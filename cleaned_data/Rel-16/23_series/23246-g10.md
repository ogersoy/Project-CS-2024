# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions defined in
TR 21.905 [1] and TS 22.146 [2] and the following apply:
**MBMS Service Announcement:** Mechanism to allow users to be informed about
the MBMS user services available.
**MBMS Bearer Service** : the service provided by the PS Domain to MBMS User
Services to deliver IP multicast datagrams to multiple receivers using minimum
network and radio resources.
**MBMS User Service** : the MBMS service provided to the end user by means of
the MBMS Bearer Service and possibly other capabilities.
**MBMS Service Area:** The area within which data of a specific MBMS session
are sent. Each individual MBMS session of an MBMS Bearer Service may be sent
to a different MBMS Service Area. This MBMS Service Area is the same or a
subset of the Multicast or Broadcast Service Area as defined in TS 22.146 [2].
An MBMS Service Area smaller than the Multicast or Broadcast Service Area is
typically used for localized services.
**MBMS over a Single Frequency Network:** See TS 25.346 [10].
**Receive Only Mode:** A UE configuration option that allows a UE to receive
only eMBMS broadcast service without the need to access and register with the
PLMN offering the eMBMS service. A UE configured to operate in Receive Only
Mode receives MBMS service only on a standardised TMGI value range. The UE
uses the acquired system information to receive MBMS broadcast. Use of Receive
Only Mode does not require USIM for the UE.
**Shared MBMS Network:** A network shared by multiple PLMNs that provides MBMS
services. The Shared MBMS network consists of the following shared network
elements: BM-SC(s) and MBMS-GW(s). The shared MBMS network may also include
eNB(s), MCE(s), and shared MME(s) for MBMS operation.

# 4 MBMS Architecture
## 4.1 Overview
MBMS is a point-to-multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a
single source entity to multiple recipients. Transmitting the same data to
multiple recipients allows network resources to be shared.
The MBMS bearer service offers two modes:
\- Broadcast Mode;
\- Multicast Mode.
Broadcast Mode is supported for EPS and GPRS, and Multicast Mode is supported
for GPRS. MBMS for EPS supports E-UTRAN and UTRAN. MBMS for GPRS supports
UTRAN and GERAN.
MBMS architecture enables the efficient usage of radio-network and core-
network resources, with an emphasis on radio interface efficiency.
MBMS is realised by the addition of a number of new capabilities to existing
functional entities of the 3GPP architecture and by addition of a number of
new functional entities.
The existing PS Domain functional entities (GGSN, SGSN, MME, E-UTRAN, UTRAN,
GERAN and UE) are enhanced to provide the MBMS Bearer Service. In the EPS a
functional entity MBMS GW exists at the edge between the CN and the BM-SC. In
the bearer plane, this service provides delivery of IP Multicast datagrams
from the Gi and SGi-mb reference points to UEs with a specified Quality of
Service. In the control plane, this service provides mechanisms for:
\- managing the MBMS bearer service activation status of UEs (in the case of
multicast mode);
\- outsourcing authorisation decisions to the MBMS User Service (i.e. to the
BM-SC) (in the case of multicast mode);
\- providing control of session initiation/modification/termination by the
MBMS User Service and managing bearer resources for the distribution of MBMS
data (in the case or multicast and broadcast modes).
A particular instance of the MBMS Bearer Service is identified by an IP
Multicast Address and an APN Network Identifier. A TMGI also can be used to
identify one MBMS Bearer Service inside one PLMN.
For GPRS the boundary of the MBMS Bearer Service is the Gmb and Gi reference
points as shown in Figure 1 below. The former provides access to the control
plane functions and the latter the bearer plane. For EPS the boundary is the
SGmb and the SGi-mb as shown in figure 1b below.
A functional entity, the Broadcast Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC) provides a
set of functions for MBMS User Services. BM-SC functions for different MBMS
User Services may be supported from the same or different physical network
elements.
## 4.2 Reference Architecture Model
### 4.2.1 GPRS
Note 1: Network entities and reference points solely used by the MBMS user
service (e.g. for service announcement as described in clause 4.4.1.2) are not
shown in this figure.
Note 2: Gp applies only when SGSN and GGSN are in different PLMNs.
Note 3: the Iu/Gn reference point above is a direct tunnel according to clause
5.6.2.2, figure 6b in TS 23.060 [15] with IP multicast based addressing
according to RFC 4607 [21].
Figure 1a: Reference architecture for GPRS to support the MBMS bearer service
with GERAN and UTRAN
### 4.2.2 EPS
Figure 1b: Reference architecture for Evolved Packet System with E-UTRAN and
UTRAN (MBMS Broadcast Mode only)
NOTE 1: In addition to MBMS Bearers (over SGmb/SGi-mb), the BM-SC may use EPS
Bearers (over SGi) to realize an MBMS User Service as specified in TS 26.346
[7].
NOTE 2: The MCE (see TS 36.300 [17]) is not shown in the figure.
NOTE 3: MBMS service over Gn-SGSN is supported when the MBMS-GW is co-located
with the PDN GW and this PDN GW has the necessary GGSN functions to control
the MBMS Bearer Service over Gn.
## 4.3 MBMS Specific Reference points
### 4.3.1 Gmb
Signalling between GGSN and BM-SC is exchanged at Gmb reference point. This
represents the network side boundary of the MBMS Bearer Service from a control
plane perspective. This includes user specific Gmb signalling and MBMS bearer
service specific signalling.
MBMS bearer service specific Gmb signalling:
\- The GGSN establishes the MBMS bearer context and registers at BM-SC.
\- The GGSN or the BM-SC releases the MBMS bearer context and de-registers the
GGSN from the BM-SC.
\- The BM-SC indicates session start, update and stop to the GGSN including
session attributes like QoS and MBMS service area.
User specific Gmb signalling:
\- The BM-SC authorises the user specific MBMS multicast service activation
(join) at the GGSN.
\- The GGSN reports to the BM-SC the successful user specific MBMS multicast
activation (join) to allow the BM-SC to synchronise the BM-SC MBMS UE context
with the MBMS UE contexts in the SGSN and GGSN.
\- The GGSN reports to the BM-SC when a user specific MBMS multicast service
is released or deactivated (e.g. at implicit detach). The GGSN makes this
report in order to synchronise the BM-SC MBMS UE context with the MBMS UE
contexts in the SGSN and GGSN.
The BM-SC initiates the deactivation of a user specific MBMS bearer service
when the MBMS user service is terminated.
BM-SC functions for different MBMS bearer services may be provided by
different physical network elements. Further, MBMS bearer service specific and
user specific signalling for the same MBMS bearer service may also be provided
by different physical network elements. To allow this distribution of BM-SC
functions, the Gmb protocol must support the use of proxies to correctly route
the different signalling interactions in a manner which is transparent to the
GGSN.
### 4.3.1a SGmb
The SGmb reference point has similar functions with the Gmb interface in
control plane except for the Multicast Mode related functions. Specifically,
MBMS bearer service specific SGmb signalling:
\- The BM-SC indicates session start, update and stop to the MBMS-GW including
session attributes like QoS and MBMS service area, and some of attributes may
be different from them in Gmb.
### 4.3.2 Mz
Mz is the roaming variant of the Gmb reference point with the same
functionality as described under Gmb, i.e. with MBMS bearer and User specific
signalling.
MBMS bearer and User specific Mz signalling is used between a BM-SC in the
visited PLMN and a BM-SC in the home PLMN when MBMS services from the home
PLMN are offered by the visited PLMN.
User specific signalling is used between a BM-SC in the visited PLMN and a BM-
SC in the home PLMN when the visited PLMN offers MBMS user services to roaming
users. This user specific Mz signalling provides home PLMN authorisation for
MBMS user services that are provided by the visited PLMN. This mechanism
supports only MBMS user service classes that are offered by the visited and by
the home PLMN.
Mz may use proxying capabilities as described for Gmb, e.g. to proxy
signalling between BM-SCs. An APN may be included in the signalling between
BM-SCs, which is used to select an appropriate GGSN to access the MBMS service
aiming for an optimized routing, resource saving, or operator policy.
NOTE: For EPS, the Mz reference point is not supported in this release.
### 4.3.3 Reference Points for Evolved Packet System
NOTE: The below listed reference points are applicable for the E-UTRAN and
UTRAN MBMS Broadcast Mode (with or without counting) only.
**M1:** It is the reference point between MBMS GW and E-UTRAN/UTRAN for MBMS
data delivery. IP Multicast is used on this interface to forward data.
**M3:** It is the reference point for the control plane between MME and
E-UTRAN.
**Sm:** It is the reference point for the control plane between MME and MBMS
GW.
**Sn:** It is the reference point between MBMS GW and SGSN (S4 based) for the
control plane and for MBMS data delivery. Point-to-point mode is used on this
interface to forward data..
**SGi-mb:** It is the reference point between BM-SC and MBMS GW function for
MBMS data delivery.
**SGmb:** It is the reference point for the control plane between BM-SC and
MBMS GW.
Protocol assumption:
\- The Sm reference point is based on GTPv2-C.
\- The Sn reference point is based on GTPv2-C and GTPv1-U.
\- The M1 reference point is based on GTPv1-U.
## 4.4 MBMS Service Provision
### 4.4.1 MULTICAST MODE
Reception of an MBMS MULTICAST service is enabled by certain procedures that
are illustrated in the Figure below.
{width="5.041666666666667in" height="5.29375in"}
Figure 2: Phases of MBMS Multicast service provision
The phases subscription, joining and leaving are performed individually per
user. The other phases are performed for a service, i.e. for all users
interested in the related service. The sequence of phases may repeat, e.g.
depending on the need to transfer data. Also subscription, joining, leaving,
service announcement as well as MBMS notification may run in parallel to other
phases.
This is illustrated with the following example of timeline:
{width="6.970833333333333in" height="4.5881944444444445in"}
Figure 3: Timeline example
#### 4.4.1.1 Subscription
Establishes the relationship between the user and the service provider, which
allows the user to receive the related MBMS multicast service.
Service Subscription is the agreement of a user to receive service(s) offered
by the operator. Subscription information is recorded in the BM-SC.
Subscription information and other BM-SC functionality may be on separate
entities, which is enabled by proxy capability of the Gmb interface.
NOTE: procedures for the subscription phase are out of scope of this
specification.
#### 4.4.1.2 Service announcement
MBMS user service announcement/discovery mechanisms shall allow users to
request or be informed about the range of MBMS user services available. This
includes operator specific MBMS user services as well as services from content
providers outside of the PLMN. Service announcement is used to distribute to
users information about the service, parameters required for service
activation (e.g. IP multicast address(es)) and possibly other service related
parameters (e.g. service start time).
Operators/service providers may consider several service discovery mechanisms.
This could include standard mechanisms such as SMS, or depending on the
capability of the terminal, applications that encourage user interrogation.
The method chosen to inform users about MBMS user services may have to account
for the user\' s location, (e.g. current cell, in the HPLMN or VPLMN). Users
who have not already subscribed to a MBMS user service should also be able to
discover MBMS user services.
The following could be considered useful for MBMS user service announcement
mechanisms (not exhaustive):
\- SMS Cell Broadcast to advertise MBMS Multicast and Broadcast user services;
\- MBMS Broadcast mode to advertise MBMS Multicast and Broadcast user
Services;
\- MBMS Multicast mode to advertise MBMS Multicast user Services;
\- PUSH mechanism (WAP, SMS-PP, MMS);
\- URL (HTTP, FTP).
The details of the MBMS service announcement mechanisms are out of scope of
this specification, but MBMS shall allow the utilisation of solutions using
IETF protocols.
Service announcement is further defined within MBMS User Service
specifications TS 26.346 [7].
#### 4.4.1.3 Joining
Joining (i.e. MBMS multicast activation by the user) is the process by which a
subscriber joins (becomes a member of) a multicast group, i.e. the user
indicates to the network that he/she wants to receive Multicast mode data of a
specific MBMS bearer service. An MBMS user service may also be carried by more
than one MBMS bearer service. In that case the MBMS user service part in the
UE initiates the relevant MBMS bearer services to receive the service (see
clause 8.2).
#### 4.4.1.4 Session Start
Session Start is the point at which the BM-SC is ready to send data. This can
be identified with the start of a \"Multicast session\" as defined in TS
22.146 [2]. Session Start occurs independently of activation of the service by
the user -- i.e. a given user may activate the service before or after Session
Start. Session Start is the trigger for bearer resource establishment for MBMS
data transfer. If an MBMS user service is carried by more than one MBMS bearer
service, a Session Start message is sent for each MBMS bearer service. In that
case the UE may need to initiate the reception of multiple relevant MBMS
bearer services to receive the MBMS user service.
#### 4.4.1.5 MBMS notification
Informs the UEs about forthcoming (and potentially about ongoing) MBMS
multicast data transfer.
#### 4.4.1.6 Data transfer
It is the phase when MBMS data are transferred to the UEs.
#### 4.4.1.7 Session Stop
It is the point at which the BM-SC determines that there will be no more data
to send for some period of time -- this period being long enough to justify
removal of bearer resources associated with the session. At Session Stop, the
bearer resources are released.
#### 4.4.1.8 Leaving
Leaving (i.e. MBMS multicast deactivation by the user) is the process by which
a subscriber leaves (stops being a member of) a multicast group, i.e. the user
no longer wants to receive Multicast mode data of a specific MBMS bearer
service.
### 4.4.2 Multicast Mode timeline
#### 4.4.2.1 Period between Service Announcement and Session Start
The service announcement may contain a schedule of Session Start times and may
be sent some time before the service is due to start. So, this time period
could be hours, days or even weeks.
#### 4.4.2.2 Period between Service Announcement and Service Subscription
Service Subscription can be done anytime before or after Service announcement.
#### 4.4.2.3 Period between Service Announcement and Joining
The Joining time is chosen by the user and/or UE possibly in response to a
Service Announcement. Users will typically join at the time of their choosing
so that the period between announcement and joining may be very long or very
short. In order to avoid overload situations being caused by many users
attempting to join in a short period of time, the UE shall be able to use
parameters sent by the BM-SC in the service announcement to randomise the
joining time.
#### 4.4.2.4 Period between Joining and Session Start
Some MBMS bearer services may be \'always on\'. In this case, Joining can take
place immediately after Service Announcement and possibly many hours before,
or after, Session Start.
In other cases, if a Session Start time is known, Joining may take place
immediately before Session Start or after Session Start. For these services,
the announcement may contain some indication of a time period which users and
UEs should use to choose a time to Join the MBMS bearer service.
#### 4.4.2.5 Period between Session Start and First Data Arrival
Session Start indicates that the transmission is about to start. The time
delay between a Session Start indication and actual data should be long enough
for the network actions required at Session Start to take place e.g. provision
of service information to the UTRAN, establishment of the bearer plane.
Session Start may be triggered by an explicit notification from the BM-SC. In
the case of bearer plane resources which are set-up after the start of session
data transmission, the network is not required to buffer the session data and
loss of data can be assumed.
#### 4.4.2.6 Period between Session Start and Session Stop
When the BM-SC knows that there is no more data to be sent for a \"long idle
period\", it should indicate Session Stop to the network, causing the release
of bearer resources. However, if this idle period with no data is short, this
may not be appropriate as it brings more signalling and processing.
The duration of this \"long idle period\" is implementation dependent. The
order of magnitude should be defined to take into account network constraints
(including UTRAN, GERAN, and CN).
If the BM-SC wants to use session repetition identification on the MBMS bearer
service level, the BM-SC must stop the MBMS session before starting the next
MBMS user service session for that TMGI.
#### 4.4.2.7 Session Update
Session Update is used to update specific parameters of an ongoing MBMS
Multicast session. The SGSN can use the procedure to update the list of RAs
where MBMS multicast users are located for an ongoing MBMS Multicast service
session.
### 4.4.3 BROADCAST MODE
An example for the phases of MBMS broadcast service provision is described in
the figure below:
{width="5.020833333333333in" height="4.501388888888889in"}
Figure 4: Phases of MBMS broadcast service provision
The sequence of phases may repeat, e.g. depending on the need to transfer
data. It is also possible that the service announcement and MBMS notification
phase may run in parallel with other phases, in order to inform UEs which have
not yet received the related service.
{width="6.097916666666666in" height="5.026388888888889in"}
Figure 5: Broadcast service timeline
#### 4.4.3.1 Service announcement
Informs UEs about forthcoming MBMS user services. Also see clause 4.4.1.2 on
Multicast mode.
#### 4.4.3.1a UE local service activation
The MBMS user service part in the UE initiates reception of the MBMS bearer
service to receive an MBMS user service. In case one MBMS user service is
carried by more than one MBMS bearer service, the UE may need to initiate the
reception of multiple relevant MBMS bearer services to receive the MBMS user
service (see clause 8.12).
#### 4.4.3.2 Session Start
Session Start is the point at which the BM-SC is ready to send data. This can
be identified with the start of a \"Broadcast session\" as defined in TS
22.146 [2]. Session Start is the trigger for bearer resource establishment for
MBMS data transfer. If an MBMS user service is carried by more than one MBMS
bearer service, a Session Start message is sent for each MBMS bearer service.
In that case the UE may need to initiate the reception of multiple relevant
MBMS bearer services to receive the MBMS user service.
#### 4.4.3.3 MBMS notification
Informs the UEs about forthcoming (and potentially about ongoing) MBMS
broadcast data transfer.
#### 4.4.3.4 Data transfer
It is the phase when MBMS data are transferred to the UEs.
#### 4.4.3.5 Session Stop
It is the point at which the MBMS user service determines that there will be
no more data to send for some period of time -- this period being long enough
to justify removal of bearer resources associated with the service. At Session
Stop, the bearer resources are released.
#### 4.4.3.6 Session Update
Session Update is used to update specific parameters of an ongoing MBMS
Broadcast session. Parameters which can be updated are MBMS Service Area,
and/or the List of SGSNs/MMEs (only from BM-SC to GGSN or MBMS GW). A Session
Update received in one node, results in a Session Update being sent to
downstream nodes, to inform of the changed MBMS Service Area. When a Session
Update is received in the GGSN or MBMS GW including the List of SGSN/MME
parameter, it results in a Session Start being sent to new downstream nodes,
and in a Session Stop being sent to downstream nodes that have been removed
from the list.
In order to support the update of the priority of a broadcast data flow of a
group communication service as specified in TS 23.468 [24], the QoS(ARP
parameter only) of an MBMS Broadcast service session may be modified by the
Session Update procedure.
NOTE: The update of the QoS(ARP) only applies to the E-UTRAN.
### 4.4.4 Broadcast Mode timeline
#### 4.4.4.1 Period between Service Announcement and Session Start
Same as for Multicast mode.
#### 4.4.4.2 Period between Session Start and First Data Arrival
Same as for Multicast mode.
#### 4.4.4.3 Period between Session Start and Session Stop
Same as for Multicast mode.
# 5 Functional Entities To Support MBMS
## 5.0 General
To provide MBMS bearer services existing functional entities, GGSN, MME, SGSN,
eNodeB/RNC/BSC, perform several MBMS related functions and procedures, some of
which are specific to MBMS. An MBMS specific functional entity -- Broadcast
Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC) supports various MBMS user service specific
services such as provisioning and delivery. In the EPS a functional entity
MBMS GW exists at the edge between the CN and the BM‑SC.
## 5.1 Broadcast-Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC)
### 5.1.0 General
The BM-SC provides functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery.
It may serve as an entry point for content provider MBMS transmissions, used
to authorise and initiate MBMS Bearer Services within the PLMN and can be used
to schedule and deliver MBMS transmissions.
The BM-SC is a functional entity, which must exist for each MBMS User Service.
The BM-SC consists of the following sub-functions:
\- Membership function;
\- Session and Transmission function;
\- Proxy and Transport function;
\- Service Announcement function;
\- Security function.
\- Content synchronization for MBMS in UTRAN.
\- Content synchronization for MBMS in E-UTRAN for broadcast mode.
\- Header compression for MBSFN MBMS data in UTRAN.
\- Header compression for Mission Critical services using MBMS in E-UTRAN (see
TS 23.468 [24]).
NOTE: Header compression of MBMS data is not supported in E-UTRAN only for
Mission Critical services in this Release.
\- For MBMS bearer service for NB or M UE categories, provide mapping from UE
Capability for MBMS as defined in TS 23.682 [29] to QCIs as defined in clause
6.3.2.
This clause describes BM-SC functions, which are defined for the standardised
MBMS User Services.
Figure 5a: BM-SC functional structure
### 5.1.1 Membership Function
The BM-SC Membership function provides authorization for UEs requesting to
activate an MBMS service.
The Membership function may have subscription data of MBMS service users.
The Membership Function may generate charging records for MBMS service users.
The Membership Function is an MBMS bearer service level function, but it may
also provide user service level functions e.g. membership management etc. In
this case it does also have a Gi/SGi interface.
### 5.1.2 Session and Transmission Function
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function shall be able to schedule MBMS
session transmissions.
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function should be able to schedule MBMS
session retransmissions, and label each MBMS session with an MBMS Session
Identifier to allow the UE to distinguish the MBMS session retransmissions.
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function allocates TMGIs.
Each transmission and subsequent retransmission(s) of a specific MBMS session
are identifiable by a common MBMS Session Identifier (2-3 Octets) passed at
the application layer in the content, and also passed in a shortened form
(i.e. the least significant octet) in the MBMS Session Start Request message
to the eNodeBs/RNCs/BSCs. The full MBMS Session Identifier should be used by
the UE to identify an MBMS session when completing point-to-point repair,
while the shortened MBMS Session Identifier is included by the RANs in the
notification messages for MBMS
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function shall be able to provide the MBMS
GW or GGSN with transport associated parameters such as quality-of-service and
MBMS service area.
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function shall be able to initiate and
terminate MBMS bearer resources prior to and following transmission of MBMS
data.
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function should be able to send MBMS data.
It could also apply favourable error resilient schemes e.g. specialized MBMS
codecs or Forward Error Correction schemes.
When IP multicast is used for distribution of payload from GGSN to RNC or from
MBMS GW to eNodeB and RNC, the BM-SC Session and Transmission Function shall
include synchronization information for the MBMS payload. If the header
compression is used over the radio, the compression is done in the BM-SC. The
details of synchronization and header compression for the MBMS payload are
specified in TS 25.346 [10] and TS 25.446 [18].
The BM-SC Session and Transmission Function should be able to authenticate and
authorize external sources and accept content from them.
The Session and Transmission Function is user service level function and it
triggers bearer level functions when MBMS sessions are scheduled.
### 5.1.3 Proxy and Transport Function
The BM-SC Proxy and Transport Function is a Proxy Agent for signalling over
SGmb and Gmb reference points between MBMS GWs/GGSNs and other BM-SC sub-
functions, e.g. the BM-SC Membership Function and the BM-SC Session and
Transmission Function. Further, the BM-SC Proxy and Transport Function shall
also be able to handle when BM-SC functions for different MBMS services are
provided by multiple physical network elements. Routing of the different
signalling interactions shall be transparent to the MBMS GW and the GGSN.
The BM-SC Proxy and Transport function shall be able to generate charging
records for content provider charging of transmitted data. Content provider
name is provided to BM-SC Proxy and Transport function over SGmb/Gmb at
session start.
The BM-SC Proxy and Transport function may act as an intermediate device for
the MBMS data sent from the BM-SC Session and Transmission function to the
MBMS GW or GGSN.
The Proxy and Transport Function may be divided further into a Proxy function
managing the control plane (SGmb/Gmb) and a Transport function managing the
multicast payload.
The Proxy and Transport Function is an MBMS bearer service function.
### 5.1.4 Service Announcement Function
The BM-SC Service Announcement function shall be able to provide service
announcements for multicast and broadcast MBMS user services.
The BM-SC Service Announcement function shall be able to provide the UE with
media descriptions specifying the media to be delivered as part of an MBMS
user service (e.g. type of video and audio encodings).
The BM-SC Service Announcement function shall be able to provide the UE with
MBMS session descriptions specifying the MBMS sessions to be delivered as part
of an MBMS user service (e.g. multicast service identification, addressing,
time of transmission, etc.).
The BM-SC Service Announcement function shall be able to deliver media and
session descriptions by means of service announcements using IETF specified
protocols over MBMS multicast and broadcast bearer services.
The Service Announcement Function is a user service level function.
The following mechanisms should be supported for service announcement. Service
announcements may be triggered by the BM-SC but are not necessarily sent by
the BM-SC:
\- MBMS bearer capabilities to advertise MBMS user Services;
\- PUSH mechanism (WAP push);
\- URL (WAP, HTTP);
\- SMS (point-to-point);
\- SMS-CB cell broadcast.
Other mechanisms could be considered in future releases.
### 5.1.4a MBMS Security Function
MBMS user services may use the Security functions for integrity and/or
confidentiality protection of MBMS data. The MBMS Security function is used
for distributing MBMS keys (Key Distribution Function) to authorized UEs.
Detailed description of the security functions is provided in (TS 33.246 [5]).
### 5.1.5 MBMS Content Transfer for the same MBMS User Service for GPRS and
EPS
#### 5.1.5.1 General
For GPRS, although these procedures mention GERAN and UTRAN extensively, only
the BM-SC (which renders the content differently) and the SGSN have to
implement functionality to deliver this. The GGSN, RNC and BSC shall all be
transparent to this functionality.
For EPS, although these procedures mention UTRAN and E-UTRAN extensively, only
the BM-SC and the MBMS-GW have to implement functionality to deliver this. The
MME, S4-SGSN, RNC and eNodeB remain transparent to this functionality.
#### 5.1.5.2 Separate MBMS Bearer Services for the same MBMS User Service
The same MBMS user service may transfer its data on separate MBMS bearer
services for different access technologies, typically with different QoS, e.g.
for GRPS using separate MBMS bearer services for GERAN and UTRAN or for EPS
using separate MBMS bearer services for UTRAN and E-UTRAN. For this purpose
two IP multicast addresses (multicast mode only) and/or two TMGIs should be
allocated for the same MBMS user service. One IP multicast address (multicast
mode only) and/or one TMGI is for, e.g. GERAN, and another IP multicast
address (multicast mode) and/or another TMGI is for, e.g. UTRAN. The detailed
impacts on the network nodes are listed below:
a) The service announcement instructs the UE to join two multicast MBMS bearer
services (e.g. for GRPS one is for GERAN and the other is for UTRAN), i.e. for
multicast mode, two IP multicast addresses that are allocated in the BM-SC are
sent to UE within one service announcement message.
NOTE 1: One MBMS User Service may use several MBMS Bearer Services.
b) A UE that might move between areas covered by different access technologies
activates both MBMS bearer services.
c) The UE monitors the paging/notification channels for both TMGIs and
receives MBMS data when transferred by the MBMS bearer services.
d) When the BM-SC needs to deliver the content, the BM-SC produces two sets of
MBMS data from the same content and sends independent Session Start messages
for both of the MBMS bearer services. The \"different\" content streams for
the same MBMS user service are sent on the separate MBMS bearer services. For
GPRS, a 2G/3G indicator in the Session Start message (which the GGSN passes
transparently to the SGSN) indicates whether the content should be delivered
in GERAN-only or UTRAN-only (or both) coverage areas.
e) For GPRS, the SGSN uses the 2G/3G indicator to decide whether a MBMS
Session Start Request message should be sent to the BSCs and/or the RNCs.
NOTE 2: See clause 7.3 for potential issues.
#### 5.1.5.3 Same MBMS Bearer Service for the same MBMS User Service
The same MBMS user service may also transfer its data on the same MBMS bearer
service for multiple access technologies, i.e. for GRPS using a same MBMS
bearer service for GERAN and UTRAN or for EPS using a same MBMS bearer service
for UTRAN and E-UTRAN. For this purpose one IP multicast address (multicast
mode only) and/or one TMGI should be allocated for the same MBMS user service.
In such application, the \"different\" content for the same MBMS user service
are sent in separate MBMS Sessions sequentially. For GRPS, the 2G/3G indicator
in the Session Start message indicates whether the MBMS session should be
delivered in GERAN-only or UTRAN-only (or both) coverage areas and the SGSN
uses the 2G/3G indicator to decide whether a MBMS Session Start Request
message should be sent to the BSCs and/or the RNCs.
NOTE: The same MBMS bearer service for both UTRAN and E-UTRAN may be used if
the BM-SC does not execute header compression for the MBMS service.
### 5.1.6 Location Dependent Content Transfer for the same MBMS User Service
(Broadcast Mode only)
Some MBMS user services may broadcast different content in different areas of
the network. In such case the UE is not aware of the relation between location
and content, i.e. the UE just activates the reception of the service and
receives the content that is relevant for its location.
The BM‑SC controls which content is broadcasted in which area by establishing
a separate MBMS bearer service for each content data flow. All MBMS bearer
services of the same MBMS user service share the same TMGI but bear different
Flow Identifiers. The BM‑SC allocates the Flow Identifier during the MBMS
Session Start procedure and initiates a separate session for each content data
flow. For IP Multicast support in EPS, the MBMS GW allocates an IP Multicast
Address based on the TMGI and Flow Identifier (broadcast mode only). Since in
any specific location only one version of the content shall be available at
any point in time, the MBMS Service Areas of each session of a same user
service shall not overlap; this shall be ensured by proper configuration of
the service in the BM‑SC. The RNC and the eNodeB ultimately enforces this
constraint by rejecting any session start request with the same TMGI as an
already active session if there is any overlap in the respective service
areas. As indicated above, the UE is unaware of the Flow Identifier and of the
existence of multiple sessions for the same MBMS user service.
### 5.1.7 MBMS User Service Consumption Reporting (Broadcast mode only)
MBMS User Service Consumption Reporting functionality better enables the MBMS
service operator to decide in a dynamic manner, based on real time demand of
an MBMS User Service, to either:
\- establish service delivery over an MBMS bearer;
\- tear down service delivery over an already established MBMS bearer to only
leave service delivery over unicast.
By permitting these decisions to be made dynamically, this functionality
enables the MBMS service operator to better utilize overall network resources
in supporting unicast and/or MBMS services delivery. The MBMS service
consumption reporting procedure is optional and initiated by the MBMS receiver
(UE) to the BM-SC, in accordance with parameters in the Associated Delivery
Procedure description as defined in TS 26.346 [7].
The BM-SC can specify the nominal periodicity by which the UE, when it is
continuously consuming the service of concern, performs consumption reporting.
The BM-SC can specify whether the UE includes its current location (serving
cell-ID or MBMS SAI) when it performs consumption reporting. The location type
is selected based on the Associated Delivery Procedure Description settings,
or the MooD Management Object (MO) on the UE, or via UE pre-configuration
rules. Typically, the BM-SC is pre-configured, via OAM procedures, with a
threshold per location (number of UEs reporting consumption) to be used in
making the decision to switch delivery method.
The service offloaded to the MBMS bearer could be either one delivered by
unicast not involving MBMS User Services, or an MBMS User Service delivered on
a unicast bearer. Furthermore, the BM-SC can determine, based on Consumption
Reporting from UEs consuming that MBMS User Service over an MBMS bearer, the
interest for that MBMS User Service has decreased sufficiently to terminate
the MBMS bearer. In such event, UEs may continue to receive the service but
over unicast instead, either not involving the MBMS User Service, or as an
MBMS User Service over unicast. Continued consumption monitoring by the BM-SC,
and consumption reporting by UEs, may be employed to facilitate further
switching, over time, between bearer modes.
Along with MBMS Consumption Reporting, the use of MBMS operation on Demand
(clause 7.4) permits certain content that is initially delivered over the
unicast network to be turned into an MBMS User Service, in order to
efficiently use network resources when the traffic exceeds a certain
threshold.
## 5.2 User Equipment
The UE shall support functions for the activation/deactivation of the MBMS
bearer service.
Once a particular MBMS bearer service is activated, no further explicit user
request is required to receive MBMS data although the user may be notified
that data transfer is about to start.
The UE shall support security functions as appropriate for MBMS.
The UE should, depending on terminal capabilities, be able to receive MBMS
user service announcements, paging information (non MBMS specific) and support
simultaneous services (for example the user can originate or receive a call or
send and receive messages whilst receiving MBMS video content). Reception of
this paging or announcements may however, create losses in the MBMS data
reception. The MBMS user service should be able to cope with such losses.
A UE in Multicast Mode shall be able to synchronise with the SGSN, which of
its MBMS UE contexts are still active.
Depending upon terminal capability, UEs may be able to store MBMS data. This
may involve DRM but this is out of scope of this specification.
The MBMS Session Identifier contained in the notification to the UE shall
enable the UE to decide whether it needs to ignore the forthcoming
transmission of MBMS session (e.g. because the UE has already received this
MBMS session).
## 5.3 UTRAN/GERAN
UTRAN/GERAN are responsible for efficiently delivering MBMS data to the
designated MBMS service area.
Efficient delivery of MBMS data in multicast mode may require mechanisms in
the UTRAN/GERAN, e.g. the number of users within a cell prior to and during
MBMS transmission could be used to choose an appropriate radio bearer.
MBMS transmissions may be initiated and terminated intermittently. The
UTRAN/GERAN shall support the initiation and termination of MBMS transmissions
by the core-network. Further, the UTRAN/GERAN shall be able to receive MBMS
data from the core-network over Iu bearers shared by many UEs.
.UTRAN (and GERAN in Iu mode) may also support reception of MBMS data from the
core-network over IP multicast. When UTRAN (or GERAN Iu mode) supports IP
multicast reception, the UTRAN (GERAN Iu mode) should support TEID
coordination, i.e. avoid using the same value ranges for its own unicast TEIDs
as are used by the GGSN and MBMS GW for the Common TEID-Us (C-TEIDs). If
clashes anyhow occur, the RNC (Iu mode BSC) shall reject IP multicast
reception and fallback to normal shared Iu bearers for reception of MBMS data.
The UTRAN/GERAN shall support both intra-RNC/BSC and inter-RNC/BSC mobility of
MBMS receivers. Mobility is expected to cause limited data loss. Therefore,
MBMS user services should be able to cope with potential data loss caused by
UE mobility.
The UTRAN/GERAN shall be able to transmit MBMS user service announcements,
paging information (non MBMS specific) and support other services in parallel
with MBMS (for example depending on terminal capabilities the user could
originate or receive a call or send and receive messages whilst receiving MBMS
video content).
## 5.4 SGSN
The SGSN\'s role within the MBMS architecture is to perform MBMS bearer
service control functions for each individual UE and to provide MBMS
transmissions to UTRAN/GERAN. When IP multicast is used for MBMS transmissions
the SGSN is bypassed in the 3G case (and GERAN Iu mode case), i.e. MBMS data
sent directly from GGSN to RNC (or Iu mode BSC) or from MBMS GW to RNC in EPS.
The SGSN shall provide support for intra-SGSN and inter-SGSN mobility
procedures. Specifically this requires the SGSN to store a user-specific MBMS
UE context for each activated multicast MBMS bearer service and to pass these
contexts to the new SGSN during inter-SGSN mobility procedures.
The SGSN shall be able to indicate its MBMS support to the UE as well as it
shall be able to synchronise with the UE, which of the UE\'s MBMS UE contexts
are still active.
The SGSN shall be able to generate charging data per multicast MBMS bearer
service for each user. The SGSN does not perform on-line charging for either
the MBMS bearer service or the MBMS user service (this is handled in the BM-
SC).
The SGSN shall be able to establish Iu and Gn bearers shared by many users
upon receiving a session start from the GGSN. Likewise, the SGSN shall be able
to tear down these bearers upon instruction from the GGSN.
When MBMS in EPS for UTRAN access is supported, the SGSN shall support the
necessary control plane functions provided via Sn interface to/from MBMS GW.
## 5.5 GGSN
The GGSN role within the MBMS architecture is to serve as an entry point for
IP multicast traffic as MBMS data. Upon notification from the BM-SC the GGSN
shall be able to request the establishment of a bearer plane for a broadcast
or multicast MBMS transmission. Further, upon BM-SC notification the GGSN
shall be able to tear down the established bearer plane. Bearer plane
establishment for multicast services is carried out towards those SGSNs and
/or RNCs that have requested to receive transmissions for the specific
multicast MBMS bearer service. For an optimized bearer plane, IP multicast
transport may be used within the core network. The bearer plane is then
established between the GGSN and the RNCs.
When IP multicast is used for distribution payload from GGSN to RNC, and one
or more RNC rejects IP multicast distribution, the GGSN should in parallel
with the IP multicast distribution provide legacy MBMS payload distribution
(i.e. using point-to-point GTP-tunnels) via the SGSNs to these RNCs. In that
case, the GGSN shall remove the synchronisation protocol elements included by
the BM-SC (i.e. synchronization information and the compressed header) before
forwarding the payload on the legacy path (see TS 25.446 [18]).
The GGSN shall be able to receive MBMS specific IP multicast traffic and to
route this data to the proper IP multicast distribution address and/or GTP
tunnels set-up as part of the MBMS bearer service.
The GGSN may also provide features that support the MBMS bearer service that
are not exclusive to MBMS. Examples are:
\- Message Screening (not needed if the MBMS sources are internal in the
PLMN);
\- Charging Data Collection;
\- Flow Based Charging (see clause 10).
## 5.6 MBMS Data Sources and Content Provider
For group communications related services, the standard interface to and from
BM-SC is MB2 (TS 23.468 [24], TS 29.468 [27]). For services other than Group
Communications, the standard reference point between the content provider and
the BM-SC is defined in TS 26.348 [31].
## 5.7 Other Functional Element
### 5.7.1 Void
### 5.7.2 CBC
The Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC) may be used to announce MBMS user services to
the users.
### 5.7.3 Void
## 5.8 Void
## 5.9 Functional Elements for the Evolved Packet System
### 5.9.1 MBMS GW
One or more MBMS GW function entities may be used in a PLMN.
Note that MBMS GW may be stand alone or co-located with other network elements
such as BM-SC or combined S‑GW/PDN GW.
MBMS GW functions include:
\- It provides an interface for entities using MBMS bearers through the SGi-mb
(user plane) reference point;
\- It provides an interface for entities using MBMS bearers through the SGmb
(control plane) reference point;
\- IP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data to E-UTRAN (M1 reference
point). If the MBMS‑GW has allocated both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast
address, IP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data is performed
towards both IP Multicast addresses, using the same C-TEID;
\- IP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data to RNCs (M1 reference
point);
NOTE 1: In case of mobility in or out from an MBMS service area, the service
continuity is handled by the Service Layer (in UE and network).
\- In the case of UTRAN access, it allocates either an IPv4 or an IPv6 IP
Multicast address. An RNC should join to IP Multicast distribution to receive
the MBMS data. The IP Multicast address together with the IP address of the
multicast source (SSM) and a C-TEID is provided to the RNC via SGSN;
\- In the case of E-UTRAN access, and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and
IPv6, it may allocate both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address (e.g. in
deployments with a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 eNodeBs and/or backhauls). Otherwise
it allocates either an IPv4 or an IPv6 IP Multicast address. An eNodeB should
join to IP Multicast distribution using one IP Multicast address (either IPv4
or IPv6) to receive the MBMS data. When a single IP Multicast address is
allocated by the MBMS-GW, this IP Multicast address together with the IP
address of the multicast source (SSM) and a C-TEID is provided to the eNodeB
via MME. When two IP Multicast addresses are allocated by the MBMS-GW:
\- each of them is associated with an IP address of the multicast source
(SSM);
\- the same C-TEID is associated to both IP Multicast addresses;
\- both IP Multicast addresses together with the corresponding IP addresses of
the multicast source (SSM) and the C-TEID is provided to the E-UTRAN via MME;
NOTE 2: The C-TEID is allocated based on MBMS bearer service uniquely
identified by the TMGI and Flow Identifier (Broadcast mode only).\ The IP
Multicast Address or, optionally in case of E-UTRAN access and if the MBMS‑GW
supports both IPv4 and IPv6, both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address are
either uniquely allocated for the MBMS bearer service (identified by the TMGI
and Flow Identifier), or it may be reused from another active MBMS bearer
service with an identical service area and of the same QoS.
NOTE 3: Care should be taken to avoid clashes among C-TEIDs generated in MBMS-
GWs. and UTRAN/E‑UTRAN.
\- An MBMS GW may support fall back to point to point mode where applicable
for UTRAN access;
\- An MBMS GW can communicate with multiple control plane entities (i.e. MME,
SGSN and BM-SCs).
### 5.9.2 MBMS Control plane function
The MBMS control plane function is supported by MME for E-UTRAN access and by
SGSN for UTRAN access. For SGSN functions, see clause 5.4.
One or more MBMS control plane functional entities are used in a PLMN.
MME supports the following functions in order to enable MBMS support for
E-UTRAN:
\- Session control of MBMS bearers to the E-UTRAN access (including reliable
delivery of Session Start/Session Stop to E-UTRAN);
\- Transmit Session control messages towards multiple E-UTRAN nodes;
\- When connected to multiple MCEs (see TS 36.300 [17]), the MME should filter
the distribution of Session Control message to the MCEs based on the MBMS
service area;
\- Provision of the list of MBMS Service Areas served by the MCE to the MME
using M3AP Setup signalling;
\- Transmit Session Control messages towards the necessary E-UTRAN nodes to
ensure the distribution of content from ongoing MBMS sessions:
\- if an MCE sets up (or restarts) an M3AP connection with the MME, by
applying the MCE Failure procedure specified in TS 23.007 [26]; or
\- if the MCE modifies the list of MBMS Service Areas it serves, by triggering
the MCE Configuration Update procedure.
\- It provides an Sm interface to the MBMS GW function: it receives MBMS
service control messages and the IP Multicast address or, optionally, (e.g. in
deployments with a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 eNodeBs and/or backhauls) and if the
MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast
address for MBMS data reception from MBMS GW function over the Sm interface.
NOTE: When a UE leaves or enters MBMS bearer coverage, the service continuity
is handled by the Service Layer (in UE and network).
### 5.9.3 E-UTRAN
E-UTRAN is responsible for efficiently delivering MBMS data to the designated
MBMS service area.
The E-UTRAN for MBMS in EPS shall have capability of receiving IP multicast
distribution.
In order to provide the appropriate MBMS bearer service for NB or M UE
categories, E-UTRAN/MCE may map received QCI into appropriate radio
configurations for the appropriate UE categories, when such mapping is
configured as described in clause 6.3.2.
# 6 MBMS Attributes and Parameters
## 6.1 MBMS UE Context
The MBMS UE Context is used in Multicast Mode and contains UE-specific
information related to a particular MBMS bearer service that the UE has
joined. An MBMS UE Context is created in the UE, SGSN,GGSN and BM-SC
Membership function when the UE joins an MBMS bearer service. In the SGSN, an
MBMS UE Context is also created as a result of an inter-SGSN routing area
update after the transfer of the MBMS UE Context from the old SGSN.
In Iu mode, all MBMS UE Contexts of a UE are provided via MBMS UE Linking
mechanism to the BSC/SRNC at least when the first PS RAB is established for
the UE, or when the UE performs MBMS Multicast Service Activation. MBMS UE
Contexts are provided to the Iu mode BSC/SRNC regardless whether MBMS Sessions
are ongoing or not (i.e. before, between and after Sessions). In addition, all
MBMS UE Contexts of a UE are provided via MBMS UE Linking mechanism when a UE,
which has an MBMS UE Context active, moves to PMM-Connected state via the MBMS
Service Request procedure for the purpose of MBMS.
In the UE and SGSN, the MBMS UE Context is stored as part of the MM Context
for the UE. The MBMS UE Context is stored in the GGSN. There is one MBMS UE
Context per MBMS bearer service that the UE has joined.
In the Iu mode BSC/RNC, the MBMS UE Contexts are stored as part of the UE
Context of the BSC/RNC.
The content of the MBMS UE Context is described in Table 1.

## 6.2 MBMS Bearer Context
The MBMS Bearer Context, which is referred to as MBMS Service Context in RAN,
contains all information describing a particular MBMS bearer service and is
created in each node involved in the delivery of the MBMS data.
In MBMS multicast mode a MBMS Bearer Context is created in the SGSN and GGSN
when the first MBMS UE Context is created in the node or when a downstream
node requests it. The MBMS Bearer Context is statically configured in the BM-
SC Proxy and Transport Function; how this is done is out of the scope of this
specification. The MBMS Bearer Context is created in the Iu mode BSC and in
SRNC when a first MBMS UE Context is created in BSC/SRNC. MBMS Session Start
procedure may create MBMS Bearer Context in a BSC/RNC which has no MBMS Bearer
Context yet.
In MBMS broadcast mode, an MBMS Bearer Context is created in the MME/SGSN,
MBMS GW/GGSN and RAN as a result of the MBMS Session Start procedure.
An MBMS Bearer Context, once created, can be in one of two states reflecting
the bearer plane resource status of the corresponding MBMS bearer service.
{width="3.375in" height="2.25in"}
Figure 6: MBMS Bearer Context State Model
\'Active\' reflects the state of an MBMS Bearer Context in which bearer plane
resources are required in the network for the transfer of MBMS data. This
state is maintained as long as there is a corresponding MBMS session ongoing.
\'Standby\' reflects the state of an MBMS Bearer Context in which no bearer
plane resources are required in the network for the transfer of MBMS data.
This state is maintained as long as there is no corresponding MBMS session
ongoing.
In MBMS broadcast mode, the MBMS Bearer Context is always implicitly in state
\'active\' (since it is created as a result of an MBMS Session Start
procedure) and does not use the MBMS Bearer Context State Model in Figure 6.
The content of the MBMS Bearer Context is described in Table 2.

## 6.3 Quality-of-Service
### 6.3.1 Quality-of-Service for GPRS
It shall be possible for the network to control quality-of-service parameters
for sessions of multicast and broadcast MBMS bearer services. All QoS
attributes related to the UMTS bearer service described in TS 23.107 [3] are
applicable to MBMS bearer services. Compared to point-to-point bearer services
the following limitations exist:
\- For **traffic class** , only the background and streaming classes shall be
supported.
\- For **SDU error ratio** , only higher values are supported, i.e. the values
describing higher numbers of lost or corrupted SDUs (actual values are for the
background and streaming classes are 10^-2^ and 10^-1^).
\- For **maximum bit-rate** , see the values described in TS 22.246 [6].
\- For **Guaranteed bit rate** of the Streaming Traffic Class: depending on
radio resource usage by other services, some cells of the MBMS Service Area
may not have sufficient resources available for a MBMS Session. The RAN may
decide not to establish RB in cells where requested resources are not
available. The RAN does not reject a MBMS Session Start Request message even
if one or more cells do not have enough resources to establish radio bearers.
MBMS bearer services of background class are best suited for the transport of
MBMS user services such as messaging or downloading. Buffering, shaping
schemes and packet dropping may be applied to the traffic flow to adapt to the
available resources and changing network conditions. The total transfer time
is not critical for background class bearer services since the content must
normally have been received in totality and stored in the UE before the user
can access it.
MBMS bearer services of streaming class are best suited for the transport of
MBMS user services such as streaming. As for point-to-point bearer services,
the network should minimise the packet transfer delay of streaming class
bearer services as far as possible. Packet dropping should be the preferred
traffic conditioning action applied to the traffic flow to adapt to the
available resources.
The principle difference between background and streaming classes for MBMS is
the support of a guaranteed bit-rate in the streaming case. No indication is
provided to the UE in cases where the RAN cannot provide the requested QoS. As
a result, some UEs may not receive the MBMS session or parts of it. For
background class, the RAN may continue to distribute data in congestion
conditions but at potentially high packet loss rates, therefore the MBMS user
service will have to provide sufficient redundancy within the data to be able
to cope with the high packet loss.
MBMS user services that would normally use MBMS bearer services of background
class may however decide to use a streaming class MBMS bearer service if the
MBMS user service cannot cope with high packet loss.
The Allocation and Retention Priority of the MBMS bearer service allows for
prioritisation between MBMS bearer services.
As the MBMS bearer service transfers data to many UEs in parallel and because
of the lack of feedback channel on radio level low SDU error ratios are
difficult to achieve. When the resulting packet error ratio is not suitable
for the MBMS user service or when prevention of data loss is required, an MBMS
user service may perform retransmission of MBMS data over a point-to-point PDP
context.
### 6.3.2 Quality-of-Service for EPS
It shall be possible for the network to control quality-of-service parameters
for sessions of broadcast MBMS bearer services. All EPS QoS attributes related
to the EPS bearer service are applicable to MBMS bearer services.
For EPS, only GBR MBMS service is defined and the MBMS bearer service QoS
includes the parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR (TS 23.401 [16]).
For E-UTRAN MBMS bearer service for NB or M UE categories, operator defined
QCIs may be configured in the BMSC and in the EUTRAN.
The BMSC may take into account the UE Capability for MBMS received via
Activate MBMS Bearer Request in addition to the QoS requirements of the
service and map that to a QCI value that is sent using MBMS Session Start
Procedure towards EUTRAN (see TS 23.682 [29]).
BMSC may be configured to take into account the UE Category for MBMS to derive
operator defined QCIs.
An example mapping is shown below for a service with otherwise the same QoS
requirements:
Table 6.3.2-1: QCI association with UE Categories
+------------------------------------+----------------------+ | UE Categories supported | Operator defined QCI | | | | | | (not standardised) | +------------------------------------+----------------------+ | IoT UE type M2 | a | +------------------------------------+----------------------+ | **Both UE Category M1 and M2 UEs** | b | +------------------------------------+----------------------+ | IoT UE type NB2 | c | +------------------------------------+----------------------+ | Both UE Category NB1 and NB2 | d | +------------------------------------+----------------------+
The BMSC may receive coverage level information for MBMS in addition to the UE
Category for MBMS. When coverage information is received, and the BMSC is
configured to take into account the coverage level, then BMSC generates the
appropriate QCI based on the UE Category for MBMS and coverage level
information for the MBMS service as defined in TS 23.682 [29].
An example mapping is shown below for a service with otherwise the same QoS
requirements including coverage level:
Table 6.3.2-2: QCI association with UE Categories and coverage level
+----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | UE Categories supported | Operator defined QCI | | | | | | (not standardised) | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | IoT UE type M2, Coverage level: Medium | a | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | IoT UE type M2, Coverage level: Normal | b | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | IoT UE type M2 Coverage level: High | c | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | Both UE Category M1 and M2 UEs | d | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | IoT UE type NB2 | e | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+ | Both UE Category NB1 and NB2 | f | +----------------------------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 1: The QCI to and from UE Capability for MBMS needs to be the same in
E-UTRAN and BMSC.
Each GBR MBMS bearer service is associated with the following MBMS bearer
level QoS parameters:
\- QoS Class Identifier (QCI);
\- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP);
\- Maximum Bit Rate (MBR);
\- Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR).
Unlike point-to-point EPS bearers, the MBR of a particular GBR bearer service
shall be set equal to the GBR.
NOTE 2: UE-AMBR and APN-AMBR do not apply to MBMS bearer services.
Compared to point-to-point bearer services the following limitations exist:
\- For Guaranteed bit rate: depending on radio resource usage by other
services, some cells of the MBMS Service Area may not have sufficient
resources available for a MBMS Session. The RAN may decide not to establish RB
in cells where requested resources are not available. The RAN does not reject
a MBMS Session Start Request message even if one or more cells do not have
enough resources to establish radio bearers.
\- MBMS bearer admission control within E-UTRAN is constrained by the E-UTRAN
resources that are configured for MBMS.
In the case of E-UTRAN, established MBMS bearers may not always use all the
resources configured for MBMS. When the resources configured for MBMS are not
fully utilised, the E-UTRAN may schedule delivery of traffic from point-to-
point bearers using some of the un-utilised MBMS resources (refer to TS 36.213
[25]).
GBR MBMS bearer services are best suited for the transport of MBMS user
services where a constant bit rate is needed. As for point-to-point bearer
services, the network should comply with the transfer delay for GBR QCI\'s (TS
23.203 [23]). Packet dropping should be the preferred traffic conditioning
action applied to the traffic flow to adapt to the available resources. The
BM-SC ensures that the bit rate is not larger than the MBR. There is no radio
aware flow shaping in the BM-SC.
The Allocation and Retention Priority of the MBMS bearer service allows for
prioritisation between MBMS bearer services at MBMS bearer service
establishment.
When the MBMS bearer service experience a packet error ratio which is not
suitable for the MBMS user service or when prevention of data loss is
required, an MBMS user service may perform retransmission of MBMS data over a
point-to-point PDP context or PDN connection.
### 6.3.3 MBMS QoS distribution tree
MBMS data will be distributed to multiple users through a MBMS distribution
tree that can go through many BSCs/RNCs, many SGSNs and one or more GGSNs.
Furthermore some bearer resources may be shared between many users accessing
the same MBMS bearer service in order to save resources. As a result, each
branch of a MBMS distribution tree shall be established with the same QoS.
MBMS distribution tree shall have the same QoS for all its branches.
When a branch of the MBMS distribution tree has been created, it is not
possible for another branch (e.g. due to arrival of a new UE or change of
location of a UE with removal of a branch and addition of a new one) to impact
the QoS of already established branches.
There is no QoS (re-)negotiation between network elements (e.g. between RNC
and SGSN). This implies that some branches may not be established if QoS
requirement cannot be accepted by the concerned network node.
### 6.4 Temporary Mobile Group Identity
Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI) is used for MBMS notification purpose.
The BM-SC allocates a globally unique TMGI per MBMS bearer service. The
structure of the TMGI is defined in TS 23.003 [13].
For Multicast MBMS bearer services the TMGI is transmitted to UE via the MBMS
Multicast Service Activation procedure. For Broadcast Service the TMGI can be
obtained via service announcement see \" Service Announcement\".
The TMGI is a radio resource efficient MBMS bearer service identification,
which is equivalent to the MBMS bearer service identification consisting of IP
multicast address and APN.
## 6.5 IP Multicast distribution
### 6.5.1 General
For GPRS in GGSN or for EPS in MBMS GW it shall by configuration be possible
to enable distribution of MBMS payload by using IP Multicast in the backbone
network. IP Multicast distribution is done from GGSN to RNC downstream nodes
or from MBMS GW to eNodeB or RNC downstream nodes. The Source Specific
Multicast (SSM) service model shall be used by nodes and routers as specified
in RFC 4607 [21] and RFC 4604 [22].
### 6.5.2 IP Multicast distribution for GERAN Iu-mode and UTRAN for GPRS
Fallback to legacy point-to-point distribution is done for RNC nodes which do
not support IP Multicast distribution.
NOTE: Support of fallback assumes the corresponding SGSNs have user plane
functionality.
The GGSN chooses an IP Multicast address for distribution and a Source address
as well as a common TEID-U (C‑TEID). The proposed IP Multicast and Source
address for distribution and the C-TEID is indicated by the GGSN to the
downstream SGSNs at Session Start. The SGSN forwards the request to the
downstream RNC (and BSC in Iu mode) at Session Start. The RNC may accept or
reject the proposed IP Multicast distribution in the MBMS Session Start
Response to the SGSN. If accepted the RNC shall report the channel (IP
Multicast and Source address) to the backbone in order to join the bearer
service multicast distribution. At Session Stop the RNC shall correspondingly
report to the backbone in order to leave the bearer service multicast
distribution.
If one or more downstream RNC nodes do not accept IP Multicast distribution,
the SGSN will establish a normal MBMS point-to-point GTP-U tunnel to related
RNCs and a point-to-point GTP-U tunnel to the GGSN. The SGSN does not respond
to the GGSN until it has received responses from all RNCs. The SGSN shall
indicate to the GGSN if IP Multicast distribution is accepted (by one or more
RNCs) and it shall also indicate if normal MBMS point-to-point distribution is
required (by one or more RNCs). The SGSN will also establish a normal MBMS
point-to-point GTP-U tunnel to GGSN if there are BSCs in Gb mode in the MBMS
distribution tree.
The RNC node shall indicate to SGSN if IP Multicast distribution is accepted
in the Session Start Response. If this indication is missing, the SGSN node
shall treat the RNC node as not accepting IP Multicast distribution and use
unicast distribution.
IP Multicast distribution is only used within a PLMN. In the roaming case the
GGSN establishes normal MBMS point-to-point GTP-U tunnels to SGSNs/RAN nodes
in other networks.
GGSN shall assign IP Multicast addresses used for MBMS distribution according
to RFC 4607 [21]. When several GGSN are used for MBMS payload distribution,
the used IP Multicast addresses and common TEIDs shall be coordinated by
configuration. Clashes between common TEIDs allocated by GGSN and TEIDs
allocated by RNC should be avoided by coordinated TEID ranges.
The GTP-U Error Indication mechanism shall be disabled for MBMS bearers using
IP Multicast distribution. The receiving node controls itself what is received
using the IGMPv3/MLDv2 protocol, RFC 4604 [22].
The MBMS payload with the synchronization information received from the BM-SC
included, shall be distributed by the GGSN with IP Multicast to the RNC. The
synchronization information is used in the radio interface for the user data
transmission synchronization across the RNCs as described in TS 25.346 [10].
It is up to RAN configurations whether the inter-RNC MBMS combining/MBSFN
operation mode is used during the MBMS payload delivery.
### 6.5.3 IP Multicast distribution for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS
The MBMS GW chooses an IP Multicast address for distribution or, optionally,
in the case of E-UTRAN access (e.g. in deployments with a mix of IPv4 and IPv6
eNodeBs and/or backhauls) and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, both
an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address for distribution. The IP Multicast
Addresses may be unique for the MBMS bearer service, or it may be reused from
another active MBMS bearer service with an identical service area and of the
same QoS. The proposed IP Multicast and Source addresses for distribution is
indicated by the MBMS GW to the downstream MMEs and/or SGSNs at Session Start.
The MME/SGSN forwards the request to the downstream eNodeB/RNC at Session
Start.
In the UTRAN case, the RNC may accept or reject the proposed IP Multicast
distribution in the MBMS Session Start Response to the SGSN. The RNC node
shall indicate to SGSN if IP Multicast distribution is accepted in the Session
Start Response. If accepted the RNC shall report the channel (IP Multicast and
Source address) to the backbone in order to join the bearer service multicast
distribution. For an IP Multicast address that is shared by several MBMS
bearer services, RNC only reports to the backbone once. At Session Stop the
RNC shall correspondingly report to the backbone in order to leave the bearer
service multicast distribution. For a MBMS bearer service that shares the IP
Multicast address with one or more other MBMS bearer service(s), the RNC does
only report to the backbone at session stop of the last remaining bearer
service that has used a shared IP Multicast address. If one or more downstream
RNC nodes do not accept IP Multicast distribution, the SGSN will establish a
normal MBMS point-to-point GTP-U tunnel to related RNCs and a point-to-point
GTP-U tunnel to the MBMS GW. The SGSN does not respond to the MBMS GW until it
has received responses from all RNCs or until a configurable time has elapsed
(e.g. with a recommended default of 5 seconds). The SGSN shall indicate to the
MBMS GW if IP Multicast distribution is accepted (by one or more RNCs) and it
shall also indicate if normal MBMS point-to-point distribution is required (by
one or more RNCs). The RNC node shall indicate to SGSN if IP Multicast
distribution is accepted in the Session Start Response. If this indication is
missing, the SGSN node shall treat the RNC node as not accepting IP Multicast
distribution and use unicast distribution.
IP Multicast distribution is only used within a PLMN.
MBMS GW shall assign IP Multicast addresses used for MBMS distribution
according to RFC 4607 [21]. When several MBMS GWs are used for MBMS payload
distribution, the used IP Multicast addresses shall be coordinated by
configuration. Clashes between common TEIDs allocated by MBMS GW and TEIDs
allocated by eNodeB/RNC should be avoided by coordinated TEID ranges.
The receiving node controls itself what is received using the IGMPv3/MLDv2
protocol RFC 4604 [22].
The MBMS payload with the synchronization information received from the BM-SC
shall be distributed by the MBMS GW with IP Multicast to the eNodeB/RNC. The
synchronization information is used in the radio interface for the user data
transmission synchronization across the eNodeBs and RNCs as described in TS
25.346 [10]. It is up to RAN configurations whether the inter-RNC MBMS
combining/MBSFN operation mode is used during the MBMS payload delivery.
Mobility between cells may cause limited MBMS data loss towards the UE.
Therefore, MBMS user services should be able to cope with potential data loss
caused by UE mobility.
# 7 Architectural Aspects of MBMS User Services
MBMS bearers may be used in numerous ways to provide different types of
applications. MBMS user services employ MBMS bearers and possibly point-to-
point bearers in order to provide application data in an efficient manner.
This clause is used to discuss different aspects of MBMS user services that
directly relate to the usage of MBMS and point-to-point bearers. This clause
is not intended to deal with the architecture and interfaces of MBMS user
services.
## 7.1 Alternative User Service Support
For many MBMS services, it will be necessary to provide alternative means for
the UE to access the service without using MBMS bearer capabilities. This is
required, for example, after completion of the MBMS session for a file
download to permit errors in the file to be corrected; to permit the network
to charge for a successful download; to pass a decrypt key to the UE; etc. It
may also be useful in cases where all or part of an MBMS transmission has been
missed due to the UE being out of coverage, switched off, etc.
Care is needed to ensure that such alternative access mechanisms do not create
traffic that overloads the network (radio, RNC, BSC, SGSN, GGSN and BM-SC). In
the case that such alternative access requires direct interaction between the
UE and a network server, one way for this load to be distributed is for the
BM-SC to distribute to each UE, at activation time, one or more server
addresses (from a group of addresses), along with parameter(s) that are used
to generate a random time dispersion of the requests.
## 7.2 Avoid overload in SGSN, GGSN and BM-SC caused by Joining
For Joining that is triggered by a service announcement (e.g. CBS or MBMS),
then the service announcement needs to be able to contain parameters to help
avoid overload in the SGSN, GGSN and BM-SC. The UE uses the defined parameters
in the service announcement to randomly select the time at which to join the
service. Hence the BM-SC needs to be able to generate the parameters and needs
to be able to get them sent to the UE in the service announcement.
## 7.3 Access aspects of MBMS user services
In networks with multiple accesses, e.g. GERAN and UTRAN for GPRS, users may
in some situations experience problems in receiving MBMS services. These
situations include:
\- an operator that has chosen to provide a service on one access only (e.g.
only on GERAN), and where a UE is camping on the wrong access (i.e. on UTRAN
in the previous example) when an MBMS session is started. This UE may miss the
MBMS content, as the MBMS architecture doesn\'t provide any mechanism for
paging coordination, etc.
\- an operator that has chosen to provide a service with different QoS levels
e.g. on GERAN and UTRAN (see clause 5.1.5.2). A UE that is changing access
type during an ongoing MBMS session may not be able sort the situation out and
receive the MBMS content correctly.
## 7.4 MBMS operation on Demand
\"MBMS operation on Demand\" (MooD) allows certain content that is initially
delivered over the unicast network to be turned into an MBMS User Service, in
order to efficiently use network resources when the traffic exceeds a certain
threshold. Two types of MBMS operation on Demand are described in TS 26.346
[7]: UE-Elected and Network-Elected offloading. In both types, there could be
a network proxy/server to detect whether unicast traffic volume for the same
service or content exceeds a certain threshold, and to indicate such
occurrence to the BM-SC to enable MBMS offloading. The MooD feature is
optional.
UEs that support MooD functionality support handling of the MooD redirection
message. To assist the MooD decision, the network proxy/server may obtain UE
location by many possible means as per the operator\'s policy, including use
of the current location field in the MooD Header.
MooD is supported for E-UTRAN and UTRAN accesses.
## 7.5 Enhanced TV services support over E-UTRAN
Enhanced TV services over E-UTRAN enables operators and service providers to
deliver TV services from broadcasters as well as 3rd party service providers.
The separation of access to MBMS transport services from MBMS user services
allow separate content delivery and transport services from the operators.
This is achieved by:
\- A broadcast component where mechanisms to enable decoupling of content,
MBMS service and MBMS transport, allowing the system to offer: MBMS transport
only, a shared MBMS network between operators, broadcast only TV service to
devices with no operator subscription.
\- A unicast component via PDN connectivity is achieved through operator\'s
EPC network, in which operator subscription for TV service may be achieved via
dedicated APN.
\- Enable mechanisms for broadcast/unicast fall-back support, consumption-
based switching between unicast/broadcast are supported.
\- Support standardised interface between BM-SC and the content provider, as
defined in TS 26.348 [31], in order to facilitate both transport and user
services delivery for TV services via MBMS (for broadcast) and EPC (for
unicast).
There are 2 MBMS Service Types considered for TV service:
\- MBMS transport only mode:
\- The 3GPP network provides only transport of data/TV content in a
transparent manner.
\- The 3rd party content provider\'s signalling and data transferred via MBMS
bearer(s) are transparent to BM-SC and the MBMS bearer service.
\- All other service aspects, e.g. decision of whether to send data over
broadcast or unicast, is not within 3GPP network, and assumed to be performed
by application server.
\- MBMS full service mode:
\- 3GPP MBMS system provides full service layer capability.
\- BM-SC is aware of the content stream and is capable of transforming the
content stream into 3GPP compliant stream.
\- BM-SC can perform decision on whether to switch an MBMS user service
between broadcast or unicast service.
# 8 MBMS Procedures
## 8.1 MBMS Notification
### 8.1.1 Iu mode notification (UTRAN and GERAN) for GPRS
When an MBMS Session starts, UEs interested in the MBMS bearer service (PMM-
CONNECTED UEs and PMM-IDLE UEs) shall be notified.
MBMS Session attributes such as Session Identifier and MBMS Service Area(s)
are made available in all interested RNCs during the Session Start procedure.
For radio efficiency reasons, the UTRAN may select on a per cell basis whether
to establish point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links for the distribution
of MBMS data to the UEs.
In order to perform this selection, the UTRAN requests a proportion of UEs to
move to PMM-CONNECTED mode by means of MBMS notification sent in the MBMS
service Area.
The exact number of UEs moved to PMM-CONNECTED mode is a decision of the RAN
node. It is not necessary for all UEs to move to PMM-CONNECTED mode in order
for the RAN to decide to use point-to-multipoint, other UEs may remain in PMM-
IDLE state. This is a UTRAN choice (based on Radio Resource Management
criteria).
Following the decision to set up point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links,
the number of UEs that need to be maintained in PMM-CONNECTED mode or moved to
PMM-IDLE mode for MBMS data reception is also a decision of the RAN node.
### 8.1.2 A/Gb mode notification (GERAN)
When an MBMS Session starts, UEs interested in the MBMS bearer service and
that are in READY or STANDBY states shall be notified. The MBMS notification
triggers detection or counting of UEs per cell for selection of the most
appropriate MBMS radio bearer.
MBMS Session attributes such as Session Identifier, MBMS Service Area, QoS are
made available in all interested BSCs that are connected to a registered SGSN
by the Session Start procedure.
## 8.2 MBMS Multicast Service Activation
The MBMS multicast service activation procedure registers the user in the
network to enable the reception of data from a specific multicast MBMS bearer
service. The activation is a signalling procedure between the UE and the
network. The procedure establishes MBMS UE contexts in UE, SGSN and GGSN and
Iu mode BSC/RNC for each activated multicast MBMS bearer service comparable to
regular PDP contexts.
{width="5.906944444444444in" height="6.175in"}
Figure 7: The activation of an MBMS multicast service
1\. The UE activates a general purpose PDP context if one is not already
established.
2\. The UE sends an IGMP (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) Join message over the default
PDP context to signal its interest in receiving a particular multicast MBMS
bearer service identified by an IP multicast address.
3\. The GGSN sends an MBMS Authorization Request seeking authorization for the
activating UE to receive data. The MBMS Authorization Request may include
trace information (Additional MBMS Trace Info), if activated. The
authorization decision, which may be based on subscription data in the BM-SC,
Membership function is provided in the MBMS Authorization Response together
with the APN to be used for creation of the MBMS UE context. If the MBMS
Authorization Response indicates that the UE is not authorized to receive the
MBMS data the process terminates with no additional message exchange.
4a. The GGSN sends an MBMS Notification Request (IP multicast address, APN,
Linked NSAPI) to the SGSN. Linked NSAPI is set equal to the NSAPI of the PDP
context over which the Join request was received. The IP multicast address is
the one requested by the UE in the Join request. The APN may be different from
the APN to which the default PDP context has been activated. In any case, the
APN may resolve to a GGSN that is different from the GGSN receiving the
IGMP/MLD Join request.
4b. The SGSN sends a MBMS Notification Response (Cause) to the GGSN that sent
the MBMS Notification Request, where Cause shall indicate whether or not the
MBMS context activation will proceed. Upon reception of the response message
with Cause indicating unsuccessful operation the GGSN should not send any
further MBMS Notification Request messages. The procedure is then terminated.
5\. The SGSN sends a Request MBMS Context Activation (IP multicast address,
APN, Linked NSAPI, TI) to the UE to request it to activate an MBMS UE Context.
Linked NSAPI allows the UE to associate the MBMS UE Context with the PDP
context over which it sent the IGMP/MLD Join message in step 2. TI was chosen
by the SGSN and contains a value not used by any other activated PDP context
and MBMS UE context for this UE.
6\. The UE creates an MBMS UE context and sends an Activate MBMS Context
Request (IP multicast address, APN, MBMS_NSAPI, MBMS bearer capabilities) to
the SGSN. The IP multicast address identifies the MBMS multicast service,
which the UE wants to join/activate. An APN may indicate a specific GGSN. The
MBMS bearer capabilities indicate the maximum QoS the UE can handle. The
MBMS_NSAPI was chosen by the UE and contains a value not used by any other
activated PDP context and MBMS UE context for this UE. If the SGSN has the
MBMS Bearer Context information for this MBMS bearer service, the SGSN should
verify the UE\'s MBMS bearer capabilities. If the SGSN determines that the
UE\'s MBMS bearer capabilities are less than the Required MBMS Bearer
Capabilities, it shall reject the request for activation of an MBMS context
with an appropriate cause.
7\. If the MBMS UE Context was not established, the SGSN sends a MBMS
Notification Reject Request (Cause) to the GGSN that sent the MBMS
Notification Request, where Cause shall indicate the reason why the MBMS UE
Context could not be established. The GGSN then sends a MBMS Notification
Reject Response back to the SGSN. This should prevent further sending of MBMS
Notification Request messages. The procedure is then terminated.
8\. Security Functions may be performed, e.g. to authenticate the UE.
9\. In A/Gb mode and if BSS trace is activated, the SGSN shall send an Invoke
Trace (Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, and OMC Identity) message to
the BSS. Trace Reference, and Trace Type are copied from the trace information
received from the HLR or OMC.
10\. The SGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context
Requests (IP multicast address, APN, MBMS_NSAPI, IMSI, MSISDN, RAI, IMEI-SV,
RAT Type, MS Time Zone, CGI/SAI, Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC
Identity , Additional MBMS Trace Info) to the GGSN. The SGSN shall include
Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, and OMC Identity if GGSN trace is
activated. The SGSN shall include Additional MBMS Trace Info if BM-SC trace is
activated. The SGSN shall copy Trace Reference, Trace Type, and OMC Identity
from the trace information received from the HLR or OMC. The inclusion of
CGI/SAI shall be according rules detailed in clause 15.1.1a in TS 23.060 [15].
11\. The GGSN sends an MBMS Authorization Request (IMSI, MSISDN, RAI, IMEI-SV,
RAT Type, MS Time Zone, CGI/SAI, Additional MBMS Trace Info) seeking
authorization for the activating UE. The GGSN shall include Additional MBMS
Trace Info if BM-SC trace is activated. The CGI/SAI is included, if available.
The authorization decision is provided in the MBMS Authorization Response. The
BM-SC creates an MBMS UE Context.
12\. If the GGSN does not have the MBMS Bearer Context information for this
MBMS bearer service, the GGSN sends a MBMS Registration Request to the BM-SC.
See clause \"MBMS Registration Procedure\".
If no TMGI has been allocated for this MBMS bearer service, the BM-SC will
allocate a new TMGI. This TMGI will be passed to GGSN and SGSN via the MBMS
Registration Response message and further to UE via Activate MBMS Context
Accept message.
The BM-SC responds with a MBMS Registration Response containing the MBMS
Bearer Context information for this MBMS bearer service and adds the
identifier of the GGSN to the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its
MBMS Bearer Context. See clause \"MBMS Registration Procedure\".
13\. The GGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context
Response to the SGSN.
14\. If the SGSN does not have the MBMS Bearer Context information for this
MBMS bearer service, the SGSN sends a MBMS Registration Request to the GGSN.
See clause \"MBMS Registration Procedure\".
The GGSN responds with a MBMS Registration Response containing the MBMS Bearer
Context information for this MBMS bearer service and adds the identifier of
the SGSN to the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer
Context. See clause \"MBMS Registration Procedure\".
15\. The SGSN provides Iu mode RAN with the MBMS UE Context(s) if at least one
PS RAB is established for the UE.
16\. In Iu mode and if trace is activated, the SGSN shall send an Invoke Trace
(Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, and OMC Identity) message to the
RAN. Trace Reference, and Trace Type are copied from the trace information
received from the HLR or OMC.
NOTE: Step 16 is applied when the trace activation is triggered by means of
signalling. Another alternative is the triggering of trace activation by the
OMC. The details of both Trace Activation procedures are described in TS
32.422 [14].
17\. The SGSN sends an Activate MBMS Context Accept (TMGI) to the UE. If it
was not possible to verify the UE\'s MBMS bearer capabilities in Step 6, the
UE\'s MBMS bearer capabilities shall be verified now b y the SGSN. If the SGSN
determines that the UE\'s MBMS bearer capabilities are lower than the Required
MBMS Bearer Capabilities the SGSN rejects the request for activation of an
MBMS context indicating an appropriate cause and starts the deactivation of
the already established MBMS UE contexts.
### 8.2.1 Void
## 8.3 MBMS Session Start Procedure
### 8.3.0 General
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS Session Start procedure when it is ready to send
data. This is a request to activate all necessary bearer resources in the
network for the transfer of MBMS data and to notify interested UEs of the
imminent start of the transmission.
Through this procedure, MBMS session attributes such as QoS, MBMS service
Area, estimated session duration, are provided to the registered GGSN(s) and
SGSN(s), to all BSCs/RNCs that are connected to a listed SGSN and to the
registered MBMS GW(s) and MME(s). In addition the procedure allocates the
bearer plane to all registered GGSNs, all registered SGSNs and all registered
MBMS GWs, to BSCs/RNCs and E-UTRAN that respond to the session start request
message. If IP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data to E-UTRAN/UTRAN
is supported, the MBMS-GW allocates an IP Multicast address together with the
corresponding IP address of the multicast source (i.e. MBMS GW) and the C-TEID
are provided to the eNodeB via MME and to the RNC via SGSN in this procedure.
Optionally, in the case of E-UTRAN access (e.g. in deployments with a mix of
IPv4 and IPv6 eNodeBs and/or backhauls) and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4
and IPv6, both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address together with the
corresponding alternative IP addresses of the multicast source are also
allocated by the MBMS‑GW and provided to the E-UTRAN via the MME. An IP
multicast address and the paired IP address of the multicast source shall be
of the same IP type.
After sending the Session Start Request message the BM-SC waits for a
configurable delay (time to MBMS data transfer) before sending MBMS data. This
delay should be long enough to avoid buffering of MBMS data in entities other
than the BM-SC, i.e. the delay should allow the network to perform all
procedures required to enable MBMS data transfer before the BM-SC sends MBMS
data. For example notification of UEs and radio bearer establishment should be
performed before MBMS data arrive in the RAN. The delay may be in the region
of multiple seconds or tens of seconds. It may be useful for the BM-SC to be
able to configure different delays for MBMS bearer services on 2G, 3G and
E-UTRAN, respectively.
For the distributed MCE architectures, i.e. when the MCE is part of the eNB as
described in clause 15.1.1 in TS 36.300 [17], an absolute time stamp for when
data can be expected, \"MBMS data transfer start\", should be used at MBSFN
operation mode to ensure synchronized session control and to facilitate a
graceful reallocation of resources for the MBSFN when needed. When the
parameter \"MBMS data transfer start\" is present, a receiving supporting node
shall ignore the parameter \"time to MBMS data transfer\". For session stop
signalling, the parameter \"MBMS data transfer stop\" is if present used to
schedule the release of the radio resources in order to ensure a synchronized
session control.
### 8.3.1 MBMS Session Start Procedure for GERAN and UTRAN for GPRS
For multicast MBMS bearer services the registration of SGSNs and GGSNs is
initiated by MBMS multicast Service Activation procedures, Inter SGSN Routeing
Area Update procedures, Inter SGSN Serving RNS Relocation procedure and
performed by MBMS Registration procedures. The GGSN keeps track of the
registered SGSNs in the list of downstream nodes.
For broadcast MBMS bearer services the list of downstream nodes of BM-SC and
GGSN are achieved in the following ways:
\- The list of downstream nodes for GGSN will be sent from the BM-SC to the
GGSN in the Session Start Request.
Normally, the GGSN contained in the \"list of downstream nodes\" for BM-SC is
the default GGSN (or two for resilience).
The overall Session Start procedure is presented in the following figure:
Figure 8a: Session Start procedure for GERAN and UTRAN for GPRS
1\. The BM-SC Session and Transmission function sends a Session Start Request
message to indicate the impending start of the transmission and to provide the
session attributes (TMGI, Flow Identifier (Broadcast only), QoS, MBMS service
Area, Session identifier, estimated session duration, broadcast/multicast,
list of downstream nodes for GGSN (Broadcast only), time to MBMS data
transfer, MBMS HC indicator (if header compression is used for MBMS payload),
...) and the 2G/3G indicator. The message is sent to the BM-SC Proxy and
Transport function, which then forwards it to the GGSNs listed in the \"list
of downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer Context. The
BM-SC Proxy and Transport function sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer
Context to \'Active\'. For a broadcast MBMS bearer service the GGSN creates an
MBMS bearer context. In broadcast mode, the BM‑SC may start multiple sessions
for the same MBMS bearer service (identified by the TMGI) but with different
content. If so, a Flow Identifier is included in the Session Start Request to
identify the different sub-sessions and the associated MBMS Service Areas
shall not overlap. The GGSN stores the session attributes and the list of
downstream nodes in the MBMS Bearer Context, sets the state attribute of its
MBMS Bearer Context to \'Active\' and sends a Session Start Response message
to the BM-SC. Proxy and Transport function which forwards it to the BM-SC
Session and Transmission function. The BM-SC Proxy and Transport function
copies Session Start Requests to the BM-SC Membership function for charging
purposes.
2\. The GGSN sends an MBMS Session Start Request message containing the
session attributes (TMGI, Flow Identifier (Broadcast only), QoS, MBMS service
Area, Session identifier, estimated session duration, broadcast/multicast,
time to MBMS data transfer, IP Multicast and Source addresses for backbone
distribution, common TEID-U, MBMS HC indicator, ...) and the 2G/3G indicator
to the SGSNs listed in the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter of the
corresponding MBMS Bearer Context. For a broadcast MBMS bearer service the
SGSN creates an MBMS bearer context. The SGSN stores the session attributes
and the 2G/3G indicator in the MBMS Bearer Context, sets the state attribute
of its MBMS Bearer Context to \'Active\'. If one or more of the downstream
nodes accepts the Session Start and the proposed IP Multicast and Source
address for backbone distribution and the proposed C-TEID, the SGSN includes
an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted in the MBMS Session
Start Response message to GGSN. If one or more of the downstream nodes does
not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone
distribution or the proposed C-TEID or if there are downstream BSCs in Gb mode
connected to the SGSN, the SGSN falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS
bearer establishment for these nodes and responds with an MBMS Session Start
Response message providing the TEID for bearer plane that the GGSN shall use
for forwarding the MBMS data. Otherwise if all nodes accept multicast, the
SGSN returns the C-TEID and the IP Multicast distribution address in the
Session Start Response message. The GGSN shall initiate IP Multicast
distribution if at least one of the SGSNs indicates it has accepted IP
Multicast distribution. For MBMS bearer service a SGSN receiving multiple MBMS
Session Start Request messages establishes only one bearer plane with one
GGSN.
3\. The SGSN sends an MBMS Session Start Request message including the session
attributes (TMGI, QoS, MBMS service Area, Session identifier, estimated
session duration, broadcast/multicast, time to MBMS data transfer, list of
RAs, MBMS HC indicator, ...) to each BSC and/or each RNC that is connected to
this SGSN. When the message is sent to an RNC/BSC in Iu mode, the IP Multicast
and Source address for backbone distribution and C‑TEID shall also be included
if received from the GGSN. The 2G/3G indicator shall be used by the SGSN to
determine whether the MBMS Session Start Request message is sent only to BSCs,
or only to RNCs, or to both RNCs and BSCs. For a broadcast MBMS bearer service
the BSC/RNC creates an MBMS Service Context. The BSC in Iu mode/RNC stores the
session attributes in the MBMS Service Context, sets the state attribute of
its MBMS Service Context to \'Active\'. If the RNC accepts the Session start
and the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution and
the proposed C-TEID the RNC sends an MBMS Session Start Response message to
SGSN including an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted. If an
RNC does not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone
distribution (or the proposed C-TEID), the RNC falls back to normal point-to-
point MBMS bearer establishment. A BSC in Gb mode which does not serve the
MBMS Service Area need not store the session attributes. A BSC/RNC receiving
multiple MBMS Session Start Request messages establishes only one bearer plane
with one SGSN.
3a If the BSC/RNC accepts IP Multicast distribution the BSC/RNC joins the
multicast group in the IP backbone according to RFC 3376 [19], RFC 3810 [20]
and RFC 4604 [22].
4\. The BSC/RNC establishes the necessary radio resources for the transfer of
MBMS data to the interested UEs. RAN resource set up can be scheduled
according to the time to MBMS data transfer parameter.
NOTE: The upstream node normally provides the MBMS Session Start Request
message once per MBMS session to a downstream node. Due to \"Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple Core Network Nodes\" however, a BSC/RNC
may receive the MBMS Session Start Request message from several SGSNs.
### 8.3.2 MBMS Session Start Procedure for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS
The list of downstream nodes of BM-SC and the list of MBMS control plane nodes
(MMEs and SGSNs) of MBMS GW are achieved in the following ways:
\- The list of MBMS control plane nodes for MBMS GW will be sent from the BM-
SC to the MBMS GW in the Session Start Request.
Normally, the MBMS GW contained in the \"list of downstream nodes\" for BM-SC
is the default MBMS GW (or two for resilience).
The overall Session Start procedure is presented in the following figures:
Figure 8b.1: Session Start procedure for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS
Figure 8b.2: Session Start procedure for E-UTRAN for EPS with delayed response
1\. BM-SC sends a Session Start Request message to MBMS GW to indicate the
impending start of the transmission and to provide the session attributes
(TMGI, Flow Identifier, QoS, MBMS service Area, list of cell IDs if available,
Session identifier, estimated session duration, list of MBMS control plane
nodes (MMEs, SGSNs) for MBMS GW, time to MBMS data transfer, MBMS data
transfer start, access indicator, ...). The message is sent to the MBMS GWs
listed in the \"downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer
Context in the BM-SC. The BM-SC may start multiple sessions for the same MBMS
bearer service (identified by the TMGI) but with different content. If so, a
Flow Identifier is included in the Session Start Request to identify the
different sub-sessions and the associated MBMS Service Areas shall not
overlap. The Access indicator indicates in which radio access types the MBMS
service should be broadcasted, i.e. UTRAN, or E-UTRAN, or both. The Access
indicator may be included in charging information generated by the MBSM GW.
If MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to BMSC when access type is
E-UTRAN, then MBMS‑GW delays response to BMSC (i.e. step 2) until after step 6
is executed as shown in figure 8b.2. This configuration should be only
performed when E-UTRAN executes step 7 below before responding to the MBMS
Session Start message as specified in TS 36.300 [17].
NOTE: It is up to the operator to ensure that E-UTRAN, MBMS‑GW and BMSC are
configured only when E‑UTRAN supports delaying the response from eNB.
2\. The MBMS GW responds with a Session Start Response message with
information for BM-SC to send MBMS data to the MBMS GW , if figure 8b.1 is
executed. The MBMS‑GW responds only after first MME response in step 6 is
received, if it is configured to do so as shown in figure 8b.2.
3\. The MBMS GW creates an MBMS bearer context. The MBMS GW stores the session
attributes and the list of MBMS control plane nodes in the MBMS bearer context
and allocates a transport network IP multicast address or, optionally, for
E-UTRAN access (e.g. in deployments with a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 eNodeBs and/or
backhauls) and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, both an IPv4 and an
IPv6 IP Multicast address, according to clause 6.5.3 and a C-TEID for this
session. The MBMS GW sends a Session Start Request message including the
session attributes (TMGI, Flow Identifier, QoS, MBMS service Area, list of
cell IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated session duration,
transport network IP Multicast Address(es), IP address(es) of the multicast
source, C-TEID, ...) to MMEs and/or SGSNs listed in the \"list of MBMS control
plane nodes\" parameter after filtering the list using the Access indicator,
thus ignoring entries not consistent with the Access indicator.
4\. The MME or SGSN creates an MBMS bearer context. The MME/SGSN stores the
session attributes and sends a Session Start Request message including the
session attributes (TMGI, QoS, MBMS service area, list of cell IDs if
available, Session identifier, estimated session duration, broadcast (for
UTRAN only), transport network IP Multicast Address, IP address of the
multicast source, C-TEID, ...) to E-UTRAN/UTRAN. Optionally in the case of
E-UTRAN access and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, the MME
includes both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address together with the
corresponding alternative IP address(es) of the multicast source. When
connected to multiple MCEs, the MME should filter the distribution of Session
Control message to the MCEs based on the MBMS service area.
For UTRAN, if one or more of the downstream nodes accepts the Session Start
with the proposed IP Multicast and Source addresses for backbone distribution
and the proposed C-TEID, the SGSN includes an indication that IP Multicast
distribution is accepted in the MBMS Session Start Response message to MBMS
GW. If one or more of the downstream nodes does not accept the proposed IP
Multicast and Source addresses for backbone distribution or the proposed
C-TEID, the SGSN falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer establishment
for these nodes and responds with an MBMS Session Start Response message
providing the TEID for bearer plane that the MBMS GW shall use for forwarding
the MBMS data. Otherwise if all nodes accept multicast, the SGSN returns the
C-TEID and the IP Multicast distribution address in the Session Start Response
message.
For E-UTRAN access, eNB may respond to Session Start Request after first
successful MBMS resources have been reserved (i.e. step 7) which indicates to
the BMSC that there are resources already available for MBMS data delivery, as
shown in figure 8b.2.
5\. The E-UTRAN/UTRAN creates an MBMS bearer context. The E-UTRAN/UTRAN stores
the session attributes, sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to
\'Active\' (in UTRAN only) and responds the MME/SGSN to confirm the reception
of the Session Start Request message. When a cell ID list is included in the
Session Start Request, E-UTRAN uses it to determine a set of radio resources
to be used for the broadcast. Based on the cell ID list, the set of radio
resources selected may be reduced from the full set of resources defined by
the MBMS service area. The E-UTRAN ensures that all of its corresponding nodes
make the same decision on the reduced set.
For UTRAN, if an RNC accepts the Session start and the proposed IP Multicast
and Source addresses for backbone distribution and the proposed C-TEID the RNC
sends an MBMS Session Start Response message to SGSN including an indication
that IP Multicast distribution is accepted. If an RNC does not accept the
proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution (or the
proposed C-TEID), the RNC falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer
establishment.
6\. The MME/SGSN stores the session attributes and the identifier of the
eNBs/RNCs as the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer
Context and responds to the MBMS GW. The SGSN should wait for a response from
all UTRAN nodes (until an acceptable duration) to be able to report to the
MBMS‑GW whether all, part or none of the RNCs have accepted IP multicast
distribution and to provide an SGSN IP address and TEID for user plane over Sn
if some RNCs did not accept IP multicast distribution. The MME may return an
MBMS Session Start Response to the MBMS-GW as soon as the session request is
accepted by one E-UTRAN node. The MBMS‑GW initiates IP Multicast distribution
and/or point-to-point MBMS bearers (for UTRAN only) depending on the responses
from the MMEs/SGSNs.
If the MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to the BMSC, MBMS‑GW waits
until step 6 occurs before responding to the BMSC as shown in figure 8b.2.
7\. The E-UTRAN/UTRAN establishes the necessary radio resources for the
transfer of MBMS data to the interested UEs. For E-UTRAN the radio resource
set up is scheduled using the MBMS data transfer start parameter if it is
present, otherwise using the time to MBMS data transfer parameter. The MBMS
data transfer start parameter is not used by UTRAN.
8\. If the E-UTRAN/UTRAN node accepts IP Multicast distribution, it joins the
appropriate transport network IP multicast address (including the IP address
of the multicast source) allocated by the MBMS GW, to enable reception of MBMS
data. If several MBMS bearer services uses the same IP multicast address, the
join is only done once.
9\. The BM-SC starts sending the MBMS data.
10\. MBMS GW function receives MBMS data. MBMS GW sends the MBMS data using IP
multicast distribution towards all joined eNodeBs/RNCs.
## 8.4 MBMS Registration Procedure
The MBMS Registration is the procedure by which a downstream node informs an
upstream node that it would like to receive session attributes and data for a
particular MBMS bearer service in order to distribute it further downstream.
This procedure builds up a distribution tree for the delivery of MBMS session
attributes and data from the BM-SC to the UEs interested in the service. This
procedure results in the set-up of a corresponding MBMS Bearer Context in the
nodes along the distribution tree, but it does not result in the establishment
of bearer plane which will be established by the Session Start procedure.
The MBMS Registration procedure is initiated:
\- When the first MBMS UE Context for a particular MBMS bearer service is
created in the SGSN or GGSN (see clause \"MBMS UE Context\") and the
corresponding MBMS Bearer Context is not already established in the node;
\- When an MBMS Registration Request for a particular MBMS bearer service is
received from a downstream node but the corresponding MBMS Bearer Context is
not established in the node; or
\- When a DRNC detects that it hosts UEs interested in the MBMS bearer
service.
NOTE: The terms \'downstream\' and \'upstream\' refer to the topological
position of one node with respect to another and relative to the direction of
the MBMS data flow, i.e. from BM-SC to UE.
{width="5.416666666666667in" height="2.6881944444444446in"}
Figure 9: MBMS Registration procedure
1\. When the DRNC detects that it hosts UEs interested in the MBMS bearer
service, the DRNC sends a MBMS Registration Request message to its parent SGSN
if not already done. How the RNC determines its parent SGSN is a matter of
implementation.
2\. If the SGSN has no MBMS Bearer Context for an MBMS bearer service and the
SGSN receives an MBMS Registration Request from an RNC for this MBMS bearer
service, or if the first MBMS UE Context is created in the SGSN for an MBMS
bearer service for which the SGSN has no corresponding MBMS Bearer Context,
the SGSN creates an MBMS Bearer Context (in \"Standby\" state) and sends an
MBMS Registration request (IP multicast address, APN) message to the GGSN. How
the SGSN selects a GGSN is a matter of implementation; it may for instance be
based on prior signalling related to a particular UE or via APN resolution.
3\. If the GGSN has no MBMS Bearer Context for an MBMS bearer service and the
GGSN receives an MBMS Registration from an SGSN for this MBMS bearer service,
or when the first MBMS UE Context is created in the GGSN for an MBMS bearer
service for which the GGSN has no MBMS Bearer Context, the GGSN creates an
MBMS Bearer Context (in \"Standby\" state) and sends a Registration Request
(IP multicast address, APN) message to the BM-SC. Proxy and Transport function
The exact nature of the signalling between GGSN and BM-SC via Gmb interface is
specified in TS 29.061 [4].
4\. Upon reception of an MBMS Registration Request from a GGSN, the BM-SC
Proxy and Transport function adds the identifier of the GGSN to the \"list of
downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context and responds with a
MBMS Registration Response (TMGI, Required Bearer Capabilities) message. The
exact nature of the signalling between GGSN and BM-SC via Gmb interface is
specified in TS 29.061 [4]. If the MBMS Bearer Context is in the \'Active\'
state, the BM-SC initiates the Session Start procedure with the GGSN, as
described in clause \"MBMS Session Start Procedure\".
5\. If the GGSN receives a Registration Request from the SGSN in step 2, the
GGSN:
\- adds the identifier of the SGSN to the \"list of downstream nodes\"
parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context,
\- responds with an MBMS Registration Response (TMGI, Required Bearer
Capabilities) message, and
\- if the MBMS Bearer Context is in the \'Active\' state, initiates the
Session Start procedure with the SGSN, as described in clause \"MBMS Session
Start Procedure\".
6\. If the SGSN received MBMS Registration Request from the DRNC in step 1,
the SGSN:
\- adds the identifier of the RNC to the \"list of downstream nodes\"
parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context,
\- responds with an MBMS Registration Response message, and
\- if the MBMS Bearer Context is in the \'Active\' state, initiates the
Session Start procedure with the DRNC, as described clause \"MBMS Session
Start Procedure\".
## 8.5 MBMS Session Stop Procedure
### 8.5.0 General
The BM-SC Session and Transmission function initiates the MBMS Session Stop
procedure when it considers the MBMS session to be terminated. The session is
typically terminated when there is no more MBMS data expected to be
transmitted for a sufficiently long period of time to justify a release of
bearer plane resources in the network. For GERAN and UTRAN for GPRS, the
procedure is propagated to all SGSNs and GGSNs that are registered for the
corresponding MBMS bearer service and to BSCs/RNCs that have an established Iu
bearer plane with an SGSN. For E‑UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS, the procedure is
propagated to all MBMS GWs, MMEs and SGSNs that are registered for
corresponding MBMS bearer service and to E-UTRAN/UTRAN that have accept to
receive IP multicast distribution.
### 8.5.1 MBMS Session Stop Procedure for GERAN and UTRAN for GPRS
The overall MBMS Session Stop procedure is presented in the following figure:
Figure 10: MBMS Session Stop procedure for GERAN and UTRAN for GPRS
1\. The BM-SC Session and Transmission function sends a Session Stop Request
message to the BM-SC Proxy and Transport function, which forwards it to all
GGSNs listed in the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter of the affected
MBMS Bearer Context to indicate that the MBMS session is terminated and the
bearer plane resources can be released. The MBMS Bearer Context is uniquely
identified by the TMGI or the combination of TMGI and Flow Identifier. The BM-
SC Proxy and Transport function sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer
Context to \'Standby\'. The GGSN sends a Session Stop Response message to the
BM-SC Proxy and Transport function, which forwards it to the BM-SC Session and
Transmission function. The BM-SC Proxy and Transport function copies Session
Stop Requests to the BM-SC Membership function for charging purposes.
2\. The GGSN sends an MBMS Session Stop Request message to all SGSNs that have
a bearer plane established with the GGSN, releases the corresponding bearer
plane resources towards these SGSNs and sets the state attribute of its MBMS
Bearer Context to \'Standby\'. The GGSN releases the MBMS Bearer Context in
case of a broadcast MBMS bearer service.
3\. The SGSN releases the TEID and bearer plane resources on which it was
receiving MBMS data from the GGSN for the affected MBMS bearer service and
sends an MBMS Session Stop Request message to all BSCs/RNCs that have a bearer
plane established with the SGSN and sets the state attribute of its MBMS
Bearer Context to \'Standby\'. The SGSN releases the MBMS Bearer Context in
case of a broadcast MBMS bearer service.
3a If the RNC/BSC is using IP multicast distribution it shall disable
reception from the IP backbone of the particular MBMS bearer service according
to RFC 3376 [19], RFC 3810 [20] and RFC 4604 [22].
4\. The RNC releases the affected radio and Iu resources; the BSC releases the
affected radio resources. The BSC/RNC sets the state attribute of its MBMS
Bearer Context to \'Standby\'. The BSC/RNC releases the MBMS Service Context
in case of a broadcast MBMS bearer service. A BSC in Gb mode shall send an
acknowledgement to the SGSN even if there is no active MBMS context in the
BSC.
### 8.5.2 MBMS Session Stop Procedure for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS
The overall MBMS Session Stop procedure is presented in the following figure:
Figure 10b: MBMS Session Stop procedure for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS
1\. The BM-SC sends a Session Stop Request message (MBMS data transfer stop,
...) to the MBMS GW listed in the \"list of down stream nodes\" parameter of
affected MBMS Bearer Context to indicate the end of session and the bearer
plane resources can be released. The MBMS Bearer Context is uniquely
identified by the TMGI or the combination of TMGI and Flow Identifier. The BM-
SC sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to \'Standby\'. The
MBMS GW responses with Session Stop Response and release its information
regarding the session.
2\. The MBMS GW forwards Session Stop Request message to the MME/SGSN which
previously received the Session Start Request message, release the
corresponding bearer plane resources to E-UTRAN/UTRAN and sets the state
attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to \'Standby\'. The MBMS GW releases the
MBMS Bearer Context in case of a broadcast MBMS bearer service.
3\. MME/SGSN forwards Session Stop Request message to the E-UTRAN/UTRAN which
previously received the Session Start Request message and sets the state
attribute of its MBMS bearer Context to \'Standby\'. Each E‑UTRAN/UTRAN
responds with Session Stop Response message to the MME/SGSN. The MME/SGSN
releases the MBMS Bearer Context in case of a broadcast MBMS bearer service.
3a If the E-UTRAN/UTRAN is using IP multicast distribution it shall disable
reception from the IP backbone of the particular MBMS bearer service according
to RFC 3376 [19], RFC 3810 [20] and RFC 4604 [22]. If several MBMS bearer
services shares the same IP multicast address, the reception from the IP
backbone shall only be disabled when the last MBMS bearer service that has
used a shared IP multicast address is stopped.
4\. The E-UTRAN/UTRAN releases the affected resources and removes the MBMS
Bearer Context (in E-UTRAN) or sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer
Context to \'Standby\' (in UTRAN). For E-UTRAN the release of the radio
resources are scheduled using the MBMS data transfer stop parameter if
present. It may be provided by the BM-SC in the Session Stop signalling. The
MBMS data transfer stop parameter is not used by UTRAN.
## 8.6 MBMS De-Registration Procedure
### 8.6.0 Common MBMS De-Registration procedure
The MBMS De-Registration is the procedure by which a downstream node informs
an upstream node that it does not need to receive signalling, session
attributes and data for a particular MBMS bearer service anymore and therefore
would like to be removed from the corresponding distribution tree.
The MBMS De-registration procedure is initiated:
\- By the SGSN or GGSN when the last MBMS UE Context for a particular MBMS
bearer service is deleted from the node and the \"list of downstream nodes\"
parameter in the corresponding MBMS Bearer Context is empty;
\- By the SGSN or GGSN when the last node registered in the \"list of
downstream nodes\" de-registers from an MBMS bearer service for which there is
no corresponding MBMS UE Context; or
\- By the DRNC that registered at an SGSN when it deletes the associated MBMS
Service Context.
{width="5.124305555555556in" height="3.7604166666666665in"}
Figure 11: MBMS De-Registration Procedure
A. When the DRNC that is registered at an SGSN no longer hosts any UE
interested in that MBMS bearer service, the DRNC requests the de-registration
from the MBMS bearer service to its parent SGSN. As an implementation option,
the DRNC may decide not to de-register from the MBMS bearer service
immediately when these conditions are met, e.g. in order to avoid unnecessary
signalling in the case where the RNC would again need the same MBMS bearer
service shortly after.
The SGSN removes the identifier of the RNC from the \"list of downstream
nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context and confirms the
operation by sending an MBMS De-Registration Response message to the RNC. If
an Iu bearer plane had been established between the DRNC and the SGSN for this
MBMS bearer service, the Iu bearer plane is released. If the RNC is using IP
multicast distribution it shall disable reception from the IP backbone of the
particular MBMS bearer service according to RFC 3376 [19], RFC 3810 [20] and
RFC 4604 [22].
B. When the \"list of downstream nodes\" of a particular MBMS Bearer Context
in the SGSN becomes empty and the SGSN has no MBMS UE Contexts linked to that
MBMS Bearer Context, the SGSN sends an MBMS De-Registration Request (IP
multicast address, APN) message to its upstream GGSN associated with the MBMS
Bearer Context.
The GGSN removes the identifier of the SGSN from the \"list of downstream
nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context and confirms the
operation by sending an MBMS De-Registration Response message to the SGSN. If
a bearer plane had been established between the SGSN and the GGSN for this
MBMS bearer service, the bearer plane is released.
C. When the \"list of downstream nodes\" of a particular MBMS Bearer Context
in the GGSN becomes empty and the GGSN has no MBMS UE Contexts linked to that
MBMS Bearer Context, the GGSN sends a De-Registration Request (IP multicast
address, APN) message to the BM-SC. Proxy and Transport function If a bearer
plane had been established over Gi for this MBMS bearer service, the bearer
plane is released.
The BM-SC removes the identifier of the GGSN from the \"list of downstream
nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context and confirms the
operation by sending a De-Registration Response message to the GGSN.
### 8.6.1 BM-SC initiated MBMS De-Registration Procedure
This MBMS De-Registration Procedure is initiated by BM-SC when the specific
MBMS bearer service is terminated. This procedure tears down the distribution
tree for the delivery of session attributes and MBMS data. This procedure
results in releasing of all MBMS Bearer Contexts and associated MBMS UE
Contexts in the nodes along the distribution tree.
Figure 12: BM-SC initiated MBMS De-Registration Procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends a De-Registration Request message to all GGSNs contained
in the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer
Context to indicate the session is terminated and any related MBMS bearer
resources shall be released.
The GGSN returns a De-Registration Response message to the BM-SC. The BM-SC
releases all MBMS UE Contexts and the corresponding MBMS Bearer context.
2\. The GGSN sends an MBMS De-Registration Request message to all SGSNs
contained in the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter. of the corresponding
MBMS Bearer Context. The SGSN returns an MBMS De-registration Response message
to the GGSN and releases all bearer resources if the state attribute of the
MBMS Bearer Context is \'Active\'. The GGSN releases all MBMS UE Contexts and
the affected MBMS Bearer Context. If a bearer plane had been established over
Gi for this MBMS bearer service, the bearer plane is released.
3\. The SGSN sends an MBMS De-Registration Request message to all BSCs/RNCs
connected with this SGSN. The BSC/RNC returns an MBMS De-Registration Response
message to the SGSN, and releases all bearer resources if the state attribute
of the MBMS Service Context is \'Active\'. If the BSC/RNC is using IP
multicast distribution it shall disable reception from the IP backbone of the
particular MBMS bearer service according to RFC 3376 [19], RFC 3810 [20] and
RFC 4604 [22]. The SGSN releases all MBMS UE Contexts and the affected MBMS
Bearer Context. If a bearer plane had been established between the SGSN and
the GGSN for this MBMS bearer service, the bearer plane is released.
4\. The BSC/RNC releases the affected radio resources, all MBMS UE Contexts
and the MBMS Service Context. The detailed procedures are specified in TS
25.346 [10] and TS 43.246 [11]. RAN may notify the UEs that the MBMS Bearer
service has being terminated, so that the UE can locally deactivate its MBMS
UE context, detailed procedures are specified in TS 25.346 [10] and TS 43.246
[11].
## 8.7 MBMS Multicast Service Deactivation
The multicast service deactivation is a signalling procedure between the UE
and the network. The procedure removes the MBMS UE Context from the UE, RAN,
SGSN and GGSN for a particular MBMS multicast service. The multicast service
deactivation can be initiated by:
\- The UE;
\- The GGSN;
\- The BM-SC; or
\- The SGSN
All these cases are contained in the procedure illustrated in figure 13. The
UE initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 1), the BM-SC
initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 3), the GGSN
initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 4), the SGSN
initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 5) or 9), and the
MBMS UE de-linking is performed at step 7).
At GPRS detach, all MBMS UE contexts of the UE are implicitly deactivated in
the UE, SGSN and GGSN, i.e. the SGSN performs the deactivation procedure
starting with step 7).
If the PDP context linked to the MBMS UE context by the linked NSAPI is
deactivated by the UE or SGSN or GGSN, then the SGSN shall perform the MBMS
deactivation procedure starting with step 7). The UE will remove all MBMS UE
Contexts locally after the Linked PDP Context was deactivated.
Figure 13: MBMS Multicast Service Deactivation
1\. The UE sends an IGMP (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) Leave message (here, the Leave
message means Leave Group message in RFC 2236 for IGMP (IPv4) and Multicast
Listener Done in RFC2710 for MLD (IPv6)) over the default PDP context to leave
a particular multicast service identified by an IP multicast address.
2\. The GGSN sends a Leave Indication (IP multicast address, APN,IMSI) to the
BM-SC Proxy and Transport function, which forwards it to the BM-SC Membership
function, indicating that the UE is requesting to leave the multicast service
identified by the IP multicast address. The exact nature of the signalling
between GGSN and BM-SC is specified in TS 29.061 [4].
3\. Upon reception of the Leave Indication, the BM-SC Membership function
verifies that the IP multicast address corresponds to a valid MBMS bearer
service and sends a UE Removal Request (IP multicast address, APN, IMSI) to
the GGSN that originated the Leave Indication. The APN shall be the same that
was provided during service activation (see \"MBMS Multicast Service
Activation\"). The exact nature of the signalling between GGSN and BM-SC is
specified in TS 29.061 [4]. The BM-SC Membership function may also initiate
the deactivation of an MBMS UE Context for service-specific reasons (e.g. the
service is terminated but the UE has not yet left the multicast group) by
directly sending a UE Removal Request message to the GGSN.
4\. Upon reception of the UE Removal Request or for other reasons (e.g. Error
cases), the GGSN sends an MBMS UE Context Deactivation Request (IP multicast
address, APN, IMSI) to the SGSN. The IP multicast address, APN and IMSI
together identify the MBMS UE Context to be deleted by the SGSN. The APN is
the one received in step 3. The SGSN acknowledges reception of the MBMS UE
Context Deactivation Request by sending an MBMS UE Context Deactivation
Response to the GGSN.
5\. Upon reception of the MBMS UE Context Deactivation Request or for other
reasons (e.g. due to a change in the roaming restrictions for the user) the
SGSN sends a Deactivate MBMS Context Request (TI) to the UE. The TI identifies
the MBMS UE Context to be deleted by the UE.
6\. The UE deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a Deactivate MBMS Context
Accept (TI) to the SGSN.
7\. If the UE is PMM-CONNECTED and has been already linked towards the RAN, t
he SGSN sends a MBMS UE De-Linking Request to the RNC (IP multicast address,
APN, TMGI). RAN deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a MBMS UE De-Linking
Response (TMGI ) to the SGSN.
8\. If dedicated radio resources are currently assigned to the UE for the
reception of the MBMS data, the RAN releases these radio resources. If shared
radio resources are currently assigned for the distribution of the MBMS data,
the RAN may decide to move the remaining UEs to dedicated resources. The
detailed procedures and conditions are specified in TS 25.346 [10] and TS
43.246 [11].
9\. Upon reception of the Deactivate MBMS Context Accept or for other reasons
(e.g. due to expiry of the long timer that is started upon a periodic routeing
area update not being received) the SGSN sends a Delete MBMS Context Request
(MBMS_NSAPI) to the GGSN that holds the MBMS UE Context. This GGSN may be
different from the GGSN that receives IGMP Leave request in step 1.
10\. The GGSN deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a Deactivation Indication
to the BM-SC to confirm the successful deactivation of the MBMS UE Context.
The BM-SC, after receiving the Deactivation Indication, deletes the MBMS UE
Context and sends a confirmation to the GGSN. The exact nature of the
signalling between GGSN and BM-SC is specified in TS 29.061 [4].
11\. If the GGSN does not have any more users interested in this MBMS bearer
service and the \"list of downstream nodes\" in the corresponding MBMS Bearer
Context is empty, the GGSN sends a MBMS De-Registration Request to the BM-SC
Proxy and Transport function. The BM-SC Proxy and Transport function responds
with a MBMS De-Registration Response and removes the identifier of the GGSN
from the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context.
See clause \"MBMS De-Registration Procedure\".
12\. The GGSN confirms the deactivation of the MBMS UE Context to the SGSN by
sending a Delete MBMS Context Response to the SGSN, which then deletes the
MBMS UE Context.
13\. If the SGSN does not have any more users interested in this MBMS bearer
service and the \"list of downstream nodes\" in the corresponding MBMS Bearer
Context is empty, the SGSN sends an MBMS De-Registration Request to the GGSN.
The GGSN responds with an MBMS De-Registration Response and removes the
identifier of the SGSN from the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its
MBMS Bearer Context. See clause \"MBMS De-Registration Procedure\".
## 8.8 MBMS Session Update procedure
### 8.8.1 General
The MBMS Session Update procedure may be invoked by BM-SC or by SGSN. The BM-
SC uses the procedure to update the service area or the QoS(ARP) for an
ongoing MBMS Broadcast service session. The SGSN can also use the procedure to
update the list of RAs where MBMS multicast users are located for an ongoing
MBMS Multicast service session.
For the distributed MCE architectures, i.e. when the MCE is part of the eNB as
described in clause 15.1.1 in TS 36.300 [17], an absolute time stamp for when
data can be expected, \"MBMS data transfer start\", should be used at MBSFN
operation mode to ensure synchronized session control and to facilitate a
graceful reallocation of resources for the MBSFN when needed. When the
parameter \"MBMS data transfer start\" is present, a receiving supporting node
shall ignore the parameter \"time to MBMS data transfer\". For session stop
signalling, the parameter \"MBMS data transfer stop\" is if present used to
schedule the release of the radio resources in order to ensure a synchronized
session control. The MME also sends an MBMS Session Start Request message to
any added MCEs, and an MBMS Session Stop Request message to any removed MCEs.
The MME shall set \"MBMS Data Transfer Start\" to \" Time of MBMS Data
Transfer \" or \" Time of MBMS Data Stop \" respectively as specified in TS
36.444 [28].
### 8.8.2 SGSN initiated Session Update for GERAN and UTRAN for MBMS Multicast
service
If the SGSN has provided a list of RAs in the MBMS Session Start Request
message (even if the list was empty) and RAs are added or removed from the
list, the SGSN shall use the MBMS Session Update procedure to inform the RNCs
that the list has changed. The SGSN sends the Session Update message only to
the RNCs that are affected by the list change. The procedure is used only
during the MBMS Multicast service session and when SGSN has already sent a
MBMS Session Start Request message to the RNC.
If the SGSN has provided a list of RAs in the MBMS Session Start Request
message (even if the list was empty) the SGSN shall send the Session Update to
a RNC when:
\- the first UE which have activated the service enters in a RA that is not in
the list;
\- the last UE which have activated the service leaves from a RA that was in
the list.

Figure 13a. Session Update procedure
1) The SGSN sends MBMS Session Update Request message to a RNC.
2) The RNC acknowledges the MBMS Session Update Request with the MBMS Session
Update Response message.
### 8.8.3 BM-SC initiated Session Update for GERAN and UTRAN for MBMS
Broadcast service
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS Session Update procedure when the service area
for an ongoing MBMS Broadcast service session shall be modified.
The attributes that can be modified by the Session Update Request are the MBMS
Service Area, and the list of downstream nodes for GGSN (Broadcast only). A
node receiving the Session Update Request determines how the attributes have
changed by comparing the attributes in the message with corresponding
attributes in its stored MBMS Bearer Context.
A Session Update received in one node, results in a Session Update being sent
to downstream nodes, to inform of the changed MBMS Service Area. If a Session
Update with the List of SGSN parameter included is received in the GGSN, it
does also result in a Session Start being sent to new downstream nodes, and in
a Session Stop being sent to downstream nodes that have been removed from the
list.
The overall Session Update procedure is presented in figure 13b.
{width="5.995833333333334in" height="2.408333333333333in"}
Figure 13b: Session Update procedure for GERAN and UTRAN
1\. The BM-SC Session and Transmission function sends a Session Update Request
(TMGI, Flow Identifier (Broadcast only), QoS, MBMS Service Area, Session
identifier, estimated session duration, broadcast/multicast, list of
downstream nodes for GGSN, time to MBMS data transfer) to the BM-SC Proxy and
Transport function, which then forwards it to the GGSNs listed in the \"list
of downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer Context. The
TMGI and Session identifier identifies the ongoing session. The QoS,
broadcast/multicast attributes and the 2G/3G indicator shall be identical as
in the preceding Session Start message. The MBMS Service Area and the List of
downstream nodes for GGSN define the new service area. The time to MBMS data
transfer shall be set to 0 and the estimated session duration shall be set to
a value corresponding to the remaining part of the session.
The GGSN stores the new session attributes and the list of downstream nodes in
the MBMS Bearer Context and sends a Session Update Response message to the BM-
SC Proxy and Transport function which forwards it to the BM-SC Session and
Transmission function. The BM-SC Proxy and Transport function copies the
Session Update Request to the BM-SC Membership function for charging purposes.
2\. The GGSN compares the new list of downstream nodes with the list of
downstream nodes it has stored in the MBMS Bearer Context. It sends an MBMS
Session Start Request message to any added SGSN, an MBMS Session Stop Request
to any removed SGSN, and an MBMS Session Update Request to the remaining SGSNs
in the new list.
3\. The SGSN receiving an MBMS Session Update Request message, sends an MBMS
Session Update Request message including the session attributes (TMGI, QoS,
MBMS service Area, Session identifier, estimated session duration,
broadcast/multicast, time to MBMS data transfer, list of RAs, etc.) to each
BSC and/or each RNC that is connected to this SGSN.
4\. The BSCs/RNCs establish or release the necessary radio resources for the
transfer of MBMS data to the interested UEs.
### 8.8.4 BM-SC initiated Session Update for EPS with E-UTRAN and UTRAN
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS Session Update procedure when the service
attributes (e.g. Service Area, list of cell IDs or ARP) for an ongoing MBMS
Broadcast service session shall be modified, e.g. the Session Update procedure
for EPS is initiated by BM-SC to notify eNBs to join or leave the service
area. Update of the QoS(ARP) is triggered when the priority of a broadcast
data flow of a group communication service is changed as specified in TS
23.468 [24].
The attributes that can be modified by the Session Update Request are the MBMS
service area, list of cell IDs, Access indicator, MBMS data transfer start,
QoS(ARP) and the List of MBMS control plane nodes. A node receiving the
Session Update Request determines how the attributes have changed by comparing
the attributes in the message with corresponding attributes in its stored MBMS
Bearer Context.
A Session Update received in one node, results in a Session Update being sent
to downstream nodes, to inform of the changed MBMS service attributes. If a
Session Update with the List of MME and SGSN parameter included is received in
the MBMS GW, it does also result in a Session Start being sent to new
downstream nodes, and in a Session Stop being sent to downstream nodes that
have been removed from the list.
NOTE: For a MBMS session the change of service area does not result in a
change of MBMS‑GW.
The overall Session Update procedure is presented in figure 13c-1 and 13c-2.
Figure 13c-1: Session Update procedure for EPS with E-UTRAN and UTRAN
Figure 13c-2: Session Update procedure for EPS with E-UTRAN with delayed
response
1\. The BM-SC sends a Session Update Request (TMGI, Flow Identifier, QoS, MBMS
Service Area, list of cell IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated
session duration, the list of MBMS control plane nodes(MMEs, SGSNs) for MBMS
GW, time to MBMS data transfer, MBMS data transfer start, Access Indicator,
...) to MBMS GW. The TMGI and Session identifier identifies the ongoing
session. Apart from the ARP parameter, all other parameters in the QoS profile
shall be identical as in the preceding Session Start message. The ARP
parameter may be different if it is to be updated. The MBMS Service Area and
the list of MBMS control plane nodes (MMEs, SGSNs) for MBMS GW define the new
service area. The estimated session duration shall be set to a value
corresponding to the remaining part of the session. If radio access of MBMS
service is updated the Access indicator shall be included to indicate in which
radio access types the MBMS service should be broadcasted, i.e. UTRAN, or
E-UTRAN, or both. The ARP parameter may be updated only if the Access
Indicator indicates E-UTRAN. The Access indicator may be included in charging
information generated by the MBMS‑GW.
If MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to BMSC when access type is
E-UTRAN, then MBMS‑GW delays response to BMSC (i.e. Step 2) until after step 6
is executed as shown in figure 13c-2. This configuration should be only
performed when E-UTRAN executes step 7 below before responding to the MBMS
Session Update message as specified in TS 36.300 [17].
NOTE: It is up to the operator to ensure that E-UTRAN, MBMS‑GW and BMSC are
configured only when E‑UTRAN supports delaying the response from eNB.
2\. The MBMS GW stores the new session attributes in the MBMS Bearer Context
and sends a Session Update Response message to the BM-SC, if figure 13c-1 is
executed. The MBMS‑GW responds only after first MME response in step 6 is
received, if it is configured to do so as shown in figure 13c-2.
3\. The MBMS GW filters the new list of MBMS control plane nodes using the
Access indicator to ignore entries not consistent with the Access indicator,
and compares remaining entries in the new list of MBMS control plane nodes
with the list of MBMS control plane nodes it has stored in the MBMS Bearer
Context. It sends an MBMS Session Start Request message to any added MME/SGSN,
an MBMS Session Stop Request to any removed MME/SGSN, and an MBMS Session
Update Request (TMGI, Flow Identifier, QoS, MBMS Service Area, list of cell
IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated session duration, ...) to the
remaining MME/SGSNs in the new list. The handlings of the MBMS Session
Start/Stop Request message are described in clauses 8.3.2 and 8.5.2.
4\. The MME/SGSN receiving an MBMS Session Update Request message, sends an
MBMS Session Update Request message including the session attributes (TMGI,
QoS, MBMS service Area, list of cell IDs if available, Session identifier,
estimated session duration, broadcast (for UTRAN only), transport network IP
Multicast Address, IP address of the muticast source, C‑TEID, etc.) to each
eNodeB/MCE/RNC that is connected to the MME/SGSN.
For E-UTRAN, when connected to multiple MCEs, the MME should filter the
distribution of MBMS Session Update Request messages to the MCEs based on the
MBMS service area.
For UTRAN, if one or more of the downstream nodes newly added to the MBMS
Service Area accepts the Session Update and the proposed IP Multicast and
Source address for backbone distribution and the proposed C‑TEID, the SGSN
includes an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted in the MBMS
Session Update Response message to MBMS GW. If one or more of the downstream
nodes newly added to the MBMS Service Area does not accept the proposed IP
Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution or the proposed C‑TEID,
the SGSN falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer establishment for
these nodes and responds with an MBMS Session Update Response message
providing the TEID for bearer plane that the MBMS GW shall use for forwarding
the MBMS data. Otherwise if all nodes accept multicast, the SGSN returns the
C‑TEID and the IP Multicast distribution address in the Session Update
Response message.
E-UTRAN may respond to Session Update Request after first successful MBMS
resources have been set up or released (i.e. Step 7) which indicates to the
BMSC that there are resources already available for MBMS data delivery, as
shown in figure 13c-2.
5\. If the E-UTRAN/UTRAN has no MBMS bearer context with the TMGI indicated in
the MBMS Session Update Request message, the E-UTRAN/UTRAN creates an MBMS
bearer context and sets its state attribute to \'Active\' (in UTRAN only).
Otherwise the E-UTRAN/UTRAN compare the new service area with the one it has
stored in the MBMS Bearer Context and make the corresponding update. Then the
E-UTRAN/UTRAN responds the MME/SGSN to confirm the reception of the Session
Update Request message. When a cell ID list is included in the Session Start
Request, E-UTRAN uses it to determine a set of radio resources to be used for
the broadcast. Based on the cell ID list, the set of radio resources selected
may be reduced from the full set of resources defined by the MBMS service
area. The E-UTRAN ensures that all of its corresponding nodes make the same
decision on the reduced set.
For UTRAN, if an RNC newly added to the MBMS Service Area accepts the Session
Update and the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone
distribution and the proposed C-TEID the RNC sends an MBMS Session Update
Response message to SGSN including an indication that IP Multicast
distribution is accepted. If an RNC newly added to the MBMS Service Area does
not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone
distribution (or the proposed C‑TEID), the RNC falls back to normal point-to-
point MBMS bearer establishment.
6\. The MME/SGSN updates the session attributes in its MBMS Bearer Context and
responds to the MBMS GW. The SGSN should wait for a response from all UTRAN
nodes (until an acceptable duration) if the Service Area has been changed to
be able to report to the MBMS‑GW whether all, part or none of any newly added
RNCs have accepted IP multicast distribution and to provide an SGSN IP address
and TEID for user plane over Sn if some RNCs did not accept IP multicast
distribution. The MME may return a response to the MBMS-GW as soon as the
session update request is accepted by one E-UTRAN node.
If the MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to the BMSC, MBMS‑GW waits
until step 6 occurs before responding to the BMSC as shown in figure 13c-2.
7\. The E-UTRAN/UTRAN establishes/releases the radio resources for the
transfer of MBMS data to the interested UEs. If the ARP parameter is updated
the MCE shall ensure that any necessary changes to radio resources are
synchronized across all eNBs in the corresponding MBSFN area. For E-UTRAN the
radio resource set up is scheduled using the MBMS data transfer start
parameter if it is present, otherwise using the time to MBMS data transfer
parameter if it is present. The MBMS data transfer start parameter is not used
by UTRAN.
8\. The eNodeBs/RNCs send IP multicast Join or Leave message to the received
user plane IP multicast address allocated by the MBMS GW. If multiple MBMS
bearers services shares the same IP multicast address, this shall be
considered before a Join or Leave message is sent.
## 8.9 MBMS UE Context Synchronisation Procedure
The Routing Area Update procedure transfers the MBMS UE Context status between
UE and SGSN. This MBMS UE Context status identifies MBMS UE contexts, which
are lost or deactivated only on one side. All MBMS UE Contexts, which are
active on one side only shall be deactivated locally. If the UE wishes to re-
activate the related MBMS bearer service, it shall join the MBMS bearer
service again. See clause 8.2 \"MBMS Multicast Service Activation\".
{width="3.375in" height="1.1791666666666667in"}
Figure 13d. MBMS UE Context Synchronisation procedure
1) The UE sends Routeing Area Update Request to the SGSN. It includes the MBMS
UE Context status, which indicates the UE\'s active MBMS UE Contexts.
2) The SGSN sends Routeing Area Update Accept to the UE. It includes the MBMS
UE Context status, which indicates the UE\'s MBMS UE Contexts that are stored
in the SGSN.
## 8.9a MBMS feature support indication
An SGSN that supports MBMS shall indicate MBMS feature support to the UE
during Routing Area Update procedure in the Routing Area Update Accept message
and during GPRS attach procedure in the Attach Accept message. The UE then
knows it can use already activated MBMS bearers, or activate new MBMS bearers
according to clause 8.2 \"MBMS Multicast Service Activation\".
An SGSN that does not support MBMS will not indicate MBMS feature support to
the UE. This indicates to the UE that MBMS bearers are no longer supported,
which may allow the UE to use point-to-point bearers for MBMS data transfer.
In this case, the UE shall deactivate all active MBMS UE Contexts locally.
## 8.10 Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update
This procedure describes the handling of MBMS bearer services when an MBMS UE
performs a Routeing Area Update and the serving SGSN changes. It is based on
the Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure specified in TS 23.060 [15]. The
procedure is performed regardless whether MBMS sessions are ongoing or not.
The handling of any PDP contexts established by the UE is not changed compared
to the procedure without MBMS. The procedure described below does not show all
details of the Routeing Area update procedure. Only for the MBMS specific
additions the steps are described.
{width="5.997916666666667in" height="7.1625in"}
Figure 14: Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update
2) An SGSN supporting MBMS indicates its MBMS support in the SGSN Context
Request message. If the SGSN indicates that it supports MBMS, the old SGSN
includes the transfer of the MBMS UE Context(s) in the SGSN Context Response
message.
7) For the MBMS UE context(s) received in step 2) the new SGSN sends Update
MBMS UE Context Request (Serving network identity, MS Time Zone, CGI/SAI, RAT
Type, Additional MBMS Trace Info) to the GGSNs concerned. The GGSNs update
their MBMS UE Context fields and return Update MBMS UE Context Response.
8) The GGSN sends Update MBMS UE Context Request (RAI) to the BM-SC. The
inclusion of CGI/SAI shall be according rules detailed in clause 15.1.1a in TS
23.060 [15]. The BM-SC updates its MBMS UE Context fields and return Update
MBMS UE Context Response.
9) If the GGSN receives new or updated Additional MBMS Trace Info from the new
SGSN, the GGSN sends an Activate Trace (Additional MBMS Trace Info) message to
the BM-SC.
14) In case the new SGSN indicated no MBMS support in step 2) the old SGSN
deactivates all MBMS UE context(s) of the UE in SGSN, GGSN and BM-SC by
initiating deactivation procedure(s) as described in clause \"8.7 MBMS
Multicast Service Deactivation\".
15) If the old SGSN does not have any more MBMS UE Contexts for the MBMS
bearer service(s) and the \"list of downstream nodes\" in the corresponding
MBMS Bearer Context is empty, the SGSN initiates the MBMS De-Registration
Procedure. See clause \"8.6 MBMS De-Registration Procedure\".
16) In case the new SGSN indicated MBMS support in step 2), the new SGSN
verifies for each MBMS UE Context received whether it has a corresponding MBMS
Bearer Context. For each MBMS Bearer Context that the SGSN does not already
have, the SGSN creates an MBMS Bearer Context (in \"Standby\" state) and
initiates the MBMS Registration Procedure towards the GGSN. See clause \"8.4
MBMS Registration Procedure\".
17) An SGSN without MBMS support does not indicate MBMS feature support in the
Routing Area Update Accept message. On the other hand if the SGSN supports
MBMS, the Routing Area Update Accept indicates to the UE that the network
supports MBMS.
## 8.10a Inter-system Intra-SGSN change
For an MBMS UE transitioning between UTRAN and A/Gb mode GERAN, the procedures
are the same as the Iu mode to A/Gb mode Intra SGSN Change and A/Gb mode to Iu
mode Intra SGSN Change procedures specified in TS 23.060 [15].
Furthermore, the same considerations on Radio Access Technology changes apply
as specified in the impacts of applying flow based charging specified in TS
23.060 [15], i.e. the SGSN shall send an Update MBMS UE Context Request to the
GGSN. Subsequently the GGSN shall send an Update MBMS UE Context Request to
the BM-SC as described in the Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure in
clause 8.10.
## 8.11 Inter SGSN Serving RNS Relocation Procedure
This procedure is performed when the SGSN changes due to SRNS relocation. It
bases on the SRNS Relocation procedure specified in TS 23.060 [15]. The
procedure is performed regardless whether MBMS sessions are ongoing or not.
The handling of any PDP contexts established by the UE is not changed compared
to the procedure without MBMS. The procedure described below does not show all
details of the SRNS relocation procedure. Only for the MBMS specific additions
the steps are described.

Figure 15: SRNS Relocation Procedure
3) The old SGSN transfers the MBMS UE Context(s). in the Forward Relocation
Request message to the new SGSN
5) An MBMS supporting SGSN indicates its MBMS support in the Forward
Relocation Response message.
14) In case the new SGSN supports MBMS it verifies for each MBMS UE Context
received whether it has a corresponding MBMS Bearer Context. For each MBMS
Bearer Context not yet existing in the SGSN the SGSN creates an MBMS Bearer
Context (in \"Standby\" state) and initiates the MBMS Registration Procedure.
See clause \"MBMS Registration Procedure\".
16) In case the new SGSN indicated no MBMS support in step 3) the old SGSN
deactivates all MBMS UE contexts of the UE in SGSN, GGSN and BMSC by
initiating deactivation procedure(s) as described in clause \"8.7 MBMS
Multicast Service Deactivation\".
17) If the old SGSN does not have any more MBMS UE Contexts for this MBMS
bearer service and the \"list of downstream nodes\" in the corresponding MBMS
Bearer Context is empty, the SGSN initiates the MBMS De-Registration
Procedure. See clause \"MBMS De-Registration Procedure\".
18) If the new SGSN supports the MBMS and for the MBMS UE context(s) received
in step 5) the new SGSN sends Update MBMS UE Context Request (Serving network
identity, MS Time Zone, CGI/SAI, RAT Type, Additional MBMS Trace Info) to the
GGSNs concerned. The GGSNs update their MBMS UE Context fields and return
Update MBMS UE Context Response. The GGSN sends updated Serving network
identity to the BM-SC. The inclusion of CGI/SAI shall be according rules
detailed in clause 15.1.1a in TS 23.060 [15].
19) If the GGSN receives new or updated Additional MBMS Trace Info from the
new SGSN, the GGSN sends an Activate Trace (Additional MBMS Trace Info)
message to the BM-SC.
20) An SGSN without MBMS support does not indicate MBMS feature support in the
Routing Area Update Accept message. On the other hand if the SGSN supports
MBMS, the Routing Area Update Accept indicates to the UE that the network
supports MBMS.
## 8.12 MBMS Broadcast Service Activation
MBMS Broadcast service activation is the procedure by which a UE locally
activates a broadcast MBMS bearer service:
\- The MBMS broadcast service activation procedure does not register the user
in the network. There is no MBMS bearer service specific signalling exchanged
between the UE and the Network.
\- The broadcast service activation procedure does not establish MBMS UE
contexts in UE, SGSN and GGSN.
## 8.13 MBMS Broadcast service de-activation
The MBMS Broadcast service de-activation by the UE is local to the UE, i.e.
without interaction with the Network.
## 8.14 Void
## 8.15 MBMS UE Linking/De-linking mechanism
MBMS UE Linking is the process by which UE MBMS context(s) is (are) provided
to an Iu-mode RAN.
MBMS UE linking procedure is performed when the UE is PMM-CONNECTED at least
in the following cases.
\- When a UE which has a MBMS UE context is moved to the PMM CONNECTED state
and a PS RAB is established. This may happen at any point in time e.g. before,
during and between Sessions.
\- When a UE joins the MBMS bearer service and is in the PMM CONNECTED state
due to an existing PS RAB. This may happen at any point in time e.g. before,
during and between Sessions.
\- When a UE is moved to the PMM CONNECTED state via the MBMS Service Request
procedure. This may happen at any point in time during a MBMS session.
The UE linking is performed to link a specific UE to an MBMS service. It
provides the SRNC/Iu-mode BSC with a list of MBMS service identifiers
(including TMGI) for MBMS bearer services activated by the UE. If no MBMS
service context exists for this particular MBMS bearer service then the
SRNC/Iu-mode BSC creates an MBMS service context after this procedure.
NOTE: the MBMS Bearer Context is referred to as the MBMS Service Context in
3GPP RAN specifications
MBMS UE De-Linking denotes the process where a MBMS UE context is removed from
the RAN.
MBMS UE De-Linking procedure is performed if the UE is PMM-CONNECTED and has
been already linked towards the RAN at least when it initiates MBMS Multicast
Service Deactivation procedure. This may happen at any point in time during
the whole MBMS service availability i.e. before, during and between MBMS
sessions.
The UE De-Linking is performed to unlink a specific UE from a MBMS service.
The entry for this UE is removed from the concerned MBMS service context(s) in
the SRNC.
## 8.16 MBMS Service Request Procedure
For MBMS, when UTRAN wants to count the number of users that are interested in
a specific MBMS service which are present in a cell, it will request a
percentage of the interested UEs to transit to PMM-CONNECTED state. The MBMS
Service Request procedure is used by a UE in the PMM‑IDLE state to move to the
PMM-CONNECTED state. The MBMS Service Request procedure is also used by a UE
in PMM IDLE or PMM-CONNECTED state to request to be maintained in PMM-
CONNECTED state for the purpose of receiving data over an MBMS point-to-point
radio bearer.
Figure 17: MBMS Service Request procedure
1) An RRC connection is established if it doesn\'t already exist.
2) The UE sends a Service Request message to the SGSN if MBMS PTP reception
shall be used or if otherwise required to do so by the RAN when MBMS reception
shall be started. The Service Type shall indicate MBMS multicast service
reception or MBMS broadcast service reception. The SGSN shall not release the
Iu signalling connection until requested by the RAN.
3) The SGSN may perform the security functions.
4) The SGSN provides the RAN with the IMSI of the UE.
5) The SGSN provides the RAN with the MBMS UE context(s) (IP multicast
address/APN, TMGI, MBMS_NSAPI) via MBMS UE Linking procedure, if the SGSN has
active MBMS UE context(s) for the UE.
NOTE: Step 6 is independent of steps 4 to 5 and can occur before or
simultaneously with any of these steps.
6) The RNC establishes the necessary radio resources for the transfer of MBMS
data to the interested UEs.
7) When PTP transmission of a MBMS multicast or MBMS broadcast service is
active for a UE then the RNC shall supervise the Iu signalling connection.
When the RAN determines that it does not need to keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED
state anymore, it shall trigger a normal Iu release towards SGSN.
## 8.17 Notification in case of parallel services
### 8.17.1 Notification of incoming CS domain call during an ongoing MBMS
session
For the RRC connected mobiles in UTRAN, the RNS will have received the IMSI
from the core network and hence is able to perform paging coordination. The
UEs in RRC idle state in UTRAN need to perform paging coordination while
receiving the MBMS session\'s user data.
In GERAN, this is achieved by the UE monitoring its paging channels while
receiving the MBMS session\'s user data. If the mobile responses to the CS
paging in GERAN, then the ongoing MBMS service is likely to be interrupted in
the UE.
### 8.17.2 Notification of additional MBMS session during an ongoing MBMS
session
For the RRC connected mobiles in UTRAN, the SGSN has sent the list of MBMS
bearer services that the user has activated to the UTRAN. The RNS needs to
notify an RRC connected UE.
For the UEs in RRC idle state, the UTRAN performs MBMS notification for the
UE.
In GERAN, this is achieved by the UE monitoring its paging channel(s) where
notification is sent while receiving the MBMS session\'s user data.
If the mobile accepts the new MBMS session in GERAN, then the ongoing MBMS
service is likely to be interrupted in the UE.
### 8.17.3 Notification of Mobile Terminating PS data during an ongoing MBMS
session
For the RRC connected mobiles in UTRAN, the SGSN request the establishment of
a RAB which will be used to deliver the MT user data.
For the UEs in RRC idle state, the UTRAN performs paging notification for the
UE.
In GERAN, this is achieved by the UE monitoring its paging channels while
receiving the MBMS session\'s user data.
If the mobile responses to the PS paging in GERAN, then the ongoing MBMS
service is likely to be interrupted in the UE.
### 8.17.4 Notification of MBMS session during an ongoing CS or PS domain
\"connection\"
When the UE establishes the UTRAN RRC connection for a CS service, the UE
shall send a flag indicating that it has activated at least one MBMS bearer
service. The RNC requests the SGSN to send the list of MBMS bearer services
that the user has activated to enable the RNC to notify the UE when MBMS
session starts.
When a UE moves to PMM-connected state, the SGSN sends the list of MBMS bearer
services that the user has activated to the RNC. The RNC notifies the UE when
an MBMS session of the user\'s activated MBMS bearer services starts.
These procedures are not supported by GERAN in this version of the
specification.
# 9 Security
Security of MBMS is found in TS 33.246 [5].
# 10 Charging requirement
## 10.1 General
The MBMS architecture shall support on-line and off-line charging.
It shall be possible to collect charging information for the multicast mode.
It shall also be possible to collect charging information for MBMS services in
visited networks.
MBMS shall collect charging information about the transmission of MBMS
broadcast or multicast data that are provided by content or service providers
(e.g. 3^rd^ parties). This shall enable billing of broadcast and multicast
content or service providers.
To enable billing of broadcast and multicast content providers, data shall be
collected at the BM-SC.
NOTE: SGSN, GGSN and BM-SC generate charging data for the transmitted data,
always under the assumption that the UEs are within the MBMS service area. If
the MBMS service area is less than the PLMN, then there is the possibility
that a UE will have moved outside the MBMS service area. Charging data will
still be generated for that UE causing an inaccuracy in the data. This
inaccuracy increases as the size of the MBMS service area is decreased.
## 10.2 Bearer level charging for MBMS
To provide bearer level charging for MBMS, mechanisms and functional elements
described in TS 23.125 [12] are used for MBMS Bearer Contexts.
For EPS, MBMS GW shall collect charging information about the transmission of
MBMS broadcast for UTRAN and E-UTRAN. MBMS Bearer context in MBMS GW should
include charging related information elements.
Flow Based Charging (FBC) may be used to collect charging data records for
MBMS Bearer Contexts e.g. for the purpose to charge the service provider, cf.
TS 23.125 [12].
NOTE: Since multiple users share an MBMS bearer context FBC cannot be used for
creating reports on a per user basis.
## 10.3 Application level charging for MBMS
For GPRS, in order to meet the MBMS charging requirements in TS 22.146 [2] and
TS 22.246 [6], the following elements and functionalities are provided by the
GPRS MBMS architecture:
a) The MSISDN and IMSI are passed to the BM-SC. This provides the operator
with the ability to associate GPRS location information (i.e. serving network
idenity) with a user.
b) In order to permit differential roaming tariffs, the serving network
identity is provided to the BM-SC.
c) Charging for MBMS services is based on application layer mechanisms, since
it is only at the application layer that security is provided which can
restrict content to authorised users or confirm delivery of content to users:
The following general requirements apply to charging information generated by
the BM-SC:
\- Charging information generated for application layer charging events should
include the above information provided by the GPRS network to facilitate
differential roaming tariffs.
\- Charging information should include an indication of the point at which the
user had access to the content (e.g. if and when decryption keys for encrypted
content are sent to the UE.).
For EPS, in order to meet the MBMS charging requirements in TS 22.146 [2],
charging requirements for MBMS in EPS should be supported in broadcast mode
and be same as that in broadcast mode for MBMS in GPRS network on application
level.
## 10.4 Generation of charging records in the VPLMN
In this Release, charging for roaming scenario of MBMS in EPS will not be
considered.
For GPRS, in order to permit the settlement of inter-operator roaming charges
, the SGSN needs to raise CDRs. The information that needs to be included on
these CDRs is FFS.
# 11 Roaming Support for MBMS user services
## 11.1 Scenarios description
There are three specific scenarios to provide MBMS user services to roaming
users.
One uses a GGSN in the HPLMN, the other two are enabled by use of the Mz
interface and are further described below:
\- A visited PLMN may offer to roaming users MBMS user services from their
home PLMN. For this case, the PDP connection, which will be used for the JOIN
step, may always be from the UE to the V‑GGSN due to operator policy or
routing optimization, then the authorization is done in the BM-SC in visited
PLMN with the authorization information retrieved from the BM-SC in home PLMN.
Then the MBMS user traffic is provided by the BM-SC in home PLMN and proxied.
An APN indicating a GGSN will be included in the authorisation information
sent from home BM-SC to visited BM-SC. Whether GGSN of home or visited PLMN
would be used is based on the operator policy, or agreement between PLMNs, for
example, the visited BM-SC may modify the APN from the home BM-SC according to
configuration of operator policy.
\- Or, a visited PLMN may offer its own MBMS user services to roaming users
when visited and home PLMN support the same classes of MBMS user services. For
this case, the authorization is done in the BM-SC in visited PLMN with the
authorization information retrieved from the BM-SC in home PLMN. Then the MBMS
user traffic is provided by the BM-SC in visited PLMN.
Editors\' note: It is FFS how to deal with the services in the BM-SC in
visited network which are not the same service class as supported by the BM-SC
in home network.
The usage of any of the scenarios and the offered MBMS user services are
subject to the roaming agreement between visited and home PLMN operators.
## 11.2 Scenario signalling flow
### 11.2.1 APN selection
When a UE is authorized through the BM-SC in the visited PLMN (by proxying the
authorization signalling), an APN may be selected and decided by the BM-SC in
the home PLMN or the BM-SC in the visit PLMN depending on the operator policy
or agreement between PLMNs. See step 4 of the figure 18.
Figure 18: MBMS route optimization for HPLMN provided MBMS services
Figure 18 is an extension of MBMS multicast service activation procedure
described in clause 8.2, the only revise is that an authorization step (step
4) is added according to clause 11.1.
4\. The BM-SC in visited PLMN finds the BM-SC in home PLMN which will serve
the UE based on the multicast IP address, and identity of the user, and sends
the authorization request to it. The BM-SC in home PLMN can respond with an
APN, which indicates a GGSN in home PLMN which will serve the UE for the
specific MBMS service. The BM-SC in the visit network may modify the APN based
on the operator policy or agreement between PLMNs.
###### ## Annex A (Informative): Void
###### ## Annex B (Informative): Void
###### ## Annex C (normative): TV services delivery using unicast mode &
switching between broadcast & unicast modes for E-UTRAN
To enable TV services delivery using unicast mode of transport, the applicable
functions need to be enabled in the operator\'s network:
UE:
Able to support TV services as required including:
\- For Unicast support, there needs to be additional PDN connection via
dedicated APN for TV services delivery.
NOTE: It can require explicit connection towards TV Content Provider for
Unicast reachability information (e.g. IP addresses, ports, etc.). UE should
be configured with appropriate APN to facilitate easy access to TV services
via unicast.
\- Ability to support Consumption Reporting and MooD feature for enabling
switching between broadcast and unicast operation on demand, if required.
Content Provider/Packet Streaming Server needs to provide the required
functions for MBMS Broadcast services as defined in this specification. The
operator needs to enable access to the transport and MBMS user services
towards TV content providers, if required, as described in clause 7.5.
MME: If APN is configured in the HSS for enabling unicast delivery for TV
services for the user, then MME checks when UE provides an APN and verifies
that the user has subscription for that APN against the HSS provided APN,
using existing procedures.
HSS: Shall be configured well known dedicated APN in the user\'s subscription
for Unicast TV services support when dedicated PDN connectivity for TV
services is required.
The main deployment options for TV services are, but not limited to :
**Deployment Option 1:**
Joint broadcast + unicast TV service through BM-SC and PDN GW via SGi.
**Scenario A:**
The Content Provider has a Service Level Agreement with an operator. The
dedicated TV service includes a TV Service subscription associated with the
operator subscription, which allows tuning to TV unicast and MBMS broadcast
for transport.
In case popularity based switching according to MBMS operations on Demand
(MooD, TS 26.346 [7]) is supported, then:
\- The operator monitors the TV service consumption per channel in areas and
decide to use unicast or MBMS broadcast usage.
According to the agreement between the Content Provider and the operator, the
operator may provide usage information to the Content Provider.
**Scenario B :**
This Scenario enables the realization for multi-purpose devices, where the
managing operator provides all functionality.
In case popularity based switching according to MBMS operations on Demand
(MOOD, TS 26.346 [7]) is supported, then:
\- The operator monitors the TV service consumption per channel in areas and
decide to use unicast or MBMS broadcast transport.
According to the agreement between the Content Provider & the operator, the
operator may provide usage information to the Content Provider.
**Deployment option 2:**
Separate direct broadcast service through BM-SC and direct unicast service via
SGi through PDN GW.
For Unicast TV transport, the Content Provider uses regular unicast data
connectivity. For MBMS broadcast, the Content Provider provides the content of
the TV channel via user plane.
In case popularity based switching according to MBMS operations on Demand
(MooD, TS 26.346 [7]) is supported, then:
\- The Content Provider monitors the popularity of the TV service over
Unicast, for each operator individually.
\- When unicast TV service usage of a channel is high in a certain area, the
Content Provider interacts with operator in order to activate MBMS Broadcast
in the identified area.
In order to monitor popularity in the MBMS Broadcast Areas, the operator can
expose popularity information (derived from HTTP Consumption Reporting, TS
26.346 [7]) to the Content Provider via dedicated provisioning interface (see
TS 26.348 [31]).
###### ## Annex D (normative): Shared MBMS Network over E-UTRAN
# D.1 General
A Shared MBMS network (SMN) consists of network elements shared by multiple
PLMNs to offer MBMS service over E-UTRAN. The shared network elements are at
least a shared BM-SC and shared MBMS‑GW. Shared MBMS Network has MBMS
synchronization area (MBSFN area) defined within each PLMN.
The SMN has the following properties:
\- The BM-SC and MBMS‑GW are shared among participating PLMNs.
\- The SMN provides the entry point of the data stream.
\- The BM-SC can provide full service layer functionality or act only in
transparent mode for the case of MBMS as transport only.
\- An MBMS service area may span across RAN nodes from different participating
PLMNs.
\- RAN nodes (eNBs/MCEs) dedicated to MBMS bearer service may be deployed, in
which case these nodes are part of the SMN. This deployment requires a shared
MME function.
# D.2 Architecture
## D.2.1 Architecture for per PLMN MBSFN synchronization area
Figure D.2.1-1 shows and example network architecture for Shared MBMS Network
with MBMS synchronization area defined within each PLMN. The example shows two
PLMNs (PLMN 1 and PLMN2) providing shared MBMS service. In the example, F3 is
shared spectrum used by all involved PLMN for MBMS service.
Figure D.2.1-1: Shared MBMS Network architecture with per-PLMN MBMS
synchronization area
The SMN contains the following network elements:
\- Shared BM-SC (denoted BM-SC(SMN) in Figure D.2.1-1):
\- Provides all the functionality defined in clause 5.1 for EPC.
\- Shared MBMS-GW (denoted MBMS-GW(SMN) in Figure D.2.1-1)
\- Provides all the functionality defined in clause 5.9.1.
\- In addition:
\- It connects to MMEs from one or multiple PLMNs via the inter-PLMN Sm-s
reference point for control plane signalling.
\- It connects to E-UTRAN nodes from one or multiple PLMNs via the inter-PLMN
M1-s reference point for IP multicast distribution.
The SMN may also contain shared E-UTRAN functionality for the purpose of MBMS
service only. In that case the SMN also contains the following network
entities:
\- Shared E-UTRAN - eNB, MCE (denoted RAN(SMN) in Figure D.2.1-1)
\- Provides functionality as defined in clause 5.9.1.
\- Shared MME MBMS function (denoted MME(SMN)):
\- The shared MME MBMS control function provides the functionality defined in
clause 5.9.2.
NOTE: The shared MME MBMS control function provides only a subset of the
functionality of a regular MME as defined in TS 23.401 [16], dedicated only to
providing control plane functionality related to MBMS service.
## D.2.2 Reference Points
The following reference points are defined for Shared MBMS Network:
\- All internal reference points within the SMN leverage existing reference
points M1, M2, M3, Sm, SGmb, SGi-mb.
\- All internal reference points within each PLMN existing reference points
M2, M3
\- M1-s:
\- Inter-PLMN reference point between the Shared MBMS‑GW and the E-UTRAN node
from a participating PLMN.
\- Provides equivalent functionality to M1.
\- Sm-s:
\- Inter-PLMN reference point between the Shared MBMS‑GW and MME from a
participating PLMN.
\- Provides equivalent functionality to Sm.
## D.2.3 UE Aspects
Different scenarios can be supported from the perspective of the UE. The
following is a non-exhaustive list of possible scenarios:
UE Scenario 1: The UE receives both unicast and broadcast service from same
PLMN. The UE follows the same functionality as defined in clause 5.2.
UE Scenario 2: The UE receives broadcast MBMS service without PLMN
subscription over E-UTRAN without the need to access and register with the
PLMN offering the MBMS service. The UE acts in Receive Only mode as defined in
Annex E.
UE Scenario 3: The UE receives unicast service from one serving PLMN\'s (e.g.
the PLMN for which it has unicast subscription), and receive MBMS service
through a different PLMN. The UE acts in Receive Only mode with independent
unicast as defined in Annex E.
## D.2.4 TMGI for shared MBMS networks
AS described in TS 23.003 [13], the TMGI is composed by an MBMS Service ID and
a PLMN ID (MCC/MNC).
There construction of the PLMN ID field in the TMGI is deployment dependent.
The following are example deployment options:
\- Example Deployment Option 1: Shared PLMN ID
\- A Shared PLMN ID is used for the shared MBMS service. The shared PLMN ID is
broadcasted in the cells broadcasting the shared MBMS service content.
\- Example Deployment Option 2: Internal PLMN ID in the Shared MBMS network
\- The Shared MBMS network (i.e. BMSC) uses the \"Internal\" PLMN ID to
generate the TMGI. MBMS-GW uses the PLMN ID from the incoming SGmb interface
towards the rest of the network entities in the MBMS path. eNB announces a
MBMS session TMGI whose PLMN ID is not in the SIB1 PLMN ID list. The
\"Internal\" PLMN ID is not used for any other PLMN services.
###### ## Annex E (normative): UE behaviour in Receive Only Mode
A UE configured as Receive Only Mode can receive only MBMS broadcast service
over E-UTRAN without the need to access and register with the PLMN offering
the MBMS service. A UE configured to operate in Receive Only Mode shall shall
camp on a network cell in an eMBMS Broadcast carrier, shall attempt to receive
MBMS service based only on a standardised TMGI value range for Receive Only
Mode. The UE shall not attempt to receive MBMS service for TMGIs outside the
standardized TMGI range. The UE shall refrain from any Mobility Management or
other signalling with the network offering MBMS. The UE uses the acquired
system information to receive MBMS broadcast. Use of Receive Only Mode does
not require USIM for the UE.
A UE may be configured as Receive Only Mode with independent unicast using EPS
bearer contexts. This configuration option allows a UE to operate as Receive
Only Mode (as defined above) for MBMS broadcast service, and independently
follows regular NAS/RRC procedures for unicast service with a PLMN. This mode
of operation requires USIM and PLMN subscription to receive unicast service.
No additional subscription or credentials are required to receive MBMS
broadcast service.
Any device that is equipped with MBMS broadcast receiver and is configured to
operate in Receive Only Mode is able to receive the broadcast content, with
the following characteristics:
\- No PLMN credentials/subscription are required, as long as use of EPS
unicast bearers is not required by the device.
\- Without PLMN credentials/subscription, the UE can only access broadcast
services without subscription. The content can be Free To Air (FTA) content as
defined in TS 22.101 [30] in which case it can be viewed without content
subscription.
\- There is no need for the UE to support uplink.
NOTE: It is possible though that there is content protection handled at
application layer. In that case security is provided at application layer, and
keys, etc. are provisioned out of band. This provisioning is out of scope of
3GPP.
The UE is preconfigured with all the necessary information for the UE to
acquire the system information and receive MBMS service. This information
includes:
\- PLMN ID(s) that provide the MBMS service.
\- TMGI(s):
\- In the case of the network providing MBMS service in MBMS transport only
mode, the TMGI(s) for each MBMS service need to be configured in the UE.
\- The UE may be configured to receive TMGI(s) via Service Announcement (see
clauses 4.4.3.1, 5.1.4 and 6.4).
\- RAN specific information,
\- USD(s).
Figure E-1 shows the components of a UE in Receive Only Mode and in Receive
Only Mode with independent unicast.
Figure E-1: UE components in Receive Only Mode and Receive Only Mode with
independent unicast
The unicast component is active only in Receive Only Mode with independent
unicast. The unicast component follows regular NAS/RRC procedures for
E-UTRAN/EPC in order to receive unicast service.
For the broadcast component, the UE is configured with MBMS radio resources
for TV service with no PLMN subscription. The broadcast component of the UE
shall camp on a network cell in an eMBMS Broadcast carrier and shall attempt
