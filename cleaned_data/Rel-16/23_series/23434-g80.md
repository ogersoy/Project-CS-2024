# Introduction
This document specifies a functional architecture for service enabler
architecture layer (SEAL) over 3GPP networks to support vertical applications
(e.g. V2X applications). This functional architecture will include common
application plane and signalling plane entities. A set of common services
(e.g. group management, configuration management, location management)
specified in this document can be shared across vertical applications.
The SEAL functional architecture takes into consideration the common
capabilities to support mission critical and other vertical applications.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the functional architecture for service enabler
architecture layer (SEAL) and the procedures, information flows and APIs for
each service within SEAL in order to support vertical applications over the
3GPP system. The present document is applicable to vertical applications using
E-UTRAN or NR access based on the EPC or 5GS architecture defined in 3GPP TS
23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]. To ensure efficient use and deployment of
vertical applications over 3GPP systems this specification for SEAL services
includes the group management, configuration management, location management,
identity management, key management and network resource management.
NOTE: In the present document, the multicast services offered by SEAL are only
applicable for EPS.

# 6 Generic functional model for SEAL services
## 6.1 General
The functional model for SEAL is organized into generic SEAL service
functional model and specific SEAL service functional models. The generic SEAL
service functional model will be used as the reference model for the specific
SEAL service functional models.
The following SEAL services are supported towards the vertical application
layer:
\- Location management;
\- Group management;
\- Configuration management;
\- Identity management;
\- Key management; and
\- Network resource management.
The generic functional model for the SEAL is organized into generic functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the application
layer support aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and off-
network functional model is specified in this clause.
## 6.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 6.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for SEAL.
Figure 6.2-1: Generic on-network functional model
In the vertical application layer, the VAL client communicates with the VAL
server over VAL-UU reference point. VAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast
delivery modes.
NOTE 1: The VAL-UU reference point is out of scope of the present document.
The SEAL functional entities on the UE and the server are grouped into SEAL
client(s) and SEAL server(s) respectively. The SEAL consists of a common set
of services (e.g. group management, location management) and reference points.
The SEAL offers its services to the vertical application layer (VAL).
NOTE 2: The functionalities and reference points of the vertical application
layer are out of scope of the present document.
NOTE 3: The vertical application layer may further consist of vertical
application enabler layer functionalities (specified by 3GPP) and application
specific functionalities, which is out of scope of the present document.
The SEAL client(s) communicates with the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-UU
reference points. SEAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast delivery modes.
The SEAL client(s) provides the service enabler layer support functions to the
VAL client(s) over SEAL-C reference points. The VAL server(s) communicate with
the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-S reference points. The SEAL server(s) may
communicate with the underlying 3GPP network systems using the respective 3GPP
interfaces specified by the 3GPP network system.
Editor\'s Note: SEAL-UU support for multicast delivery is FFS.
The specific SEAL client(s) and the SEAL server(s) along with their specific
SEAL-UU reference points and the specific network interfaces of 3GPP network
system used are described in the respective on-network functional model for
each SEAL service.

Figure 6.3-1: Generic off-network functional model
In the vertical application layer, the VAL client of UE1 communicates with VAL
client of UE2 over VAL-PC5 reference point. A SEAL client of UE1 interacts
with the corresponding SEAL client of UE2 over SEAL-PC5 reference points. The
UE1, if connected to the network via Uu reference point, can also act as a UE-
to-network relay, to enable UE2 to access the VAL server(s) over the VAL-UU
reference point.
NOTE: The VAL-PC5 reference point is out of scope of the present document.
Editor\'s Note: The functionalities of reference points between the SEAL
clients of two UEs over SEAL-PC5 reference point is FFS.
The specific SEAL client(s) along with their specific SEAL-PC5 reference
points are described in the respective off‑network functional model for each
SEAL service.

### 6.4.3 Signalling control plane
#### 6.4.3.1 SIP entities
##### 6.4.3.1.1 Signalling user agent
This functional entity acts as the SIP user agent (both client and server) for
all SIP transactions.
##### 6.4.3.1.2 SIP AS
The SIP AS functional entity supports the following functions on behalf of the
VAL service:
\- influencing and impacting the SIP session; and
\- supporting event subscription and event notification.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the Application Server as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [14].
##### 6.4.3.1.3 SIP core
###### 6.4.3.1.3.1 General
The SIP core contains a number of sub-entities responsible for registration,
service selection and routing in the signalling control plane.
The SIP core shall be either:
1\. compliant with 3GPP TS 23.228 [15], i.e. the SIP core is a 3GPP IP
multimedia core network subsystem; or
2\. a SIP core, which internally need not comply with the architecture of 3GPP
TS 23.228 [15], but with the reference points that are defined in subclause
6.5.3 (if exposed), compliant to the reference points defined in 3GPP TS
23.002 [14].
The data related to the functions of the SIP core, e.g. for data for
application service selection, the identity of the serving registrar or
authentication related information may be provided by the PLMN operator
responsible for the bearer plane. In this case, the SIP database that is the
source of the data may be part of the HSS. Alternatively, this data may be
provided by the VAL service provider. In this case, the source of the data may
be the VAL service provider\'s SIP database.
###### 6.4.3.1.3.2 Local inbound / outbound proxy
The local inbound / outbound proxy functional entity acts as both an inbound
proxy and an outbound proxy for all SIP transactions. This functional entity
can provide the following functions:
\- NAT traversal;
\- Resource control;
\- Route/forward requests and responses to the user agents;
\- SIP signalling security; and
\- Depending on the PLMN operator policy, discovery and address resolution,
including E.164 numbers.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this functional entity is provided by the P-CSCF
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
###### 6.4.3.1.3.3 Registrar finder
The registrar finder functional entity is responsible for:
a) Identifying the serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity. The serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity is identified using information provided either by the PLMN
operator\'s own SIP database or the VAL service provider\'s SIP database, and
optionally using the PLMN operator\'s internal information e.g. network
topology, registrar availability.
1) Registrar finder and registrar in the VAL service provider domain:
registrar finder in the VAL service provider\'s domain uses the information
from the VAL service provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving
registrar in the VAL service provider domain.
2) Registrar finder and registrar in the PLMN operator domain: registrar
finder uses information from PLMN operator\'s SIP database to identify the
serving registrar in the PLMN operator domain.
3) Registrar finder in PLMN operator domain and registrar in VAL service
provider domain: registrar finder uses information from the VAL service
provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the VAL service
provider domain.
NOTE 1: The need for the registrar finder is deployment specific e.g. a
deployment that has only one registrar does not need the registrar finder and
the related SIP database information.
b) Providing discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers.
NOTE 2: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the I-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
###### 6.4.3.1.3.4 Registrar / application service selection
The registrar / application service selection functional entity provides the
following functions:
\- Registrar function (with integral provision of a location server) and also
acts as an inbound proxy (with access to the integral location server), and
outbound proxy for all SIP transactions where application service selection is
required. It registers the user and maintains the association of the location
and identity of the user in a location service. It provides notifications of
the registration states.
\- Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling. Both
the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are
supported by access either to the public network\'s own SIP database or the
VAL service provider\'s SIP database.
\- Can provide the application service selection for all SIP transactions,
possibly based on application service selection information stored by either
the public network\'s own SIP database or the VAL service provider\'s SIP
database.
\- Performs SIP signalling security.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the S-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
##### 6.4.3.1.4 Diameter proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy agent for Diameter messaging as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24].
The Diameter proxy, when used on the AAA-2 interface, is collocated with the
migration management server.
Other instances of the Diameter proxy may also be present in the SIP core /
IMS.
NOTE: The number of instances of the Diameter proxy is deployment specific.
#### 6.4.3.2 SIP database
##### 6.4.3.2.1 General
The SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and
corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP
core, and such information as application service selection.
In deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this
database is provided by the HSS.
In deployment scenarios where the VAL service provider provides the SIP core,
the SIP database may be provided by the VAL service provider.
Access to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core
entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are
stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only
when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.
NOTE: The SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder
since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be
different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.
The SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related
information:
\- signalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;
\- signalling plane security information: SIP core access control information
for authentication and authorization;
\- VAL UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information,
etc.; and
\- signalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).
The SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for
mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the
call control and session management entities of the SIP core.
The SIP database consists of the following functionalities:
\- support for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and
Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core
services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to
access the SIP core; and
\- authentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the
VAL UE.
##### 6.4.3.2.2 SIP database logical functions
The SIP database provides the following logical functions:
a) mobility management;
\- provides the UE mobility through the SIP core.
b) registrar assignment support;
\- provides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for VAL services
based on VAL service provider requirements on a per-user basis, (e.g. whether
a particular registrar within the PLMN operator\'s network (e.g. a registrar
reserved for VAL service use or a registrar in a secure location) or a
registrar within the VAL service provider network is assigned.
c) call and/or session establishment support;
\- provides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core.
For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently
hosts the user.
d) user security information generation;
\- provides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data
for the SIP core.
e) signalling plane security support;
\- provides authentication procedures to access VAL services by storing the
generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling
plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.
f) user identification handling;
\- provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public
identities.

# 7 Identities
## 7.1 User identity (User ID)
The VAL user presents the user identity to the identity management server
during a user authentication transaction, to provide the identity management
client a means for VAL service authentication. In general, since identity
management is a common SEAL service, it uses a set of credentials (e.g.
biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a
single VAL service. The user credentials uniquely identifies the VAL user to
the identity management server.
NOTE: The specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to
use the user ID is specified in 3GPP TS 33.434 [29].
Editor\'s note: The naming and definition of the identities in subclause 7 may
require further study (e.g. renaming user identity to VAL user identity, and
renaming VAL user identity to VAL service user identity).
## 7.2 VAL user identity (VAL user ID)
The VAL user ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
the VAL user. For example, the VAL user ID may be a URI. The VAL user ID is
used for authentication and authorization purposes for providing the VAL
service towards the VAL user via the VAL UE. The VAL user ID also indicates
the VAL service provider with whom the VAL user has a VAL service agreement.
The VAL user may have VAL service agreement with several VAL service providers
and thus will have obtained unique VAL user ID per VAL service provider. The
VAL user ID can be used to access any SEAL service.
## 7.3 VAL UE identity (VAL UE ID)
The VAL UE ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
the VAL UE. For example, the VAL UE ID for V2X service is mapped to the
StationID as specified in ETSI TS 102 894-2 [25]. The VAL UE ID is used to
address the VAL UE in order to send VAL messages.
## 7.4 VAL service identity (VAL service ID)
The VAL service ID is a unique identifier that represents the VAL service. A
VAL server provides a list of VAL services towards the VAL users or VAL UE.
Each VAL service is uniquely identified by a VAL service ID, which is an
identifier of the VAL application providing that VAL service. The VAL service
ID can be used for policy mapping, QoS handling for VAL communication and VAL
message distribution. For example, an identifier of a V2X service, e.g. ITS-
AID or PSID specified in ETSI TS 102 965 [26] and ISO TS 17419 [27], can be
used as a V2X service ID.
## 7.5 VAL group identity (VAL group ID)
The VAL group ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
a set of VAL users or VAL UE according to the VAL service. The set of VAL
users may belong to the same or different VAL service providers. It indicates
the VAL application server where the group is defined.
## 7.6 VAL system identity (VAL system ID)
The VAL system ID is a globally unique identifier representing a VAL system.

### 9.3.3 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
#### 9.3.3.1 General
The location management server provides location reporting configuration to
the location management clients, indicating what information the location
management server expects and what events will trigger the sending of this
information to the location management server. The decision to report location
information can be triggered at the location management client by different
conditions, e.g., the reception of the location reporting configuration,
initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI
change, MBMS session change, leaving a specific MBMS bearer service area,
tracking area change, PLMN change, call initiation, or other types of events
such as emergency. The location report can include information described as
ECGI, MBMS SAIs, geographic coordinates and other location information.
#### 9.3.3.2 Fetching location reporting configuration
Figure 9.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching location reporting
configuration.
Pre-condition:
\- If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is activated
by the location management server.
\- The location management client is aware that the location reporting
configuration is available at the location management server.
Figure 9.3.3.2-1: Fetching location reporting configuration procedure
1\. The location management client sends location reporting configuration
request message to the location management server.
2\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
message to the location management client(s) containing the initial location
reporting event triggers configuration (or a subsequent update) , e.g. minimum
time between consecutive reports, SAI changes, or ECGI changes for reporting
the location of the VAL UE. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to
a specific location management client or as a group message over an MBMS
bearer to update the location reporting configuration for multiple location
management clients at the same time.
NOTE 1: The location reporting configuration information can be made part of
the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.
NOTE 2: Different location management clients may be given different location
reporting criteria.
3\. The location management client stores or updates the location reporting
event triggers configuration. A location reporting event occurs, triggering
step 3.
#### 9.3.3.3 Location reporting
Figure 9.3.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for location reporting.
Figure 9.3.3.3-1: Location reporting procedure
1\. The location management client sends a location information report to the
location management server, containing location information identified by the
location management server and available to the location management client.
2\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
### 9.3.4 On-demand location reporting procedure
The location management server can request UE location information at any time
by sending a location information request to the location management client,
which may trigger location management client to immediately send the location
report.
Figure 9.3.4-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure
1\. Based on configurations such as periodical location information timer, or
location information request from other entities (e.g., another location
management client, VAL server), location management server initiates the
immediately request location information from the location management client.
2\. The location management server sends a location information request to the
location management client.
3\. VAL user or VAL UE is notified and asked about the permission to share its
location. VAL user can accept or deny the request
4\. The location management client immediately responds to the location
management server with a report containing location information identified by
the location management server and available to the location management
client.
5\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
### 9.3.5 Client-triggered or VAL server-triggered location reporting
procedure
Figure 9.3.5-1 illustrates the high level procedure of client-triggered or VAL
server-triggered location reporting.
Figure 9.3.5-1: Client-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. Location management client 2 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL server
sends a location reporting trigger to the location management server to
activate a location reporting procedure for obtaining the location information
of location management client 1.
NOTE: Step 1 can be performed when Location management client 2 or VAL server
require to update the location reporting trigger.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 2 or
VAL server is authorized to send a location reporting trigger. Depending on
the information specified by the location reporting trigger, location
management server initiates an on-demand location reporting procedure or an
event-triggered location reporting procedure for the location of location
management client 1.
3\. Once the location information of the location management client 1 is
available in the location management server by the on-demand location
reporting procedure, a location information report is sent to the location
management client 2 or VAL server.
### 9.3.6 Location reporting triggers configuration cancel
Figure 9.3.6-1 illustrates the procedure used for cancelling the location
reporting triggers configuration at the target Location management client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The location management server has subscribed the location management
client 2 location with the location reporting event triggers.
2\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the location management server.
Figure 9.3.6-1: Location reporting triggers configuration cancel
1\. The location management client 1 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL
server sends a location reporting configuration cancel request to the location
management server (1a). The location management server sends the location
reporting configuration cancel request to the location management client 2 to
stop receiving the UE location information (1b). This message can be sent via
unicast or multicast.
NOTE: Step 1b can be initiated without step 1a.
2\. The location management client invalidates the location reporting triggers
configuration and no longer reports its location to the location management
server.
3\. The location management client 2 sends the location reporting
configuration cancel response to the location management server (3a) as an
acknowledgement. The location management server sends the location reporting
configuration cancel response to the location management client 1 (3b) as an
acknowledgement.
### 9.3.7 Location information subscription procedure
Figure 9.3.7-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information
subscription request. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to VAL user
or VAL UE location information.
Figure 9.3.7-1: Location information subscription request procedure
1\. VAL server sends a location information subscription request to the
location management server to subscribe location information of one or more
VAL users or VAL UEs.
2\. The location management server shall check if the VAL server is authorized
to initiate the location information subscription request.
3\. The location management server replies with a location information
subscription response indicating the subscription status.
### 9.3.8 Event-trigger location information notification procedure
Figure 9.3.8-1 illustrates the high level procedure of event-trigger usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of VAL user or VAL UE.
Figure 9.3.8-1: Event-trigger usage of location information procedure
1\. Based on the configurations, e.g., subscription, periodical location
information timer, location management server is triggered to report the
latest user location information to VAL server.
2\. The location management server sends the location information report
including the latest location information of one or more VAL users or VAL UEs
to the VAL server or to the location management client that has previously
configured. The latest location information is from the location report
procedure as described in subclause 9.3.3, or from PLMN operator.
3\. VAL server may further share this location information to a group or to
another VAL user or VAL UE.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 3 can be skipped if not needed.
### 9.3.9 On-demand usage of location information procedure
The VAL server can request UE location information at any time by sending a
location information request to the location management server, which may
trigger location management server to immediately send the location report.
Figure 9.3.9-1 illustrates the high level procedure of on demand usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of VAL user or VAL UE.
Figure 9.3.9-1: On-demand usage of location information procedure
1\. VAL server sends a location information request to the location management
server.
2\. The location management server acquires the latest location of the UEs
being requested, by triggering an on-demand location report procedure as
described in subclause 9.3.4, or from PLMN operator.
3\. Then, location management server immediately sends the location
information report including the latest location information acquired of one
or more VAL users or VAL UEs.
4\. VAL server may further share this location information to a group or to
another VAL user or VAL UE.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 3 can be skipped if not needed.

# 10 Group management
## 10.1 General
The group management is a SEAL service that offers the group management
related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 10.2 Functional model for group management
### 10.2.1 General
The functional model for the group management is based on the generic
functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the support for
group management aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and off-
network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 10.2.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 10.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for group
management.
Figure 10.2.2-1: On-network functional model for group management
The group management client communicates with the group management server over
the GM-UU reference point. The group management client provides the support
for group management functions to the VAL client(s) over GM‑C reference point.
The VAL server(s) communicate with the group management server over the GM-S
reference point.
### 10.2.3 Off-network functional model description
Figure 10.2.3-1 illustrates the off-network functional model for group
management.
Figure 10.2.3-1: Off-network functional model for group management
The group management client of the UE1 communicates with the group management
client of the UE2 over the GM‑PC5 reference point.
### 10.2.4 Functional entities description
#### 10.2.4.1 General
The functional entities for group management SEAL service are described in the
following subclauses.
#### 10.2.4.2 Group management client
The group management client functional entity acts as the application client
for management of groups. A VAL system maintains groups corresponding to one
or more vertical applications. The group management client interacts with the
group management server. The group management client also supports
interactions with the corresponding group management client between the two
UEs.
The group management client functional entity is supported by the signalling
user agent and HTTP client functional entities of the signalling control
plane.
#### 10.2.4.3 Group management server
The group management server functional entity provides for management of
groups supported within the vertical application layer. The group management
server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222
[8]. The group management server also supports interactions with the
corresponding group management server in distributed SEAL deployments.
The group management server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
All the group management clients supporting users belonging to a single group
are required to use the same group management server for that group. A group
management client supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have
relationships with multiple group management servers.
### 10.2.5 Reference points description
#### 10.2.5.1 General
The reference points for the functional model for group management are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 10.2.5.2 GM-UU
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management client and the group management server are supported by GM-UU
reference point. This reference point utilizes Uu reference point as described
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
GM-UU reference point is used for VAL service signalling for VAL service data
management of the VAL service. The GM-UU reference point supports:
\- Configuration of group related data at the group management client by the
group management server; and
\- Configuration of group related data at the group management server by the
group management client.
The GM-UU reference point uses the HTTP-1/HTTP-2 reference points for
transport and routing of group management related signalling. The GM-UU
reference point uses the SIP-1/SIP-2 reference points for
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 10.2.5.3 GM-PC5
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management clients located in different VAL UEs are supported by GM-PC5
reference point. This reference point utilizes PC5 reference point as
described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [12].
#### 10.2.5.4 GM-C
The interactions related to group management functions between the VAL
client(s) and the group management client within a VAL UE are supported by
GM-C reference point.
#### 10.2.5.5 GM-S
The interactions related to group management functions between the VAL
server(s) and the group management server are supported by GM-S reference
point. This reference point is an instance of CAPIF-2 reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
GM-S reference point supports the VAL server to obtain group information
corresponding to the VAL service. The GM-S reference point uses HTTP-1/HTTP-2
reference points for transport and routing of group management related
signalling. The GM-S reference point uses SIP-2 reference point for
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 10.2.5.6 GM-E
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management servers in a distributed deployment are supported by GM-E reference
point.
Editor\'s Note: The functions enabled over GM-E reference point is FFS.
## 10.3 Procedures and information flows for group management
### 10.3.1 General
Group management procedures apply to on-network VAL service only.
Group creation provides a dedicated VAL group to individual VAL users to
enable the required communication for one or multiple VAL services. This
includes the normal group creation by administrators or by authorized user/UE.
NOTE: If an authorized VAL user/UE wants to participate in a new group created
by the authorized VAL user/UE, then the authorized VAL user/UE needs to have
been included in the new group as a member.

### 14.3.3 Unicast resource management
#### 14.3.3.1 General
The following subclauses specify the procedures for unicast resource
management for vertical application layer. The NRM server sets up bearers and
may need to modify the bearers for an already established VAL service
communication.
Characteristics that may need to be modified include:
\- activation and deactivation of the bearer;
\- modification of the QoS characteristics of the bearer (e.g. bearer priority
adjustment); and
\- modification of GBR due to application requirement
NOTE: A VAL service communication can consist of both unicast and multicast
bearers which can all need modification due to the same event.
Vertical application layer specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by
functional entities in performing these procedures are specified in the
respective vertical application layer TS (e.g. for V2X application layer, see
3GPP TS 23.286 [7]).
Unicast resource management is supported with PCC interactions with SIP core
and PCC interactions with NRM server. The PCC procedures for EPS are specified
in 3GPP TS 23.203 [18] and the PCC procedures for 5GS are specified in 3GPP TS
23.503 [19].
#### 14.3.3.2 Unicast resource management with SIP core
##### 14.3.3.2.1 Request for unicast resources at VAL service communication
establishment
###### 14.3.3.2.1.1 General
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at VAL service communication establishment. If concurrent sessions
are used the NRM server may utilize the capability of resource sharing
specified for underlying network policy and charging functions. The request
for resources includes application type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.
###### 14.3.3.2.1.2 Procedure
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAL client has requested VAL service communication with the VAL server.
Figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1: Resource request at VAL service communication
establishment
1\. The VAL server sends request for resources to the NRM server.
2\. The NRM server evaluates the need for network resources and use of
resource sharing.
3\. The NRM server sends a session progress request containing request for
resources.
4\. PCC procedures are initiated from SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy.
5\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy sends a OK message to the NRM
server.
6\. The NRM server sends a resource response to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL service communication is established and resources have been
allocated.
##### 14.3.3.2.2 Request for modification of unicast resources
###### 14.3.3.2.2.1 General
To modify unicast bearers, the NRM server shall send a resource modification
request containing the parameters to be modified for the UE.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between VAL service communications; or
>
> \- Release and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the VAL service
> communications over multicast transmission
###### 14.3.3.2.2.2 Procedure
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.2.2.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast:

### 14.3.4 Multicast resource management for EPS
#### 14.3.4.1 General
The VAL server utilizes the NRM server for multicast resource management.
To activate the multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the
Activate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM
server performing the GCS AS function.
To deactivate the multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the
Deactivate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM
server performing the GCS AS function.
To modify multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the Modify
MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM server
performing the GCS AS function.
Editor\'s note: To support other modes of MBMS is FFS.
#### 14.3.4.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
##### 14.3.4.2.1 General
In this scenario, upon triggered by VAL server, the NRM server pre-establishes
MBMS bearer(s) in certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of the
VAL service group communication session. When a user originates a request for
a VAL service group communication session for one of these areas, the pre-
established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL VAL service communication.
The following steps need to be performed prior to the start of the VAL service
group communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:
\- Pre-establish MBMS bearer(s)
\- Announce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM clients
When these preparation steps have been done the VAL service group
communication session using MBMS bearer can start.
The vertical application level communications are sent on the MBMS bearer.
Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the application level
control messages, due to different bearer characteristic requirements.
##### 14.3.4.2.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 14.3.4.2.2-1 shows only one of the receiving VAL clients
using an MBMS bearer. There might also be VAL clients in the same VAL service
group communication session that receive the communication on unicast bearers.
Figure 14.3.4.2.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
1\. The VAL server sends a MBMS bearers request to the NRM server including
service description(s) for which the MBMS bearers are requested.
2a. The NRM server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation of the
MBMS bearer in EPS is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP
TS 23.468 [16]. This bearer will be used for the VAL service communication.
2b. Optionally, the NRM server may also activate an MBMS bearer dedicated for
application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS bearer is
done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is
implementation specific.
3a. The NRM server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service description
associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
3b. The NRM server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service description
associated with the application control MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
NOTE 2: Step 3a and step 3b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement
message.
4\. The NRM client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The NRM
service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the VAL UE. The NRM client
shares the MBMS bearer related information with the VAL client.
5\. The NRM client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to receive
VAL service communication over MBMS, whereby the NRM server may decide to use
the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for VAL service communication
sessions based on available information at the NRM server including the MBMS
listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5.
NOTE 3: Step 5 is optional for the VAL UE on subsequent MBMS bearer
announcements.
6\. The NRM server provides a MBMS bearers response to the VAL server.
7\. A VAL service group communication session is established.
8\. As the VAL server transmits the VAL service communication over the MBMS
bearer, the VAL service communication packets are detected and delivered to
the VAL client.
#### 14.3.4.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
##### 14.3.4.3.1 General
In this scenario, the VAL server uses a unicast bearer for communication with
the UE on the DL at the start of the group communication session. When the VAL
server triggers to use an MBMS bearer in EPS for the DL VAL service
communication, the NRM server decides to establish an MBMS bearer in EPS using
the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. The NRM server provides MBMS
service description information associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from
the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL VAL
service and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL VAL service
communication.
##### 14.3.4.3.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.3.2-1 illustrates the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment.
Figure 14.3.4.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. A VAL service group communication session is established.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The VAL server sends MBMS bearers request to the NRM server.
4\. The NRM server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the VAL service group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[16]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from
the BM-SC.
5\. The NRM server provides service description information associated with
the MBMS bearer to the UE. The VAL UE obtains the TMGI from the announcement
message. This message may be sent on an application level control signalling
bearer.
6\. The VAL UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI,
while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
7\. The VAL UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated
with the TMGI.
8\. The NRM client notifies the NRM server the MBMS listening status
associated to the monitored TMGI, (e.g. that it is successfully receiving the
TMGI). The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of the
TMGI. The NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast
bearer for VAL service communication sessions based on available information
at the NRM server including the MBMS listening status report as described in
clause 14.3.4.5.
9\. The NRM server provides an MBMS bearer response to the VAL server with the
dynamic MBMS bearer(s) information. The VAL server stops sending VAL service
communication data over unicast way to the VAL client.
NOTE: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make
an efficient decision to switch again to a unicast transmission or to take
measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that
the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an
insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).
10\. A VAL service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is
established.
11\. The VAL server sends the downlink VAL service communication for the VAL
service group communication session over the MBMS.
#### 14.3.4.4 MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer
##### 14.3.4.4.1 General
The MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer.
Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive
way of doing announcement. The NRM server will send the MBMS bearer
announcement message to the NRM client regardless if there is an MBMS bearer
active or the VAL client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer with
sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it gives a
secure way to inform the NRM client about the MBMS bearer and how to retrieve
the data on the MBMS bearer.
When there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for
VAL service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for
additional MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application
level control signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.
The MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting
compared to an MBMS bearer used for VAL service communication, since
application signalling messages are more sensitive to packet loss.
##### 14.3.4.4.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.4.2-1 illustrates a procedure that enables the NRM server to
announce a new MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An MBMS bearer used for VAL service application control messages must have
been pre-established and announced to the NRM client.
2\. Additional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the
NRM client.
Figure 14.3.4.4.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages
1\. The NRM client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for VAL service
application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.
2\. The NRM server activates a new MBMS bearer.
3\. The NRM server announces the MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The bearer may
have just been activated or may have already been running for some time. The
step may be repeated as needed.
4\. The NRM server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer used
for VAL application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement contains
the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally include
additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and optional
MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In this case
the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer details.
5\. The NRM client start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.
6\. If requested by the NRM server, the NRM client sends an acknowledgement of
the MBMS bearer to the NRM server.
7\. The NRM server de-announce the MBMS bearer.
8\. The NRM server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that contains
the identity of the MBMS bearer.
9\. The NRM client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.
The same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer
announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of
UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.
#### 14.3.4.5 MBMS bearer quality detection
##### 14.3.4.5.1 General
The NRM client and NRM server use this procedure to report and take action on
the MBMS bearer quality towards VAL service communications. A NRM client
monitors an MBMS bearer to enable receiving VAL service communication. Based
on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality),
the NRM client needs to inform the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to
receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient
quality or not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS
bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality,
the NRM client may notify the NRM server at which MBMS reception quality level
it has received the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer.
The issue can be more complex since the NRM client needs to estimate the
quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently
transmitted on the MBMS bearer. The reason for this is that an NRM client that
has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even
notice that a VAL service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the NRM server
still assumes that the VAL UE can receive the VAL service communication being
broadcasted.
To estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block
Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation
can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and
measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g.
RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.
Based on the MBMS bearer quality reported from the NRM clients, the NRM server
may decide to use the MBMS bearer for a group communication if a certain
number of NRM clients located in the MBMS service area are able to receive the
VAL service communication. And if a NRM client is not able to receive the VAL
service communication on the MBMS bearer, the NRM server may decide to switch
the user plane deliver mode for the NRM client from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer.
##### 14.3.4.5.2 Procedure
The NRM client shall indicate the ability of the NRM client to receive the
MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is
announced to the NRM client
2\. The NRM client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area
3\. The VAL UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the
modulation and coding scheme
4\. The VAL UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN
transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals
Figure 14.3.4.5.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection
1\. The NRM client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be reported
to the NRM server. The NRM client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by
using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality
estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding
scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected
MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the NRM
server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The NRM client may also
map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The
MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality
level the VAL service communication has been received.
Editor\'s note: The set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of
the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.
NOTE 1: When MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to
be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be
used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received
quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the NRM client
sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define the
MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been
acceptable or not to receive a specific VAL service communication. If the MBMS
bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the NRM
client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception
quality level. Based on the MBMS listening status, if MBMS reception quality
level is received, then the NRM server may efficiently decide to switch to
another bearer (e.g., MBMS bearer or unicast bearer) or to take measures to
prepare such a switch and further notify the VAL server.
NOTE 2: Prior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial
to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS
bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer
of the communication to unicast.
NOTE 3: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on VAL
service type (i.e. V2X, MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The
metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this
specification.
3\. The NRM server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g.
information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS
bearer announcement message.
4\. The NRM server may send user plane delivery mode to VAL server based on
the MBMS listening status to preserve the service continuity as described in
clause 14.3.4.6 and clause 14.3.4.9.
#### 14.3.4.6 Service continuity in MBMS scenarios
##### 14.3.4.6.1 General
This subclause specifies service continuity scenarios when MBMS bearers are
used. There are different solutions for different scenarios.
##### 14.3.4.6.2 Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the
scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a
larger area. In VAL communications several VAL service communication streams
may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one VAL service
communication stream may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving
users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. A VAL UE that is
interested in receiving a VAL service communication stream that is broadcasted
in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service
continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated
(TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN
areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially
overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1
and MBSFN area 2.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-2 illustrates the procedure:
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
1\. The VAL UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional
MBMS bearers that the NRM client is interested in are active in the current
cell.
2a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully
receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 1. The NRM client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.
2b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
NOTE: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make
an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer,
or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level
indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).
3\. The VAL UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are
active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast
the same service on both TMGIs.
4\. The NRM client sends a location information report to the NRM server. For
that, the UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block
(SIB) transmitted by the radio cells.
5\. The NRM server sends to the NRM client a MBMS bearer announcement with
information related to TMGI 2 (if the NRM server had not done it before).
Hence, the NRM client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same VAL service
communication.
6a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that it is successfully receiving
TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality
level per TMGI.
6b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL UE may receive the VAL service communication over both MBMS
bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The VAL UE may also verify that it is the
same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to
perform error corrections.
8\. The VAL UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is
active.
9a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully
receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 2. The NRM client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.
9b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
10\. The VAL UE receives the VAL service communication only over TMGI 2.
This service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may
occur if the VAL UE would request to transfer the VAL service communication
stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a
multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still
required that the NRM client sends a location report (and MBMS listening
report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the
MBMS listening report by the NRM client to the NRM server a unicast bearer is
needed. The location report from the NRM client is required, since the NRM
server must know that the VAL UE has entered a new area and can only listen to
MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the VAL server might send
a VAL service communication stream that the VAL UE is required to listen to on
the MBMS bearer 1, since the NRM server still assumes that the VAL:UE is
located in the MBSFN area 1.
The solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 14.3.4.6.2-3. In this
case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS
bearers are used only for VAL service communication. An application level
signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is
used for application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS
bearer TMGI 9. By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9)
the VAL UEs can receive application control messages for all VAL service
communication going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A VAL UE that
is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a VAL service group
transmission (e.g. V2X) only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information
received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that
specific VAL service communication over a unicast instead. Without the
information received over TMGI 9 the NRM client must immediately report that
the VAL UE has left the broadcast area that the NRM server assumes that the
VAL UE is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for
the NRM client to inform the NRM server of a location change.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a
separate application signalling bearer
The procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in
this subclause. However, in this scenario the NRM client is not required to
initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report).
The VAL UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without
the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there
is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area
(i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all
application control messages for all VAL service communications ongoing in
both areas. If the VAL UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that
does not transmit the VAL service communication of interest the VAL UE can
report to the NRM server that it is not able to listen to the VAL service
communication over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the NRM server to switch to
a unicast bearer instead.
#### 14.3.4.7 MBMS suspension notification
##### 14.3.4.7.1 General
In this procedure the NRM client is requested by the NRM server to send a MBMS
suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can be included in
the MBMS bearer announcement and the NRM server may choose to only send this
request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all NRM clients.
##### 14.3.4.7.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.7.2.-1 illustrates a procedure in which the NRM client notifies
the NRM server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.
The NRM server can decide on a subset of all VAL UEs in the MBMS broadcast
area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the NRM server makes
the decision of the VAL UE subset, consideration shall be taken to the
location of the VAL UEs, since VAL UEs\' location is dynamically changed. This
means that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be updated
regularly based on the VAL UEs mobility.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer
Figure 14.3.4.7.2-1: MBMS suspension notification
1\. The NRM server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to the NRM
client.
NOTE: This message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and
may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.
2\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].
3\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling
Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].
4\. The NRM client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS suspension
report.
5\. Based on the MBMS suspsension report received, the NRM server determines
whether to switch to a new bearer (unicast or MBMS). If NRM server determines
to switch to unicast bearer, then the NRM server sends the user plane delivery
mode message to VAL server , and the VAL server sends the downlink data over
the new bearer.
The NRM client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report shall
still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). A NRM client
shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS listening
reports).
The same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that
may be detected by the NRM client.
#### 14.3.4.8 MBMS bearer event notification
##### 14.3.4.8.1 General
The NRM server is an instantiation of a GCS AS. For the NRM server to know the
status of the MBMS bearer, and thus know the networks ability to deliver the
VAL service, it is required that the network provides MBMS bearer event
notifications to the NRM server. The different events notified to the NRM
server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell
successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells
fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status
of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios.
Editor\'s note: The procedure defined in this sub clause requires an
enhancement to GCSE and RAN and is therefore subject to implementation in EPC
and RAN.
##### 14.3.4.8.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 14.3.4.8.2-1 shows notification information flows from
NRM server to BM-SC.
Figure 14.3.4.8.2-1: MBMS bearer event notification
1\. The NRM server activates an MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer
is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
2\. The BMSC will respond to the activation with an Activate MBMS bearer
response message, according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
3\. The EPC and RAN will initiate the MBMS session start procedure according
to 3GPP TS 23.246 [17]. This procedure is outside the scope of this
specification.
4a. At the first indication of a successful MBMS session start procedure, the
BM-SC sends a MBMS bearer event notification, indicating that the MBMS bearer
is ready to use.
4b. The NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
5\. The VAL server starts to use the MBMS bearer according to the MBMS
procedures in this specification.
6\. An event from RAN related to the MBMS session is received by the BM-SC.
7a. The BM-SC notifies the NRM server of certain MBMS related events including
references to affected MBMS services areas or list of cells. Example of such
events may be radio resources not available, overload, MBMS suspension.
7b. The NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
8\. The NRM server may decide, based on the received events, to switch to
unicast transmission for relevant VAL UEs.
NOTE: Steps 6-8 should be seen as example events from the network that may
occur and possible actions taken by the NRM server. These steps may be done at
any time and repeatedly during the life time of an MBMS bearer.
#### 14.3.4.9 Switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer
##### 14.3.4.9.1 General
The NRM server monitors the bearers used for VAL service communications and
decides to switch between MBMS and unicast bearers.
##### 14.3.4.9.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.9.2-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is
about to move out of MBMS coverage or getting into good MBMS coverage by
switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that a bearer (unicast or MBMS) has been activated by the VAL
server for downlink delivery.
Figure 14.3.4.9.2-1: Switching between MBMS delivery and unicast delivery
1\. The VAL UE detects changing MBMS bearer condition (good or bad MBMS
coverage) for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is
implementation specific.
2\. The NRM client notifies the NRM server about the MBMS bearer condition for
the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS listening status report.
NOTE 1: To efficiently notify the NRM server, e.g., when the NRM client
detects that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services, the
NRM client proactively may send to the NRM server a MBMS listening status
report including the MBMS reception quality level.
3\. The NRM server makes the decision to switch between MBMS delivery and
unicast delivery based on available information at the NRM server including
the MBMS listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5. The NRM
server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
4\. The VAL server sends the downlink data over the new bearer (unicast or
MBMS) to the VAL client as per step 3.
NOTE 2: The new bearer (unicast or MBMS) may be set up on demand after step 3
or before.
5\. During the switching, the VAL client simultaneously receives downlink data
through both bearers (unicast bearer and MBMS bearer). If there is no downlink
data to the VAL client, this step can be skipped.
6\. The VAL client ceases to receive the downlink data through previous bearer
but continues receiving data through new bearer.

# 15 Service-based interface representation of the functional model for SEAL
services
## 15.1 General
The functional models for SEAL services is represented using functional
entities and reference points between the functional entities as specified in
subclause 6. The vertical applications consume the SEAL services in the form
of APIs. Each SEAL service offers these APIs on a service-based interface to
all its consumer entities.
## 15.2 Functional model representation

interactions with SEAL are governed based on the reference point interactions
of the functional models specified in subclause 6. VAL function represents the
functionalities of the VAL server.
