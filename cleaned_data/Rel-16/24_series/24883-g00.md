incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the protocol details for connecting MCPTT
systems to Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems according to the architectural
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80].
The functional entity that provides connection of MCPTT systems to LMR systems
over the external interface is the IWF. The IWF is expected to behave as a
peer MCPTT system, as further detailed in clause 5 of the present document.
The internal function of the IWF is out of scope of 3GPP.
NOTE: The present document will no longer be updated after its approval by
plenary. All updates are being done directly to the corresponding technical
specifications.

# 5 Functional entities
## 5.1 General
An IWF can perform the controlling role for group calls and private calls as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80].
An IWF can perform the participating role for group calls and private calls,
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80].
An IWF can perform a non-controlling role for temporary group calls involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems as specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80].
An IWF performing the participating role can serve an originating LMR user.
How the IWF serves LMR users is out of scope of 3GPP.
An IWF performing the participating role can serve a terminating LMR user. How
the IWF serves LMR users is out of scope of 3GPP.
The same IWF can perform the participating role and controlling role for the
same group session.
The same IWF can perform the participating role and non-controlling role for
the same group session.
When referring to the procedures in the present document for the IWF acting in
a participating role, the term, \"participating IWF\" is used.
When referring to the procedures in the present document for the IWF acting in
a controlling role, the term \"controlling IWF\" is used.
When referring to the procedures in the present document for the IWF acting in
a non-controlling role for a group call, the term \"non-controlling IWF of an
MCPTT group\" is used.
To be compliant with the procedures in the present document, an IWF shall:
\- support the IWF procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80];
\- generate SDP offer and SDP answer in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] and
subclause 6.3 of 3GPP TS 24.379 [81];
\- implement the role of a centralised floor control server and implement the
on-network procedures for floor control as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5];
\- for registration and service authorisation, IWF procedures are out of scope
of the present document;
\- for affiliation of users hosted in the MCPTT system, implement the
procedures specified in the present document; for LMR users, the affiliation
process is out of scope of the present document;
\- for group call functionality (including broadcast, emergency and imminent
peril), implement the procedures specified in the present document; and
\- for private call functionality (including emergency), implement the
procedures specified in the present document.
To be compliant with the procedures in the present document requiring the
distribution of private call keying material between MCPTT clients as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78], an IWF shall behave as an encryption
endpoint on behalf of its LMR users.
NOTE: A scenario with the IWF acting as an encryption endpoint is not end to
end encryption. End to end encryption with LMR users is out of scope of the
present document, but some tools are provided to allow end to end encryption
to be defined outside of 3GPP.
To be compliant with the procedures for confidentiality protection of XML
elements in the present document, the IWF shall implement the procedures
specified in subclause 6.6.2 of 3GPP TS 24.379 [81].
To be compliant with the procedures for integrity protection of XML MIME
bodies in the present document, the IWF shall implement the procedures
specified in subclause 6.6.3 of 3GPP TS 24.379 [81].
## 5.2 Functional connectivity models

# 104 General
## 104.4 Warning Header Field
### 104.4.1 General
An IWF can include a free text string in a SIP response to a SIP request. When
the IWF includes a text string in a response to a SIP INVITE request the text
string is included in a Warning header field as specified in IETF RFC 3261
[24]. The IWF includes the Warning code set to 399 (miscellaneous warning) and
includes the host name set to the host name of the IWF.
### 104.4.2 Warning texts
Existing warning texts a specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] will be used.
### 104.6.0 General
Subclauses 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3 and 4.6.4 in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] describe the
aspects and states that are key in managing priority calls and alerts.
The IWF manages the states on behalf of its homed users. For states that are
managed by clients, the IWF manages an instance of the state for each client
for each user homed in the IWF.
### 104.7.1A Media security at the IWF
With respect to LMR interworking, the IWF provides the interfaces as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80] and 3GPP TS 33.180 [78] to key management and group
management capabilities of the LMR system.
## 104.12 Broadcast group calls
A broadcast group call is a group call where the initiating user expects no
response from the other users, so that when the user\'s transmission is
complete, so is the call.
## 104.13 MCPTT-LMR interworking overview
To support interworking with existing Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems, an
Interworking Function (IWF) has been defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] and 3GPP TS
23.283 [80]. The IWF provides the set of functions and roles of an MCPTT
server.
# 106 Call control common procedures
### 106.2.1 SDP offer generation
The SDP offer shall contain only one SDP media-level section for offered
speech according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] and, if floor control shall be used
during the session, shall contain one SDP media-level section for a media-
floor control entity according to 3GPP TS 24.380 [5].
When composing an SDP offer according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] the IWF:
1) shall set the IP address of the IWF for the offered speech media stream
and, if floor control shall be used, for the offered media-floor control
entity;
2) shall include an \"m=audio\" media-level section for the MCPTT media stream
consisting of:
a) the port number for the media stream selected;
b) the codec(s) and media parameters and attributes with the following
clarification:
i) if the IWF is initiating a call to a group identity;
ii) if the \ element is present in the group
document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [31] containing an \ element
with a \"name\" attribute; and
iii) if the IWF supports the encoding name indicated in the value of the
\"name\" attribute;
then the IWF shall insert the value of the \"name\" attribute in the
\ field of the \"a=rtpmap\" attribute as defined in IETF RFC
4566 [12]; and
c) \"i=\" field set to \"speech\" according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
3) if floor control shall be used during the session, shall include an
\"m=application\" media-level section as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]
clause 12 for a media-floor control entity, consisting of:
a) the port number for the media-floor control entity selected as specified in
3GPP TS 24.380 [5]; and
b) the \'fmtp\' attributes as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] clause 14; and
4) if media security is required between the MCPTT client and the IWF for a
private call, shall include the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE in an \"a=key-mgmt\"
attribute as a \"mikey\" attribute value in the SDP offer as specified in IETF
RFC 4567 [47].
### 106.2.2 SDP answer generation
When the IWF receives an initial SDP offer for an MCPTT session, the IWF shall
process the SDP offer and shall compose an SDP answer according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [4].
When composing an SDP answer, the IWF:
1) shall accept the speech media stream in the SDP offer;
2) shall set the IP address of the IWF for the accepted speech media stream
and, if included in the SDP offer, for the accepted media-floor control
entity;
NOTE: If the IWF is behind a NAT the IP address and port included in the SDP
answer can be a different IP address and port than the actual IP address and
port of the IWF depending on the NAT traversal method used by the SIP/IP Core.
3) shall include an \"m=audio\" media-level section for the accepted MCPTT
speech media stream consisting of:
a) the port number for the media stream;
b) media-level attributes as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
c) if the \"a=recvonly\" attribute is present in the SDP offer, include an
\"a=sendonly\" attribute;
d) if the \"a=sendonly\" attribute is present in the SDP offer, include an
\"a=recvonly\" attribute; and
e) \"i=\" field set to \"speech\" according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]; and
4) if included in the SDP offer, shall include the media-level section of the
offered media-floor control entity consisting of:
a) an \"m=application\" media-level section as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]
clause 12; and
b) \'fmtp\' attributes as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] clause 14.
##### 106.2.3.1.1 Automatic commencement mode for private calls
When performing the automatic commencement mode procedures, the IWF performing
the participating role:
1) shall accept the SIP INVITE request and generate a SIP 200 (OK) response
according to rules and procedures of 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
2) shall include the option tag \"timer\" in a Require header field of the SIP
200 (OK) response;
3) shall include the g.3gpp.mcptt media feature tag in the Contact header
field of the SIP 200 (OK) response;
4) shall include the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\" in the Contact header field of the
SIP 200 (OK) response;
5) shall include the Session-Expires header field in the SIP 200 (OK) response
and start the SIP session timer according to IETF RFC 4028 [7]. The
\"refresher\" parameter in the Session-Expires header field shall be set to
\"uas\";
6) shall include an SDP answer in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SDP offer
in the incoming SIP INVITE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the
clarifications given in subclause 106.2.2;
7) shall send the SIP 200 (OK) response towards the MCPTT server according to
rules and procedures of 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
8) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]
subclause 6.2.
##### 106.2.3.2.1 Manual commencement mode for private calls
When performing the manual commencement mode procedures:
1) if the user homed in the IWF declines the MCPTT session invitation the IWF
performing the participating role shall send a SIP 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable) response towards the MCPTT controlling function with the warning
text set to: \"110 user declined the call invitation\" in a Warning header
field as specified in subclause 104.4, and not continue with the rest of the
steps in this subclause.
The IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall accept the SIP INVITE request and generate a SIP 180 (Ringing)
response according to rules and procedures of 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
2) shall include the option tag \"timer\" in a Require header field of the SIP
180 (Ringing) response;
3) shall include the g.3gpp.mcptt media feature tag in the Contact header
field of the SIP 180 (Ringing) response;
4) shall include the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\" in the Contact header field of the
SIP 180 (Ringing) response; and
5) shall send the SIP 180 (Ringing) response to the controlling MCPTT
function.
When sending the SIP 200 (OK) response to the incoming SIP INVITE request, the
IWF performing the participating role shall follow the procedures in subclause
106.2.3.1.1.
### 106.2.6 Receiving an MCPTT session release request
Upon receiving a SIP BYE request, the IWF:
1) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]; and
2) shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response towards the MCPTT server according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
##### 106.2.8.1.1 SIP INVITE request for originating MCPTT emergency group
calls
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCPTT emergency state is set, the IWF performing the participating
role:
1) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body in the
SIP INVITE request, an \ element set to \"true\" and if the
MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 1: emergency-gc-capable\",
shall set the MCPTT emergency group call state to \"MEGC 2: emergency-call-
requested\";
2) if the IWF has determined that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be sent, and
the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to \"MEA 1: no-alert\", shall:
a) set the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml
MIME body to \"true\" and set the MCPTT emergency alert state to \"MEA 2:
emergency-alert-confirm-pending\"; and
b) include in the SIP INVITE request the specific location information for
MCPTT emergency alert as specified in subclause 106.2.9.1;
3) if the IWF has determined that an MCPTT emergency alert is not to be sent
and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to \"MEA 1: no-alert\", shall set
the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body
to \"false\"; and
4) if the MCPTT client emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of
the group is set to a value other than \"MEG 2: in-progress\" set the MCPTT
client emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of the MCPTT group
to \"MEG 4: confirm-pending\".
NOTE 1: This is the case of a user homed in the IWF already being in the MCPTT
emergency state it initiated previously while originating an MCPTT emergency
group call or MCPTT emergency alert. All group calls the user homed in the IWF
originates while in MCPTT emergency state will be MCPTT emergency group calls.
When the MCPTT emergency state is clear and the MCPTT emergency group call
state is set to \"MEGC 1: emergency-gc-capable\" and the IWF determines that
the request for MCPTT emergency group call is authorized by local policy, the
IWF performing the participating role shall set the MCPTT emergency state and
perform the following actions:
1) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body in the
SIP INVITE request an \ element set to \"true\" and set the
MCPTT emergency group call state to \"MEGC 2: emergency-call-requested\"
state;
2) if the user homed in the IWF has also requested an MCPTT emergency alert to
be sent, shall:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body the \ element set to \"true\" and set the MCPTT emergency alert state to \"MEA
2: emergency-alert-confirm-pending\"; and
b) include in the SIP INVITE request the specific location information, if
available, for MCPTT emergency alert as specified in subclause 106.2.9.1;
3) if the IWF has determined that an MCPTT emergency alert is not to be sent,
shall set the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml
MIME body to \"false\"; and
4) if the MCPTT client emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of
the group is set to a value other than \"MEG 2: in-progress\" shall set the
MCPTT client emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of the MCPTT
group to \"MEG 4: confirm-pending\".
NOTE 2: This is the case of an initial MCPTT emergency group call and
optionally an MCPTT emergency alert being sent. As the MCPTT emergency state
is not sent, there is no MCPTT emergency alert outstanding.
NOTE 3: An MCPTT group call originated by an affiliated member of an MCPTT
group which is in an in-progress emergency state (as tracked on the MCPTT
client by the MCPTT client emergency group state) but is not in an MCPTT
emergency state of their own will also be an MCPTT emergency group call. The
\ and \ elements of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body do not need to be included in this case and hence no action
needs to be taken in this subclause.
##### 106.2.8.1.2 Resource-Priority header field for MCPTT emergency group
calls
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to either \"MEGC 2: emergency-
call-requested\" or \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-granted\", or the MCPTT client
emergency group state of the group is set to \"MEG 2: in-progress\", the IWF
performing the participating role shall include in the SIP INVITE request a
Resource-Priority header field populated with the values for an MCPTT
emergency group call as specified in subclause 106.2.8.1.15.
NOTE: The IWF performing the participating role ideally would not need to
maintain knowledge of the in-progress emergency state of the group (as tracked
for the client by the MCPTT client emergency group state by the IWF performing
the participating role) but can use this knowledge to provide a Resource-
Priority header field set to emergency level priority, which starts the
infrastructure priority adjustment process sooner than otherwise would be the
case.
If the MCPTT client emergency group state of the group is \"no-emergency\" or
\"cancel-pending\", the IWF performing the participating role shall include in
the SIP INVITE request a Resource-Priority header field populated with the
values for a normal MCPTT group call as specified in subclause 106.2.8.1.15.
##### 106.2.8.1.3 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling MCPTT in-progress
emergency group state
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-
granted\" and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to \"MEA 1: no-alert\",
the IWF performing the participating role shall generate a SIP re-INVITE
request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the clarifications given below.
The IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1 with the
\ element set to \"false\";
2) shall clear the MCPTT emergency state; and
3) shall set MCPTT emergency group state of the MCPTT group to \"MEG 3:
cancel-pending\".
NOTE 1: This is the case of a user homed in the IWF who has initiated an MCPTT
emergency group call and wants to cancel it.
If the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-
granted\" and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to a value other than
\"MEA 1: no-alert\" and only the MCPTT emergency group call is to be
cancelled, the IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1 with the
\ element set to \"false\"; and
2) shall set the MCPTT emergency group state of the MCPTT group to \"MEG 3:
cancel-pending\".
NOTE 2: This is the case of a user homed in the IWF that has initiated both an
MCPTT emergency group call and an MCPTT emergency alert and wishes to only
cancel the MCPTT emergency group call. This leaves the MCPTT emergency state
set.
If the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-
granted\" and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to a value other than
\"MEA 1: no-alert\" and the user homed in the IWF has indicated that the MCPTT
emergency alert on the MCPTT group should be cancelled in addition to the
MCPTT emergency group call, the IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1 with the
\ element set to \"false\";
2) shall:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body an \ element set to \"false\";
b) set the MCPTT emergency alert state to \"MEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-
pending\"; and
c) clear the MCPTT emergency state; and
3) shall set the MCPTT emergency group state of the MCPTT group to \"MEG 3:
cancel-pending\".
NOTE 3: This is the case of a user homed in the IWF that has initiated both an
MCPTT emergency group call and an MCPTT emergency alert and wishes to cancel
both.
##### 106.2.8.1.4 Receiving a SIP 2xx response to a SIP request for a priority
call
In the procedures in this subclause, a priority group call refers to an MCPTT
emergency group call or an MCPTT imminent peril group call.
On receiving a SIP 2xx response to a SIP request for a priority group call,
the IWF:
1) if the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 2: emergency-call-
requested\" or \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-granted\":
a) shall set the emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of the
group to \"MEG 2: in-progress\" if it was not already set;
b) if the MCPTT emergency alert state of the user homed in the IWF is set to
\"MEA 2: emergency-alert-confirm-pending\" and the SIP 2xx response to the SIP
request for a priority group call does not contain a Warning header field as
specified in TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.4 with the warning text containing the
mcptt-warn-code set to \"149\", shall set the MCPTT emergency alert state of
the user homed in the IWF to \"MEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated;
c) shall set the MCPTT emergency group call state to \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-
granted\"; and
d) shall set the MCPTT imminent peril group call state to \"MIGC 1: imminent-
peril-capable\" and the MCPTT imminent peril group state to \"MIG 1: no-
imminent-peril\"; or
2) if the MCPTT imminent peril group call state is set to \"MIGC 2: imminent-
peril-call-requested\" or \"MIGC 3: imminent-peril-call-granted\" and the SIP
2xx response to the SIP request for an imminent peril group call does not
contain a Warning header field as specified in TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.4
with the warning text containing the mcptt-warn-code set to \"149\":
a) set the MCPTT imminent peril group call state to \"MIGC 3: imminent-peril-
call-granted\"; and
b) set the MCPTT imminent peril group state to \"MIG 2: in-progress\".
##### 106.2.8.1.5 Receiving a SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or SIP 6xx
response to a SIP request for a priority group call
In the procedures in this subclause, a priority group call refers to an MCPTT
emergency group call or an MCPTT imminent peril group call.
Upon receiving a SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or a SIP 6xx response to a
SIP request for a priority group call the IWF:
1) if the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 2: emergency-call-
requested\" or \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-granted\":
a) shall set the MCPTT emergency group call state to \"MEGC 1: emergency-gc-
capable\";
b) if the emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of the group is
\"MEG 4: confirm-pending\" shall set the emergency group state of the user
homed in the IWF of the group to \"MEG 1: no-emergency\"; and
c) if the sent SIP request for a priority group call contained an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body with an \ element set
to a value of \"true\", shall set the MCPTT emergency alert state of the user
homed in the IWF to \"MEA 1: \"no-alert\"; and
> 2) if the MCPTT imminent peril group call state is set to \"MIGC 2:
> imminent-peril-call-requested\" or \"MIGC 3: imminent-peril-call-granted\":
>
> a) shall set the MCPTT imminent peril group state to \"MIG 1: no-imminent-
> peril\"; and
>
> b) shall set the MCPTT imminent peril group call state to \"MIGC 1:
> imminent-peril-gc-capable\".
##### 106.2.8.1.9 SIP request for originating MCPTT imminent peril group calls
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
When the IWF performing the participating role determines to originate an
MCPTT imminent peril group call, the IWF performing the participating role:
1) if the client homed in the IWF\'s imminent peril group state is set to
\"MIGC 1: imminent-peril-gc-capable\" and the in-progress emergency state of
the group is set to a value of \"false\":
a) shall include in the SIP request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml
MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1 with the
\ element set to \"true\" and set the MCPTT emergency group
call state to \"MIGC 2: imminent-peril-call-requested\" state; and
b) if the client homed in the IWF\'s imminent peril group state of the group
is set to a value other than \"MIG 2: in-progress\" shall set the client homed
in the IWF\'s emergency group state of the MCPTT group to \"MIG 4: confirm-
pending\".
NOTE: An MCPTT group call originated by an affiliated member of an MCPTT group
which is in an in-progress imminent peril state (as tracked on the client by
the client imminent peril group state) will also have the priority associated
with MCPTT imminent peril group calls. The \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info MIME body does not need to be included in this
case, nor do any state changes result and hence no action needs to be taken in
this subclause.
##### 106.2.8.1.11 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling MCPTT in-progress
imminent peril group state
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCPTT imminent peril group call state is set to \"MIGC 3: imminent-
peril-call-granted\" or the MCPTT imminent peril group state of the MCPTT
group is set to \"MIG 2: in-progress\", the IWF shall generate a SIP re-INVITE
request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the clarifications given below.
The IWF:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in clause F.1 with the \
element set to \"false\"; and
2) shall set MCPTT imminent peril group state of the MCPTT group to \"MIG 3:
cancel-pending\".
NOTE: This is the case of a user who has initiated an MCPTT imminent peril
group call and wants to cancel it, or another authorised member of the group
who wishes to cancel the in-progress imminent peril state of the group.
##### 106.2.8.1.12 Resource-Priority header field for MCPTT imminent peril
group calls
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCPTT imminent peril group call state is set \"MIGC 2: imminent-
peril-call-requested\" or \"MIGC 3: imminent-peril-call-granted\", or the
client homed in the IWF\'s imminent peril state of the group is set to \"MIG
2: in-progress\", the IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP INVITE request a Resource-Priority header field
populated with the values for an MCPTT imminent peril group call as specified
in subclause 106.2.8.1.15.
NOTE: The IWF performing the participating role ideally would not need to
maintain knowledge of the in-progress imminent peril state of the group (as
tracked for the client by the client imminent peril group state) but can use
this knowledge to provide a Resource-Priority header field set to imminent
peril level priority, which starts the infrastructure priority adjustment
process sooner than otherwise would be the case.
When the MCPTT imminent peril group call state is set to \"MIGC 1: imminent-
peril-gc-capable\" and the IWF performing the participating role determines
that cancellation of the MCPTT imminent peril group call is authorized, or the
MCPTT client imminent peril group state of the group is \"MIG 1: no-imminent-
peril\" or \"MIG 3: cancel-pending\", the IWF performing the participating
role:
1) shall include in the SIP INVITE request a Resource-Priority header field
populated with the values for a normal MCPTT group call as specified in
subclause 106.2.8.1.15.
##### 106.2.8.1.13 Receiving a SIP INFO request in the dialog of a SIP request
for a priority group call
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving a SIP INFO request within the dialog of the SIP request for a
priority group call:
\- with the Info-Package header field containing the g.3gpp.mcptt-info package
name;
\- with the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body associated with the
info package according to IETF RFC 6086 [64]; and
\- with one or more of the \, \ and \ elements set in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body;
the IWF:
1) shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INFO request as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
2) if the MCPTT emergency group call state is set to \"MEGC 3: emergency-call-
granted\":
a) if the MCPTT emergency alert state of the user homed in the IWF is set to
\"MEA 2: emergency-alert-confirm-pending\":
i) if the \ element is set to a value of \"false\", shall set the
MCPTT emergency alert state to \"MEA 1: no-alert\"; and
ii) if the \ element is set to a value of \"true\", shall set the
MCPTT emergency alert state of the user homed in the IWF to \"MEA 3:
emergency-alert-initiated\";
3) if the MCPTT imminent peril group call state is set to \"MIGC 2: imminent-
peril-call-requested\" or \"MIGC 3: imminent-peril-call-granted\":
a) if the \ element is set to a value of \"false\" and an
\ element is set to a value of \"true\", shall:
i) set the MCPTT imminent peril group state to \"MIG 1: no-imminent-peril\";
ii) set the MCPTT imminent peril group call state to \"MIGC 1: imminent-peril-
capable\"; and
iii) set the emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF of the group
to \"MEG 2: in-progress\"; and
NOTE 1: This is the case of an IWF attempting to make an imminent peril group
call when the group is in an in-progress emergency group state. The IWF will
then receive a notification that the imminent peril call request was denied,
however the IWF will be participating at the emergency level priority of the
group.
NOTE 2: the emergency group state of the user homed in the IWF above is the
view of the in-progress emergency state of the group for each user homed in
the IWF.
4) if the SIP request for a priority group call sent by the IWF did not
contain an \ element and if the MCPTT emergency alert state of
the user homed in the IWF is set to \"MEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending\":
a) if the \ element contained in the SIP INFO request is set to a
value of \"true\", shall set the MCPTT emergency alert state of the user homed
in the IWF to \"MEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated\"; and
b) if the \ element contained in the SIP INFO request is set to a
value of \"false\", shall set the MCPTT emergency alert state of the user
homed in the IWF to \"MEA 1: no-alert\".
##### 106.2.8.1.14 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling the in-progress
emergency group state of a group by a third-party
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon the need to cancel an in-progress emergency group state of a group, the
IWF performing the participating role shall generate a SIP re-INVITE request
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the clarifications given below.
The IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1 with the
\ element set to \"false\";
2) shall set MCPTT emergency group state of the MCPTT group to \"MEG 3:
cancel-pending\"; and
3) if the MCPTT emergency alert on the MCPTT group originated by a MCPTT user
is to be cancelled:
a) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body an
\ element set a value of \"false\"; and
b) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body an
\ element set to the MCPTT ID of the MCPTT user who originated
the MCPTT emergency alert.
NOTE: When an MCPTT emergency alert is cancelled by a user other than its
originator, the \ element is needed to identify which MCPTT
emergency alert is being cancelled, as more than one MCPTT user could have
originated emergency alerts to the same group.
##### 106.2.8.1.15 Resource-Priority header field values
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
The IWF performing the participating role may populate the Resource-Priority
header as described for the IWF performing the controlling role in subclause
106.3.3.1.19.
##### 106.2.8.3.2 SIP request for originating MCPTT emergency private calls
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCPTT emergency private call state is set to \"MEPC 1: emergency-pc-
capable\", the IWF:
1) shall set the MCPTT emergency state if not already set;
2) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body in the
SIP request an \ element set to \"true\" and set the MCPTT
emergency private call state to \"MEPC 2: emergency-pc-requested\";
3) if an MCPTT emergency alert is to be sent, shall:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body the \ element set to \"true\" and set the MCPTT private emergency alert state
to \"MPEA 2: emergency-alert-confirm-pending\"; and
b) include in the SIP request the specific location information for MCPTT
emergency alert as specified in subclause 106.2.9.1;
4) if the IWF has determined not to request an MCPTT emergency alert to be
sent, shall set the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body to \"false\"; and
5) if the MCPTT emergency private priority state of this private call is set
to a value other than \"MEPP 2: in-progress\" shall set the MCPTT emergency
private priority state to \"MEPP 3: confirm-pending\".
##### 106.2.8.3.3 Resource-Priority header field for MCPTT emergency private
calls
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCPTT emergency private call state is set to either \"MEPC 2:
emergency-pc-requested\" or \"MEPC 3: emergency-pc-granted\", or the MCPTT
emergency private priority state of the call is set to \"MEPP 2: in-
progress\", the IWF shall include in the SIP request a Resource-Priority
header field populated with the values for an MCPTT emergency private call as
specified in subclause 106.2.8.1.15.
NOTE: The IWF ideally would not need to maintain knowledge of the in-progress
emergency state of the call (as tracked on the MCPTT client by the MCPTT
client emergency private state) but can use this knowledge to provide a
Resource-Priority header field set to emergency level priority, which starts
the infrastructure priority adjustment process sooner than otherwise would be
the case.
If this is a request to cancel the MCPTT emergency private call and the MCPTT
emergency private priority state of the private call is \"MEPP 1: no-
emergency\" or \"MEPP 3: cancel-pending\", the IWF shall include in the SIP
request a Resource-Priority header field populated with the values for a
normal MCPTT private call as specified in subclause 106.2.8.1.15.
##### 106.2.8.3.6 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling MCPTT emergency private
call state
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCPTT emergency private call state is set to \"MEPC 3: emergency-pc-
granted\" and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to \"MPEA 1: no-alert\",
the IWF performing the participating role shall generate a SIP re-INVITE
request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the clarifications given below.
The IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], 3GPP TS 24.379 [81],
clause F.1 with the \ element set to \"false\";
2) shall clear the MCPTT emergency state; and
3) shall set MCPTT emergency private priority state of the MCPTT emergency
private call to \"MEPP 3: cancel-pending\".
NOTE 1: This is the case where a private call is in emergency and the
emergency is to be cancelled.
When the MCPTT emergency private call state is set to \"MEPPC 3: emergency-pc-
granted\" and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to a value other than
\"MPEA 1: no-alert\" and the IWF decides that only the MCPTT emergency private
call should be cancelled, the IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], 3GPP TS 24.379 [81],
clause F.1 with the \ element set to \"false\"; and
2) shall set the MCPTT emergency private priority state of the MCPTT emergency
private call to \"MEPP 3: cancel-pending\";
NOTE 2: This is the case where both an MCPTT emergency private call and an
MCPTT emergency alert have been initiated and only the MCPTT emergency on the
private call is to be cancelled. This leaves the MCPTT emergency state set.
When the MCPTT emergency private call state is set to \"MEPC 3: emergency-pc-
granted\" and the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to a value other than
\"MPEA 1: no-alert\" and the IWF performing the participating role has
indicated that the MCPTT emergency alert on the MCPTT private call should be
cancelled in addition to the MCPTT emergency private call, the IWF performing
the participating role:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1 with the
\ element set to \"false\";
2) shall:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body an \ element set to \"false\"; and
b) set the MCPTT private emergency alert state to \"MPEA 4: emergency-alert-
cancel-pending\";

these MCPTT clients.
After expiry of timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer) and the local
counter of the number of SIP 200 (OK) responses received from invited members
is less than the value required by the IWF performing the controlling role,
then the IWF performing the controlling role shall wait until further
responses have been received from invited clients and the value of the local
counter of the number of SIP 200 (OK) responses received from invited members
is equal to the number required by the IWF performing the controlling role,
before continuing with the timer TNG1 expiry procedures in this subclause.
After expiry of timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer) and the local
counter of the number of SIP 200 (OK) responses received from invited members
is greater or equal to the number required by the IWF performing the
controlling role, the IWF performing the controlling role shall execute the
steps described below:
1) if the IWF is configured to \"proceed\" with the setup of the group call,
then the IWF performing the controlling role:
a) shall perform the following actions:
i) generate a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INVITE request as specified in
the 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.3.3.2.2 before continuing with the rest of
the steps;

call proceeded without all required group members\" in a Warning header field
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.4, with the IWF acting as the
MCPTT server MCPTT function;
iii) include in the SIP 200 (OK) response an SDP answer to the SDP offer in
the incoming SIP INVITE request as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.379 [81]
subclause 6.3.3.2.1, with the IWF acting as the controlling MCPTT function;
iv) interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]; and
NOTE 4: Resulting media plane processing is completed before the next step is
performed.
v) send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the inviting MCPTT client according to 3GPP
TS 24.229 [4];
b) when a SIP 200 (OK) response to a SIP INVITE request is received from an
invited MCPTT client the IWF performing the controlling role may send an in-
dialog SIP MESSAGE request to the MCPTT client that originated the group
session with the text \"group call proceeded without all required group
members\";
c) when the IWF performing the controlling role receives a SIP BYE request
from an invited MCPTT client, shall take the actions specified in subclause
106.3.3.2.4 and may send an in-dialog SIP MESSAGE request to the MCPTT client
that originated the group session with the text \"group call proceeded without
all required group members\"; and
d) shall generate a notification package as specified in subclause 106.3.3.4
and send a SIP NOTIFY request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] to the MCPTT
clients which have subscribed to the conference event package; and
2) if the IWF is configured to \"abandon\" the setup of the group call, then
the IWF performing the controlling role shall:
a) send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to the MCPTT client that
originated the group session with the warning text set to \"112 group call
abandoned due to required group members not part of the group session\" in a
Warning header field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.4, with
the IWF acting as the MCPTT server;
b) for each confirmed dialog at the IWF performing the controlling role, send

specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]; and
c) for each non-confirmed dialog at the IWF performing the controlling role,
send a SIP CANCEL request towards the MCPTT clients invited to the group
session in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
If the IWF performing the controlling role receives a final SIP 4xx, 5xx or
6xx response from an affiliated and required group member prior to expiry of
timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer) and based on policy, the IWF
performing the controlling role decides not to continue with the establishment
of the group call without the affiliated and required group member, then the
IWF performing the controlling role:
NOTE 5: It is expected that this action is taken if the policy is to abandon
the call on expiry of timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer).
1) shall stop timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer); and
2) shall forward the final SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response towards the inviting
MCPTT client with the warning text set to \"112 group call abandoned due to

6xx response from an affiliated and required group member prior to expiry of
timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer);
2) the local counter of the number of SIP 200 (OK) responses received from
invited members is greater than or equal to the required number of
participants; and
3) based on policy, the IWF performing the controlling role decides to
continue with the establishment of the group call without the affiliated and
required group member;
then the IWF performing the controlling role:
NOTE 6: It is expected that this action is taken if the policy is to proceed
with the call on expiry of timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer).
1) if all other invited clients have not yet responded, shall continue running
timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer); and
2) if all other invited clients have responded with SIP 200 (OK) responses,
shall
a) stop timer TNG1 (acknowledged call setup timer);
b) generate SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INVITE request as specified in
the 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.3.3.2.2 before continuing with the rest of
the steps;
c) include in the SIP 200 (OK) response the warning text set to \"111 group
call proceeded without all required group members\" in a Warning header field
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.4, with the IWF acting as the
MCPTT server;
d) include in the SIP 200 (OK) response an SDP answer to the SDP offer in the
incoming SIP INVITE request as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause
6.3.3.2.1, with the IWF acting as the controlling MCPTT function;
e) interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]; and
NOTE 7: Resulting media plane processing is completed before the next step is
performed.
f) send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the inviting MCPTT client according to 3GPP
TS 24.229 [4].
#### 106.3.3.4 Generating a SIP NOTIFY request
The IWF performing the controlling role shall generate a SIP NOTIFY request
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the clarification in this subclause.
In the SIP NOTIFY request, the IWF performing the controlling role:
1) shall set the P-Asserted-Identity header field to the public service
identity of the IWF performing the controlling role;
2) shall include an Event header field set to \"conference\";
3) shall include an Expires header field set to 3600 seconds according to IETF
RFC 4575 [30], as default value;
4) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [9]; and
5) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body with the
\ element containing the \ element with:
a) the \ set to the value of the MCPTT group ID;
b) if the target is a MCPTT user, the value of \ element
set to the value of MCPTT ID of the targeted MCPTT user; and
c) if the target is the non-controlling MCPTT function, the value of \ element set to the constituent MCPTT group ID.
In the SIP NOTIFY request, the IWF performing the controlling role shall
include an application/conference-info+xml MIME body according to IETF RFC
4575 [30] with the following limitations:
1) the IWF performing the controlling role shall include the MCPTT group ID of
the MCPTT group in the \"entity\" attribute of the \ element;
2) for each non-IWF connected participant in the MCPTT session with the
exception of non-controlling MCPTT functions, the IWF performing the
controlling role shall include a \ element. The \ element:
NOTE 1: Non-controlling MCPTT functions will appear as a participant in
temporary group sessions.
a) shall include the \"entity\" attribute. The \"entity\" attribute:
i) shall for the MCPTT client, which initiated, joined or re-joined an MCPTT
session, include the MCPTT ID of the user that originated the request; and
ii) shall for an invited MCPTT client include the MCPTT ID of the invited
MCPTT user in case of a prearranged group call or chat group call;
b) shall include a single \ element. The \ element:
i) shall include the \"entity\" attribute; and
ii) shall include the \ element indicating the status of the MCPTT
session according to RFC 4575; and
c) may include the \ element.
NOTE 2: The usage of \ is only applicable for human consumption.
#### 106.3.3.5 Handling of the group call timer (TNG3)
##### 106.3.3.5.1 General
When the IWF performing the controlling role receives a SIP INVITE request to
initiate a group session, then after an MCPTT session identity has been
allocated for the group session, the IWF performing the controlling role shall
start timer TNG3 (group call timer).
NOTE 1: How the IWF determines the value of the TNG3 timer is out of scope of
the present document.
If the IWF does not have a TNG3 timer value, then the IWF performing the
controlling role shall not start timer TNG3 (group call timer).
NOTE 2: The group call timer is mandated for a pre-arranged group and is
optional for a chat group.
When merging two or more active group calls into a temporary group call, if
the IWF is hosting at least one of the active group calls shall stop timer
TNG3 (group call timer) for each hosted group call, and the IWF performing the
controlling role hosting the temporary group call shall start timer TNG3
(group call timer) for the temporary group call.
NOTE 3: MCPTT server(s) other than the IWF that are hosting the independent
active group calls become non-controlling MCPTT function(s) of an MCPTT group,
for the temporary group call.
When splitting a temporary group call into independent group calls, the IWF
performing the controlling role hosting the temporary group call shall stop
timer TNG3 (group call timer) and the controlling MCPTT function(s) hosting
the independent group calls shall start TNG3 (group call timer) for each group
call.
When the last MCPTT client leaves the MCPTT session, the IWF performing the
controlling role shall stop timer TNG3 (group call timer).
On expiry of timer TNG3 (group call timer), the IWF performing the controlling
role shall release the MCPTT session by following the procedures in subclause
106.3.3.1.5;
##### 106.3.3.5.2 Interaction with the in-progress emergency group call timer
(TNG2)
If the IWF performing the controlling role starts timer TNG2 (in-progress
emergency group call timer), it shall not start timer TNG3 (group call timer).
If timer TNG3 (group call timer) is running and the MCPTT group call is
upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group call, then the IWF performing the
controlling role shall stop timer TNG3 (group call timer) and shall start
timer TNG2 (in-progress emergency group call timer). If timer TNG2 (in-
progress emergency group call timer) is running and the MCPTT emergency group
call is cancelled, then the IWF performing the controlling role shall stop
timer TNG2 (in-progress emergency group call timer) and shall start timer TNG3
(group call timer).
NOTE 1: How the IWF determines the value of the TNG2 and TNG3 timers is out of
scope of the present document.
If timer TNG2 (in-progress emergency group call timer) is running and
subsequently expires, then the controlling MCPTT function shall start timer
TNG3 (group call timer).
NOTE 2: The above conditions for starting timer TNG2 (in-progress emergency
group call timer) and timer TNG3 (group call timer) also apply in the case
that these timers are re-started. For example: the case where the timer TNG3
was initially running, the MCPTT group call is upgraded to an MCPTT emergency
group call and then the MCPTT emergency group call is cancelled.

Upon receiving a request that includes the Request-URI set to a public service
identity that is not allocated in the IWF, the IWF performing the
participating role or the controlling role shall return a SIP 404 (Not Found)
response.
#### 106.3.8.1 Session release policy for group call
If:
1) the call is a pre-arranged group call and if the IWF performing the
controlling role receives an indication from the media plane that the T4
(Inactivity) timer specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] expired and if there is at
least one participant of the prearranged group call that is an MCPTT user;
2) there are only one or no participants in the call, including both MCPTT
participants and participants homed in the IWF;
3) if the call is a pre-arranged group call and if it is according to local
policy, the initiator of the group call leaves the call;
4) less than the minimum number of affiliated group members is present;
5) timer TNG3 (group call timer) expires; or
6) the call is a broadcast group call and if the controlling MCPTT function
receives an indication from the media plane that the T4 (Inactivity) timer
specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] expired;
then the IWF performing the controlling role;
1) shall release the MCPTT session for the group call if any participants are
MCPTT users.
#### 106.3.8.2 Session release policy for private call
If:
1) IWF performing the controlling role decides that a private call has been
inactive for longer than a locally determined period; or
2) there are only one or no participants in the MCPTT session;
the IWF performing the controlling role shall release the MCPTT session for a
private call.
## 106.4 Implicit floor request
A SIP re-INVITE request fulfilling the following criteria shall be regarded by
the IWF performing the controlling role as an implicit floor request when the
originator of the request:
1) performs an upgrade of:
a) an MCPTT group call to an emergency MCPTT group call;
b) an MCPTT private call to an emergency MCPTT private call; or
c) an MCPTT group call to an imminent peril MCPTT group call; and
2) includes the \"mc_implicit_request\" \'fmtp\' attribute in the associated
UDP stream for the floor control in the SDP offer/answer as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.380 [5] clause 12.
In all other cases the SIP (re-)INVITE request shall be regarded as received
without an implicit floor request.
## 106.6 Confidentiality and Integrity Protection
### 106.6.1 General
#### 106.6.1.1 Applicability and exclusions
The procedures in subclause 106.6 apply in general to all procedures described
in clause 109, clause 110, clause 111 and clause 112.
#### 106.6.1.2 Performing XML content encryption
Whenever the IWF includes XML elements or attributes pertaining to the data
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.8 in SIP requests or SIP
responses, the IWF shall perform the procedures in subclause 106.6.2.3.2, with
the exception that when the IWF receives a SIP request with XML elements or
attributes in an MIME body that need to be copied from the incoming SIP
request to an outgoing SIP request without modification, the IWF shall perform
the procedures specified in subclause 106.6.2.5.
NOTE: The procedure in subclause 106.6.2.3.2 first determines (by referring to
configuration) if confidentiality protection is enabled and then call the
necessary procedures to encrypt the contents of the XML elements if
confidentiality protection is enabled.
#### 106.6.1.3 Performing integrity protection on an XML body
The IWF shall perform the procedures in subclause 106.6.3.3.2 just prior to
sending a SIP request or SIP response.
NOTE: The procedure in subclause 106.6.3.3.2 first determines if integrity
protection of XML MIME bodies is required and then calls the necessary
procedures to integrity protect each XML MIME body if integrity protection is
required. Each XML MIME body has its own signature.
#### 106.6.2.2 Keys used in confidentiality protection procedures
Confidentiality protection uses an XPK to encrypt the data which (depending on
who is the sender and who is the receiver of the encrypted information) can be
an SPK as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.8. An XPK-ID (SPK-ID)
is used to key the XPK (SPK). It is assumed that before the procedures in this
subclause are called, the SPK/SPK-ID is available on the sender and recipient
of the encrypted content as described in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.8.
The procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], subclause 6.6.2.3 and 3GPP TS 24.379
[81] subclause 6.6.2.4 are used with an XPK equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID
equal to the SPK-ID in the following circumstances as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78]:
1) IWF sends confidentiality protected content to an MCPTT server in the same
domain; and
2) IWF sends confidentiality protected content to an MCPTT server in another
domain.
##### 106.6.2.3.2 IWF performing any role of an MCPTT server
If the IWF performing any role of an MCPTT server determines locally that it
needs to confidentiality protect content sent to an MCPTT server, then sending
confidentiality protected content between MCPTT servers is enabled.
When sending confidentiality protected content, the IWF:
1) shall use the appropriate keying information specified in subclause
106.6.2.2;
2) shall perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.3.3 to
confidentiality protect XML elements containing the content described in 3GPP
TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.8; and
3) shall perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.3.4 to
confidentiality protect URIs in XML attributes for URIs described in 3GPP TS
24.379 [81] subclause 4.8.
If the IWF determines locally that it does not need to confidentiality protect
content sent to an MCPTT server, then sending confidentiality protected
content between MCPTT servers is disabled, and content is included in XML
elements and attributes without encryption.
#### 106.6.2.5 IWF copying received XML content
The following procedure is executed when an IWF receives a SIP request
containing XML MIME bodies, where the content needs to be copied from the
incoming SIP request to the outgoing SIP request.
The IWF:
1) shall copy the XML elements from the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request that do not contain a \ XML element, to the same XML
body in the outgoing SIP request;
2) for each encrypted XML element in the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request as determined by 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in subclause 106.6.2.2 to
decrypt the content within the XML element by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.4.2, and shall continue with
the steps below if the encrypted XML element was successfully decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in subclause
106.6.2.3.2, then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the content within the XML element using the keying
information described in subclause 106.6.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.3.3; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted content into the same XML MIME body of the
outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in subclause
106.6.2.3.2, shall include the decrypted content in the same XML MIME body of
the outgoing SIP request.
3) for each encrypted XML URI attribute in the XML MIME body of the incoming
SIP request as determined by 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in subclause 106.6.2.2 to
decrypt the URI value of the XML attribute by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.4.3, and shall continue with
the steps below if the encrypted XML attribute value was successfully
decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in subclause
106.6.2.3.2, then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the URI value of the XML attribute using the keying
information described in subclause 106.6.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.2.3.4; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted attribute value into the same XML MIME body
of the outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in subclause
106.6.2.3.2, shall include the decrypted value in the same XML MIME body of
the outgoing SIP request.
#### 106.6.3.2 Keys used in integrity protection procedures
Integrity protection uses an XPK to sign the data which (depending on who is
the sender and who is the receiver of the signed information) can be an SPK as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.8. An XPK-ID (SPK-ID) is used to
key the XPK (SPK). It is assumed that before the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379
[81] subclause 6.6.3.3 and 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.3.4 are called,
the SPK/SPK-ID are available on the sender and recipient of the integrity
protected content, as described in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 4.8.
The procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.3.3 and 3GPP TS 24.379
[81] subclause 6.6.3.4 shall be used with a XPK equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID
equal to the SPK-ID in the following circumstances as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78]:
1) IWF sends integrity protected content to an MCPTT server in the same
domain; and
2) IWF sends integrity protected content to an MCPTT server in another domain.
##### 106.6.3.3.2 Integrity protection at the IWF
The IWF determines locally whether sending integrity protected content from
the IWF to an MCPTT server is enabled.
NOTE 1: How the IWF determines whether to integrity protect content is out of
scope of the present document.
When sending integrity protected content, the IWF shall use the appropriate
keying information specified in subclause 106.6.3.2 and shall perform the
procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause 6.6.3.3.3 to integrity protect XML
MIME bodies.
NOTE 2: Each XML MIME body is integrity protected separately.
## 106.7 Priority sharing
The IWF performing the participating role shall enable or disable priority
sharing as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
### 106.8 Private call parameters
#### 106.8.1 Private call parameter check
Parameters of an incoming SIP INVITE are indicated as follows:
1) floor control. Floor control operation is indicated by an SDP offer with a
media-level section for a media-floor control entity;
2) commencement mode. The requested commencement mode is according to the
Answer-mode header, i.e. either \"auto\" or \"manual\"; and
3) implicit floor request. An implicit floor request is indicated by inclusion
of the \"mc_implicit_request\" \'fmtp\' attribute for the floor control in the
SDP offer/answer as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] clause 12.
Additional LMR specific parameters, such as LMR encryption mode, are out of
scope of the present document. The LMR specific parameters may be conveyed in
the \ element of the \ element of
the \ element of the MIME body \ root element as defined in
3GPP TS 24.379 [81], clause F.1.
#### 106.8.2 Private call parameter response values
To reject a private call due to unsupported parameters, the IWF performing the
participating role shall include in its response to the SIP INVITE a list of
parameters from the incoming SIP INVITE that it does support.
To indicate support for one or more private call parameters, in the \ element of the \ element of the \ root element
in the XML body, the IWF:
1) if floor control is requested in the incoming SIP INVITE and is supported,
shall include the \ element;
2) if \"without\" floor control is requested in the incoming SIP INVITE and is
supported by the IWF (i.e. full duplex is not supported), shall include the
\ element;
3) if implicit floor is requested in the incoming SIP INVITE and is supported
by the IWF (i.e. the IWF need not talk first), shall include the \ element;
4) if floor is not implicitly requested in the incoming SIP INVITE and the IWF
supports floor not being implicitly requested (i.e. the IWF must talk first),
shall include the \ element;
5) if manual commencement is requested in the incoming SIP INVITE and is
supported by the IWF, shall include the \ element; and
6) if automatic commencement is requested in the incoming SIP INVITE and is
supported by the IWF, shall include the \ element.

# 109 Affiliation
## 109.1 General
Subclause 109.2.2.2 contains the procedures for explicit and implicit
affiliation of a user homed in the IWF, in the IWF homing that user.
Subclauses in 109.2.2.2 also cover the case where the IWF manages affiliation
to a group on behalf of the users homed at that IWF (i.e. having only one
affiliation for a whole set of users homed in the IWF). In that case, the IWF
needs to implement the same set of procedures but in those procedures, it
shall use the MCPTT ID and the MCPTT client ID that are associated with the
IWF itself instead of the ones associated with a user homed in the IWF.
NOTE: How the MCPTT ID and MCPTT client ID associated with the IWF are
determined is out of the scope of this specification.
Subclause 109.2.2.3 contains the procedures for explicit and implicit
affiliation of an MCPTT user at the IWF owning the MCPTT group.
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
IWF for a user homed in the IWF in the following circumstances:
\- when the IWF performing the participating role attempts to join an MCPTT
chat group for a user homed in the IWF that is not already affiliated to the
MCPTT group;
\- when the IWF performing the participating role attempts to initiate an
MCPTT emergency group call or MCPTT imminent peril group call for a user homed
in the IWF that is not already affiliated to the MCPTT group;
\- when the IWF performing the participating role attempts to initiate an
MCPTT emergency alert targeted to an MCPTT group for a user homed in the IWF
that is not already affiliated to the MCPTT group.
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
IWF owning the MCPTT group in the following circumstances:
\- on receipt of a SIP INVITE request from an MCPTT server serving an MCPTT
user where the MCPTT user wants to join an MCPTT chat group homed in the IWF
and the MCPTT client is not already affiliated to the MCPTT group homed in the
IWF;
\- on receipt of a SIP INVITE request from an MCPTT server serving an MCPTT
user where the MCPTT user initiates an MCPTT emergency group call or MCPTT
imminent peril group call to a group homed in the IWF and the MCPTT client is
not already affiliated to the MCPTT group homed in the IWF; and
\- on receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request from an MCPTT server serving an MCPTT
user when the MCPTT user initiates an MCPTT emergency alert targeted to an
MCPTT group homed in the IWF and the MCPTT client is not already affiliated to
the MCPTT group homed in the IWF.
## 109.2 Procedures
### 109.2.2 IWF procedures towards the MCPTT system
#### 109.2.2.1 General
The IWF procedures toward the MCPTT system consist of:
\- procedures toward the MCPTT system of an IWF serving the user homed in the
IWF; and
\- procedures of an IWF owning a group that is visible to the MCPTT system.
#### 109.2.2.2 Procedures toward the MCPTT system of an IWF serving the user
homed in the IWF
##### 109.2.2.2.1 General
The procedures toward the MCPTT system of an IWF serving the user homed in the
IWF consist of:
\- a receiving subscription to affiliation status procedure;
\- a sending notification of change of affiliation status procedure;
\- a sending affiliation status change towards MCPTT server owning MCPTT group
procedure;
\- an affiliation status determination from MCPTT server owning MCPTT group
procedure;
\- an affiliation status determination procedure;
\- an affiliation status change by implicit affiliation procedure;
\- an implicit affiliation status change completion procedure;
\- an implicit affiliation status change cancellation procedure; and
\- an automatic affiliation to configured groups procedure.
##### 109.2.2.2.2 Stored information
The IWF maintains information equivalent to that defined in TS 24.379 [81]
subclause 9.2.2.2.2.
NOTE: The virtual data structure referenced in this subclause is for
information only. Implementors may choose other means to track affiliation
status for users homed in the IWF. References to the elements of this virtual
data structure are made in other subclauses with the understanding that
implementors choosing not to use this virtual data structure will take other
appropriate actions.
##### 109.2.2.2.3 Procedure for handling affiliation status change of a user
homed in the IWF
When the IWF determines that affiliation status should change for a user homed
in the IWF, the IWF performing the participating role:

the served MCPTT client information entry as the served list of the MCPTT
group information entries;
7) if the candidate expiration interval is nonzero:
a) shall construct the candidate list of the MCPTT group information entries
as follows:
i) for each MCPTT group ID which has an MCPTT group information entry in the
served list of the MCPTT group information entries, such that the expiration
time of the MCPTT group information entry has not expired yet, and which is
determined by the IWF to be a group to which the user homed in the IWF is to
be affiliated:
A) shall copy the MCPTT group information entry into a new MCPTT group
information entry of the candidate list of the MCPTT group information
entries;
B) if the affiliation status of the MCPTT group information entry is
\"deaffiliating\" or \"deaffiliated\", shall set the affiliation status of the
new MCPTT group information entry to the \"affiliating\" state and shall reset
the affiliating p-id of the new MCPTT group information entry; and
C) shall set the expiration time of the new MCPTT group information entry to
the current time increased with the candidate expiration interval;
ii) for each MCPTT group ID which has an MCPTT group information entry in the
served list of the MCPTT group information entries, such that the expiration
time of the MCPTT group information entry has not expired yet, and which is
determined by the IWF to be a group to which the user homed in the IWF is not
to be affiliated:
A) shall copy the MCPTT group information entry into a new MCPTT group
information entry of the candidate list of the MCPTT group information
entries; and
B) if the affiliation status of the MCPTT group information entry is
\"affiliated\" or \"affiliating\":

to the \"de-affiliating\" state; and
\- shall set the expiration time of the new MCPTT group information entry to
the current time increased with twice the value of timer F; and
iii) for each MCPTT group ID:
A) which does not have an MCPTT group information entry in the served list of
the MCPTT group information entries; or
B) which has an MCPTT group information entry in the served list of the MCPTT
group information entries, such that the expiration time of the MCPTT group
information entry has already expired;
> and which is determined by the IWF to be a group to which the user homed in
> the IWF is to be affiliated:
A) shall add a new MCPTT group information entry in the candidate list of the
MCPTT group information list for the MCPTT group ID;
B) shall set the affiliation status of the new MCPTT group information entry
to the \"affiliating\" state;
C) shall set the expiration time of the new MCPTT group information entry to
the current time increased with the candidate expiration interval; and
D) shall reset the affiliating p-id of the new MCPTT group information entry;

the served MCPTT client ID;
with the affiliation status set to the \"affiliating\" state or the
\"affiliated\" state and with the expiration time which has not expired yet;
and
c) if the candidate number of MCPTT group IDs is bigger than N2 value of the
served MCPTT ID, shall be based on service provider policy reduce the
candidate MCPTT group IDs to that equal to N2;
NOTE: The service provider policy can determine to remove an MCPTT group ID
based on the importance or priority of the MCPTT group or some other policy to
determine which groups are preferred.
8) if the candidate expiration interval is zero, constructs the candidate list
of the MCPTT group information entries as follows:
a) for each MCPTT group ID which has an entry in the served list of the MCPTT
group information entries:
i) shall copy the MCPTT group entry of the served list of the MCPTT group
information into a new MCPTT group information entry of the candidate list of
the MCPTT group information entries;

group information entries with the affiliation status set to the
\"deaffiliating\" state or the \"deaffiliated\" state and with the expiration
time not expired yet, and which has an MCPTT group information entry in the
candidate list of the MCPTT group information entries with the affiliation
status set to the \"affiliating\" state; or
d) which has an MCPTT group information entry in the served list of the MCPTT
group information entries with the affiliation status set to the
\"affiliated\" state and with the expiration time not expired yet, and which
has an MCPTT group information entry in the candidate list of the MCPTT group
information entries with the affiliation status set to the \"de-affiliating\"
state.
##### 109.2.2.2.4 Receiving subscription to affiliation status procedure
Upon receiving a SIP SUBSCRIBE request such that:
1) the Request-URI of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request contains the public service
identity identifying the IWF performing the terminating participating role
serving the user homed in the IWF;
2) the SIP SUBSCRIBE request contains an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml
MIME body containing the\ element which identifies an MCPTT
ID associated with a user homed in the IWF performing the terminating
participating role;
3) the SIP SUBSCRIBE request contains the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcptt\" (coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]), in a
P-Asserted-Service header field according to IETF RFC 6050 [9]; and
4) the Event header field of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request contains the
\"presence\" event type;
the IWF performing the terminating participating role:
1) if the IWF does not support receiving a SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the
affiliation status of a user homed in the IWF, the IWF shall generate and send
a SIP 501 (Not Implemented) response to the SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [4], IETF RFC 6665 [26], and shall skip the remainder of this
procedure;
Editor's Note: TS 24.379 needs to be examined to make sure that the reception
of a SIP 501 is properly handled in all cases.
2) shall identify the served MCPTT ID in the \ element of
the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body of the SIP SUBSCRIBE
request;
3) if the Request-URI of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request contains the public service
identity identifying the IWF performing the terminating participating role
serving the user homed in the IWF, shall identify the originating MCPTT ID in
the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request;

For the duration of the subscription, the IWF performing the terminating
participating role shall notify the subscriber about changes of the
information of the served MCPTT ID, as described in subclause 109.2.2.2.5.
##### 109.2.2.2.5 Sending notification of change of affiliation status
procedure
In order to notify the subscriber about changes of the served MCPTT ID, the
IWF:
NOTE: the served MCPTT ID identifies the user homed in the IWF whose
affiliation status has been subscribed.
1) shall consider an MCPTT user information entry such that:
a) the MCPTT user information entry is in the list of MCPTT user information
entries described in subclause 109.2.2.2.2; and
b) the MCPTT ID of the MCPTT user information entry is equal to the served
MCPTT ID;
as the served MCPTT user information entry;
2) shall consider the list of the MCPTT client information entries of the
served MCPTT user information entry as the served list of the MCPTT client
information entries;
3) shall generate an application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-user
affiliation information according to 3GPP TS 24.379 subclause 9.3.1 and the
served list of the MCPTT client information entries with the following
clarifications:

8) shall consider an MCPTT user information entry such that:
a) the MCPTT user information entry is in the list of MCPTT user information
entries described in subclause 109.2.2.2.2; and
b) the MCPTT ID of the MCPTT user information entry is equal to the MCPTT ID
associated with the user homed in the IWF;
as the served MCPTT user information entry;
9) for each MCPTT group information entry such that:
a) the MCPTT group information entry has the \"affiliating\" affiliation
status, the MCPTT group ID set to the handled MCPTT group ID, the expiration
time has not expired yet and the affiliating p-id is not set;
b) the MCPTT group information entry is in the list of the MCPTT group
information entries of an MCPTT client information entry; and
c) the MCPTT client information entry is in the list of the MCPTT client
information entries of the served MCPTT user information entry;
shall set the affiliating p-id of the MCPTT group information entry to the

affiliation information for a user homed in the IWF constructed according to
3GPP TS 24.379 subclause 9.3.1.2. The IWF shall indicate all MCPTT client IDs
associated with the user homed in the IWF, such that:
a) the affiliation status is set to \"affiliating\" or \"affiliated\", and the
expiration time has not expired yet in an MCPTT group information entry with
the MCPTT group ID set to the handled MCPTT group;
b) the MCPTT group information entry is in the list of the MCPTT group
information entries of an MCPTT client information entry;
c) the MCPTT client information entry has the MCPTT client ID set to the
served MCPTT client ID; and
d) the MCPTT client information entry is in the list of the MCPTT client
information entries of the served MCPTT user information entry.
The IWF shall set the \ child element of the \ root element to
the current p-id.
The IWF shall not include the \"expires\" attribute in the \
element.
The IWF shall send the SIP PUBLISH request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
If timer F expires for the SIP PUBLISH request sent for a (de)affiliation
request of the user homed in the IWF to the MCPTT group ID or upon receiving a
SIP 3xx, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the SIP PUBLISH request, the IWF:
1) shall remove each MCPTT group ID entry such that:
a) the MCPTT group information entry has the MCPTT group ID set to the handled
MCPTT group ID;
b) the MCPTT group information entry is in the list of the MCPTT group
information entries of an MCPTT client information entry; and
c) the MCPTT client information entry is in the list of the MCPTT client

##### 109.2.2.2.7 Affiliation status determination from MCPTT server owning
MCPTT group procedure.
NOTE 1: Usage of one SIP SUBSCRIBE request to subscribe for notification about
change of affiliation state of several users homed in the same IWF is not
supported in this version of the specification.
In order to discover whether a user homed in the IWF was successfully
affiliated to a handled MCPTT group in the MCPTT server owning the handled
MCPTT group, the IWF shall generate an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request according
to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4], IETF RFC 3856 [51], and IETF RFC 6665 [26].
In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the IWF:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity of the controlling
MCPTT function associated with the handled MCPTT group ID;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body. In the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body, the IWF:
a) shall include the \ element set to the handled MCPTT
group ID; and
b) shall include the \ element set to the MCPTT ID
associated with the user homed in the IWF;
3) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]), in a P-Asserted-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [9];
4) if the IWF wants to receive the current status and later notification,
shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [26], to
4294967295;
NOTE 2: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [24].
5) if the IWF wants to fetch the current state only, shall set the Expires
header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [26], to zero;
6) shall include an Accept header field containing the application/pidf+xml
MIME type; and
7) shall include an application/simple-filter+xml MIME body indicating per-
user restrictions of presence event package notification information according
to 3GPP TS 24.379 subclause 9.3.2, indicating the MCPTT ID associated with the
user homed in the IWF.
The IWF shall send the SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
In order to re-subscribe or de-subscribe, the IWF shall generate an in-dialog
SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4], IETF RFC 3856 [51], and
IETF RFC 6665 [26]. In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the IWF:
1) if the IWF wants to receive the current status and later notification,
shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [26], to
4294967295;
NOTE 3: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [24].
2) if the MCPTT server wants to de-subscribe, shall set the Expires header
field according to IETF RFC 6665 [26], to zero; and
3) shall include an Accept header field containing the application/pidf+xml
MIME type.
Upon receiving a SIP NOTIFY request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4], IETF RFC
3856 [51], and IETF RFC 6665 [26], if the SIP NOTIFY request contains an
application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-group affiliation information

##### 110.1.1.5.1 Originating procedures
This subclause describes the procedures for inviting an MCPTT user to an MCPTT
session. The procedure is initiated by the IWF performing the non-controlling
role of a group homed in the IWF as the result of an action in subclause
110.1.1.5.2 or subclause 110.1.1.5.5.
The IWF performing the non-controlling role:
1) shall invite the MCPTT clients as specified in subclause 106.3.4.1.2;
2) shall include in each SIP INVITE request an SDP offer based on the SDP
offer in the received SIP INVITE request from the IWF performing the non-
controlling role according to the procedures specified in subclause
106.3.4.1.1 with respect to a group homed in the IWF; and
3) shall send each SIP INVITE request towards the terminating network in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
For each SIP 183 (Session Progress) response received to each SIP INVITE
request sent to an MCPTT client, the IWF performing the non-controlling role
of a group homed in the IWF:
1) For each SIP 183 (Session Progress) response containing the option tag
\"100rel\", shall send a SIP PRACK request towards the MCPTT client according
to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]; and
2) shall cache the received response;
For each SIP 200 (OK) response received to each SIP INVITE request sent to an
MCPTT client, the IWF performing the non-controlling role of a group homed in
the IWF:
1) shall send a SIP ACK request towards the MCPTT client according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [4];
2) shall cache the SIP 200 (OK) response;
3) shall start the SIP session timer according to rules and procedures of IETF
RFC 4028 [7]; and
4) if at least one of the participants has subscribed to the conference event
package, shall send a SIP NOTIFY request to all participants with a

subclause 10.1.3.5.2.
On receipt of a SIP 3xx, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response from an invited MCPTT
client, the IWF performing the non-controlling role of an MCPTT group:
1) shall send an SIP ACK request towards the MCPTT client as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [4];
2) shall remove the cached provisional responses received from the MCPTT
client, if any cached provisional responses exist; and
3) if the procedures are initiated by the receipt of the \"SIP INVITE request
for non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group\" as specified in
subclause 110.1.1.5.2, shall cache the SIP 3xx, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response.
##### 110.1.1.5.2 Terminating procedures
###### 110.1.1.5.2.1 General
When receiving the \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT function of
an MCPTT group\" the IWF can be performing the controlling role in an ongoing
prearranged group call or, if a prearranged group call is not ongoing, be
initiated as an IWF performing the non-controlling role and invite both MCPTT
users and participants homed in the IWF. MCPTT users are invited per the
procedures of 3GPP TS 24.379 [81].
NOTE: How participants homed in the IWF are invited is out of the scope of
this document.
If a prearranged group call is not ongoing the IWF performing the non-
controlling role shall perform the actions specified in subclause
110.1.1.5.2.2.
If the \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT
group\" is received when a prearranged group call is ongoing, the IWF
performing the controlling role may switch roles from operating as an IWF
performing the controlling role to operate as an IWF performing the non-
controlling role as specified in subclause 110.1.1.5.2.3.
When operating in the non-controlling mode and a SIP BYE request is received
from the controlling MCPTT function, the IWF performing the non-controlling
role shall change from operating in the non-controlling mode to operating in
the controlling mode as specified in subclause 110.1.1.5.2.4.
###### 110.1.1.5.2.2 Initiating a prearranged group call
Upon receipt of a \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT function of
an MCPTT group\" and if a group call for the group homed in the IWF is not
ongoing, the IWF performing the non-controlling role of a group:
NOTE 1: The Contact header field of the SIP INVITE request contains the
\"isfocus\" feature media tag.
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP INVITE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF performing the non-controlling role may
include a Retry-After header field to the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error)
response as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [24]. Otherwise, continue with the rest
of the steps;
2) shall determine if the media parameters are acceptable and if not reject
the request with a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response. Otherwise, continue
with the rest of the steps;
3) shall reject the SIP request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response and not
process the remaining steps if:
a) an Accept-Contact header field does not include the g.3gpp.mcptt media
feature tag; or
b) an Accept-Contact header field does not include the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\";
4) if the partner system does not have a mutual aid relationship with the
primary MCPTT system identified by the contents of the P-Asserted-Identity,
shall reject the \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT function of an
MCPTT group\" with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response, with warning text set to
\"128 isfocus already assigned\" in a Warning header field as specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [81], subclause 4.4, and shall not process the remaining steps;
5) if a trusted mutual aid relationship exists between the partner system and
the primary MCPTT system and the procedure in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] subclause
10.6.2.4.2 is supported:
NOTE 2: 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] subclause 10.6.2.4.2 provides the ability for the
non-controlling function to send back to the controlling function a list of
affiliated members. The controlling function then issues SIP INVITE messages
to each of those affiliated members itself. Steps (a-f) below implement that
procedure.
a) shall generate a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response as specified in 3GPP TS
24.229 [4];
b) shall determine the group members of the group homed in the IWF identified
by the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml
MIME body of the SIP INVITE request;
c) if the IWF performing the non-controlling role determined that at least one
member of the group homed in the IWF is affiliated, shall include a P-Refused-
URI-List header field populated with affiliated members of the prearranged
group in accordance with the IETF RFC 5318 [36]:
d) if the IWF performing the non-controlling role determined that no members
of the group homed in the IWF are affiliated, shall include the warning text
set to \"128 isfocus already assigned\" in a Warning header field as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.379 [81], subclause 4.4; and
e) shall send the SIP 403 (Forbidden) response towards the controlling MCPTT
function as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]; and
f) shall not process the remaining steps;
6) if any members of the group homed in the IWF are MCPTT users, shall
determine the group parameters for the MCPTT group ID contained in the
\ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME
body of the SIP INVITE request and continue with the rest of the steps;
7) shall cache the content of the SIP INVITE request, if received in the
Contact header field and if the specific feature tags are supported;
8) shall check if a Resource-Priority header field is included in the incoming
SIP INVITE request and may apply any preferential treatment to the SIP request
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
9) shall determine the members of the group homed in the IWF to invite as
specified in subclause 106.3.5.5;
Editor's Note: How affiliation of an MCPTT ID on behalf of multiple LMR users
is handled requires further study.
10) if the IWF performing the non-controlling role determines that there are
members of the group homed in the IWF that are required, shall send a SIP 183
(Session Progress) response to the SIP INVITE request for IWF performing the
non-controlling role of a group homed in the IWF as specified in subclause
106.3.4.2.2.1 and shall populate the response with an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body containing the \
element set to \"true\".
11) if the IWF performing the non-controlling role determines that there are
no group members homed in the IWF that are required, may, according to local
policy, send a SIP 183 (Session Progress) response to the \"SIP INVITE request
for non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group\" as specified in
subclause 106.3.4.2.2.1;
12) shall invite each MCPTT group member determined in step 9) above, to the
group session, as specified in subclause 110.1.1.5.1; and
13) shall interact with the media plane toward MCPTT group members as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] subclause 6.3;
Unless a SIP response has been sent to the controlling MCPTT function as
specified in step 10 or 11 above, the IWF performing the non-controlling role
of a group homed in the IWF shall wait for the first SIP provisional response
or first SIP 200 (OK) response from one of the invited MCPTT clients or an
indication that one of the invited participants home in the IWF is affiliated,
before sending a response to the SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT
function of an MCPTT group.
Upon receiving the first 18x response to a SIP INVITE request sent to an
invited MCPTT client as specified in subclause 110.1.1.5.1, not containing a
P-Answer-State header field or an indication that a participant homed in the
IWF is affiliated, and if a SIP 183 (Session Progress) response has not
already been sent in response to the \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling
MCPTT function of an MCPTT group\", the IWF performing the non-controlling
role of a group homed in the IWF:
1) shall generate a SIP 183 (Session Progress) response as described in
subclause 106.3.4.2.2.1; and
2) shall forward the SIP 183 (Session Progress) response to the controlling
MCPTT function according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
When;
1) the IWF performing the non-controlling role receives;
a) the first 18x response to a SIP INVITE request sent to an invited MCPTT
client as specified in subclause 110.1.1.5.1, containing a P-Answer-State
header field with the value \"Unconfirmed\" as specified in IETF RFC 4964
[34]; or
b) an indication that a participant homed in the IWF is affiliated;
2) a SIP 183 (Session Progress) response has not already been sent in response
to the SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT
group; and
3) the IWF performing the non-controlling role of a group supports media
buffering;
then the IWF performing the non-controlling role of a group:
1) shall generate SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INVITE request as specified
in subclause 106.3.4.2.2.2 before continuing with the rest of the steps;
2) shall include in the SIP 200 (OK) response an SDP answer to the SDP offer
in the incoming SIP INVITE request as specified in subclause 106.3.4.2.1;
3) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]
subclause 6.3.5; and
NOTE 3: Resulting media plane processing is completed before the next step is
performed.
4) shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the controlling MCPTT function
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
If the IWF performing the non-controlling role does not determine that any
participants homed in the IWF are required, then upon receiving the first SIP
200 (OK) response to a SIP INVITE request sent to an invited MCPTT client as
specified in subclause 110.1.1.5.1 or an indication that a participant homed
in the IWF is affiliated, the IWF performing the non-controlling role of a
group:
1) shall generate SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INVITE request as specified
in subclause 106.3.4.2.2.2 before continuing with the rest of the steps;
2) shall include in the SIP 200 (OK) response an SDP answer to the SDP offer
in the incoming SIP INVITE request as specified in subclause 106.3.4.2.1;
3) shall interact with the media plane toward the MCPTT clients as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] subclause 6.3.5; and
NOTE 4: Resulting media plane processing is completed before the next step is
performed.
4) shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the controlling MCPTT function
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
If the IWF performing the non-controlling role determines that one or more
participants homed in the IWF are required, then the IWF performing the non-
controlling role of a group homed in the IWF shall wait until all SIP 200 (OK)
responses to SIP INVITE requests have been received from the required MCPTT
clients and all required participants homed in the IWF are affiliated before
sending a SIP 200 (OK) response back to the controlling MCPTT function, as
specified above.
If all invited MCPTT clients have rejected SIP INVITE requests with a SIP 3xx,
4xx, 5xx or 6xx response and no invited participants homed in the IWF have
affiliated, the non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group:
1) shall generate a SIP reject response as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
2) shall, from the list of reject response codes cached by the IWF performing
the non-controlling role of a group homed in the IWF, select the highest
prioritized cached reject response code as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [24];
and
3) shall send the reject response towards the controlling MCPTT function as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
###### 110.1.1.5.2.3 Joining an ongoing prearranged group call
Upon receipt of a \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling MCPTT function of
an MCPTT group\" and if a prearranged group call is already ongoing, the IWF
performing the non-controlling role of a group:
NOTE 1: The Contact header field of the SIP INVITE request contains the
\"isfocus\" feature media tag.
1) shall determine if the media parameters are acceptable and if not, reject
the request with a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response. Otherwise, continue
with the rest of the steps;
2) shall reject the SIP request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response and not
process the remaining steps if:
a) an Accept-Contact header field does not include the g.3gpp.mcptt media
feature tag; or
b) an Accept-Contact header field does not include the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\";
3) if the partner MCPTT system does not have a mutual aid relationship to
merge an ongoing prearranged call with the primary MCPTT system identified by
the contents of the P-Asserted-Identity, shall reject the \"SIP INVITE request
for non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group\" with a SIP 403
(Forbidden) response, with warning text set to \"128 isfocus already
assigned\" in a Warning header field as specified in subclause 4.4, and shall
not process the remaining steps;
4) shall cache the content of the SIP INVITE request, if received in the
Contact header field and if the specific feature tags are supported;
5) shall check if a Resource-Priority header field is included in the incoming
SIP INVITE request and may apply any preferential treatment to the SIP request
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];

8) shall instruct the media plane to initialise the switch to non-controlling
mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5] subclause 6.5.2.3;
NOTE 2: Resulting media plane processing is completed before the next step is
performed. The media plane indicates the state of the floor and if the state
is \"floor-taken\", information about the current speaker.
9) if the media plane provided information about the current speaker, cache
the information about the current speaker(s);
10) shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the controlling MCPTT function
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
Upon receipt of the SIP ACK request, the non-controlling MCPTT function of an
MCPTT group:
1) if information about a current speaker is cached:
a) shall generate a SIP INFO request as specified in subclause 106.3.4.1.3;
and
b) shall send the SIP INFO request to the controlling MCPTT function as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4];
2) shall instruct the media plane to finalise the switch to the non-

group homed in the IWF:
1) if keeping the prearranged group call active is according to the release
policy in subclause 106.3.8.1, shall request the media plane towards the MCPTT
clients to switch to controlling mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [5]
subclause 6.3.5;
NOTE 1: Resulting media plane processing is completed before the next step is
performed.
2) if a SIP BYE request was received, shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to
the SIP BYE request; and
3) if keeping the prearranged group call active is according to the release
policy in subclause 106.3.8.1 and if the IWF performing the non-controlling
role has at least one remaining MCPTT client that has subscribed to the
conference package, shall send a NOTIFY request to all MCPTT participants with
a subscription to the conference event package as specified in subclause
110.1.3.5.2.
Editor\'s note: Add subclause 110.1.3.5.2.
NOTE 2: The SIP NOTIFY request will indicate to MCPTT clients that all
participants, with the exception of the users belonging to the constituent
group homed in the IWF hosted by the IWF performing the non-controlling role,
have left the prearranged group call.
###### 110.1.1.5.3.1 Terminating procedures
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request that includes an MCPTT session identity
of an ongoing MCPTT session in the Request-URI, the IWF performing the non-
controlling role acts as a controlling MCPTT function towards the MCPTT client
and shall perform the actions in the subclause 110.1.1.4.5.1 with the
following clarifications:
1) the MCPTT session identity in the Contact header field of the SIP 200 (OK)
response shall be the MCPTT session identity generated by the IWF; and
2) the subclause 110.1.3.5.2 shall be used when sending the SIP NOTIFY request
for subscriptions to the conference event package.
###### 110.1.1.5.3.2 Late call entry initiated by IWF performing the non-
controlling role
When IWF performing the non-controlling role is notified that an MCPTT client
is newly affiliated or comes back from out of coverage, the IWF performing the
non-controlling role shall invite the MCPTT client to join an ongoing group
call homed in the IWF by following the procedures specified in subclause
110.1.1.5.1.
NOTE: How the IWF performing the non-controlling role is informed when an
MCPTT client comes back from out of coverage is out of scope of the present
document.
##### 110.1.1.5.4 SIP OPTIONS request authorization procedure
Upon receipt of an SIP OPTIONS request containing a P-Asserted-Identity header
field containing the public service identity of a MCPTT server not authorized
to send the SIP OPTIONS request, the IWF performing the non-controlling role
of an MCPTT group shall send a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [4] and exit this subclause.
Upon receipt of an SIP OPTIONS request containing a P-Asserted-Identity header
field containing the public service identity of a MCPTT server authorized to
send the SIP OPTIONS request, the IWF performing the non-controlling role of
an MCPTT group shall perform the actions in this subclause.
NOTE: The action of the IWF performing the non-controlling role of an MCPTT
group on receipt of the SIP OPTIONS request mimics the actions of the IWF
performing the non-controlling role of an MCPTT group on receipt of the SIP
INVITE request.
The IWF performing the non-controlling role shall:
1) if the IWF performing the non-controlling role does not recognize the group
identified by the SIP OPTIONS request, shall send the SIP 404 (Not Found)
response to the SIP OPTIONS request with the warning text set to \"113 group
document does not exist\" in a Warning header field as specified in TS 24.379
[81], subclause 4.4;
2) if the IWF performing the non-controlling role determines that one of the
following conditions are fulfilled:
a) if the constituent group homed in the IWF is a chat group and the rules for
joining a group conference as specified in subclause 106.3.5.3 are fulfilled;
or
b) if the constituent group homed in the IWF is a prearranged group and the
rules for initiating a prearranged group session as specified in 3GPP TS
24.379 [81], subclause 6.3.5.4, with the IWF acting as the non-controlling
MCPTT function;
then the IWF performing the non-controlling role:

iii) shall include the P-Asserted-Identity of the IWF performing the non-
controlling role of a group; and
3) if none of the conditions in step 2 above) are fulfilled, shall send a SIP
403 (Forbidden) response with the warning text set to \"119 user is not
authorised to initiate the group call\" in a Warning header field as specified
in TS 24.379 [81], subclause 4.4.
##### 110.1.1.5.5 Initiating a temporary group session
Upon receiving a \"SIP INVITE request for controlling MCPTT function of an
MCPTT group\" when a prearranged group session is not ongoing, the IWF
performing the non-controlling role shall:
NOTE 1: The difference between a \"SIP INVITE request for controlling MCPTT
function of an MCPTT group\" and a \"SIP INVITE request for non-controlling
MCPTT function of an MCPTT group\" is that the latter SIP INVITE request
contains the isfocus media feature tag in the Contact header field.
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP INVITE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF performing the non-controlling role may
include a Retry-After header field to the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error)
response as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [24]. Otherwise, continue with the rest

# 304 General
## 304.1 MCData overview
The MCData service supports communication between a pair of users (i.e. one-
to-one communication) and several users (i.e. group communication), where each
user has the ability to share data using Short Data Service (SDS.
The present document provides the signalling control protocol enhancements to
support the MCData architectural procedures for MCData SDS interworking
between on‑network Mission Critical users and users homed in the IWF, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.283[80].
The present document makes use of the existing IMS procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
The procedures in this document allow an on‑network MCData user to:
\- send a standalone SDS using signalling control plane to a user homed in the
IWF or to a group including at least one user homed in the IWF; and
\- send a standalone SDS using media plane to a user homed in the IWF or to a
group including at least one user homed in the IWF.
The procedures in this document allow a user homed in the IWF to:
\- send a standalone SDS using signalling control plane to an on‑network
MCData user or to a group of on‑network MCData users; and
\- send a standalone SDS using media plane to an on‑network MCData user or to
a group of on‑network MCData users.
The present document does not support the interworking of SDS sessions with
users homed in the IWF.
The MCData procedures provided by the present document refer to:
\- the media plane procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.582 [85]
\- the group management procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.481 [31];
\- the identity management procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.482 [49]; and
\- the security procedures defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
The following procedures are provided within this document:
\- common procedures are specified in clause 306;
\- procedures for registration in the IM CN subsystem and service
authorisation are specified in clause 307;
\- procedures for affiliation are specified in clause 308;
\- procedures for SDS are specified in clause 309;
\- procedures for transmission and reception control are specified in clause
311;
\- procedures for dispositions and notifications are specified in clause 312;
and
\- procedures for communication release are specified in clause 313.
Editor\'s note: check the above list before completion of the present
document.
The user homed in the IWF obtains access to the MCData service via the IWF.
The procedures by which the user homed in the IWF accesses the IWF are outside
the scope of the present document.
## 304.2 Identity, URI and address assignments
### 304.2.1 Public Service identities
In order to support MCData interworking with LMR, the following URI and
address assignments are assumed:
1) the IWF performing the participating role is configured to be reachable
using the public service identity of the IWF performing the participating role
that is serving the user homed in the IWF.
### 304.2.3 MCData client ID
The MCData client ID is described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 4.8.
## 304.5 MCData Protocol
Subclause 315 describes the TLV based message formats used in MCData
communications. Annex I of 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] describes the standard format
of the messages and the encoding rules for each type of information element.
## 304.6 Protection of sensitive XML application data
In certain deployments, for example, in the case that the MCData operator uses
the underlying SIP core infrastructure from the carrier operator, the MCData
operator can prevent certain sensitive application data from being visible in
the clear to the SIP layer. The following data are classed as sensitive
application data:
\- MCData ID;
\- MCData group ID;
\- alert indicator;
\- access token (containing the MCData ID); and
\- MCData client ID.
The above data is transported as XML content in SIP messages. in XML elements
or XML attributes.
NOTE: SIP layer protection terminates at the IWF.
Data is transported in attributes in the following circumstances in the
procedures in the present document:
\- an MCData ID, an MCData Group ID, and an MCData client ID in an XML
document published in SIP PUBLISH request for affiliation according to IETF
RFC 3856 [51];
\- an MCData ID or an MCData Group ID in XML document notified in a SIP NOTIFY
request for affiliation according to IETF RFC 3856 [51]; and
\- an MCData ID in application/resource-lists+xml document included in a SIP
MESSAGE or SIP INVITE request for one-to-one SDS, according to IETF RFC 5366
[20];
3GPP TS 33.180 [78] describes a method to provide confidentiality protection
of sensitive application data in elements by using XML encryption (i.e.
xmlenc) and in attributes by using an attribute confidentiality protection
scheme described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.6.2.3. Integrity
protection can also be provided by using XML signatures (i.e. xmlsig).
Protection of the data relies on a shared XML protection key (XPK) used to
encrypt and sign data:
\- between the MCData client and the MCData server, the XPK is a client-server
key (CSK); and
\- between MCData servers and an IWF, the XPK is a signalling protection key
(SPK).
The CSK (XPK) and a key-id CSK-ID (XPK-ID) are generated from keying material
provided by the key management server. Identity based public key encryption
based on MIKEY-SAKKE is used to transport the CSK between SIP end-points. The
encrypted CSK is transported from the MCData client to the MCData server when
the MCData client performs service authorisation as described in 3GPP TS
24.282 [82] clause 7 and is also used during service authorisation to protect
the access token.
The SPK (XPK) and a key-id SPK-ID (XPK-ID) are directly provisioned in the
MCData server and IWF.
Configuration in the MCData client, IWF and MCData server is used to determine
whether one or both of confidentiality protection and integrity protection are
required.
3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 4.6 provides examples of confidentiality and
integrity protection applied to application data.
## 304.7 Protection of TLV signalling and media content
The protection of TLV signalling and media content is based on 3GPP MCData
security solution as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
For different security requirements of different information elements of a
MCData message, the information elements of MCData messages are bifurcated in
the following components:
\- **MCData** **Data signalling payload** : information elements necessary for
identification and management of the MCData messages e.g. conversation
identifiers, session identifiers, transaction identifiers, disposition
requests, etc. This payload is confidentiality and integrity protected between
the MCData Client and the MCData server and between the MCData server and the
IWF.
\- **MCData** **Data payload** : the actual user payload for MCData user or
application consumption. This payload is confidentiality and integrity
protected between the MCData client and the IWF.
An SDS message can be sent over both signalling plane and media plane. When an
SDS message is sent using the signalling plane, the body included in the SIP
MESSAGE request, which carries MCData Data signalling payload, is protected
separately between each pair of entities if protection is applied. On the
other hand, the body included in the SIP MESSAGE request which carries the
MCData data payload is protected between the MC Data client and the IWF. The
procedures for the protection of the SDS messages over the signalling plane
are specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82]. Protection of SDS messages over the
media control plane is specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [85].
NOTE: The method by which SDS messages are protected between the IWF and the
user homed in the IWF is outside the scope of the present document.
## 304.9 Warning Header Field
### 304.9.1 General
An IWF can include a free text string in a SIP response to a SIP request. When
the IWF includes a free text string in a response to a SIP MESSAGE or SIP
INVITE request the free text string is included in a Warning header field as
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [24]. The IWF includes the Warning code set to 399
(miscellaneous warning) and includes the host name set to the host name of the
IWF.
EXAMPLE: Warning: 399 TETRA.gov.uk \"200 user not authorised to transmit
data\"
### 304.9.2 Warning texts
The warning texts are specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 4.9.2.

## 306.3 IWF performing MCData server role procedures
### 306.3.0 Introduction
The IWF operates as an MCData server when exchanging SDS messages with MCData
servers within the MC system. It does not communicate directly with MCData
clients. It does not support the FD service. Subclause 306.3 and its
subclauses describe the IWF operating as a controlling and participating
MCData server.
### 306.3.1 Distinction of requests at the IWF
#### 306.3.1.1 SIP MESSAGE request
The IWF shall; perform the role of an MCData server in distinguishing between
the following SIP MESSAGE requests for originations and terminations from 3GPP
TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.3.1.1. as described below:
\- SIP MESSAGE request routed to the terminating participating MCData function
with an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an
ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-
Service header field. Such requests are known as \"SIP MESSAGE request for
standalone SDS for terminating participating MCData function\";
\- SIP MESSAGE request routed to an MCData server with an Accept-Contact
header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value
of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", an ICSI value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-Service header
field, and with an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling MIME body containing
an SDS NOTIFICATION message Such requests are known as \"SIP MESSAGE request
for SDS disposition notification for MCData server\"; and
\- SIP MESSAGE request routed to the controlling MCData function with an
Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an
ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-
Service header field. Such requests are known as \"SIP MESSAGE request for
standalone SDS for controlling MCData function\".
If a SIP MESSAGE request is received at the IWF that is not in accordance with
the SIP MESSAGE requests listed above, then the IWF shall reject the SIP
MESSAGE request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response.
#### 306.3.1.2 SIP INVITE request
The IWF shall; perform the role of an MCData server in distinguishing between
the following SIP INVITE requests for originations and terminations from 3GPP
TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.3.1.2. as described below:
\- SIP INVITE request routed to the terminating participating MCData function
with an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an
ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-
Service header field and a \ element set to \"one-to-one-sds\"
or \"group-sds\" contained in an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body. Such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE request for standalone SDS over
media plane for terminating participating MCData function\";
\- SIP INVITE request routed to the controlling MCData function with an
Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an
ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-
Service header field and a \ element set to \"one-to-one-sds\"
or \"group-sds\" contained in an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body. Such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE request for controlling MCData
function for standalone SDS over media plane\";
\- SIP INVITE request routed to the terminating participating MCData function
with an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an
ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-
Service header field and a \ element set to \"one-to-one-sds-
session\" or \"group-sds-session\" contained in an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. Such requests are known as
\"SIP INVITE request for SDS session for terminating participating MCData
function\"; and
\- SIP INVITE request routed to the controlling MCData function with an
Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an

Service header field and a \ element set to \"one-to-one-sds-
session\" or \"group-sds-session\" contained in an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. Such requests are known as
\"SIP INVITE request for controlling MCData function for SDS session\".
### 306.3.2 Sending SIP requests and receiving SIP responses
#### 306.3.2.1 Generating a SIP MESSAGE request towards the terminating MCData
client
This subclause is referenced from other procedures. Refer to 3GPP TS 24.282
[82] subclause 6.3.2.1.
### 306.3.3 Retrieving a group document
How an IWF performing the controlling role of a group obtains information
about the group is out of scope of the present document.
NOTE: During the group regrouping operation as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481
[31], the IWF performing the controlling role is notified of the constituent
MCData group identities associated with the TGI.
### 306.3.4 Determining targeted group members for MCData communications
The IWF shall only send MCData messages to affiliated group members.
The IWF determines whether a user is affiliated to a group by following the
procedures in subclause 306.3.5.
The IWF performs the affiliation check in subclause 306.3.5 on each entry
contained in the \ element of the group document.
NOTE: How the IWF obtains the group document is out scope of the present
document.
### 306.3.5 Affiliation check
The IWF shall determine that the MCData user, with MCData ID, is affiliated to
the MCData group, with MCData Group ID, at the MCData client, with MCData
client ID, if the elements, as described in TS 24.282 [82] subclause 8.3.3.2,
exist with their expected values, as below:
1) an MCData group information entry with MCData group ID same as the MCData
group ID under consideration;
2) in the MCData group information entry found in 1, an MCData user
information entry with the MCData ID same as the MCData ID under
consideration;
3) in the MCData user information entry found in 2, an MCData client
information entry with MCData Client ID same as the MCData client ID under
consideration; and
4) in the MCData user information entry found in 2, an expiration time, which
has not expired.
NOTE: How the IWF determines which users homed in the IWF are affiliated to
the MCData group is out of scope of the present document.
## 306.4 Handling of MIME bodies in a SIP message
The IWF shall support several MIME bodies in SIP requests and SIP responses
according to 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.4.
## 306.5 Confidentiality and Integrity Protection of sensitive XML content
### 306.5.1 General
#### 306.5.1.1 Applicability and exclusions
The procedures in subclause 306.5 apply in general to all procedures described
in subclause 309, subclause 312 and subclause 313 with the exception that the
confidentiality and integrity protection procedures for the registration and
service authorisation procedures are described in subclause 307.
Editor's Note: The references to the subclauses will need to reviewed
depending on which subclauses are included in the current document from the
parent specification 3GPP TS 24.282 [82]
#### 306.5.1.2 Performing XML content encryption
Whenever the IWF includes XML elements or attributes pertaining to the data
specified in subclause 304.6 in SIP requests or SIP responses, the IWF shall
perform the procedures in subclause 306.5.2.3.2, with the exception that when
the MCData server receives a SIP request with XML elements or attributes in an
MIME body that need to be copied from the incoming SIP request to an outgoing
SIP request without modification, the MCData server shall perform the
procedures specified in subclause 306.5.2.5.
NOTE: The procedures in subclause 306.5.2.3.2 first determine (by referring to
configuration) if confidentiality protection is enabled and then call the
necessary procedures to encrypt the contents of the XML elements if
confidentiality protection is enabled.
#### 306.5.1.3 Performing integrity protection on an XML body
The IWF shall perform the procedures in subclause 306.5.3.3.2 just prior to
sending a SIP request or SIP response.
NOTE: The procedures in subclause 306.5.3.3.2 first determine if integrity
protection of XML MIME bodies is required and then calls the necessary
procedures to integrity protect each XML MIME body if integrity protection is
required. Each XML MIME body has its own signature.
### 306.5.2 Confidentiality Protection
#### 306.5.2.2 Keys used in confidentiality protection procedures
Confidentiality protection uses an XPK to encrypt the data which (depending on
who is the sender and who is the receiver of the encrypted information) can be
a CSK or an SPK as specified in subclause 304.6. In the case of an IWF as a
server sending or receiving to another server this key will be an SPK. An SPK-
ID is used to key the SPK. It is assumed that before the procedures in this
subclause are called, the SPK/SPK-ID are available on the sender and recipient
of the encrypted content as described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 4.6.
The procedures in subclause 306.5.2.3 and 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause
6.5.2.4 are used with an XPK equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID equal to the SPK-ID
when the IWF sends confidentiality protected content to an MCData server.
#### 306.5.2.3 Procedures for sending confidentiality protected content
##### 306.5.2.3.2 IWF performing the role of an MCData server
If the IWF performing the role of an MCData server determines locally that it
needs to confidentially protect content to an MCData server, then sending
confidentially protected content between MCData servers is enabled.
When sending confidentiality protected content, the IWF:
1) shall use the appropriate keying information specified in subclause
306.5.2.2;
2) shall perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.3.3 to
confidentiality protect XML elements containing the content described in
subclause 304.6; and
3) shall perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.3.4 to
confidentiality protect URIs in XML attributes for URIs described in subclause
304.6.
If the IWF determines locally that it does not need to confidentiality protect
content sent to an MCData server, then sending confidentiality protected
content between MCData servers is disabled, and the content is included in XML
elements and attributes without encryption.
#### 306.5.2.5 IWF copying received XML content
The following procedure is executed when an IWF receives a SIP request
containing XML MIME bodies, where the content needs to be copied from the
incoming SIP request to the outgoing SIP request.
The IWF:
1) shall copy the XML elements from the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request that do not contain a \ XML element, to the same XML
body in the outgoing SIP request;
2) for each encrypted XML element in the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request as determined by 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in subclause 306.5.2.2 to
decrypt the content within the XML element by following the procedures
specified in subclause 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] 6.5.2.4.2, and shall continue with
the steps below if the encrypted XML element was successfully decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in subclause
306.5.2.3.2, then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the content within the XML element using the keying
information described in subclause 306.5.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.3.3; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted content into the same XML MIME body of the
outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in subclause
306.5.2.3.2, shall include the decrypted content in the same XML MIME body of
the outgoing SIP request; and
3) for each encrypted XML URI attribute in the XML MIME body of the incoming
SIP request as determined by 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in subclause 306.5.2.2 to
decrypt the URI value of the XML attribute by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.4.3, and shall continue with
the steps below if the encrypted XML attribute value was successfully
decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in subclause
306.5.2.3.2, then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the URI value of the XML attribute using the keying
information described in subclause 306.5.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.2.3.4; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted attribute value into the same XML MIME body
of the outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in subclause
306.5.2.3.2, shall include the decrypted value in the same XML MIME body of
the outgoing SIP request.
### 306.5.3 Integrity Protection of XML documents
#### 306.5.3.2 Keys used in integrity protection procedures
Integrity protection uses an XPK to sign the data which (depending on who is
the sender and who is the receiver of the signed information) can be a CSK or
an SPK as specified in subclause 304.6. In the case of an IWF as a server
sending or receiving to another server this key will be an SPK. An SPK-ID is
used to key the SPK. It is assumed that before the procedures in subclause
306.5.3.3 and 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclauses 6.5.3.3.1, 6.5.3.3.3 and 6.5.3.4
are called, the SPK/SPK-ID are available on the sender and recipient of the
integrity protected content, as described in subclause 304.6.
The procedure in subclause 306.5.3.3 and 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.3.4
shall be used with a XPK equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID equal to the SPK-ID
when the IWF sends integrity protected content to an MCData server
Editor's Note: It is believed that the IWF will always use an SPK when
applying integrity protection for communication with other MCData servers,
including the case when it is originating a message on behalf of a user homed
in the IWF. If this is not the case then this subclause will require re-
wording.
#### 306.5.3.3 Sending integrity protected content
##### 306.5.3.3.2 Integrity protection at the IWF
The IWF determines locally whether sending integrity protected content from
the IWF to an MCData server is enabled.
When sending integrity protected content, the MCData server shall use the
appropriate keying information specified in subclause 306.5.3.2 and shall
perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] subclause 6.5.3.3.3 to integrity
protect XML MIME bodies.
NOTE: Each XML MIME body is integrity protected separately.
## 306.6 IWF Confidentiality and Integrity Protection of TLV messages
### 306.6.1 General
Signalling plane provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the
MCData data signalling and MCData data messages sent over the signalling
plane. Signalling plane security also provides the authentication of MCData
data messages.
The signalling plane security is based on 3GPP MCData security solution
including key management and end-to-end protection as defined in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78].
Various keys and associated key identifiers protect the MCData data signalling
and MCData data messages carried on the signalling plane.
The MCData signalling messages sent and received by an IWF are on-network
communications and do not include FD.
The MCData data signalling messages may be:
1\. SDS SIGNALLING PAYLOAD;
2\. SDS NOTIFICATION; or
3\. COMMUNICATION RELEASE.
The MCData data messages may be:
1\. DATA PAYLOAD.
In an on-network MCData communication for an MCData group, if protection of
MCData data messages is negotiated, the GMK and the GMK-ID of the MCData group
protect the MCData data messages sent and received by the IWF acting on behalf
of users homed in the IWF.
In an on-network one-to-one MCData communications, if protection of MCData
data messages is negotiated, the PCK and the PCK-ID protect the MCData data
messages sent and received by the IWF acting on behalf of MCData clients homed
in the IWF. The IWF acts as termination point for protection of one-to-one
MCData data messages that are sent and received by the IWF acting on behalf of
MCData clients homed in the IWF.
The protection of MCData communications between the user homed in the IWF and
the IWF acting on behalf of the user homed in the IWF is outside the scope of
the present document.
If protection of MCData data signalling messages between the IWF and another
MCData function acting in a participating or controlling role is configured,
the SPK and the SPK-ID protect the MCData data signalling messages sent and
received between the IWF and that MCData function.
The GMK and the GMK-ID are distributed to the IWF acting on behalf of users
homed in the IWF using the group document subscription and notification
procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [31].
The PCK and the PCK-ID are generated by the IWF initiating the standalone SDS
using signalling control plane or standalone one-to-one SDS using media plane
on behalf of the user homed in the IWF.
Editor\'s note: We will need to remove the \"standalone one-to-one SDS using
media plane\" if it gets de‑prioritized.
The SPK and the SPK-ID are configured in the IWF if it is acting as the
participating MCData function or if it is acting as the controlling MCData
function.
The key material for creating and verifying the authentication signature (SSK,
PVT and KPAK) is provisioned to the MCData clients by the KMS as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
### 306.6.3 Protection of MCData signalling and MCData messages
#### 306.6.3.1 General
The MCData messages may be encrypted and integrity protected between the IWF
and the MCData system. When encryption is applied the media shall be encrypted
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
Both unprotected MCData messages and MCData messages that are encypted and/or
integrity protected can also be end-to-end encrypted for interworking between
an MCData client and the IWF.
NOTE: The end to end encryption is independent of 3GPP encryption and is out
of scope of the present document.
# 307 Registration and service authorisation
## 307.3 IWF performing MCData server procedures
### 307.3.1 General
How the IWF authorises MCData service for users homed in the IWF is out of
scope of the present document.
# 308 Affiliation
## 308.1 General
Clause 308.2 describes the procedures for explicit affiliation by a user homed
in the IWF.
Clause 308.3 contains the IWF procedures for handling explicit affiliation by:
\- an MCData client to a group homed in the IWF; and
\- an IWF on behalf of a user homed in the IWF towards an MCData server owning

Clause 308.3 contains the IWF procedures for handling implicit affiliation by:
\- an MCData client to a group homed in the IWF; and
\- an IWF on behalf of a user homed in the IWF towards an MCData server owning
an MCData group.
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
IWF performing the participating role in the following circumstances:
\- when generating a SIP MESSAGE request on behalf of a user homed in the IWF
to initiate an MCData emergency alert targeted to an MCData group and the user
homed in the IWF is not already affiliated to that MCData group.
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
IWF performing the controlling role in the following circumstances:
\- on receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request from the participating MCData function
when the MCData user initiates an MCData emergency alert targeted to an MCData
group and the MCData client is not already affiliated to the MCData group.
Clause 308.4 describes the coding used for explicit affiliation.
## 308.2 Procedures for users homed in the IWF
The procedures regarding support in the IWF for users homed in the IWF are out
of scope of the present document.
## 308.3 IWF performing MCData server procedures
### 308.3.1 General
The procedures performed by the IWF in the role of the MCData server consist
of:
\- procedures of the IWF serving users homed in the IWF; and
\- procedures of the IWF owning the MCData group.
### 308.3.2 Procedures of the IWF performing the role of MCData server serving
users homed in the IWF
#### 308.3.2.1 General
The procedures of the IWF serving users homed in the IWF provide:
\- sending affiliation status change towards the MCData server owning an
MCData group in clause 308.3.2.6;
\- affiliation status determination from the MCData server owning an MCData
group in clause 308.3.2.7;
authorizing affiliation status change request in negotiated mode sent to a
user homed in the IWF in clause 308.3.2.8;

\- affiliation status change by implicit affiliation in clause 308.3.2.12;
\- implicit affiliation status change completion in clause 308.3.2.13;
\- implicit affiliation status change cancellation in clause 308.3.2.14; and
\- automatic affiliation to configured groups in clause 308.3.2.15.
#### 308.3.2.2 Stored information
The IWF maintains information equivalent to that defined in 3GPP TS 24.282
[82] subclause 8.3.2.2.
NOTE: The virtual data structure referenced in this subclause is for

## 309.1 General
The group administrator can disable the SDS service on a MCData group by
setting the \ element under the \ element, in the group document, to \"false\".
If the \ element under the \
element, in the group document, is set to \"false\" for a MCData group:
\- an IWF shall not send an SDS to the said MCData group on behalf of users
homed in the IWF.
\- an IWF performing the terminating MCData controlling role shall reject a
request to send SDS to the said MCData group.
### 309.2.2 Standalone SDS using signalling control plane
#### 309.2.2.1 General
The procedures in the subordinate clauses of the parent clause are used by the
IWF to send or receive:
\- a one-to-one standalone SDS message using the signalling control plane; or

#### 309.2.2.2 Procedures used by the IWF for users homed in the IWF
##### 309.2.2.2.1 Originating procedures
The IWF shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229
[4] and IETF RFC 3428 [33] with the clarifications given below.
The IWF:
1) if a one-to-one standalone SDS message is to be sent, shall insert in the
SIP MESSAGE request:
a) an application/resource-lists+xml MIME body with the MCData ID of the
target MCData user, according to rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4826 [89];
b) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with a \
element set to a value of \"one-to-one-sds\"; and
c) if end-to-end security is required and the security context does not exist
or if the existing security context has expired, an application/mikey MIME
body with the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78]. The
IWF:
i) if necessary, shall determine keying material from the key management
server as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
NOTE: How the IWF accesses the key management server is out of scope of the
present document.
ii) shall use the keying material to generate a PCK as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78];
iii) shall use the PCK to generate a PCK-ID with the four most significant
bits set to \"0001\" to indicate that the purpose of the PCK is to protect
one-to-one communications and with the remaining twenty eight bits being
randomly generated as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
iv) shall encrypt the PCK to a UID associated to the MCData client using the
MCData ID of the invited user and a time related parameter as described in
3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
v) shall generate a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE using the encapsulated PCK and PCK-
ID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
vi) shall add the MCData ID associated with the originating user homed in the
IWF to the initiator field (IDRi) of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78];
vii) shall sign the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE using the originating signing key
determined by the IWF performing the role of an MCData server provided in the
keying material together with a time related parameter; and
viii) shall include the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE in an application/mikey MIME
body as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
2) if a group standalone SDS message is to be sent:
a) shall insert in the SIP MESSAGE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body with:
i) the \ element set to a value of \"group-sds\";
ii) the \ element set to the MCData group identity; and
iii) the \ element set to the MCData client ID associated
with the originating user homed in the IWF; and
3) shall generate a standalone SDS message as specified in subclause
306.2.2.1.
##### 309.2.2.2.2 Terminating procedures
Upon receipt of an SDS intended for a user homed in the IWF, the IWF processes
the message according to the procedures in clause 309.2.2.3.2.
#### 309.2.2.3 IWF performing the Participating MCData function procedures
##### 309.2.2.3.1 Originating participating MCData function procedures
If the IWF acting as a participating MCData role determines that it needs to
send an SDS message:
1) shall determine the MCData ID of the originating user;
2) shall determine the public service identity of the controlling MCData
function associated with the requested SDS message:
a) if the SDS message to be sent is a group SDS message the public service
identity is that of the controlling MCData function associated with the MCData
group identity of the destination group; or
b) if the SDS message to be sent is a one-to-one SDS message the public
service identity is that of the controlling MCData function hosting the one-
to-one standalone SDS service for the calling user;
NOTE 1: How the IWF determines the public service identity of the controlling
MCData function is out of scope of the present document.
3) if unable to identify the controlling MCData function for standalone SDS
shall complete any further actions to notify the user homed in the IWF, and
shall not continue with any of the remaining steps;
4) shall ensure that the payload size of the message is not larger than a
configured value compatible with the MCData service;
NOTE 2: The term \"payload size\" refers to the \"Length of Payload contents\"
of the payload IE of the DATA PAYLOAD message transported in the SIP MESSAGE
request, minus 1 (to account for the added \"Payload content type\" field).
NOTE 3: The configured value for maximum payload size should not be larger
than the value contained in the \ element
in the MCData service configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484
[50]. How the IWF determines the value to configure is out of scope of the
present document.
5) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]
and IETF RFC 3428 [33];
6) shall set the Request-URI of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request to the public
service identity of the controlling MCData function as determined by step 2)
in this subclause;
7) shall include MIME bodies in to the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request according
to clause 309.2.2.2.1;
8) shall include the MCData ID of the originating user in the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
9) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]), into the P-Asserted-Service header
field of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
10) shall set the P-Asserted-Identity in the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request to
the public service identity of the IWF; and
11) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
Upon receipt of a SIP response in response to the SIP MESSAGE request in step
11) the IWF completes any further actions needed to handle the response --
e.g. notify the user homed in the IWF.
##### 309.2.2.3.2 IWF performing the Terminating participating MCData role
procedures
Upon receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request for standalone SDS for terminating
participating MCData function\", the IWF performing the participating role:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF may include a Retry-After header field to
the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as specified in IETF RFC 3261
[24] and skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall use the MCData ID present in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request to identify the user homed in the IWF;
3) if the user homed in the IWF does not exist, then the participating IWF
shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 404 (Not Found) response, and
shall not continue with the rest of the steps;
4) if the SIP MESSAGE request contains an application/mikey MIME body
containing a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE and decryption of the content of the MIME
body is to occur at the IWF, then the IWF:
a) shall extract the MCData ID of the originating MCData user from the
initiator field (IDRi) of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
b) shall convert the MCData ID to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
c) shall use the UID to validate the signature of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE as
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
d) if authentication verification of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE fails, shall
reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 606 (Not Acceptable) response, and
include warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE
failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in subclause 4.9 and not
continue with rest of the steps in this subclause; and
e) if the signature of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE was successfully validated:
i) shall extract and decrypt the encapsulated PCK using the terminating
user\'s (KMS provisioned) UID key as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78]; and
ii) shall extract the PCK-ID, from the payload as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180
[78]; and
NOTE: Any trans-encryption between the IWF and the user homed in the IWF is
out of scope of the present document.
5) takes any further steps necessary to handle the message -- e.g. notify the
user homed in the IWF.
If the IWF determines that a SIP 200 (OK) response shall be sent on behalf of
a user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP message request, the IWF shall
send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the controlling MCData function according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
If the IWF determines that a SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response shall be sent on
behalf of a user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP message request, the
IWF shall send said SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the controlling MCData
function according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]:
1) shall determine which Warning header field(s) to place in the SIP response;
and
2) shall send the SIP response to the controlling MCData function according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].

# 312 Dispositions and Notifications
## 312.1 General
The procedures in clause 312 describe:
\- the on-network procedures for generating out-of-band dispositions for on-
network SDS.
The IWF acting on behalf of a participant homed in the IWF can send a
disposition notification as a direct result of receiving an MCData message
(e.g. delivery notification) or can send a disposition notification at a later
time (e.g. read notification). In certain circumstances the delivery and read
notification can be delivered in one notification message.
## 312.2 On-network disposition notifications
### 312.2.1 Procedures of the IWF performing the participating role on behalf
of the user homed in the IWF
#### 312.2.1.1 Sending a disposition notification message
The IWF performing the participating role can follow the procedures in this
clause if it decides to:
\- indicate to an MCData client that an SDS message was delivered, read or
delivered and read when the originating client requested a delivery, read or
delivery and read report; or
\- indicate to the participating MCData function serving the MCData user that
an SDS message was undelivered. The participating MCData function can store
the message for later re-delivery.
Before sending a disposition notification the IWF performing the participating
role needs to determine:
\- the group identity related to an SDS message request received as part of a
group communication. The IWF performing the participating role determines the
group identity from the contents of the \ element
contained in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the
incoming SDS message request; and
\- the MCData user targeted for the disposition notification. The IWF
performing the participating role determines the targetted MCData user from
the contents of the \ element contained in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SDS message
request.
The IWF performing the participating role generates a SIP MESSAGE request in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] and IETF RFC 3428 [33] with the
clarifications given below.
The IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall build the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause 306.2.4.1;
2) shall follow the rules specified in clause 306.4 for the handling of MIME
bodies in a SIP message when processing the remaining steps in this clause;
3) shall insert in the SIP MESSAGE request an application/resource-lists+xml
MIME body containing the MCData ID of the targeted MCData user, according to
rules and procedures of IETF RFC 5366 [20];
4) if sending a disposition notification in response to an MCData group data
request, shall include an \ element set to the MCData
group identity in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
5) if requiring to send an SDS notification, shall generate an SDS
NOTIFICATION message and include it in the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in
clause 306.2.3.1; and
6) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
### 312.2.2 Participating IWF procedures
#### 312.2.2.1 IWF performing the MCData participating role
If the IWF acting in a MCData participating role determines that it shall send
a disposition notification
the IWF shall follow the procedures of clause 312.2.1.1.
Upon receipt of a SIP 202 (Accepted) response in response to the SIP MESSAGE
request, the IWF:
1) shall complete any further actions needed to notify the user homed in the
IWF.
Upon receipt of a SIP 200 (OK) response in response to the SIP MESSAGE
request, the IWF:
1) shall complete any further actions needed to notify the user homed in the
IWF.
Upon receipt of a SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the SIP MESSAGE request, the
IWF:
1) shall complete any further actions needed to notify the user homed in the
IWF.
#### 312.2.2.2 Participating IWF receives disposition notification from a
Controlling MCData function
Upon receipt of a:
\- \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for terminating
MCData client \";
The IWF:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF may include a Retry-After header field to
the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4]
and skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall use the MCData ID present in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request to identify the user homed in the IWF;
3) if the identity of the user homed in the IWF does not exist, then the
participating IWF shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 404 (Not
Found) response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps; and
4) shall notify the user homed in the IWF.
If the IWF determines that a SIP 2xx response shall be sent on behalf of a
user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP MESSAGE requests, the IWF shall
send a SIP 2xx response to the controlling MCData function.
If the IWF determines that a SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response shall be sent on
behalf of a user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP MESSAGE request, the
IWF shall send the response to the controlling MCData function.
### 312.2.3 IWF performing the MCData controlling role
Upon receipt of a:
\- \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for MCData server\";
or
\- if the IWF determines that it shall send an SDS disposition notification
the IWF performing the MCData controlling role:
1) if the IWF has received the SIP MESSAGE;
a) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF may include a Retry-After header field to
the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as specified in IETF RFC 3261
[24]. Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps;
b) shall reject the SIP request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response and not
process the remaining steps if an Accept-Contact header field does not include
the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\";
c) if the incoming SIP MESSAGE request does not contain an
application/resource-lists MIME body or contains an application/resource-lists
MIME body with more than one \ element, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE
request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response including warning text set to
\"145 unable to determine called party\" in a Warning header field as
specified in subclause 4.4, and shall not continue with the rest of the steps;
d) shall attempt to correlate the disposition notification to the original SDS
request using the values contained in the Conversation ID and Message ID of
the SDS NOTIFICATION message contained in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
signalling MIME body of the SIP MESSAGE; and
e) if unable to correlate the disposition notification as determined by step
d), shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response
including warning text set to \"216 unable to correlate the disposition
notification\" in a Warning header field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82]
subclause 4.4, and shall not continue with the rest of the steps;
2) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]
and IETF RFC 3428 [33];
3) when sending an SDS disposition notification:
a) shall include an Accept-Contact header field containing the
g.3gpp.mcdata.sds media feature tag along with the \"require\" and
\"explicit\" header field parameters according to IETF RFC 3841 [6] in the
outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
b) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag
g.3gpp.icsi-ref with the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" along with parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" according to IETF RFC 3841 [6] in the outgoing SIP MESSAGE
request;
4) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity of the terminating
participating MCData function associated to the MCData user to be invited or
the public service identity of the IWF of the participant homed in the IWF to
be invited;
NOTE 1: How the IWF finds the address of the terminating MCData participating
function is out of the scope of the current release.
5) shall include a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\";
6) shall copy the public user identity of the calling MCData user or the
public user identity of the IWF of the participant homed in the IWF from the
P-Asserted-Identity header field of the incoming SIP MESSAGE request into the
P-Asserted-Identity header field of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
7) shall copy the MCData ID of the MCData user or participant homed in the IWF
listed in the MIME resources body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE request, into
the \ element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
8) if an incoming SIP MESSAGE request contains an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body with an \ element:
a) shall retrieve the group document for the MCData group id contained in the
\ element from the group management server, if not
already cached, and identify the group members;
NOTE 2: How the IWF obtains the group document is out scope of the present
document.

# Annex A: Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] for non-controlling check
of user profile
# A.1 General
Editor\'s note: The subclauses in this annex are intended to be applied as CRs
to 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] directly, whether or not the other clauses in the
present document become a new TS or are moved to existing TSs. The letter A is
prepended to target 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] subclause title numbers. References
within the subclauses do not prepend the letter A since the text body will be
directly ported to 3GPP TS 24.379 [81]. The following markup is required, so
that it survives when tracking is cleared on the TR and still indicate the
changes required to 3GPP TS 24.379 [81]: deleted text is highlighted in red,
added text highlighted in green. Additionally, added text will be with
underlined font and deleted text will be with a strikethru font.
The present annex provides one approach for checking user profile information
in a multi-system scenario. In the current release of 3GPP TS 24.379, the
controlling function checks the user profile document for the user\'s
authorization to initiate priority calls and emergency alerts. Where the
controlling function is in a partner system, the originating system is better
suited to check the user profile. The approach in the present annex moves the
user profile checks to a non-controlling function in the originating system.
### A.5.3.2 Functional connectivity models
The following figures give an overview of the connectivity between the
different functions of the MCPTT server as described in subclause 5.3.1.
NOTE: Separate boxes are shown for each of the functions of the MCPTT server.
In each MCPTT system, these functions can be physically combined into one
MCPTT server or can be implemented on more than one MCPTT server. For example,
there could be an instantiation of an MCPTT server that only serves as a
controlling MCPTT function, but not as a participating MCPTT function for any
MCPTT clients. When an MCPTT server supports more than one function, then
sending requests from one function to another does not incur a traversal of
the underlying IMS SIP core network.
Figure 5.3.2-1 shows the basic functions of the MCPTT server when operating
within the primary MCPTT system.
Figure 5.3.2-1: Functions of the MCPTT server in the primary MCPTT system
Figure 5.3.2-2 shows the use of the non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT
group within the primary MCPTT system. This can occur due to group re-grouping
of groups within the same MCPTT system, where the MCPTT server(s) of one or
more of the constituent groups are not controlled by the same controlling
MCPTT function as that of the temporary group. The non-controlling MCPTT
function of an MCPTT group either provide the identities of the users of the
group to the controlling MCPTT function, or the non-controlling MCPTT function
of an MCPTT group can invite the users of the group on behalf of the
controlling MCPTT function.
Figure 5.3.2-2: The non-controlling function operating in the primary MCPTT
system
Figure 5.3.2-3 shows the roles of the MCPTT server in a mutual aid
relationship between a primary MCPTT system and a partner MCPTT system. Here,
the controlling MCPTT function is in the primary MCPTT system and the called
user is homed in a partner MCPTT system.
Figure 5.3.2-3: Mutual aid relationship between the primary MCPTT system and a
partner MCPTT system with the controlling MCPTT function in the primary MCPTT
system
Figure 5.3.2-4 shows the roles of the MCPTT server in a mutual aid
relationship between a primary MCPTT system and a partner MCPTT system. Here,
the controlling MCPTT function is in the partner MCPTT system.
Figure 5.3.2-4: Mutual aid relationship between the primary MCPTT system and a
partner MCPTT system with the controlling MCPTT function in the partner MCPTT
system
Figure 5.3.2-5 shows the roles of the MCPTT server in a mutual aid
relationship between a primary MCPTT system and a partner MCPTT with the use
of a non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group within the partner MCPTT
system. This can occur due to group re-grouping where the MCPTT server(s) of
one or more of the constituent groups are homed on the partner system. If the
primary MCPTT system and partner MCPTT system operate in a trusted mutual aid
relationship, then the non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group can
provide the identities of the users of the group to the controlling MCPTT
function. If the primary MCPTT system and partner MCPTT system operate in an
untrusted mutual aid relationship, then the non-controlling MCPTT function of
an MCPTT group invites the users of the group on behalf of the controlling
MCPTT function.
Figure 5.3.2-5: Mutual aid relationship between the primary MCPTT system and a
partner MCPTT system involving the use of a non-controlling MCPTT function of
an MCPTT group in the partner MCPTT system
Figure 5.3.2-6 illustrates a functional connectivity model involving multiple
partner systems where the partner system that owns the group does not home any
of the group members.
Figure 5.3.2-6: Mutual aid relationship between the primary MCPTT system and
more than one partner MCPTT system
Other functional connectivity models can exist.
#### A.6.3.1.1 SIP INVITE request
The MCPTT server needs to distinguish between the following initial SIP INVITE
requests for originations and terminations:
\- SIP INVITE requests routed to the participating MCPTT function as a result
of processing initial filter criteria at the S-CSCF in accordance with the
origination procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] with the Request-URI
set to a public service identity of the participating MCPTT function that
identifies the pre-established session set-up. Such requests are known as

listening call\" in the procedures in the present document.
##### A.6.3.3.1.12 Populate mcptt-info and location-info MIME bodies for
emergency alert
This subclause is referenced from other procedures.
This subclause describes the procedures for populating the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml and application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-location-
info+xml MIME bodies for an MCPTT emergency alert. The procedure is initiated
by the controlling MCPTT function when it has received a SIP request
initiating an MCPTT emergency alert and generates a message containing the
MCPTT emergency alert information required by 3GPP TS 23.379 [3].
The controlling MCPTT function:
1) shall include, if not already present, an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
info+xml MIME body as specified in Annex F.1, and set the \ element
to a value of \"true\";
