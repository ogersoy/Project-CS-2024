where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical

incorporated in the document.
In the present document, certain modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
NOTE 1: The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
NOTE 2: The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as
substitutes for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct
citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain
continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a
referenced document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
NOTE 3: The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
NOTE 4: The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" shall not to be used as
substitutes for \"may\" and \"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
NOTE 5: The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 General
For time sensitive communication (TSC), a 5G system (5GS) can be integrated as
a bridge in a time-sensitive networking (TSN) network (i.e. a TSN bridge). The
device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) is deployed at the UE-side edge and the
network-side TSN translator (NW-TT) is deployed at the network-side edge in
order to interface with a TSN network while achieving transparency (see 3GPP
TS 23.501 [2]).
The DS-TT and NW-TT fulfil all functions related to IEEE 802.1AS [4], which
include delivery of generalized precision time protocol (gPTP) messages.
Clause 5 describes details of the gPTP message delivery.
# 5 gPTP message delivery
## 5.1 Overview
For TSN time synchronization, a 5G system (5GS) can be considered as a time-
aware system, which needs to support implementation of generalized precision
time protocol (gPTP) requirements (see IEEE 802.1AS [4]).
Within a 5GS, a gPTP message is delivered over the user plane. While the
generic mechanisms for the gPTP message delivery are according to IEEE Std
802.1AS [4], a specific requirement for the DS-TT and the NW-TT is available
in terms of the signalling of ingress time. See clause 5.2 for further
details.
## 5.2 Signalling of ingress time for time synchronization
Upon reception of a downlink gPTP message (Sync message for one-step operation
or Follow_Up message for two-step operation) for a given TSN working domain,
the NW-TT shall create an ingress timestamping (TSi) for each gPTP event
(Sync) message and add Suffix field with TSi to the gPTP message encoded as
specified in clause 5.3.1.
Upon reception of a gPTP message over the user plane, the UE shall forward the
gPTP message to the DS-TT. The DS-TT shall create an egress timestamping (TSe)
for every gPTP event (Sync) message. The DS-TT shall use TSi from the Suffix
field of the gPTP message (Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_Up
message for two-step operation) to calculate the residence time spent within
the 5G system for the gPTP event (Sync) message expressed in 5GS time as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] for the corresponding TSN working domain, then
shall remove the Suffix field that contains TSi from the gPTP message before
sending the gPTP message toward the downstream TSN node.
In case of multiple TSN working domains, the procedure above is repeated for
each TSN working domain sending its own gPTP messages.
In case of a gPTP message (Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_Up
message for two-step operation) locally generated by the NW-TT (i.e.
synchronization is provided by the 5G clock), the NW-TT makes the time
generating the gPTP event (Sync) message as TSi and add Suffix field with TSi
to the gPTP message encoded as specified in clause 5.3.1.
## 5.3 Encoding of organization specific TLV extensions
### 5.3.1 General
Organization specific TLV extensions are included the Suffix field of a gPTP
message as specified in clause 14.3 of IEEE Std 1588-2008 [3]. The Suffix
field is coded as shown in figure 5.3.1.1 and table 5.3.1.1.
+----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | | +----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | TLV type | octet 1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet2 | | | | | | | | +----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Length of TLV | octet 3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet 4 | | | | | | | | +----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Organization Id | octet 5 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet 7 | | | | | | | | +----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Organization Subtype | octet 8 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet 10 | | | | | | | | +----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Data field | octet 11 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet n | | | | | | | | +----------------------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Editor\'s note: The value of the OUI for 3GPP needs to be assigned by the
IEEE.

The Data field of a TLV extension carrying an Ingress timestamp is coded as
shown in figure 5.3.2.1 and table 5.3.2.1.
