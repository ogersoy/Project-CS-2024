# 4 Overview
## 4.1 General principles
Business trunking refers to an architecture where corporate networks appear to
the NGN as an NGCN. Although the interface between an NGCN and an NGN is IP-
based, this does not preclude the existence of non-IP-based elements within
the NGCN but not visible to the NGN. The NGCN appears to the NGN as a black
box.
## 4.2 Access network interconnection
NGCN sites may be connected to any IP-connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN)
valid for TISPAN NGN using a Customer Network Gateway (CNG), as defined in
ETSI ES 282 001 [2] or connected to an NGN core network via an edge router of
the enterprise.
Connection to an IP-CAN includes the case where the NGCN site incorporates a
CNG as defined in ETSI TS 185 003 [15], connected to a DSL-based access
network (see figure 4.1) as well as the case where the NGCN site comprises a
corporate LAN with one or more edge routers playing the role of a CNG
connected to access nodes in the operator\'s access network (see figure 4.2).
NOTE 1: Use of the \"SIP Proxy/B2BUA\" function within the CNG, as defined in
ETSI TS 185 003 [15], is not applicable to the present release of the present
document.
NOTE 2: Within an NGCN site, the CNG functionality may be collocated with an
NGCN host or a stand-alone equipment unit.
Towards an access network, the NGCN site acts as a UE. For further details see
clause 7.
Towards the IM CN subsystem, the entry point / exit point entity is dependent
on the approach adopted and is described further in clause 6.
An NGCN connects a multiplicity of endpoints to the network, each of which may
be an IP device or a legacy phone. The NGN does not need to have any knowledge
on the individual endpoints connected to the NGCN.
With the subscription based approach, for each NGCN site, the Home Subscriber
Server (HSS) stores a single public user identity and a single associated user
profile enabling triggering of network-based services beyond those provided by
the NGCN itself. A set of telephone numbers and/or SIP URIs are also
associated with each NGCN site. The former could be expressed in the form of
number ranges and the latter using wildcards in the user or host part.
Figure 4.1: DSL access
Figure 4.2: Corporate LAN access
Identifiers based on private numbers shall be handled in accordance with ETSI
TR 102 634 [20].
## 4.3 Service level layer interconnection
The service level layer interconnection makes use of IMS. Two main
interconnection arrangements are provided:
\- Interconnection of the NGN and NGCN where the entry point to the IMS is the
P-CSCF. This is known as the subscription-based approach. This is represented
by scenario 5 in subclause 8.3 of 3GPP TS 24.523 [7]. In this case each site
of the NGCN has a service subscription to the IMS, with an appropriate entry
in the HSS. An AS is used to provide business trunking applications, e.g.
those defined in 3GPP TS 22.519 [1], subclause 4.4. If such capabilities are
not required, then the AS is not included in any request processing. The
service level capabilities of this scenario are described further in subclause
6.1.
\- Interconnection of the NGN and NGCN where the entry point to the IMS is the
IBCF. This is known as the peering-based approach. This is represented by
scenario 6 in subclause 8.4 of 3GPP TS 24.523 [7]. In this case there is no
dynamic registration to the IMS of individual NGCN-users or NGCN-sites.
However, the absence of such dynamic registrations in an HSS does not preclude
the NGN to host enterprise specific data in an HSS. The service level
capabilities of this scenario are described further in subclause 6.2.
The second of these arrangements is called the peering-based approach due to
the similarity of the arrangement to the mechanism by which the IMS in two
NGNs interconnect. The provision of the business trunking applications (e.g.
those defined in 3GPP TS 22.519 [1], subclause 4.4) is realized by an
intelligent routeing function, which may involve an AS depending on the actual
enterprise specific data.
In none of the arrangements do the private extensions behind the NGCN need
their own service subscription within the NGN, since they are owned and
managed by the NGCN. The private extensions register with the NGCN, and the
NGCN provides the individual services to the private extensions.
An architecturally similar case to the peering-based approach is represented
by scenario 3 in subclause 7.1 of 3GPP TS 24.523 [7]. In this case, SIP
requests at one entry point are always routed to the same exit point, and no
business trunking applications are provided. The service level capabilities of
this scenario are described further in subclause 6.3 of the present document.
This scenario carries private network traffic only.
# 5 Functional architecture
## 5.1 General
The architectural split of the service layer and transport layer (used in the
description below) is defined in ETSI ES 282 001 [2].
## 5.2 Subscription based business trunking
### 5.2.1 General
This describes the architectural requirements for the connection of an NGCN
site to the NGN using the P-CSCF as an entry point at the service layer.
Subclause 8.3 of 3GPP TS 24.523 [7] shows the arrangement of the involved
functional entities.
### 5.2.2 Used functional entities at the service layer
The main functional entities from the IMS service layer as specified in ETSI
ES 282 007 [4] that are used to realise subscription-based business trunking
arrangements are as follows:
\- P-CSCF;
\- S-CSCF;
\- AS (in case a business trunking application is required); and
\- HSS.
NOTE: The above list includes only those entities where specific functionality
is applied to realise business communication in this scenario. Entities which
otherwise transport, but apply no special processing, e.g. I-CSCF, are not
listed.
Within the AS, the additional services can be provided by the home network
operator, or can be provided by a third party service provider. It is also
possible that the enterprise itself provides the services, by providing
equipment that acts as an application server beyond an ISC gateway function.
A description of specific procedures executed to provide subscription-based
business trunking can be found in subclause 6.1.
### 5.2.3 Used reference points at the service layer
The main reference points from the IMS service layer as specified in ETSI ES
282 007 [4] that are used to realise subscription-based business trunking
arrangements are as follows:
\- Gm (this reference point forms the point of interconnection between the
NGCN site and the NGN at the service layer);
\- Mw;
\- Cx;
\- ISC (in case a business trunking application is required);
\- Sh (in case a business trunking application is required);
\- e2; and
\- Gq\'.
NOTE: The above list includes only those interfaces where specific protocol is
applied to realise business communication in this scenario.
### 5.2.4 Used functional entities at the transport layer
The main functional entities from the transport layer as specified in ETSI ES
282 007 [4] that are used to realise subscriptionâ€‘based business trunking
arrangements are as follows:
\- BGF (whether an I-BGF or a C-BGF performs this function requires further
study).
NOTE: The above list includes only those entities where specific functionality
is applied to realise business communication in this scenario. Entities which
otherwise transport, but apply no special processing, are not listed.
### 5.2.5 Used reference points at the transport layer
The main reference points from the transport layer as specified in ETSI ES 282
007 [4] that are used to realise subscriptionâ€‘based business trunking
arrangements are as follows:
\- none identified.
NOTE: The above list includes only those interfaces where specific protocol is
applied to realise business communication in this scenario.
## 5.3 Peering-based business trunking
### 5.3.1 General
This describes the architectural requirements for the connection of an NGCN
site to the NGN using the IBCF as an entry point at the service layer.
Subclause 8.4 of 3GPP TS 24.523 [7] shows the arrangement of the involved
functional entities.
Optionally an AS may be used to provide business trunking applications, e.g.
those defined in clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 22.519 [1]. One mechanism to support
such functionality is to use an AS attached to a transit function (see 3GPP TS
23.218 [33]) using the ISC interface. Based on an SLA with the NGCN concerned
this option is administrated in the related subscriber profile in an HSS.
{width="4.490277777777778in" height="2.5284722222222222in"}
Figure 5.1: Originating Side with AS and HSS
Because the **routeing** function in the originating scenario has to behave
like a CSCF performing originating procedures, the IBCF provokes this by
insertion of an originate-indication in the forwarded request (e.g. \"orig\"
parameter in the related Route header field).
NOTE: The IBCF capability to invoke originating services is added in 3GPP TS
23.228 [17].
Figure 5.2: Terminating Side with AS and HSS
If business trunking applications are to be provided to the destination NGCN,
the CSCF routeing capabilities of the routeing function invoke the AS based on
the related NGCN specific data in the HSS.
### 5.3.2 Used functional entities at the service layer
The main functional entities from the IMS service layer as specified in ETSI
ES 282 007 [4] that are used to realise peering-based business trunking
arrangements are as follows:
\- routeing function;
\- IBCF;
\- if business applications are to be provided (e.g. those defined in
subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 22.519 [1]): HSS containing NGCN specific data; and
\- if business applications are to be provided (e.g. those defined in
subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 22.519 [1]): AS.
The routeing function represents the routeing capabilities available in IMS
entities. In basic scenarios the routeing capabilities of the Transit Function
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [17], subclause 5.19 are sufficient while in more
advanced scenarios where Application Servers have to be involved to provide
enhanced functionality, the routeing capabilities of one or more CSCF are
required.
On the originating side the IBCF is capable of indicating whether an incoming
SIP request is to be handled as an originating request by subsequent nodes in
the IMS (see 3GPP TS 23.228 [17], subclause 4.14).
NOTE: The above list includes only those entities where specific functionality
is applied to realise business communication in this scenario. Entities which
otherwise transport, but apply no special processing, e.g. BGCF, are not
listed.
A description of specific procedures executed to provide peering-based
business trunking can be found in subclause 6.2.
### 5.3.3 Used reference points at the service layer

282 007 [4] that are used to realise peeringâ€‘based business trunking
arrangements are as follows:

\- Mx;
\- Cx (in case business trunking applications are to be provided);
\- Sh (in case business trunking applications are to be provided); and

282 007 [4] that are used to realise sessionâ€‘level virtual leased line
arrangements are as follows:

# 6 Procedures
## 6.1 Subscription based business trunking
### 6.1.1 Introduction
In addition to the procedures specified in the subclause 6.1, the NGCN site
shall comply with the requirements identified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18],
subclause 4.1 for a UE, and specifically for a UE performing the functions of
an external attached network.
In addition to the procedures specified in the subclause 6.1, all functional
IMS entities shall support the procedures appropriate for these entities
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18] and in 3GPP TS 24.628 [10].
### 6.1.2 Identification
Each NGCN site is allocated a pair of private and public user identities. This
public user identity is also known as the NGCN site identifier; this public
user identity has to be a valid corporate network user identifier.
NGCN user identifiers are owned and managed by the enterprise. NGCN user
identifiers are not stored in the HSS.
To be able to support routeing to NGCN users registered in an NGCN, through
the connection with a specific NGCN site, an NGN shall support implicit
registration of one or more wildcarded public user identities in addition to
the implicit registration of one or more distinct public user identities. The
implicitly registered identities associated with the registration of a
particular NGCN site shall be determined by agreement between the NGCN and
NGN.
NOTE: The wildcarded public user identity consists of a delimited regular
expression located in the telephone-subscriber portion of a tel URI (e.g. tel:
+3314529! [0-9]{4}!) or in the user portion of a SIP URI (e.g.
sip:!.*!\@example.com). The wildcarded public user identity is configured in
the HSS as part of the implicit registration set of the subscription for a
corporate network identifier.
A specific public user identifier is referred to as an NGCN user identifier if
it matches a distinct public user identifier or a wildcarded public user
identifier that is contained in the implicit registration set associated with
an NGCN site identifier.
The NGN shall support implicit registration of NGCN user identifiers (specific
or wildcarded) where the domain belongs to an enterprise.
For the purpose of processing incoming and outgoing calls the identity of each
NGCN user behind an NGCN site is handled as a distinct public user identity
possibly within a public user identity range or subdomain.
### 6.1.3 Registration
Registration of the NGCN site in the IMS is required. Registration shall rely
on standard registration procedures for the IM CN subsystem, based on the pair
of private user identity and public user identity representing the NGCN site
as a whole.
NOTE 1: For NGCN sites that do not support IMS registration procedure,
approaches like surrogate registration or configuration can be used as a
fallback. The details of such approaches are out of scope of the present
document.
Upon successful registration an implicit registration set conforming to the
requirements of subclause 6.1.2, will be provided from the HSS to the S-CSCF,
the P-CSCF and the UE representing the NGCN site.
As part of the successful registration a security association as required by
the access security requirements in 3GPP TS 33.203 [16] will be established
between the NGCN site and the P-CSCF that the NGCN site used for registration.
This security association is used to secure the signalling between the P-CSCF
and the NGCN site. Also as the security association is formed based on mutual
authentication of the NGCN site and the NGN, requests that the P-CSCF receives
over such a security association are known to come from that NGCN site and no
other entity.
NOTE 2: Although the term \"security association\" is often used in relation
with IP-sec, in the above paragraph this term is also assumed to apply to
equivalent procedures in other security mechanisms as specified in the access
security requirements of 3GPP TS 33.203 [16].
The NGN will need to be configured to understand the presence of an attached
NGCN instead of a normal UE.
The NGN shall support provisioning of a special \"loose route\" indication in
the user profile if the NGCN site requires loose routing procedures to be
applied by the NGN. When available this indication is sent from the HSS to
S-CSCF during registration as a result of performing the Cx Server Assignment
procedure.
An NGCN site shall initiate initial registration when one of following events
occurs:
\- The NGCN site attachment point is powercycled.
\- The NGCN site attachment point is allocated a new IP address.
\- The IP address of the P-CSCF as reported by the DNS has changed and the
NGCN site is registered through that P-CSCF.
NOTE 3: The above criteria are applicable for registration through a single
P-CSCF and registration through multiple P-CSCFs.
\- No response is received to a keep-alive request and the NGCN site is
registered through a single P-CSCF.
\- An initial request fails due to a transport failure of some sort
(generally, due to fatal ICMP errors in UDP or connection failures in TCP),
the transaction layer times out without ever having received any response,
provisional or final (i.e. timer B or timer F in IETF RFC 3261 [21] fires) and
the NGCN site is registered through a single P-CSCF.
NOTE 4: The case where the NGCN site has registered an AOR through multiple
P-CSCF instances is addressed in subclause 6.1.5.
### 6.1.4 Requests originating from an NGCN user entering NGN
#### 6.1.4.1 General
The procedures for handling of requests from an NGCN especially applying to
identities are very different depending on whether or not the NGCN is part of
the same trust domain for asserted identities as the NGN, and if not, whether
the NGCN is considered as privileged sender or not. To highlight those
differences, three separate clauses below describe the procedure for:
\- an NGCN not considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN;
\- an NGCN considered as privileged sender and trusted by NGN; and
\- an NGCN considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN.
Trust domain for asserted identity is defined in IETF RFC 3324 [22]. To be
meaningful in a particular domain it requires the definition of a Spec(T) that
specifies the requirements that all entities in the trust domain need to
comply with. The Spec(T) to be used should be covered in the SLA.
INVITE requests sent by an NGCN site may include a P-Early-Media header with
the \"supported\" parameter.
In the event of the P-Early-Media header not being present in an 18x message
and a media flow being received, such a media flow is not forwarded in most
cases. However, under these circumstances, an NGCN site may, as an NGCN
option, forward the received media flow to the end-user and disable any
locally generated call progress tones.
NOTE: This behaviour enables managing the case when the NGCN site and/or the
remote entity generating early media do not support the P-Early-Media header.
The To header field may contain any URI format. The Request-URI shall be in a
format supported by the NGN for the request to be accepted. 3GPP TS 24.229
[18], subclause 5.1.2A.1.2 gives information on the format of the Request-URI.
In an outgoing request initiating a dialog or in a target refresh request the
Contact header field contains the target URI within the NGCN (which can be
different from the public user identities assigned to the NGCN site) for
receiving subsequent mid-dialog requests. This URI may also be suitable for
receiving future out-of-dialog requests.
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Record-Route header
field may be populated by entities within the NGCN site in a dialog initiating
request sent to the NGN.
When internally received by the NGCN attachment point, the Record-Route header
field has to be passed on by the attachment point when sending a request to
the NGN and the attachment point can also add its own Record-Route header
field.
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Via header field may
be populated by multiple entities within the NGCN site in an outgoing request
to the NGN.
#### 6.1.4.2 NGCN not considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN
For a request originated in an untrusted NGCN and entering the NGN over the Gm
reference point, network policy or a setting in the IMS subscription for the
NGCN site determines whether the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18]
for a privileged sender apply or not.
When the request needs to be presented as originated from a particular NGCN
user identified by an NGCN user identifier, the NGCN site can provide the NGCN
user identifier in the P-Preferred-Identity header field.
NOTE 1: If the P-Preferred-Identity or P-Asserted-Identity header fields are
not supplied by the NGCN site, the NGCN user identifier can be provided in the
From header field.
As aliases are not managed by the NGN, it is up to the NGCN site to provide
two P-Preferred-Identity header fields, one containing a SIP URI and the other
containing a TEL URI, in order to provide alias identities for the calling
party (see 3GPP TS 22.519 [1]).
If no identity is presented by the NGCN in a P-Preferred-Identity header
field, then the P-CSCF will provide a default identity in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field. This identity is the first on the list of URIs present
in the P-Associated-URI header field received as part of the registration
procedure. It shall exist in the HSS by agreement between the NGCN and NGN
operator, and shall identify an NGCN user who operates with the authority of
the NGCN operator (e.g. an attendant).
If the identity is provided in a P-Preferred-Identity header field the P-CSCF
checks whether this identity is part of the implicit registration set and if
so the P-Preferred-Identity header field will be removed and its value copied
into the P-Asserted-Identity header field that will be used within the NGN.
When this identity is not part of the implicit registration set, a present
P-Preferred-Identity header field will be removed and the P-CSCF will provide
a default identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field and if the NGCN
site is considered a privileged sender in the P-Served-User header field. The
default identity is the first identity on the list of URIs present in the
P-Associated-URI header field received as part of the registration procedure.
A P-Asserted-Identity header field will be discarded if received, as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], subclause 5.2.6.3.3.
When the S-CSCF receives the request it finds a match between the P-Asserted-
Identity header field and the distinct or wildcarded public user identities as
in the implicit registration set of the NGCN site\'s profile. This allows the
S-CSCF to perform its actions based on the service profile of the NGCN site;
this includes the optional link in of an AS over ISC, for example to provide
additional services to the enterprise.
NOTE 2: The above procedures do not preclude that the NGN may host a service
on behalf of the NGCN that may perform further translations on the P-Asserted-
Identity header field. For example in order to cope with NGCN sites that do
not deliver the NGCN user identifier in a P-Preferred-Identity header field or
a P-Asserted-Identity header field, an AS playing the role of a business
trunking application on the originating side can decide to override the
P-Asserted-Identity header field with the contents of the From header field,
if consistent with the range of identities assigned to the NGCN or NGCN site
and with the policy agreed between the NGN operator and the enterprise. If the
From header field contained a SIP URI, the AS can also include a second
P-Asserted-Identity header field with a TEL URI if possible. This enables the
NGCN user identifier to be sent to the destination in the form of an asserted
identity.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a request from
the NGCN site, the P-CSCF retains the header field when passing on the
request.
The NGCN site may receive a connected party identity that is not privacy-
restricted in the P-Asserted-Identity header field in an 18x or 2xx final
response depending on NGN policy.
#### 6.1.4.3 NGCN considered as privileged sender and trusted by NGN
For a request originated in a trusted NGCN and entering the NGN over the Gm
reference point, the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18] for a
privileged sender apply.
When the request needs to be presented as originated from a particular NGCN
user, the NGCN site can provide the NGCN user identifier in the P-Preferred-
Identity header field or in the P-Asserted-Identity header field.
As aliases are not managed by the NGN, it is up to the NGCN site to provide
two Asserted-Identity header fields, one containing a SIP URI and the other
containing a TEL URI, in order to provide alias identities for the calling
party (see 3GPP TS 22.519 [1]).
When a P-Preferred-Identity header field is received and is part of the
implicit registration set, the P-Served-User header field is set to the
P-Preferred-Identity header field.
When no P-Preferred-Identity header field is received or when a received
P-Preferred-Identity header field is not part of the implicit registration
set, the P-CSCF includes a P-Served-User header field set to the default
identity received in the P-Associated-URI header field during registration.
If one or two P-Asserted-Identity header field(s) are received from the NGCN
site, the P-CSCF passes them on unchanged.
If no P-Asserted-Identity header field is received the P-CSCF includes a
P-Asserted-Identity header field with a value copied from the P-Served-User
header field.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a request from
the NGCN site, the P-CSCF retains the header field when passing on the
request.
NOTE: The above procedures do not preclude that the NGN may host a service on
behalf of the NGCN that may perform further translations on the P-Asserted-
Identity header field. For example in order to cope with NGCN sites that do
not deliver the NGCN user identifier in a P-Preferred-Identity header field or
P-Asserted-Identity header field, an AS playing the role of a business
trunking application on the originating side can decide to override the
P-Asserted-Identity header field with the contents of the From header field,
if consistent with the range of identities assigned to the NGCN or NGCN site
and with the policy agreed between the NGN operator and the enterprise. If the
From header field contained a SIP URI, the AS can also include a second\
P-Asserted-Identity header field with a TEL URI if possible. This enables the
NGCN user identifier to be sent to the destination in the form of an asserted
identity.
The NGCN site may receive a connected party identity in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field in an 18x or 2xx final response. The identity will be
accompanied by a Privacy header field set to \"id\" if its presentation is
restricted.
#### 6.1.4.4 NGCN considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN
If the NGCN site is considered as privileged sender the procedures of
subclause 6.1.4.3 for the handling of requests shall apply. This means that
the P-CSCF will pass on a P-Asserted-Identity header field unchanged if
received in a request from the NGCN site. The NGCN site profile shall contain
appropriate filter criteria to ensure that the identity in the\ P-Asserted-
Identity header field will be verified by an Application Server.
The NGCN site may receive a connected party identity that is not privacy-
restricted in the P-Asserted-Identity header field in an 18x or 2xx final
response depending on NGN policy.
### 6.1.5 Requests terminating to an NGCN user leaving NGN
#### 6.1.5.1 General
The procedures for handling of requests to and responses from an NGCN
especially applying to identities are very different depending on whether the
NGCN is part of the same trust domain for asserted identities as the NGN or
not. To highlight those differences three separate clauses below describe the
procedure for:
\- an NGCN not considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN;
\- an NGCN considered as privileged sender and trusted by NGN; and
\- an NGCN considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN.
Trust domain for asserted identity is defined in IETF RFC 3324 [22]. To be
meaningful in a particular domain it requires the definition of a Spec(T) that
specifies the requirements that all entities in the trust domain need to
comply with. The Spec(T) to be used should be covered in the SLA.
When an initial request for a new dialog or a request for a standalone
transaction addressed to an NGCN site identifier or an NGCN user identifier in
the Request-URI arrives at the I-CSCF, the I-CSCF performs a location request
to HSS to locate the S-CSCF where to forward the request to. The HSS finds a
match between the Request-URI and the registered NGCN site identifier or an
implicitly registered distinct or wildcarded public user identity that belongs
to the service profile of an NGCN site. The HSS returns information about a
particular S-CSCF allocated to that specific NGCN site service profile.
When the S-CSCF receives the request it finds a match between the Request-URI
and the NGCN site identifier or the distinct or wildcarded public user
identity as in the implicit registration set of the NGCN site service profile.
This allows the S-CSCF to perform its actions based on the service profile for
the NGCN site. This includes the optional link of AS over ISC, for example to
provide additional services to an enterprise. When the S-CSCF is ready to
forward the request to the NGCN via the P-CSCF and a \"loose-route\"
indication has been received from the HSS during registration (see subclause
6.1.3), it retains the received NGCN user identifier (including any URI
parameters) in the Request-URI, then it adds to the Route header field the
contents of the Path header field as stored during registration as well as the
registered Contact address. This will ensure that the request is first routed
to the P-CSCF assigned during registration and that the P-CSCF can forward the
request over the Gm reference point towards the NGCN site. The NGCN site can
then use the Request-URI to forward the request further in the NGCN or it can
use it to select an extension to forward the call to.
The above procedure assumes specific population rules applicable when a
special indication stored in the user profile is received from the HSS. In
such cases, the S-CSCF retains the received target identity in the Request-URI
and, if the NGCN site has not registered using IETF RFC 5626 [29], adds the
Contact address (stripping out the Display name field if any) to the Route
header field (as the last field value). If the NGCN site has not registered
using IETF RFC 5626 [29], after removing its own address, the P-CSCF uses the
topmost Route header field (which happens to be the Contact address) to
identify the security association (or equivalent in case no security
association was established) and route the request according to IETF RFC 3261
[21]. If the NGCN site has registered using IETF RFC 5626 [29] the P-CSCF will
use the procedures defined in IETF RFC 5626 [29] to forward the request over
the Gm reference point towards the NGCN site.
NGCN sites that have implicitly registered a TEL URI are required to accept a
Request-URI in the form of a TEL URI when the loose route indicator is set in
their network profile.
If no loose-route indicator is configured in the NGCN site profile the
Request-URI of a SIP request received from the NGN will contain the registered
contact of the NGCN site, and the public user identity of the actual
destination inside the NGCN is conveyed in the P-Called-Party-ID header field.
NOTE 1: The non-loose-route procedure may not be adequate for NGCN URIs that
are not within the range of identities assigned to the NGCN site, e.g. private
GRUUs. This issue requires further study.
In a 2xx final response to an incoming dialog initiating or target refresh
request the Contact header field contains the target URI within the NGCN
(which can be different from the public user identities assigned to the NGCN
site) for receiving subsequent mid-dialog requests. This URI may also be
suitable for receiving future out-of-dialog requests.
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Max-Breadth header
field can prevent loops by limiting forking within the NGCN site.
NOTE 2: The Max-Breadth header field may be passed on to the NGN, e.g. if the
call is diverted back into the NGN. As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP
entities, the Max-Forwards header field can prevent loops by limiting the
number of nodes that can forward the request within the NGCN site.
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Record-Route header
field may have been populated by entities within the NGCN site in a response
to a dialog initiating request received from the NGN.
When received by the NGCN attachment point in a request from the NGN, the
Record-Route header field has to be passed on by the attachment point and the
attachment point can also add its own Record-Route header field.
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Route header field may
contain additional URIs addressing nodes within the NGCN site in a request
received from the NGN.
NOTE 3: The NGN may know the route set within the NGCN site from a Record-
Route received earlier on the same dialog, through configuration, or from a
Path header field received during registration.
#### 6.1.5.2 NGCN not considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN
For a request terminated in an untrusted NGCN and leaving the NGN over the Gm
reference point, network policy or a setting in the IMS Subscription for the
NGCN site determines whether the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18]
for a privileged sender apply or not.
The NGCN site may receive a calling party identity that is not privacy-
restricted in the P-Asserted-Identity header field in a request from the NGN,
depending on NGN policy.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a response, the
P-CSCF retains it when passing on the response.
For a response originating in the NGCN the P-CSCF provides the saved public
user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID header field that was received in the
request, plus the display name if previously stored during registration for
the NGCN site (see subclause 6.1.4.1) in the P-Asserted-Identity header field.
The S-CSCF will add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field if possible.
#### 6.1.5.3 NGCN considered as privileged sender and trusted by NGN
For a request terminated in a trusted NGCN and leaving the NGN over the Gm
reference point, the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18] for a
privileged sender apply.
The NGCN site may receive a calling party identity in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field in a request from the NGN. The identity will be accompanied by a
Privacy header field set to \"id\" if its presentation is restricted.
If a P-Asserted-Identity header field is present in the response from the
NGCN, the P-CSCF shall retain this identity when passing on the response. As
aliases are not managed by the NGN, it is up to the NGCN site to provide two
P-Asserted-Identity header fields, one containing a SIP URI and the other
containing a TEL URI, in order to provide alias identities for the calling
party (see 3GPP TS 22.519 [1]).
NOTE: If there is no P-Asserted-Identity header field in the response, the
P-CSCF will not add one.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a response, the
P-CSCF retains it when passing on the response.
#### 6.1.5.4 NGCN considered as privileged sender and not trusted by NGN
The NGCN site may receive a calling party identity that is not privacy-
restricted in the P-Asserted-Identity header field in a request from the NGN,
depending on NGN policy.
Subclause 6.1.5.3 for the handling of responses shall apply. This means that
the P-CSCF will pass on a P-Asserted-Identity header field unchanged if
received in a response from the NGCN site. The NGCN site profile shall contain
appropriate filter criteria to ensure that an Application Server will be
included in the path of a dialog initiating or stand-alone request in order to
verify the identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field in the response.
### 6.1.6 Business trunking applications
#### 6.1.6.1 General
Business trunking applications are deployed on an AS. In case such services
are offered to a specific enterprise the initial filter criteria of the
service profile of a connected NGCN site needs to be configured so that the
S-CSCF that serves the NGCN site invokes the AS that hosts the business
trunking application.
The intent of this clause is not to specify the detail of the individual
applications, but only to indicate some specific impacts on the protocol.
3GPP TS 22.519 [1] defines the business trunking application, this clause
specifies protocol impact of the different applications.
#### 6.1.6.2 Routeing capabilities
##### 6.1.6.2.1 Overview
Not applicable.
##### 6.1.6.2.2 Break-in
When break-in service is enabled for a specific NGCN site, a business trunking
application converts incoming public network traffic to private network
traffic if the conditions agreed between the enterprise and the NGN operator
indicate this.
To convert public network traffic to private network traffic the break-in
service shall insert a P-Private-Network-Indication header field as specified
in IETF RFC 7316 [31] with a private network identifier as expressed in the
SLA between the enterprise and the NGN operator, in the initial request for a
dialog or standalone request for a transaction.
To allow this service to be provided it needs to be ensured that the business
trunking application offering this service will be inserted in the signalling
path of sessions originating from and terminating to the served NGCN site.
##### 6.1.6.2.3 Break-out
When break-out is enabled for a specific NGCN site, a business trunking
application converts outgoing private network traffic to public network
traffic if the conditions agreed between the enterprise and the NGN operator
indicate this.
To convert private network traffic to public network traffic the break-out
service shall remove P-Private-Network-Indication header field as specified in
IETF RFC 7316 [31], from the initial request for a dialog or standalone
request for a transaction.
To allow this service to be provided it needs to be ensured that the business
trunking application offering this service will be inserted in the signalling
path of sessions originating from and terminating to the served NGCN site.
##### 6.1.6.2.4 Bulk rerouting
When bulk rerouting is enabled for a specific NGCN site, a terminating
business trunking application forwards incoming public or private network
traffic to a specified destination if the conditions agreed between the
enterprise and the NGN operator indicate this.
The NGN operator defines the set of rules or policies under which this should
occur, and the NGCN operator should be able to configure the capability within
those rules and policies.
To allow this service to be provided it needs to be ensured that the business
trunking application offering this service will be inserted in the signalling
path of sessions terminating to the served NGCN site.
#### 6.1.6.3 Communication admission control
When communication admission control is enabled a business trunking
application serving an NGCN site executes the NGN operator defined set of
rules or policies under which communication admission control applies, and the
NGCN operator should be able to configure the capability within those rules
and policies.
To allow this service to be provided it needs to be ensured that the business
trunking application offering this service will be inserted in the signalling
path of sessions originating from and terminating to the served NGCN site.
#### 6.1.6.4 Anonymous communication rejection
When anonymous communication rejection is enabled a terminating business
trunking application serving an NGCN site providing this service shall
implement the procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.611 [8], subclause
4.5.2.6.2.
To allow this service to be provided it needs to be ensured that the business
trunking application offering this service will be inserted in the signalling
path of sessions terminating to the served NGCN site.
#### 6.1.6.5 Communication barring
When communication barring is enabled, a terminating business trunking
application shall reject incoming calls when the evaluation of the NGCN site
specific incoming communication barring rules indicates so. The definition of
the communication barring rules is out of scope of the present document.
When the communication barring application rejects a communication, it shall
do so by implementing the protocol procedure for rejecting a communication as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.611 [8], subclause 4.5.2.6.1, excluding the
communication barring rule aspect of that procedure.
To allow this service to be provided it needs to be ensured that the business
trunking application offering this service will be inserted in the signalling
path of sessions terminating to the served NGCN site.
### 6.1.7 Signalling transparency
For private network traffic, an NGN shall be capable of transparent exchange
of signalling elements that an IETF RFC 3261 [21] SIP proxy is not allowed to
add, remove or modify, subject to the exception listed below, and shall be
capable of being tolerant of and passing on without modification any
signalling extension that is not supported. The exception is any information
that needs to be changed to accomplish NAT traversal, i.e. IP addresses and
ports in SDP. In particular, an NGN shall be capable of passing on a request,
part of which is cryptographically signed (e.g. using the Identity header
field), without removing or invalidating that signature. Whether such
transparency is provided and to what degree is a matter for agreement between
the NGN operator(s) and enterprise(s) concerned. This applies to any
functional entity on the signalling path, including P-CSCF, S-CSCF, IBCF and
AS.
NOTE: This is not intended to prevent intervention by an AS when needed to
carry out specific services as agreed between operators or as negotiated by
signalling.
### 6.1.8 Involvement of functions on the media path
#### 6.1.8.1 General
For private network traffic, entities on the signalling path shall be capable
of avoiding the insertion of functions into the media path that intervene
above the transport layer, unless explicitly required by contractual
arrangement between the NGN operator and the NGCN operator, explicitly
requested through signalling, or in order to meet regulatory requirements.
Examples of intervention that is prohibited (when exceptions do not apply)
include transcoding, language translation, recording, re-encrypting and re-
signing.
#### 6.1.8.2 DTMF
As specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], an NGCN site shall include the MIME
subtype \"telephone-event\" in the media description in the SDP for audio
media flows that support both audio codec and DTMF payloads in RTP packets as
described in IETF RFC 4733 [26].
If the MIME subtype \"telephone-event\" is not supported by the remote party,
the NGCN site should be able to send and receive DTMF in the media flow using
a suitable audio codec negotiated in the offer/answer exchange.
#### 6.1.8.3 Codecs
ETSI TS 181 005 [27] specifies principles for the use of codecs in the NGN.
Specifically ETSI TS 181 005 [27] mandates that the \"NGN shall allow end to
end negotiation of any codec between NGN entities (terminal, network
elements)\". Although no direct requirement is placed on entities within the
NGCN; by merit of the fact that SIP is used as the protocol for the
interconnect it is clear that the NGCN-NGN interconnection interface shall
allow end to end negotiation of any codec between NGCN and NGCN/NGN entities.
If the NGCN supports narrow band voice services then, as specified in ETSI TS
181 005 [27], in order to enable interworking for narrow band voice services
for public traffic, the NGCN shall be capable of sending and receiving ITUâ€‘T
Recommendation G.711 [28] coded speech with a packetization size of 20 ms.
### 6.1.9 Handling of the P-Access-Network-Info header field
When a request or response received using an xDSL-based access the P-CSCF
inserts a P-Access-Network-Info header field into the forwarded request or
response by setting the access-type field to one of the values specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [18] for this type of access. The P-CSCF adds the \"network-
provided\" parameter and the \"dsl-location\" parameter with the value
received in the Location-Information header in the User-Data Answer command as
specified in ETSI ES 283 035 [11] or with a provisioned value if a static IP
address is used and no interface to the NASS exist.
When a request or response received using an LAN-based access the P-CSCF
inserts a P-Access-Network-Info header field into the forwarded request or
response by setting the access-type field to \"ETH\", adding the \"network-
provided\" parameter and the \"eth-location\" parameter with the value
received in the Location-Information header in the User-Data Answer command as
specified in ETSI ES 283 035 [11] or with a provisioned value if a static IP
address is used and no interface to the NASS exist.
### 6.1.10 Emergency calls
The NGCN site will normally identify an emergency call as an emergency call
and ensure that it is received in the NGN with a Request-URI set to an
emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of
\"sos\" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [24]. An additional sub-service type can
be added if information on the type of emergency service is known.
The P-CSCF will handle requests identified as emergency calls and which are
public network traffic in the same fashion as calls from UEs not using
business communication procedures.
For requests identified as private network traffic, the P-CSCF can handle such
requests according to normal routeing procedures for requests, and not follow
the procedures of clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], or handle the request
as if it was public network traffic.
NOTE 1: Such emergency calls are handled within some other NGCN site, which
can either provide the emergency service routeing proxy, or the emergency
answer point. Further study is required for what policy applies in selecting
the one of the above options, and whether this choice is applicable to all or
some identification of emergency calls.
An NGCN site will normally provide a geolocation in conjunction with such
calls, using the procedures of IETF RFC 6442 [30]. The P-CSCF can also provide
location information in the P-Access-Network-Info header field. Which of these
two information is used by the E-CSCF to select a PSAP depends on the policy
of the NGN operator and the regulatory constraints in force.
NOTE 2: The location information available in the P-Access-Network-Info header
field when provided by the NGN usually represents the location of the access
point where the NGCN site is connected to the NGN, and not the terminal
attached to the NGCN.
The presence of the private network indication can modify the emergency call
handling at the P-CSCF. This is necessary if emergency calls relating to
private network traffic are to be routed to a separate PSAP (a \"private
PSAP\"), to the PSAP used for emergency calls relating to public network
traffic.
### 6.1.11 Charging
The applicable charging procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 32.260 [6].
### 6.1.12 Advice of Charge
An NGCN site supporting advice of charge services shall support the INFO
method and shall accept MIME bodies of type \"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\"
defined in 3GPP TS 24.647 [12].
If the agreement between the NGN and the NGCN specifies that an NGCN site
shall received advice of charge information, the NGCN site profile in the HSS
shall contain appropriate initial filter criteria ensuring that an Application
Server supporting the procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.647 [12] is inserted
in the signalling path of outgoing sessions.
When processing originating sessions, this application server shall be able to
act as a Charging Generation Point (CGP) with regards to the NGCN site and may
take into account charging information received from upstream in the format
defined in 3GPP TS 29.658 [13], annex C.
### 6.1.13 NAT traversal
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], annexes F and K specify mechanisms for NAT
traversal. The application of these mechanisms is not precluded, but detailed
implications of their use in a business communication environment have not
been studied.
Two solutions to keep a connection alive, depending on the NAT traversal
mechanism (Latching-based as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], annex F or SIP
Outbound-based as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18]) used, are provided in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [18].
When using the latching-based NAT traversal mechanism, as defined in 3GPP TS
24.229 [18], subclause F.4.2 provides two solutions for keeping the signalling
connection alive:
\- short registration timers (see note 1 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], subclause
F.4.2); and
\- SIP outbound keep-alive as a stand-alone mechanism (see note 2 in 3GPP TS
24.229 [18], subclause F.4.2).
When using SIP outbound, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], the SIP-outbound
keep-alive mechanism applies.
NOTE 2: Use of alternative mechanisms (e.g. OPTIONS method) is outside the
scope of the present document.
### 6.1.14 Private network traffic
Private network traffic can be distinguished from public network traffic by
the addition of a P-Private-Network-Indication header field as specified in
IETF RFC 7316 [31].
NOTE: Procedures for use of the P-Private-Network-Indication header field
within the NGN are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18]. Where an explicit
indication of private network traffic is required within the NGN, then the
P-Private-Network-Indication header field is expected to be used.
The NGN will handle the P-Private-Network-Indication header field in
accordance with its trust domain specification.
The NGCN site can include a P-Private-Network-Indication header field as
specified in IETF RFC 7316 [31] in an initial request or standalone request,
with a valid private network identification for its use.
The NGN can include a P-Private-Network-Indication header field as specified
in IETF RFC 7316 [31] in an initial request or standalone request to the NGCN
site, with a valid private network identification for its use.
For transactions relating to private network traffic, the NGCN site may
include and receive tel URIs (and their SIP equivalents) specifying Private
Numbering Plan (PNP) numbers in accordance with ETSI TR 102 634 [20].
### 6.1.15 P-CSCF and IP-CAN redundancy
3GPP TS 24.229 [18], clause 9 describes several methods enabling a UE to
obtain a list of IP addresses or the SIP server domain name of the P-CSCF. The
addressing material acquired through these methods should be used to build a
SIP URI corresponding to the P-CSCF. Once the SIP URI of the P-CSCF is
obtained, IETF RFC 3263 [25] procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18],
subclause E.2.2.1 should be applied to obtain from the DNS the IP address of
the P-CSCF, including backup addresses for use in case of failure of the
preferred choice.
An NGCN site may decide to perform multiple registrations for the same Address
of Records through different P-CSCFs or from different local network
interfaces attached to different IP-CANs. In this case, as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [18], subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the following settings apply to the
REGISTER request header fields:
1) the Contact header field shall include a \"+sip.instance\" header field
parameter containing the instance ID associated to the NGCN site and a \"reg-
id\" header field parameter as described in IETF RFC 5626 [29]; and
2) the \"outbound\" option-tag shall be included in the Supported header
field.
As specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], subclause 5.1.2A.1.1, the NGCN site shall
then include an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter in the Contact header field of the
initial request, except REGISTER.
A load distribution or a load balancing strategy can be applied when sending
an initial request to the NGN. The load distribution strategy can use a round-
robin algorithm. A load balancing strategy can make use of the actual load of
the P-CSCFs if this information is made available by the DNS.
If for an AOR multiple registrations through different P-CSCF instances
according to IETF RFC 5626 [29] are performed and an initial request except
REGISTER, fails as specified in IETF RFC 3263 [25], subclause 4.3 or if the
P-CSCF does not respond to keep alive messages, the NGCN site can attempt to
send that request to another P-CSCF where it is registered.
NOTE: Load balancing or load distribution for terminating request across
multiple P-CSCFs as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], subclause 6.1 can be
achieved by applying appropriate policies at the S-CSCF when multiple
registrations exist. These policies are implementation specific.
## 6.2 Peering-based business trunking
### 6.2.1 Introduction
The NGCN site shall appear to the NGN as if it were an IBCF complying with the
requirements identified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], subclause 4.1 for this
functional entity.
In addition to the procedures specified in the subclause 6.2, all functional
IMS entities shall support the procedures appropriate for these entities
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18] and in 3GPP TS 24.628 [10].
### 6.2.2 Identification
Each NGCN site is responsible for a set of public user identities.
### 6.2.3 Registration
There is no registration of NGCN sites in the IMS.
NOTE: Terminating requests are routed over the final NGN entity to the NGCN
site by using standard DNS techniques, which apply to the remainder of the
routeing.
### 6.2.4 Requests originating from an NGCN user entering NGN
#### 6.2.4.1 General
The procedures for handling of requests to or from an NGCN especially applying
to identities are very different depending on whether the NGCN is part of the
same trust domain for asserted identities as the NGN or not. To highlight
those differences two separate clauses describe the procedure for:
\- an NGCN not trusted by NGN; and
\- an NGCN trusted by NGN.
Trust domain for asserted identity is defined in IETF RFC 3324 [22]. To be
meaningful in a particular domain it requires the definition of a Spec(T) that
specifies the requirements that all entities in the trust domain need to
comply with. The Spec(T) to be used should be covered in the SLA.
A request will be identified in the IBCF as coming from an NGCN site relating
to a particular enterprise by means of appropriate security associations
required by the network domain security requirements specified in 3GPP TS
33.203 [16].
In case no business trunking applications are provided, the \"intelligent
routeing function\" as defined in subclause 5.3.1 just offers originating
transit functionality in the NGCN originating case (figure 5.1).
Depending on the agreements between NGN an NGCN, originating business trunking
applications are to be provided to the NGCN (e.g. those specified in 3GPP TS
22.519 [1]). In this case an AS needs to be invoked by the intelligent
routeing function to perform the originating business trunking application,
which may be realised by the IBCF forcing the CSCF routeing capabilities to
treat the NGCN originated request as an originating request, reacting on
enterprise specific data of the originating NGCN in the HSS.
NOTE: 3GPP TS 23.228 [17] defines in subclause 14.4 the capability of an IBCF
to indicate whether an incoming SIP request is to be handled as an originating
request by subsequent nodes in the IMS (e.g. by inserting the \"orig\"
parameter, defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], subclause 7.2A.6 and intended to
tell the S-CSCF that it has to perform the originating services instead of
terminating services and to tell the I-CSCF that it has to perform originating
procedures).
#### 6.2.4.2 NGCN not trusted by NGN
For a request originated in an untrusted NGCN, when the request needs to be
presented as originated from a particular NGCN user identified by an NGCN user
identifier, any identity provided by the NGCN site in the P-Preferred-Identity
header field or in the P-Asserted-Identity header field is removed.
The IBCF will provide a default identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field. This identity is configured in the IBCF, and shall identify a NGCN user
who operates with the authority of the NGCN operator (e.g. an attendant).
Depending on NGN policy, the IBCF may send to the NGCN site a connected party
identity that is not privacy-restricted, included in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field of a 18x or 2xx final response.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a request from or
a response to the NGCN site, the IBCF retains it when passing on the request
or response.
#### 6.2.4.3 NGCN trusted by NGN
If according to SLA the NGN and the NGCN form part of the same trust domain,
the NGCN delivers the P-Assertedâ€‘Identity header field to the NGN. The NGN
does not remove the P-Asserted-Identity header field in this case.
The IBCF may send to the NGCN site a connected party identity included in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field of an 18x or 2xx final response.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a request from or
a response to the NGCN site, the IBCF retains it when passing on the request.
### 6.2.5 Requests terminating to an NGCN user leaving NGN
#### 6.2.5.1 General
The procedures for handling of requests to and responses from an NGCN
especially applying to identities are very different depending on whether the
NGCN is part of the same trust domain for asserted identities as the NGN or
not. To highlight those differences two clauses describe the procedure for:
\- an NGCN not trusted by NGN; and
\- an NGCN trusted by NGN.
Trust domain for asserted identity is defined in IETF RFC 3324 [22]. To be
meaningful in a particular domain it requires the definition of a Spec(T) that
specifies the requirements that all entities in the trust domain need to
comply with. The Spec(T) to be used should be covered in the SLA.
In case no business trunking applications are provided, the \"intelligent
routeing function\" as defined in subclause 5.3.1 just offers basic and
transparent routeing functionality in the NGCN terminating case (figure 5.2).
Depending on the agreements between NGN an NGCN, terminating business trunking
applications are to be provided to the NGCN (e.g. those specified in 3GPP TS
22.519 [1]). In this case an AS needs to be invoked by the intelligent
routeing function to perform the terminating business trunking application,
which may be realised by the I-CSCF on basis of NGCN-specific data retrieved
from the HSS.
#### 6.2.5.2 NGCN not trusted by NGN
For a response originated in an untrusted NGCN, when the response needs to be
presented as coming from a particular NGCN user identified by a NGCN user
identifier, any identity provided by the NGCN site in the P-Preferred-Identity
header field or in the P-Asserted-Identity header field is removed. The IBCF
will provide a default identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field. This
identity is configured in the IBCF, and shall identify a NGCN user who
operates with the authority of the NGCN operator (e.g. an attendant).
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a request to or a
response from the NGCN site, the IBCF retains it when passing on the request
or response.
#### 6.2.5.3 NGCN trusted by NGN
For a response originating in a trusted NGCN, if a P-Asserted-Identity header
field is present in a response from the NGCN, the IBCF shall not remove this
identity when passing on the response.
If the Privacy header field with value \"id\" is received in a request to or
response from the NGCN site, the IBCF retains it when passing on the request
or response.
### 6.2.6 Business trunking application
#### 6.2.6.1 General
The provision of the business trunking applications (e.g. those defined in
3GPP TS 22.519 [1], clause 4.4) is realized by an intelligent routeing
function, which may involve an AS depending on the actual enterprise specific
data.
In the case no business trunking applications are provided, the \"intelligent
routeing function\" as defined in subclause 5.3.1 just offers originating
transit functionality in the NGCN originating case (figure 5.1). This
originating case then corresponds to the second scenario of 3GPP TS 23.228
[17], subclause 5.19. In the terminating case the \"intelligent routing
function\" just forwards requests to the appropriate IBCF.
The intent of this clause is not to specify the detail of the individual
services, but only to indicate some specific impacts on the protocol.
#### 6.2.6.2 Routeing related business trunking applications
##### 6.2.6.2.0 General
For Break-in, Break-out and bulk rerouteing see subclause 6.1.6.2.
##### 6.2.6.2.1 Originating requests
If the business trunking application receives an originating request from a
NGCN, the business trunking application shall, based on the P-Served-User
header field, identify the NGCN.
If the request contains a P-Asserted-Identity header field and does not
contain a P-Private-Network-Indication header field, the business trunking
application shall verify the P-Asserted-Identity header field against the
profile of the NGCN. If the verification fails or if the request does not
contain a P-Asserted-Identity header field, the business trunking application
shall insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field identifying the main
enterprise user. If the request contains a P-Private-Network-Indication header
field, the business trunking application shall, if present, forward the
received P-Asserted-Identity header field unchanged.
NOTE 1: The profile of the NGCN is provisioned in the business trunking
application or in the subscription profile in HSS if this application uses the
HSS for subscription storage.
NOTE 2 The profile of the NGCN can also be provisioned in the P-CSCF. In this
case, the above procedures are already executed by the P-CSCF and need thus
not be executed by the business trunking application anymore.
##### 6.2.6.2.2 Terminating responses to an originating request
When the business trunking application receives a terminating response to the
above request, if this response contains a P-Asserted-Identity header field
and does not contain a P-Private-Network-Indication header field, the business
trunking application shall verify the P-Asserted-Identity header field against
the profile of the NGCN. If the verification fails or if the response does not
contain a P-Asserted-Identity header field, the business trunking application
shall insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field identifying the main
enterprise user. If this response contains a P-Private-Network-Indication
header field, the business trunking application shall, if present, forward the
received P-Asserted-Identity header field unchanged.
NOTE 1: The profile of the NGCN is provisioned in the business trunking
application or in the subscription profile in HSS if this application uses the
HSS for subscription storage.
NOTE 2 The profile of the NGCN can also be provisioned in the P-CSCF. In this
case, the above procedures will be executed by the P-CSCF and need thus not be
executed by the business trunking application.
##### 6.2.6.2.3 Terminating requests
If the business trunking application receives a terminating request to an
NGCN, the business trunking application shall identify the particular NGCN the
enterprise user belongs to, and also the P-CSCF(s) or IBCF(s), respectively
serving the NGCN, and shall forward the request towards the NGCN. Therefore,
the business trunking application shall create a route to the NGCN by adding a
SIP URI of the P-CSCF or IBCF, respectively serving the NGCN and the NGCN in a
Route header field as bottommost entries.
NOTE 1: The profile of the NGCN is provisioned in the business trunking
application or in the subscription profile in the HSS if this application uses
the HSS for subscription storage.
NOTE 2: Inserting the SIP URI of the NGCN in a Route header field will
suppress triggering any other AS after the business trunking application.
Hence this AS has to be last in the chain of iFCs.
Editor\'s note: [BusTI-CT, CR 0001] It is FFS whether in certain scenarios
another AS needs to be the last AS to be triggered (e.g. the SCC AS) in order
to allow all desired services.
#### 6.2.6.3 Communication admission control
See subclause 6.1.6.3.
#### 6.2.6.4 Anonymous communication rejection
See subclause 6.1.6.4.
#### 6.2.6.5 Communication barring
See subclause 6.1.6.5.
### 6.2.7 Signalling transparency
For private network traffic, an NGN shall be capable of transparent exchange
of signalling elements that an IETF RFC 3261 [21] SIP proxy is not allowed to
add, remove or modify, subject to the exception listed below, and shall be
capable of being tolerant of and passing on without modification any
signalling extension that is not supported. The exception is any information
that needs to be changed to accomplish NAT traversal, i.e. IP addresses and
ports in SDP. In particular, an NGN shall be capable of passing on a request,
part of which is cryptographically signed (e.g. using the Identity header
field), without removing or invalidating that signature. Whether such
transparency is provided and to what degree is a matter for agreement between
the NGN operator(s) and enterprise(s) concerned. This applies to any
functional entity on the signalling path, including IBCF and routeing
function.
### 6.2.8 Involvement of functions on the media path
For private network traffic, entities on the signalling path shall be capable
of avoiding the insertion of functions into the media path that intervene
above the transport layer, unless explicitly required by contractual
arrangement between the NGN operator and the NGCN operator, explicitly
requested through signalling, or in order to meet regulatory requirements.
Examples of intervention that is prohibited (when exceptions do not apply)
include transcoding, language translation, recording, re-encrypting and re-
signing.
### 6.2.9 Handling of the P-Access-Network-Info header field
The P-Access-Network-Info header field is not provided by an NGCN site in the
peering-based approach to business trunking.
### 6.2.10 Emergency calls
The NGCN site will normally identify an emergency call as an emergency call
and ensure that it is received in the NGN with a Request-URI set to an
emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of
\"sos\" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [24]. An additional sub-service type can
be added if information on the type of emergency service is known. Requests
identified with this indication will be routed to an E-CSCF.
The IBCF will handle requests identified as emergency calls and which are
public network traffic by routeing them to an E-CSCF.
NOTE 1: The above constitutes an extension to the IMS architecture which still
needs to be studied as to its inclusion in the main IMS architecture
documents.
For requests identified as private network traffic, the IBCF handles such
requests according to normal routeing procedures for requests, or handle the
request as if it was public network traffic.
NOTE 2: Such emergency calls are handled within some other NGCN site, which
can either provide the emergency service routeing proxy, or the emergency
answer point. Further study is required for what policy applies in selecting
the one of the above options, and whether this choice is applicable to all or
some identification of emergency calls, or handle the request as if it was
public network traffic.
An NGCN site will normally provide a geolocation in conjunction with such
calls, using the procedures of IETF RFC 6442 [30].
The presence of the private network indication can modify the emergency call
handling at the IBCF. This is necessary if emergency calls relating to private
network traffic are to be routed to a separate PSAP (a \"private PSAP\"), to
the PSAP used for emergency calls relating to public network traffic.

NOTE: Not covered in this release of the present document.
### 6.2.12 Advice of Charge
NOTE: Not covered in this release of the present document.
### 6.2.13 NAT traversal
NOTE: The application of NAT traversal mechanisms is not precluded, but
detailed implications of their use in a business communication environment
have not been studied.
### 6.2.14 Private network traffic
Private network traffic can be distinguished from public network traffic by
the addition of a P-Private-Network-Indication header field as specified in
IETF RFC 7316 [31].
NOTE: Procedures for use of the P-Private-Network-Indication header field
within the NGN are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [18]. Where an explicit
indication of private network traffic is required within the NGN, then the
P-Private-Network-Indication header field is expected to be used.
The NGN will handle the P-Private-Network-Indication header field in
accordance with its trust domain specification.
The NGCN site can include P-Private-Network-Indication header field as
specified in IETF RFC 7316 [31] in an initial request or standalone request,
with a valid private network identification for its use.
The NGN can include P-Private-Network-Indication header field as specified in
IETF RFC 7316 [31] in an initial request or standalone request to the NGCN
site, with a valid private network identification for its use.
For transactions relating to private network traffic, the NGCN site may
include and receive tel URIs (and their SIP equivalents) specifying PNP
numbers in accordance with ETSI TR 102 634 [20].
## 6.3 Session-level virtual leased line between NGCN sites

# 7 Use of transport functions
## 7.1 Use of transport control sublayer
### 7.1.1 Use of NASS
An NGCN site can obtain an IP address from the public/carrier access network
to which it is attached as per the procedures developed in ETSI ES 282 004
[3]. Other parameters such as the P-CSCF identity may also be received from
the NASS.
When requesting an IP address from the NGN, the NGCN site shall conform to
ETSI TS 183 019 [9].
Within an NGCN site, the entity responsible for requesting an IP address from
the NASS is either the CNG or, in case the CNG operates as a bridge (as
specified in ETSI TS 185 003 [15]), a front-end device connected to the CNG
playing the role of a NASS user. Other devices in the NGCN site are assigned
IP addresses routable only within the corporate network.
As an alternative to the dynamic IP address allocation procedures described in
NASS the NGN may offer an option to assign static IP addresses to the NGCN. In
this case there may be no direct interaction between the NGCN and the NASS.
When the subscription based approach is used and no P-CSCF identity has been
received from the NASS, the NGCN site will use a provisioned identity or an
identity received from a Customer Network Gateway Control Function (CNGCF) if
the procedures described in ETSI TS 183 065 [14] are supported by the NGCN
site.
### 7.1.2 Use of RACS
In the present document it is assumed that there is no interaction between any
policy driven resource control mechanisms deployed in the NGCN with those
deployed in the NGN. The NGN may provide resource and admission control based
on operator policy and the nature of the business trunking service provided to
the NGCN (e.g. certain business trunking services can provide dedicated
transport resources, others can provide sharing of transport resources across
NGCNs, others can only provide best efforts). The control of Network Address
Translation at the edge of the NGN is also part of the necessary resource and
admission control supported by the NGN when providing business trunking
services.
### 7.1.3 Use of PCC
In the present document it is assumed that there is no interaction between any
policy driven resource control mechanisms deployed in the NGCN with those
deployed in the NGN. The NGN may provide resource control based on operator
policy and the nature of the business trunking service provided to the NGCN
(e.g. certain business trunking services can provide dedicated transport
resources, others can provide sharing of transport resources across NGCNs,
others can only provide best efforts).
The control of Network Address Translation at the edge of the NGN is also part
of the necessary resource and admission control supported by the NGN when
providing business trunking services.

3GPP TS 24.523 [7].
### A.3.2.2 Signalling flow for registration of a roaming NGCN UE visiting an
NGN/IMS with which the NGCN has a direct roaming agreement
Figure A.1
**(0) Preconditions:**
The NGCN ue1 attached to the network by some means (acquired IP address,
discovered P-CSCF, and established an IP-CAN bearer for signalling).
The following IMS parameters are assumed to be available to the UE:
a private user identity;
a public user identity; and
a home network domain name to address the SIP REGISTER request to.
Assumed authentication method: IMS AKA.
Assumed network domain security applies between IBCF and CNG on the Ic
reference point.
**(1) Unprotected REGISTER (No security association exists yet)**
NGCN ue1 constructs a REGISTER request towards its home domain hosted by his
NGCN, by Routing it via the obtained P-CSCF.
REGISTER sip:enterprise1.com
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP ue1-ip;branch=b1xx
Route: sip:pcscf1.ngn1.com;lr
From: userA\@enterprise1.com;tag=d1xx
To: userA\@enterprise1.com

port-c=3333; port-s=5059
Supported: path
Require: sec-agree
Proxy-Require: sec-agree
**(2) NGN pcscf1 receives the request**
removes itself from the Route header;
then routes the request based on the Request URI, this means that the NGN
I-DNS needs to somehow resolve the enterprise1.com name to an entry point of
the corporate network or an IBCF that handles traffic towards the
enterprise1.com entrypoint.
REGISTER sip:enterprise1.com
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP sip:pcscf1.ngn1.com;lr;branch=p1xx

Require: path
Supported: path
P-Charging-Vector: icid-value=\"i1xxx\"; orig-ioi=ngn1.com
P-Visited-Network-ID: \"Visited NGN1\"
**(3) IBCF exit point receives the REGISTER**
The functionalities of the IBCF include: network configuration hiding,
application level gateway, transport plane control, i.e. QoS control,
screening of SIP signalling; and inclusion of an Interworking Function (IWF)
if appropriate. Assuming all these functions are active, then:
encrypt the existing Path header value and all headers which reveal topology
information, such as Via, Route, Record-Route, Service-Route, and Path;
adds itself to the top of the Path header;
then routes the request based on the Request URI, this means that the NGN
I-DNS needs to somehow resolve the enterprise1.com name to an entry point of
the corporate network when it is the IBCF that resolves, or it is configured
in the IBCF that handles traffic towards the enterprise1.com entrypoint.

Following 3GPP TS 24.229 [18], for the SUBSCRIBE the same routing is used as

SUBSCRIBE will be routed by resolving the Request-URI, etc.

**(27) P-CSCF receives on its protected port on the SA with the UE the
SUBSCRIBE**
When routing via IBCF it is the P-CSCF that inserts the IBCF on the Route
header. The IBCF does not record itself in the Service-Route for some reason,
so the P-CSCF will add it to the route when needed.
It adds/modifies:
P-Asserted-Identity: sip:userA\@enterprise1.com
Route: sip:ibcf1.ngn1.com;lr,
sip:orig\@ngcn-site2.enterprise1.com;lr
Record-Route: sip:orig\@pcscf1.ngn1.com:6666;lr
Via: sip:pcscf1.ngn1.com;branch=p2xx\ Via: SIP/2.0/UDP ue1-ip;branch=b1xx
P-Charging-Vector: icid-value=\"i1xxx\"; orig-ioi=ngn1.com
**(28) IBCF performs**
record routes;
topology hiding, etc.
**(34-37) The NOTIFY from the NGCN site being a subsequent request should
follow reversely the recorded route for the SUBSCRIBE dialog**

###### ## Annex B (informative): Service Level Agreement (SLA) considerations
This annex provides guidance on technical considerations that should form part
of an SLA between an NGN operator and an NGCN operator:
1) define the NGCN sites that need to be interconnected, along with any
business trunking application provided in the NGN;
2) define the mechanism used for business trunking for each NGCN site (peering
based or subscription based);
3) define the host names within addresses of record used for each NGCN site;
4) define the use of public telecommunication numbers and PNP numbers by each
NGCN site;
5) define the NGCN site identifier for each site, e.g. used for registration
in the subscription based approach;
6) authentication and integrity protection mechanisms, including any
credentials used;
7) the method of discovery of the outbound proxy (P-CSCF or IBCF) and any
required preconfigured address if not discoverable;
8) the domain name of the NGN for subscription based approach;
9) the static IP address(s) assigned to each NGCN site of the enterprise for
the purpose of communicating with the NGN;
10) take into account media types and formats to be supported and with what
Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, it should indicate NGN handling of
media types or formats that are not recognized or supported by the NGN, e.g.
whether such media types or formats are accepted subject to \"best effort\"
QoS or rejected;
11) define whether the NGN trust domain for P-Asserted-Identity header field
extends to the NGCN, and if so, the Spec(T) to be used; in this case the NGCN
sites are regarded as privileged senders; and
12) if the NGCN is not trusted with regard to P-Asserted-Identity header
field, define whether the NGCN sites are regarded as privileged sender or not;
in the former case an application server will perform identity validation.
