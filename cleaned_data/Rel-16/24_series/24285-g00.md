Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been

# 1 Scope
The present document specifies an Allowed Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) List
Management Object (MO).
The Allowed CSG List MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM)
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5].
The Allowed CSG List MO consists of relevant parameters for that can be used
by the UE to select the appropriate CSG cell based on its subscription.
The Allowed CSG List MO defines the relevant parameters related to the Allowed
CSG List and to the Operator CSG List.
The usage of the Allowed CSG List for in the idle mode process and the
mobility management procedure is defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [2], 3GPP TS 24.008
[3] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [4].

# 4 Allowed CSG List Management Object
The Allowed CSG List Management Object (MO) is used to manage the list of
allowed CSG IDs, the Operator CSG IDs and the related restricted access
information at UE.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-csg:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[5]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the Allowed CSG list MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the Allowed CSG List
node as described in figure 4-1:
Figure 4-1: The Allowed CSG List Management Object
When a UE receives an Allowed CSG List Management Object (MO) containing the
Allowed CSG List, it shall update its Allowed CSG list stored in a USIM or in
a non-volatile memory in the ME.
When a UE receives an Allowed CSG List Management Object (MO) containing the
Operator CSG List, it shall update the Operator CSG List stored in a non-
volatile memory in the ME.

user CSGs without any restriction.
\"true\" -- Indicates that the HPLMN has configured the UE, for every PLMN not
included in any PLMN_ID leaf in the OperatorCSGEntries leaf or any PLMN for
which an OperatorCSGEntries_Only_thisPLMN leaf was not included, to present to
the user only the CSGs in the Operator CSG List.

standardized version.
