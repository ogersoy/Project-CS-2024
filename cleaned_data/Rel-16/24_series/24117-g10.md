Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

# 1 Scope
The present document defines a Management Object (MO) that can be used to
configure the parameters related to TV service provided via a PLMN.
The MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2].
The MO consists of nodes and leaves conveying configuration parameters used
for selecting and receiving TV service from a PLMN, according to the
procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.246 [3] and 3GPP TS 24.116 [8].

# 4 TV service configuration MO
## 4.1 General
The TV service configuration MO is used to manage configuration parameters
related to the TV service in receive only mode, as defined in the 3GPP TS
24.116 [8], for a device supporting provisioning of such information.
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-tv-config:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[2]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the TV service configuration MO.
## 4.2 TV service configuration MO structure
The structure of the TV service configuration MO is shown in figure 4-1 and
figure 4-2:
