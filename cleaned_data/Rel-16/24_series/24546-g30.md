##### 6.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-2 .H6}
The VAL service will use the same identity which has been authenticated by VAL
service with SIP core using SIP based REGISTER message. If VAL service do not
support SIP protocol, then HTTP based method needs to be used.
The SCM-C shall use mechanism provided by VAL service to add access-token in
SIP messages. The SCM-S shall identify the originating VAL user ID from the
access-token received from SCM-C using the mechanism defined in VAL service
specification.
##### 6.2.2.1.1.2 Create subscription {#create-subscription .H6}
In order to subscribe to notification of changes of one or more group
documents of VAL groups identified by VAL group IDs, a SCM-C shall send an
initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the network according to the UE originating
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [8] and IETF RFC 5875 [9]. In the

application/resource-lists+xml MIME body, the SCM-C shall include one \
element for each configuration document to be subscribed to, such that the
\"uri\" attribute of the \ element contains a relative path reference
to XCAP URI identifying an XML document to be subscribed to;
e) if the VAL server wants to fetch the current state only, shall set the
Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [11], to zero. Otherwise,
shall set the Expires header field to the duration for which VAL user has
requested for subscription;
Upon reception of an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request:
a) with the Event header field set to xcap-diff;

specified in 3GPP TS 24 229 [8]), in a P-Asserted-Service header field
according to IETF RFC 6050 [10];
the SCM-S:
d) shall identify the originating VAL user ID and shall use the originating
VAL user ID as an authenticated identity when performing the authorization;

disabled.
The \ element of \ element is of type
\"Boolean\" and indicates whether this particular SEAL user profile is default
profile for VAL user or not.
The \ element of \ element contains a
positive number which provides profile id. This element is used only when
multiple user-profile for a VAL user is supported.
The \ element of \ element contains
actual profile configuration. The VAL application which uses SEAL user-profile
may provide its own profile configuration specific to VAL application.

## 7.2 VAL UE configuration document
### 7.2.1 General
### 7.2.2 Application unique ID
The AUID shall be set to the VAL service ID as specified in specific VAL
service specification.
### 7.2.3 Data structure
The SEAL UE configuration document structure is specified in this clause.
The \ document:
1) shall include a \"domain\" attribute;
2) may include a \ element;
3) may include a \ element;
4) may include a \ element;
5) may include a \ element;
6) may include an \ element; and
7) may include any other attribute for the purposes of extensibility.
The \ element:
1) may contain a list of \ elements; and
2) may contain a list of \ elements.
The \ element:
1) shall contain a \ element;
2) may contain a list of \ elements; and
3) may contain \ element.
The \ element:
1) shall contain a \ element; and
2) shall contain a \ element.

### 7.2.5 Semantics
The \"domain\" attribute of the \ element contains the
domain name of the VAL service.
The \ element of the \ element contains the user
displayable name of the SEAL UE configuration document.
The creator of the SEAL UE configuration document may include an \
element in the version of the SEAL UE configuration document that is uploaded
to the SCM-S. If an \ element is included then the SEAL UE
configuration document applies only to the VAL UE(s) identified by the \ element. If no \ element is included then the SEAL UE
configuration document applies to all the VAL UEs of the domain.
The \ element contains identify of the VAL service for which
the configuration document is applicable.
If one or more optional \ elements is included in the \ element then the SEAL UE configuration document applies to the VAL UE
with an instance ID equal to the instance ID contained in the \ element.
The \ element of the \ element contains the Type Allocation
Code of the VAL UE.
The optional \ element of the \ element contains the
individual serial number uniquely identifying VAL UE within the Type
Allocation Code contained in the \ element that the SEAL UE configuration
document applies to.
If an optional \ element is included within the \
element then the SEAL UE configuration document applies to all VAL UEs within
the Type Allocation Code contained in the \ element with the serial
number equal or greater than the serial number contained in the \
element and less than or equal to the serial number contained in the \ element.
If no \ element nor \ element is included within the \ element then the SEAL UE configuration document applies to all the VAL
UE(s) with the Type Allocation Code contained within the \ element of the
\ element.
If no \ element is included then the SEAL UE configuration document
applies to all VAL UEs of the VAL service identified in the \"domain\"
attribute.
The VAL service may further extend the \ element of the \ to include VAL service specific common UE configuration.
The VAL service may further extend the \ element of the \ to include VAL service specific UE configuration for on-network
features.
### 7.2.6 MIME type
The MIME type for VAL user profile configuration shall be set to
\"vnd.3gpp.seal-ue-config-info+xml\".
### 7.2.7 IANA registration template
Your Name:
\
Your Email Address:
\
Media Type Name:
Application
Subtype name:
vnd.3gpp.seal-ue-config-info+xml
Required parameters:
None
Optional parameters:
\"charset\" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of
the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC
7303.
Encoding considerations:
binary.
Security considerations:
Same as general security considerations for application/xml media type as
specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. In addition, this media type
provides a format for exchanging information in SIP or in HTTP. So the
security considerations from IETF RFC 3261 apply while exchanging information
in SIP and the security considerations from IETF RFC 2616 apply while
exchanging information in HTTP.
The information transported in this media type does not include active or
executable content.
Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters exist.
Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security mechanisms are
described in 3GPP TS 24.229.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute
actions on a recipient\'s files or other resources.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute
actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in
disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else
violates a recipient\'s privacy in any way.
This media type does not employ compression.
Interoperability considerations:
Same as general interoperability considerations for application/xml media type
as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. Any unknown XML elements and any
unknown XML attributes are to be ignored by recipient of the MIME body.
Published specification:
3GPP TS 24.546 \"Configuration management - Service Enabler Architecture Layer
for Verticals (SEAL); Protocol specification\", available via
http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm.
Applications Usage:
Applications supporting the SEAL configuration management procedures as
described in the published specification.
Fragment identifier considerations:
The handling in section 5 of IETF RFC 7303 applies.
Restrictions on usage:
None
Provisional registration? (standards tree only):
