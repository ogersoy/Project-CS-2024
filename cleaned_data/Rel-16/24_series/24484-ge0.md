critical service offline configuration over the CSC-11 and CSC-12 reference
points.
Mission critical services include:
\- Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT);
\- Mission Critical Video (MCVideo); and
\- Mission Critical Data (MCData).
Configuration management documents defined in the present document includes:
\- MCS UE initial configuration document;
\- MCPTT UE configuration document;
\- MCPTT user profile configuration document;
\- MCPTT service configuration document;
\- MCVideo UE configuration document;
\- MCVideo user profile configuration document;
\- MCVideo service configuration document;

## 4.2 MCS UE configuration
### 4.2.1 General
Upon start up the MCS UE bootstraps the required information (e.g. FQDN or IP
address) to locate the configuration management server for configuration of
the MCS UE initial configuration management object (MO) and the default MCPTT
user profile configuration management object (MO).
In order to obtain access to MC services the MCS UE needs to obtain
configuration data either online via the network or offline using some
external device (e.g. a laptop). As part of the bootstrap process the MCS UE
needs to discover either:
1\. the online configuration management server in the network that configures
the MCS UE initial configuration MO and the default MCS user profile
configuration MO(s), then the MCS UE:
a) using the URI of the configuration management server obtained from the MCS
UE initial configuration MO, obtains for each MCS that is enabled:
\- the appropriate MCS UE configuration document;
\- the appropriate MCS user profile configuration document; and
\- the appropriate MCS service configuration document; and
b) using the URI of the group management server obtained from the MCS UE
initial configuration MO obtain the MCS group document; or
2\. the:
a) offline configuration management server on the external device that
configures the MCS UE with the:
\- MCS UE initial configuration MO;
\- appropriate MCS UE configuration MO(s);
\- appropriate MCS user profile MO(s); and
\- appropriate MCS service configuration MO(s); and
b) offline group management server on the external device that configures the
MCS UE with the MCS group MO.
The mechanism to discover the online or offline configuration management
server is dependent on the protocol used to manage and configure the MO and is
out of scope of the present document.
### 4.2.2 Online configuration
#### 4.2.2.1 General
The format of the MCS UE initial configuration MO downloaded to the MCS UE
during online configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
The format of the MCS group document downloaded to the MCS UE during online
configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5].
Figure 4.2.2.1-1 shows the MCPTT UE online configuration time sequence.
Figure 4.2.2.1-1 MCS UE online configuration time sequence
If the MCS UE initial configuration MO has changed from the version stored in
the MCS UE, the updated MCS UE initial configuration MO is downloaded to the
MCPTT UE.
If the MCS UE initial configuration MO contains a \
element and the identified default MCS user profile configuration MO(s) have
changed from the version stored in the MCS UE, the updated default MCS user
profile configuration MO(s) are downloaded to the MCS UE.
NOTE 1: The default MCS user profile configuration MO(s) define the default
identity(s) for the enabled mission critical service(s) and the profile of
services available to the user (e.g. emergency MCPTT services) prior to user
authentication.
The MCS UE contacts the identity management server using the HTTPS URI stored
in the MCS UE initial configuration MO and performs MCS User authentication as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.482 [6].
The MCS UE, using the identities obtained during MCS user authentication,
subscribes to the MCS UE configuration document, the MCS user profile
configuration document and the MCS service configuration document for each
enabled MCS using the procedure for subscribing to multiple documents
simultaneously using the subscription proxy function specified in subclause
6.3.13.2.2 (i.e., the CMS acts as a Subscription Proxy) and subscribes to the
MCS group document using the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5]. If
these documents have been updated since the current version stored in the MCS
UE, then the MCS UE will receive a SIP NOTIFY request with an XCAP Diff
document (see IETF RFC 5875 [11]), in which case the CMC updates its local
document copies . Retrieval by the MCS UE using the notified HTTPS URI of the
MCS group document is performed as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5].
NOTE 2: The MCS UE can be notified of changes to a configuration document at
any time while using the MCS.
#### 4.2.2.2 MCPTT
The format of the MPCTT UE configuration document downloaded to the MCPTT UE
during online configuration is defined in subclause 8.2.
The format of the MPCTT user profile configuration document downloaded to the
MCPTT UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 8.3.
The format of the MPCTT service configuration document downloaded to the MCPTT
UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 8.4.
#### 4.2.2.3 MCVideo configuration
The format of the MCVideo UE configuration document downloaded to the MCVideo
UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 9.2.
The format of the MCVideo user profile configuration document downloaded to
the MCVideo UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 9.3.
The format of the MCVideo service configuration document downloaded to the
MCVideo UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 9.4.
#### 4.2.2.4 MCData configuration
The format of the MCData UE configuration document downloaded to the MCData UE
during online configuration is defined in subclause 10.2.
The format of the MCData user profile configuration document downloaded to the
MCData UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 10.3.
The format of the MCData service configuration document downloaded to the
MCData UE during online configuration is defined in subclause 10.4.
### 4.2.3 Offline configuration
#### 4.2.3.1 General
When configuring an MCS UE offline the offline configuration management server
will need to support the MCS administrator providing the identity(s) of the
MCS user for whom the MCS UE is being configured so that the correct
configuration data for that MCPTT user can be configured in the MOs.
The format of the MCS UE initial configuration MO downloaded to the MCPTT UE
during offline configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
The format of the MCS group document MO to the MCPTT UE during offline
configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
NOTE: If the MCPTT service administrator includes a \"DefaultUserProfile\"
element in the MCS UE initial configuration MO as defined in 3GPP TS 24.483
[4], at least one instance of an MCS user profile configuration MO needs to
first be created on the offline configuration management server, containing
the \"MCPTTUserID\" element and \"UserProfileIndex\" element (as defined in
3GPP TS 24.483 [4]) that are included in the \"DefaultUserProfile\" element.
Editor\'s Note: [C1-170137, MCImp-eMCPTT-CT] Addressing the identities element
is FFS.
#### 4.2.3.2 MCPTT
The format of the MPCTT UE configuration MO downloaded to the MCPTT UE during
offline configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
The format of the MPCTT user profile configuration MO downloaded to the MCPTT
UE during offline configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
The format of the MPCTT service configuration MO downloaded to the MCPTT UE
during offline configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].

during offline configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
## 4.3 MCS server
### 4.3.1 General
The MCS server obtains the appropriate MCS service configuration document that
contains the mission critical organisation configured parameters that defined
the behaviour of the MCS from the configuration management server.
The MCS server obtains the MCS service configuration document that contains
the mission critical organisation configured parameters that defined the
behaviour of the MCS from the configuration management server.
The MCS server subscribes to the MCS service configuration document for each
mission critical organisation that is provisioned that is supported by the MCS
server using the procedure specified in subclause 6.3.13.2.3. How the MCS
server is provisioned with the identities of the mission critical
organisations is out of scope of the present document.
If the MCS service configuration document has been updated since the current
version stored at the MCS server, then the MCS server will receive a SIP
NOTIFY request containing an HTTPS URI of the MCS service configuration
document. Retrieval by the MCS server, using the notified HTTPS URI, of the
MCS service configuration document is performed as specified in subclause
6.3.3.2.3.
NOTE: The MCS server can be notified of changes to the MCS service management
configuration document at any time while operating the MCS.
### 4.3.2 MCPTT Server
The format of the MCPTT service configuration document downloaded to the MCPTT
server is defined in subclause 8.4.
### 4.3.3 MCVideo Server
The format of the MCData service configuration document downloaded to the
MCData server is defined in subclause 9.4.
### 4.3.4 MCData Server
The format of the MCData service configuration document downloaded to the
MCData server is defined in subclause 10.4.
## 4.4 Configuration management server
The following applies to the configuration management server used for online
configuration.
The configuration management server needs to convert the MCS UE initial
configuration document received from an MCS administrator into an appropriate
format for configuration of the MCS UE initial configuration MO.
If the MCS UE initial configuration MO contains a \
element that identifies an MCS user profile configuration document, the
configuration management server needs to convert the identified MCS user
profile configuration document received from an MCS administrator into an
appropriate format for configuration of the MCS user profile configuration MO.
Once an MCS User Profile configuration document has been created or updated by
the MCS UE, the configuration management server uses the procedures specified
in 3GPP TS 29.283 [7] to store MCS user profile configuration document as the
user profile in the MC service user database.
In order to download the MCS user profile configuration document to an MCS UE
or to support an MCS UE updating the MCS user profile configuration document,
the configuration management server uses the procedures specified in 3GPP TS
29.283 [7] to obtain the MCS user profile from the MC service user database.
In order to be notified of changes to an MCS user profile configuration
document(s) that have been subscribed to by an MCS UE, the configuration
management server uses the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 29.283 [7] to be
notified of changes to the MCS user profile stored in the MC service user
database.
In order to delete the MCS user profile when requested by an MCS UE, the
configuration management server uses the procedures specified in 3GPP TS
29.283 [7] to delete the MCS user profile from the MC service user database.
NOTE: The configuration management server and group management server
functionality for offline configuration is out of scope of the present
document.

## 7.2 MCS UE initial configuration document
### 7.2.1 General
#### 7.2.1.0 Applicability
The MCS UE initial configuration document is specified in this subclause. The
MCS UE initial configuration document content is based on requirements of
Annex A.6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [8A], and structure and procedures of OMA OMA-TS-
XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. The usage of an MCS UE initial configuration in
an MCS is described in 3GPP TS 24.379 [9] and 3GPP TS 24.380 [10]. The schema
definition is provided in subclause 7.2.2.3.
An MCS UE initial configuration document may apply to all MCS UEs of a mission
critical organization or apply to specific MCS UEs identified by the optional
\ element. If there is no \ element, then by default
the MCS UE initial configuration document applies to all MCS UEs of the
mission critical organization. If the MCS UE is to be configured with a
specific MCS UE initial configuration document that document is identified by
comparing the instance ID of the MCS UE with the criteria in the \ element.
The MCS UE initial configuration document acts as a template for the device
management server coresident in the CMS to generate the MCS UE initial
configuration managed object. The MCS UE initial configuration document that
acts as a template is referred to as a \"master MCS UE initial configuration
document\".
The master MCS UE initial configuration document is stored in the user
directory of that MCS administrator. The master MCS UE initial configuration
document does not directly apply to a specific MCS UE, but instead acts as
template that the CMS uses to generate MCS UE initial configuration managed
objects of MCS UEs identified by elements of the \ element. For
MCS UE initial configuration documents that correspond to a specific MCS UE,
the name of the MCS UE initial configuration document is created from a value
defined by the corresponding element that identifies the MCS UE within the
\ element. For a master MCS UE initial configuration documents
that does not contain a \ element, the name of the MCS UE initial
configuration document is \"DEFAULT-MCPTT-INITIAL-UE.xml\".
NOTE: For historical reasons, some of the elements in the MCS UE initial
configuration document uses the terminology \"MCPTT\", however this document
is common to all MCS with some MCPTT specific elements. Not all elements that
contain the terminology \"MCPTT\" are just MCPTT specific.
#### 7.2.1.1 MCS client access to UE initial configuration documents
The MCS UE initial configuration documents of an MCS UE are contained as \"XDM
collections\" in the user\'s directory of the users tree, in accordance with
OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. In this case, the term \"user\" in
the XCAP sense refers to the UE-id.
The MCS UE initial configuration document is accessed using the same XCAP URI,
regardless of whether the MCS UE has a specific MCS UE initial configuration
document configured or the master MCS UE initial configuration document
applies. The CMS shall generate the UE\'s MCS UE initial configuration
document from the master MCS UE initial configuration document if the MCS
administrator did not provision a specific MCS UE initial configuration
document. In this generated document, the \ element shall be set
to the MCS client\'s UE ID. The UE\'s MCS UE initial configuration document
shall always be stored with the filename corresponding to the UE\'s MCS UE ID
under the users directory in the users tree.
The XCAP URI used by the MCS client to access the UE\'s MCS UE initial
configuration document shall be\ _CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcptt.ue-init-
config/users/sip:MCSUEID/MCSUEID_

#### 7.2.2.7 Data Semantics
The \"domain\" attribute of the \ element
contains the domain name of the mission critical organization.
The creator of the MCS UE initial configuration document may include an
\ element in the version of the MCS UE initial configuration
document that is uploaded to the CMS and may also appear in the MCS UE initial
configuration document when downloaded by the MCS administrator. The \ element does not appear in the MCS UE initial configuration managed
object specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] that is configured to the MCS UE. If an
\ element is included then the MCS UE initial configuration
document and corresponding MCS UE initial configuration management object
applies only to the MCS UE(s) identified by the \ element. If no
\ element is included then the MCS UE initial configuration
document and corresponding MCS UE initial configuration management object
applies to all the MCS UEs of the domain.
If one or more optional \ elements is included in the
\ element then the MCS UE initial configuration document applies
to the MCS UE with an instance ID equal to the instance ID contained in the
\ element.
The \ element of the \ element contains the Type Allocation
Code of the MCS UE.
The optional \ element of the \ element contains the
individual serial number uniquely identifying MCS UE within the Type
Allocation Code contained in the \ element that the MCS UE initial
configuration document applies to.
If an optional \ element is included within the \
element then the MCS UE initial configuration document applies to all MCS UEs
within the Type Allocation Code contained in the \ element with the
serial number equal or greater than the serial number contained in the \ element and less than or equal to the serial number contained in the
\ element.
If no \ element nor \ element is included within the \ element then the MCS UE initial configuration document applies to all
the MCS UE(s) with the Type Allocation Code contained within the \
element of the \ element.
If no \ element is included then the MCS UE initial configuration
document applies to all MCS UEs of the mission critical organization
identified in the \"domain\" attribute.
The \ element of the \ element contains
the user displayable name of the MCS UE initial configuration document and
corresponds to the \"Name\" element of subclause 8.2.3 in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
The \"User-ID\" attribute of the \ element contains the
XUI contained in the \"XUI-URI\" attribute of the MCPTT user profile that is
intended to be used as default MCS user profile and corresponds to the
\"UserID\" element of subclause 8.2.6 in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4].
The \"user-profile-index\" attribute of the \ element
contains an indicator for a particular MCS user profile document when multiple
MCS user profiles are defined for that MCS user and is of type
\"unsignedByte\" and matches a value in a \"user-profile-index\" attribute of
the MCS user profile that is intended to be used as default MCS user profile,
and corresponds to the \"UserProfileIndex\" element of subclause 8.2.7 in 3GPP
TS 24.483 [4]
The \ element contains MCS UE initial configuration data for on-
network operation only.
The \ element contains MCS UE initial configuration data for off-
network operation only.
In the \ element:
1) the \ element;
a) the \ element contains the timer value in seconds for floor release
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.380 [10] and corresponds to the \"T100\" element of
subclause 8.2.11 in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4];

# 8 MCPTT configuration management documents
## 8.1 Introduction
This subclause defines the structure, default document namespace, AUID, XML
schema, MIME type, validation constraints and data semantics following
documents;
MCPTT UE configuration document;
MCPTT user profile configuration document; and
MCPTT service configuration document.
## 8.2 MCPTT UE configuration document
### 8.2.1 General
The MCPTT UE configuration document is specified in this subclause. The MCPTT
UE configuration document content is based on requirements of Annex A.2 of
3GPP TS 23.379 [8], in accordance with OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A
[2]. The usage of an MCPTT UE configuration document in the MCPTT service is
described in 3GPP TS 24.379 [9] and 3GPP TS 24.380 [10]. The schema definition
is provided in subclause 8.2.2.3. An MCPTT UE configuration document may apply
to all MCPTT UEs of a mission critical organization or apply to specific MCPTT
UEs identified in the \ element. If there is no \
element in the MCPTT UE configuration document, then by default the MCPTT UE
configuration document applies to all MCPTT UEs of the mission critical
organization that are not specifically identified in the \
element of another MCPTT UE configuration document of the mission critical
organization. Each MCPTT UE of a mission critical organization is configured
with an MCPTT UE configuration document that is identified by the instance ID
of the MCPTT UE.
MCPTT UE configuration documents of a MCPTT user are contained as \"XDM
collections\" in the user\'s directory of the users tree, in accordance with
OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. In this case, the term \"user\" in
the XCAP sense refers to the MCPTT ID, as the user has been already
authenticated. A MCPTT UE configuration document corresponding to a specific
MCPTT UE the MCPTT user has used to authenticate and is authorised to use the
MCPTT service with is placed in the user directory of the MCPTT user.
The MCPTT UE configuration document acts as a template for the CMS to generate
UE configuration documents that are downloaded to specific MCPTT UEs. The
MCPTT UE configuration document that acts as a template is referred to as a
\"master MCPTT UE configuration document\". The master MCPTT UE configuration
document is stored in the users tree of that MCPTT system administrator. The
master MCPTT UE configuration document does not directly apply to a specific
MCPTT UE, but instead acts as template that the CMS uses to populate the MCPTT
UE configuration documents of MCPTT UEs identified by elements of the \ element. For MCPTT UE configuration documents that correspond to a
specific MCPTT UE, the name of the MCPTT UE configuration document is created
from a value defined by the corresponding element that identifies the MCPTT UE
within the \ element. For a master MCPTT UE configuration
documents that does not contain a \ element, the name of the
MCPTT UE configuration document stored in the user directory is \"DEFAULT-
MCPTT-UE.xml\".
### 8.2.1A MCPTT client access to MCPTT UE configuration documents
The MCPTT UE configuration document is accessed using the same XCAP URI,
regardless of whether the MCPTT UE has a specific MCPTT UE configuration
document configured or the master MCPTT UE configuration document applies. The
CMS shall generate the UE\'s MCPTT UE configuration document from the master
MCPTT UE configuration document if the MCPTT administrator did not provision a
specific MCPTT UE configuration document. In this generated document, the
\ element shall be set to the MCPTT client\'s UE ID. The UE\'s
MCPTT UE configuration document shall always be stored with the filename
corresponding to the UE\'s MCPTT UE ID under the user\'s directory of the
users tree.
The XCAP URI used by the MCPTT client to access the UE\'s MCPTT UE
configuration document shall be:
CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcptt.ue-config/users/sip:MCPTTID/MCSUEID
### 8.2.2 Coding

## 8.3 MCPTT user profile configuration document
### 8.3.1 General
The MCPTT user profile configuration document is specified in this subclause.
The MCPTT user profile configuration document content is based on requirements
of Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [8], and structure and procedures of OMA OMA-
TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. The usage of an MCPTT user profile in the
MCPTT service is described in 3GPP TS 24.379 [9]. The schema definition is
provided in subclause 8.3.2.
MCPTT user profile documents are \"XDM collections\" in the user\'s directory
of the users tree, in accordance with OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2].
In this case, the term \"user\" in the XCAP sense refers to the MCPTT ID, as

#### 8.4.2.8 Naming Conventions
The service configuration document name is called service-config.xml.
#### 8.4.2.9 Global documents
The service configuration document is a global document. This document resides
under the global tree for the CMSXCAPROOT. Since there is only one document
for each mission critical organization, the CMSXCAPROOT may be used to
distinguish different service configuration documents. Otherwise, a
subdirectory under the global tree, named by the mission critical organization
name can be used to distinguish different service configuration documents. For
example, if the CMSXCAPROOTURI respresents a single one mission critical
organization, then the document URI would be:
_mc-org-domain/mcorg12345/org.3gpp.mcptt.service-config/global/service-
config.xml_
otherwise, if it services multiple organizations then the document URI would
be:
_CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcptt.service-config/global/mc-org-name/service-
config.xml_
Since the service configuration is a global document, all users will have
read-only access. Read-write access is only allowed for the system
administrators of the mission critical organization.
#### 8.4.2.10 Resource interdependencies
There are no resource interdependencies.
#### 8.4.2.11 Authorization Policies
The authorization policies for manipulating a service configuration document
shall conform to those described in OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]
subclause 5.1.5 \"_Authorization_ \".
#### 8.4.2.12 Subscription to Changes
The service configuration document application usage shall support
subscription to changes as specified in subclause 6.3.13.3.
# 9 MCVideo configuration management documents
## 9.1 Introduction
This subclause defines the structure, default document namespace, AUID, XML
schema, MIME type, validation constraints and data semantics following
documents;
MCVideo UE configuration document;
MCVideo user profile configuration document; and
MCVideo service configuration document.
## 9.2 MCVideo UE configuration document
### 9.2.1 General
The MCVideo UE configuration document is specified in this subclause. The
MCVideo UE configuration document content is based on requirements of Annex
A.2 of 3GPP TS 23.281 [27], in accordance with OMA OMA-TS-
XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. The usage of an MCVideo UE configuration
document in the MCVideo service is described in 3GPP TS 24.281 [28] and 3GPP
TS 24.581 [29]. The schema definition is provided in subclause 9.2.2.3. An
MCVideo UE configuration document may apply to all MCVideo UEs of a mission
critical organization or apply to specific MCVideo UEs identified in the
\ element. If there is no \ element in the
MCVideo UE configuration document, then by default the MCVideo UE
configuration document applies to all MCVideo UEs of the mission critical
organization that are not specifically identified in the \
element of another MCVideo UE configuration document of the mission critical
organization. Each MCVideo UE of a mission critical organization is configured
with an MCVideo UE configuration document that is identified by the instance
ID of the MCVideo UE.
MCVideo UE configuration documents of a MCVideo user are contained as \"XDM
collections\" in the user\'s directory of the users tree, in accordance with
OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. In this case, the term \"user\" in
the XCAP sense refers to the MCVideo ID, as the user has been already
authenticated. A MCVideo UE configuration document corresponding to a specific
MCVideo UE the MCVideo user has used to authenticate and is authorised to use
the MCVideo service with is placed in the user directory of the MCVideo user.
The MCVideo UE configuration document acts as a template for the CMS to
generate UE configuration documents that are downloaded to specific MCVideo
UEs. The MCVideo UE configuration document that acts as a template is referred
to as a \"master MCVideo UE configuration document\". The master MCVideo UE
configuration document is stored in the users tree of that MCVideo system
administrator. The master MCVideo UE configuration document does not directly
apply to a specific MCVideo UE, but instead acts as template that the CMS uses
to populate the MCVideo UE configuration documents of MCVideo UEs identified
by elements of the \ element. For MCVideo UE configuration
documents that correspond to a specific MCVideo UE, the name of the MCVideo UE
configuration document is created from a value defined by the corresponding
element that identifies the MCVideo UE within the \ element.
For a master MCVideo UE configuration documents that does not contain a
\ element, the name of the MCVideo UE configuration document
stored in the user directory is \"DEFAULT-MCVideo-UE.xml\".
### 9.2.1A MCVideo client access to MCVideo UE configuration documents
The MCVideo UE configuration document is accessed using the same XCAP URI,
regardless of whether the MCVideo UE has a specific MCVideo UE configuration
document configured or the master MCVideo UE configuration document applies.
The CMS shall generate the UE\'s MCVideo UE configuration document from the
master MCVideo UE configuration document if the MCVideo administrator did not
provision a specific MCVideo UE configuration document. In this generated
document, the \ element shall be set to the MCVideo client\'s
UE ID. The UE\'s MCVideo UE configuration document shall always be stored with
the filename corresponding to the UE\'s MCVideo UE ID under the user\'s
directory in the users tree.
The XCAP URI used by the MCVideo client to access the UE\'s MCVideo UE
configuration document shall be:
CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcvideo.ue-config/users/sip:MCVIDEOID/MCSUEID

#### 9.2.2.12 Subscription to Changes
The MCVideo UE configuration document application usage shall support
subscription to changes as specified in] subclause 6.3.13.3.
MCVideo UE configuration documents are kept as XDM collections. Therefore, it
is possible to subscribe to all MCVideo UE configuration documents of a
MCVideo user according to XCAP URI construction convention of a trailing
\'/\', as specified in IETF RFC 5875 [11].
## 9.3 MCVideo user profile configuration document
### 9.3.1 General
The MCVideo user profile configuration document is specified in this
subclause. The MCVideo user profile configuration document content is based on
requirements of Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.281 [27], and structure and procedures
of OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. In this case, the term \"user\" in
the XCAP sense refers to the MCVideo ID, as the user has been already
authenticated. The usage of an MCVideo user profile in the MCVideo service is
described in 3GPP TS 24.281 [28]. The schema definition is provided in
subclause 9.3.2.
MCVideo user profile documents are \"XDM collections\" in the user\'s
directory of the users tree, in accordance with OMA OMA-TS-
XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2].
The name of the MCVideo user profile document matches the value of the

5) the \ element within the \ element
indicates how a Resource-Priority header field is to be populated for MCVideo
emergency calls;
6) the \ element within the \
element indicates how a Resource-Priority header field is to be populated for
MCVideo imminent peril calls; and
7) the \ element within the \ element
indicates how a Resource-Priority header field is to be populated when
downgrading to normal priority from an MCVideo emergency call or MCVideo
imminent peril call.
In the \ element:
1) the \ element contains priority values
for off-network calls, for each of the following constituent elements:
a) \ element, which corresponds to the
\"MCVideoPrivateCallSignalling\" element as specified in subclause 14.2.12 of
3GPP TS 24.483 [4];
b) \ element, which corresponds to the
\"MCVideoPrivateCallMedia\" element as specified in subclause 14.2.13 of 3GPP
TS 24.483 [4];
c) \ element, which corresponds to
the \"MCVideoEmergencyPrivateCallSignalling\" element as specified in
subclause 14.2.14 of 3GPP TS 24.483 [4]; and

for determining what participants, participant types, and urgent transmission
types shall be granted a request to override an active off-network MCVideo
transmission, which corresponds to the \"NumLevelHierarchy\" element as
specified in subclause 14.2.18 of 3GPP TS 24.483 [4]. Absence of the \ element in the \ element indicates
that the lowest possible value is used according to the schema to represent
the priority hierarchy.
#### 9.4.2.8 Naming Conventions
The MCVideo service configuration document name shall be called \"mcvideo-
service-config.xml\".
#### 9.4.2.9 Global documents
The MCVideo service configuration document is a global document. This document
resides under the global tree for the CMSXCAPROOT. Since there is only one
document for each mission critical organization, the CMSXCAPROOT may be used
to distinguish differentMC Video service configuration documents. Otherwise, a
subdirectory under the global tree, named by the mission critical organization
name can be used to distinguish different service configuration documents. For
example, if the CMSXCAPROOTURI respresents a single one mission critical
organization, then the document URI would be:
_mc-org-domain/mcorg12345/org.3gpp.mcvideo.service-config/global/mcvideo-
service-config.xml_
otherwise, if it services multiple organizations then the document URI would
be:
_CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcvideo.service-config/global/mc-org-name/mcvideo-
service-config.xml_
Since the MCVideo service configuration is a global document, all users will
have read-only access. Read-write access is only allowed for the system
administrators of the mission critical organization.
#### 9.4.2.10 Resource interdependencies
There are no resource interdependencies.
#### 9.4.2.11 Authorization Policies
The authorization policies for manipulating a service configuration document
shall conform to those described in OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]
subclause 5.1.5 \"_Authorization_ \".
#### 9.4.2.12 Subscription to Changes
The service configuration document application usage shall support
subscription to changes as specified in subclause 6.3.13.3.
# 10 MCData configuration management documents
## 10.1 Introduction
This subclause defines the structure, default document namespace, AUID, XML
schema, MIME type, validation constraints and data semantics following
documents;
MCData UE configuration document;
MCData user profile configuration document; and
MCData service configuration document.
## 10.2 MCData UE configuration document
### 10.2.1 General
The MCData UE configuration document is specified in this subclause. The
MCData UE configuration document content is based on requirements of Annex A.2
of 3GPP TS 23.282 [24], in accordance with OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A
[2]. The usage of an MCData UE configuration document in the MCData service is
described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [25] and 3GPP TS 24.582 [26]. The schema
definition is provided in subclause 10.2.2.3. An MCData UE configuration
document may apply to all MCData UEs of a mission critical organization or
apply to specific MCData UEs identified in the \ element. If
there is no \ element in the MCData UE configuration document,
then by default the MCData UE configuration document applies to all MCData UEs
of the mission critical organization that are not specifically identified in
the \ element of another MCData UE configuration document of the
mission critical organization. Each MCData UE of a mission critical
organization is configured with an MCData UE configuration document that is
identified by the instance ID of the MCData UE.
MCData UE configuration documents of a MCData user are contained as \"XDM
collections\" in the user\'s directory of the users tree, in accordance with
OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. In this case, the term \"user\" in
the XCAP sense refers to the MCData ID, as the user has been already
authenticated. A MCData UE configuration document corresponding to a specific
MCData UE the MCData user has used to authenticate and is authorised to use
the MCData service with is placed in the user directory of the MCData user.
The MCData UE configuration document acts as a template for the CMS to
generate UE configuration documents that are downloaded to specific MCData
UEs. The MCData UE configuration document that acts as a template is referred
to as a \"master MCData UE configuration document\". The master MCData UE
configuration document is stored in the users tree of that MCData system
administrator. The master MCData UE configuration document does not directly
apply to a specific MCData UE, but instead acts as template that the CMS uses
to populate the MCData UE configuration documents of MCData UEs identified by
elements of the \ element. For MCData UE configuration documents
that correspond to a specific MCData UE, the name of the MCData UE
configuration document is created from a value defined by the corresponding
element that identifies the MCData UE within the \ element. For
a master MCData UE configuration documents that does not contain a \ element, the name of the MCData UE configuration document stored in the
user directory is \"DEFAULT-MCData-UE.xml\".
### 10.2.1A MCData client access to MCData UE configuration documents
The MCData UE configuration document is accessed using the same XCAP URI,
regardless of whether the MCData UE has a specific MCData UE configuration
document configured or the master MCData UE configuration document applies.
The CMS shall generate the UE\'s MCData UE configuration document from the
master MCData UE configuration document if the MCData administrator did not
provision a specific MCData UE configuration document. In this generated
document, the \ element shall be set to the MCData client\'s UE
ID. The UE\'s MCData UE configuration document shall always be stored with the
filename corresponding to the UE\'s MCData UE ID under the user\'s directory
of the users tree.
The XCAP URI used by the MCData client to access the UE\'s MCData UE
configuration document shall be:
CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcdata.ue-config/users/sip:MCDATAID/MCSUEID
### 10.2.2 Coding

constrained to communications initiated by MCData users identified within the
elements of the \ element, based on the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.282 [25]. This shall be the default value
taken in the absence of the element.
#### 10.3.2.8 Naming Conventions
The name of user profile configuration document shall be in the format of a
static \"mcdata-user-profile\" string concatenated with the value of \ attribute and including \".xml\" filetype. For instance
\"mcdata-user-profile-9.xml\" is the user profile document name for a MCData
user profile with the index value of 9.
#### 10.3.2.9 Global documents
The present document requires no global documents.
#### 10.3.2.10 Resource interdependencies
This Application Usage is interdependent on user profile data in the MCData
Database and the MCData Management Object.
#### 10.3.2.11 Access Permissions Policies
The authorization and access policies for a user profile configuration
document shall conform to those described in OMA OMA-TS-
XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2] subclause 5.1.5 \"_Authorization_ \" and
subclause  _5.6.7_ \"_Access Permissions Document_ \" with the following
exceptions:
1) The Principal (i.e., the user) of the user profile configuration document
shall have permission to create, modify, or delete \ child
elements of the \ elements, if the rule of the Access Permissions
document associated with the user profile configuration document contains the
action element \, as specified in OMA OMA-TS-
XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2] subclause 5.6.7 \"_Access Permissions Document_
\".
#### 10.3.2.12 Subscription to Changes
The User Access Policy Application Usage shall support subscription to changes
as specified in subclause 6.3.13.3.
MCData user profile configuration documents are kept as XDM collections.
Therefore, it is possible to subscribe to all MCData user profile
configuration documents of a MCData user according to XCAP URI construction
convention of a trailing \'/\', as specified in IETF RFC 5875 [11].
## 10.4 MCData service configuration document
### 10.4.1 General
The MCData service configuration document is specified in this subclause. The
MCData service configuration document content is based on requirements of
Annex A.5 of 3GPP TS 23.282 [24], and structure and procedures of OMA OMA-TS-
XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]. The usage of an MCData service configuration in
the MCData service is described in 3GPP TS 24.282[25] and 3GPP TS 24.582 [26].
The schema definition is provided in subclause 10.4.2.3. Each mission critical
organization is configured with an MCData service configuration document.
### 10.4.2 Coding

config.xml.
#### 10.4.2.9 Global documents
The MCData service configuration document is a global document. This document
resides under the global tree for the CMSXCAPROOT. Since there is only one
document for each mission critical organization, the CMSXCAPROOT may be used
to distinguish different MCData service configuration documents. Otherwise, a
subdirectory under the global tree, named by the mission critical organization
name can be used to distinguish different service configuration documents. For
example, if the CMSXCAPROOTURI respresents a single one mission critical
organization, then the document URI would be:
_mc-org-domain/mcorg12345/org.3gpp.mcdata.service-config/global/mcdata-
service-config.xml_
otherwise, if it services multiple organizations then the document URI would
be:
_CMSXCAPROOTURI/org.3gpp.mcdata.service-config/global/mc-org-name/mcdata-
service-config.xml_
Since the MCData service configuration is a global document, all users will
have read-only access. Read-write access is only allowed for the system
administrators of the mission critical organization.
#### 10.4.2.10 Resource interdependencies
There are no resource interdependencies.
#### 10.4.2.11 Authorization Policies
The authorization policies for manipulating a service configuration document
shall conform to those described in OMA OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V2_1-20120403-A [2]
subclause 5.1.5 \"_Authorization_ \".
#### 10.4.2.12 Subscription to Changes
The service configuration document application usage shall support
subscription to changes as specified in subclause 6.3.13.3.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for configuration management
using the extensible markup language configuration access protocol (XCAP) and
the session initiation protocol (SIP).
HTTP header fields and SIP header fields insignificant for the configuration
management are omitted.
# A.2 Signalling flows for MCPTT user profile configuration document creation
## A.2.1 CMC creating a MCPTT user profile configuration document on behalf of
MCPTT user
Figure A.2.1-1 shows a flow for a system adminstrator using configuration
management client CMC-1 creating an MCPTT user profile configuration document
on a configuration management server CMS-1 which then uploads it to the MCPTT
user database.
CMC-1 serves the system administrator (user1\@example.com). The CMC-1 is
configured with the CMSXCAPRootURI/MissionCriticalOrg/MCO-12345/.
In the example below the MCPTT user profile configuration document is user-
profile-0.xml and is created on behalf of user2@example.com (MCPTT ID
sip:user2@example.com) who has an alias of \"Officer 12345\".
The XUI of the document is the owner of the document (user1@example.com).
The document contains a single user profile for user2@example.com (Default
Duty Shift Profile of Officer 12345).
The user profile configures user2@example.com to be allowed to place private
calls to three users (user1@example.com, user3@example.com and
user4@example.com).
The user profile is configured to allow making an emergency group call to
MCPTTGroupEmergency@example.com and is alowed to have up to two simultaneous
group calls. The user is allowed to place an emergency private call to
user1\@example.com.
The user profile is configured to allow making an imminent peril call to
MCPTTGroupEmergency@example.com The user is allowed to place an Emergency
Alert to user1\@example.com.
The user profile is configured to allow making on network group calls to four
groups (MCPTTGroup-A@example.com, MCPTTGroup-B@example.com,
MCPTTGroup-C@example.com and MCPTTGroup-D@example.com).
The user is allowed to affiliate to a maximum of three groups and is implictly
affiliated to MCPTTGroup-A@example.com and MCPTTGroup-B\@example.com. The
maximum number of simultaneous transmissions with a group is limited to one.
The user profile is configured to allow making off network group calls to two
groups (MCPTTGroup-A@example.com, and MCPTTGroup-B@example.com).
The hostname of CMS-1 is cms1.example.com.
Figure A.2.1-1: CMC-1 creating a MCPTT user profile configuration document on
CMS-1 which is uploaded to the MCPTT user database
The details of the flows are as follows:
1) CMC-1 sends an HTTP PUT request shown in table A.2.1-1 to the CMS-1.

2) CMS-1 authenticates User1using the access token in the authorization header
field and creates the MCPTT user profile configuration document so that it is
accessible using the XCAP URI
http://MissionCriticalOrg/MCO-12345/sip:User2@example.com/user-profile-0.xml
and then uploads the document to the MCPTT user database (see 3GPP TS 29.283
[7]).
3) Once CMS-1 receives confirmation from the MCPTT user database that the new
MCPTT user profile document is stored then the CMS-1 sends a HTTP 201
(Created) response to indicate that the creation was successful.
## A.2.2 CMC subscribing to and obtaining MCPTT configuration documents
Figure A.2.2-1 shows a flow for a CMC subscribing to and obtaining MCPTT
configuration documents
The hostname of CMS-1 is cms1.example.com.
The user of the CMC is user2@example.com.
Figure A.2.2-1: CMC subscribing to and obtaining MCPTT configuration documents
Figure A.2.2-1 shows a CMC subscribing to and obtaining MCPTT configuration
documents. The details of the flow are as follows:
> 1\. SIP **SUBSCRIBE request (CMC in MCPTT UE to SIP Core) -- see example in
> table A.2.2-1**
A CMC in a MCPTT UE wishes to obtain and get a notification when his
configuration management documents are modified. In order to initiate a
subscription to XCAP document changes in the CMS, the MCPTT UE generates a SIP
SUBSCRIBE request indicating support for \"xcap-diff\", together with
\"message/external-body\". The Content-Type of the body is \"multipart/mixed\"
since two MIME parts are included in the body of the SIP SUBSCRIBE. One body
is of application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml containing the MCPTT access token in
order that the CMS can authenticate the MCPTT user and the other is of
application/resource-lists+xml containing a list of XCAP URIs of the
configuration management documents being subscribed to.

**Request-URI:** The public service identity of CMS-1 (sip:cms1.example.net).
**Event:** This header field is populated with the value \"xcap-diff\" to
specify the use of the xcap-diff package to get notified of changes to XCAP
configuration management documents.
**Accept:** This header field is populated with the value \"application/xcap-
diff+xml\" indicating that the MCPTT UE supports the XCAP-diff MIME type and
also the value \"message/external-body\" indicating that the MCPTT UE supports
content indirection (to avoid XCAP content that contains sensitive information
being included in a SIP NOTIFY request).
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
Contact: The contact URI and the feature tag g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to the MCPTT
feature tag \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt\"
Content-Type: Set to multipart/mixed as there are multiple body parts in the
body of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request.
\: The access token received from the Identity management
Server included within the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml body part.
\: Contains the XCAP request URIs for the documents being
subscribed to,. Relative paths (excluding the \"CMSXCAPRootURI\") may be used.
> 2\. SIP **SUBSCRIBE request (SIP core to CMS) - see example in table

> 3\. **Authorization**
The CMS performs the MCPTT user authorization based on the MCPTT access token
in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body in the SIP SUBSCRIBE
request to identify the MCPTT user and ensure that he/she is authorized to
subscribe to configuration managment document changes and to identify the
MCPTT user profile configuration document(s) of the MCPTT user.
\- In this example authorisation is sucessful, so the CMS sends a SIP 200 (OK)
response to the SIP core.
> 4\. SIP **200 (OK) response (CMS to SIP core) - see example in table
> A.2.2-4**

> 6\. **Obtaining and generating the configuration management document**
The CMS obtains the MCPTT user profile for the MCPTT user from the MCPTT user
database (see 3GPP TS 29.283 [7]), The MCPTT service configuration document is
identified solely by the entry
uri=\"/MissionCriticalOrg/MCO-12345/;/org.3gpp.mcptt.service-
config/global/service-config.xml\" and an off network MCPTT service
configuration document is generated that contains the \ and \ elements. The CMS mints XCAP URIs for each of these configuration
management documents.
> 7\. SIP **NOTIFY request (CMS to SIP core) -- see example in table A.2.2-7**
The CMS generates a SIP NOTIFY request including the xcap-diff document as a
result of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request. As this is the initial SIP NOTIFY it
contains only the new-etag, a previous etag and sel attributes for the MCPTT
UE configuration document, MCPTT user profile configuration document and the
off network MCPTT service configuration document.

The content of each document element contains a new-etag and a previous etag
attribute with identical value and no list of instructions. This way it is
indicated that this is the reference XML diff document. This documents has
only the information about the etags and the document URI\'s covered by that
subscription

## A.2.3 MCPTT server subscribing to and obtaining MCPTT service configuration
document
Figure A.2.3-1 shows a flow for the MCPTT server subscribing to and obtaining
the MCPTT service configuration document
The hostname of CMS-1 is cms1.example.com.
Figure A.2.3-1: MCPTT server subscribing to and obtaining the MCPTT service
configuration document
Figure A.2.3-1 shows a MCPTT server subscribing to and obtaining the MCPTT
service configuration document. The details of the flow are as follows:
> 1\. SIP **SUBSCRIBE request (MCPTT server to SIP Core) -- see example in
> table A.2.3-1**
A MCPTT server needs to obtain and get a notification when the service
configuration document of a hosted mission critical organisation are modified.
In order to initiate a subscription to XCAP document changes in the CMS, the
MCPTT server generates a SIP SUBSCRIBE request indicating support for \"xcap-
diff\", together with \"message/external-body\".
Table A.2.3-1: SIP SUBSCRIBE request (CMC in MCPTT UE to SIP core)

> Content-Length: 0
**Request-URI:** The XCAP-URI for the service configuration document based on
the CMS XCAP root URI configured in the MCPTT server at the public service
identity of CMS-1 (sip: MissionCriticalOrg.MCO-12345\@cms1.example.net).
**Event:** This header field is populated with the value \"xcap-diff\" to
specify the use of the xcap-diff package to get notified of changes to XCAP
configuration management documents.
**Accept:** This header field is populated with the value \"application/xcap-
diff+xml\" indicating that the MCPTT UE supports the XCAP-diff MIME type and
also the value \"message/external-body\" indicating that the MCPTT server
supports content indirection (to avoid XCAP content that contains sensitive
information being included in a SIP NOTIFY request).
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
.
> 2\. SIP **SUBSCRIBE request (SIP core to CMS) - see example in table
> A.2.3-2**
The SIP core forwards the SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the CMS.

> 3\. **Authorization**
The CMS performs authorization of the MCPTT server based on the P-Asserted-
Identity header field of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request to ensure that MCPTT server
is authorized to subscribe to MCPTT service configuration document changes.
\- In this example authorisation is sucessful, so the CMS sends a SIP 200 (OK)
response to the SIP core.
> 4\. SIP **200 (OK) response (CMS to SIP core) - see example in table
> A.2.3-4**
The CMS sends a SIP 200(OK) response to the SIP core.

> 6\. **Obtaining the MCPTT service configuration document**
The CMS obtains the MCPTT service configuration document for the Mission
Critical organisation based on the Request-URI. The CMS generates a MCPTT
service configuration document containing the \ and \
elements and mints an XCAP URI for the generated MCPTT service configuration
document.
> 7\. SIP **NOTIFY request (CMS to SIP core) -- see example in table A.2.3-7**
The CMS generates a SIP NOTIFY request including the xcap-diff document as a
result of the SIP SUBSCRIBE request. As this is the initial SIP NOTIFY it
contains only the new-etag, a previous etag and sel attributes for the MCPTT
service configuration document.
