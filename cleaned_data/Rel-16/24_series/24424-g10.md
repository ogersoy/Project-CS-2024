language (XML) configuration access protocol (XCAP) over the Ut interface for
manipulating supplementary services (SS).
The MO for XCAP over Ut interface for manipulating SS is compatible with OMA
device management protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is
defined using the OMA DM device description framework as described in the
enabler release definition OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
The MO for XCAP over Ut interface for manipulating SS consists of relevant
configuration parameters that can be managed for a UE supporting the UE role
specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 [3].

\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
The interior node is mandatory for a UE supporting the UE role specified in

## 5.4 /_\ _/Ext
The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information about
the management of the XCAP over the Ut interface for manipulating the SS is
being placed (vendor meaning application vendor, device vendor etc.). Usually
the vendor extension is identified by vendor specific name under the ext node.
The tree structure under the vendor identified is not defined and can
therefore include one or more un-standardized sub-trees.
