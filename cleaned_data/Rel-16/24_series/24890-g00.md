# 1 Scope
The present document discusses and describes the CT1 aspects of the 5G System
phase 1. In particular, these CT1 aspects include the non-access-stratum (NAS)
functions to be performed by the user equipment (UE) in idle mode and the NAS
signalling procedures between the UE and the 5G System (5GS) phase 1.
The present document also considers the requirements on the NAS between the UE
and the core network which arise from specific services such as public warning
system (PWS), SMS over NAS, emergency services, location services (LCS),
multimedia priority services (MPS), and also network functions such as access
control, security, QoS, IMS, network sharing, charging, congestion and
overload control. In addition, the document considers the case of network
slicing as well as interworking with E-UTRAN connected to EPC.
The present document is intended as a holding place for CT1 5GS material until
it stabilises sufficiently to be moved to appropriate 3GPP technical
specifications.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**5GMM-IDLE mode:** In this specification, if the term is used standalone, a
UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode means the UE can be either in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP
access or in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access.
**5GMM-CONNECTED mode:** In this specification, if the term is used
standalone, a UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode means the UE can be either in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP
access.
**5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access:** A UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode **over 3GPP
access** when no N1 NAS signalling connection between the UE and network over
3GPP access exists. The term 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access used in the
present document corresponds to the term CM-IDLE state for 3GPP access used in
3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
**5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access:** A UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over
3GPP access when a N1 NAS signalling connection between the UE and network
over 3GPP access exists. The term 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access used in
the present document corresponds to the term CM-CONNECTED state for 3GPP
access used in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
**5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access:** A UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over
non-3GPP access no N1 NAS signalling connection between the UE and network
over non-3GPP access exists. The term 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access used
in the present document corresponds to the term CM-IDLE state for non-3GPP
access used in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
**5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access:** A UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
over non-3GPP access when it has N1 NAS signalling connection between the UE
and network over non-3GPP access exists. The term 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over
non-3GPP access used in the present document corresponds to the term CM-
CONNECTED state for non-3GPP access used in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
**Access stratum connection:** A peer to peer access stratum connection
between either the UE and the NG-RAN for 3GPP access or the UE and the N3IWF
for non-3GPP access. The access stratum connection for 3GPP access corresponds
to an RRC connection via the Uu reference point. The creation of the access
stratum connection for non-3GPP access corresponds to the completion of the
IKE_SA_INIT exchange (see IETF RFC 7296 [36]) via the NWu reference point.
**DNN based congestion control:** **Type of congestion control at session
management level that is applied to reject session management requests from
UEs or** release PDU sessions when the associated DNN is congested**.**
**EAP-5G:** A vendor-specific EAP method which is used to encapsulate NAS
messages between the UE and the N3IWF.

management level that is applied at a general overload or congestion situation
in the network, e.g. lack of processing resources.**
**Last visited registered TAI:** A TAI which is contained in the registration
area that the UE registered to the network and which identifies the tracking
area last visited by the UE.
**N1 mode:** A mode of a UE allowing access to the 5G core network via the 5G
access network.
**N1 NAS signalling connection:** A peer to peer N1 mode connection between UE
and AMF. An N1 NAS signalling connection is either the concatenation of an RRC
connection via the Uu reference point and an NG connection via the N2

# 4 Architecture
## 4.1 General
The 5GS architecture is specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] and the stage 2
procedures and flows for 5GS are specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10].
## 4.2 Architecture reference model
The 5GS architecture reference model can be represented in two ways; a
service-based representation and a reference point representation (see figures
4.2.1, 4.2.2). The service-based representation also includes point-to-point
reference points where necessary. The 5GS architecture reference model covers
both roaming and non-roaming scenarios in all aspects, including interworking
between 5GS and EPS, mobility within 5GS, policy control and charging, and
authentication.
Figure 4.2.1: Non-roaming 5GS architecture in reference point representation
Figure 4.2.2: Non-roaming architecture for 5GCN with untrusted non-3GPP access
A UE, which supports 5GS connectivity, can access the 5GCN via a NG-RAN or a
standalone non-3GPP access or both. The NAS signalling with the 5GCN control-
plane functions is over the N1 reference point. The N11 reference point is
used to connect the core access and mobility management function (AMF) and the
session management function (SMF). The SMF handles the session management part
of the NAS signalling exchanged with the UE. The NWu reference point is used
for establishing secure tunnel(s) between the UE and the N3IWF so that
control-plane and user-plane exchanged between the UE and the 5GCN is
transferred securely over untrusted non-3GPP access. CT1 will specify the N1
and NWu interfaces.
## 4.3 Architecture for interworking with E-UTRAN connected to EPC
Interworking between the 5GS and the EPC through E-UTRAN is supported and
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] as illustrated by the figure 4.3.1. The system
interworking procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10].
Figure 4.3.1: Non-roaming architecture for interworking between the 5GS and
the EPC/E-UTRAN
The N26 interface is an inter-CN interface between the MME and the AMF used to
enable interworking between the EPC and the 5GCN. Support of the N26 interface
is optional. However, single-registration mode (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9])
requires support for N26 interface between the AMF and the MME to enable
seamless session continuity (e.g. for voice services) for N1 mode to S1 mode
inter-system change and vice versa.
Editor\'s note: Whether to support the single-registration mode without N26
interface is FFS.
# 5 Network selection procedures
## 5.1 Concepts
The 5GS supports both 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks as specified in 3GPP
TS 22.261 [3].
As per 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] the 5G system supports the concept of \"network
slices\" where different 5G radio access networks potentially are connected to
network slices of different SSTs. Network slicing is not taken into account
for PLMN selection. The network slices are selected only after the UE has
registered to a PLMN.
Editor\'s note: It is for further study how to support the concept of
\"network slices\" of 5G radio access networks.
Requirements on PLMN selection for 3GPP access in 3GPP TS 22.011 [2], clause
3.2 apply together with new requirements specified by 3GPP TS 22.261 [3]
subclause 6.19.2.
PLMN selection for 3GPP access does not depend on PLMN selection for non-3GPP
access. If a UE is registered over non-3GPP access, the UE performs PLMN
selection for 3GPP access independently of the PLMN to which the N3IWF
belongs.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether PLMN selection for non-3GPP access depends
on PLMN selection for 3GPP access, e.g. PLMN for 3GPP access can be taken into
account for PLMN selection for non-3GPP access.
PLMNs selected for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access may be the same or
different.
PLMN selection defines a UE-based procedure, whereby candidate PLMNs are
selected, one at a time, for attempted registration. Once the PLMN selection
has been performed, the UE follows the signalling procedures defined for the
selected RAT.
Editor\'s note: It is for further study whether a common PLMN selection
procedure can apply to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
## 5.2 Procedures
### 5.2.1 General
The radio access technology (RAT) identifier associated with each entry in the
\"User controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology\", \"Operator
controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology\" and \"HPLMN selector with
Access Technology\" data files can indicate any combination of the values:
GSM, GSM COMPACT, UTRAN, E-UTRAN, cdma2000^Â®^ 1xRTT, cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD and NG-
RAN access technologies.
NOTE: cdma2000^Â®^ is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications Industry
Association (TIA-USA).
Any signalling procedures after PLMN selection are defined in the
specifications related with the radio access technology of the selected PLMN.
### 5.2.2 Procedures for 3GPP radio access networks
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The same procedures for PLMN selection applicable for the GSM, UTRAN and
E-UTRAN access technologies as described in 3GPP TS 22.011 [2] and 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] also apply for NG-RAN, with the following additions and exceptions:
\- when the UE is informed that an area is forbidden during a registration
procedure or a generic UE configuration update procedure, the UE shall take
the following action depending on the received 5GMM cause value:
1) #12 (tracking area not allowed);
The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE and store the
current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\".
2) #13 (roaming not allowed in this tracking area);
The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, store the current
TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and shall
perform PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [7].
The lists of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" shall be erased
when:
1) the UE is switched off;
2) the UICC containing the USIM is removed; and
3) periodically (with a period in the range 12 to 24 hours).
When the lists are erased, the UE performs cell selection.
One or more tracking areas are removed from the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\" in the UE, as well as the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\" if, after a subsequent
procedure e.g. registration procedure, one or more tracking areas in the lists
are received from the network. If the UE has only one PDU session established
which is for emergency services, the tracking areas shall not be removed from
these lists if one or more tracking areas in the lists are received from the
network.
Each list shall accommodate 40 or more TAIs. When the list is full and a new
entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted.
\- one single list of forbidden PLMNs (\"forbidden PLMNs\" list) is sufficient
for 5GS. The existing \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" and \"forbidden
PLMNs for attach in S101 mode\" lists are not used for 5GS.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how RAT restriction is achieved.
#### 5.2.2.2 PLMN selection in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication
The UE shall perform PLMN selection in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication.
### 5.2.3 Procedures for non-3GPP access networks
Editor\'s note: Currently there are no new requirements available.
### 5.2.4 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN
#### 5.2.4.1 Alternative 1 for steering of UE in VPLMN
##### 5.2.4.1.1 General
The purpose of the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN is to allow the HPLMN
to update the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations at the UE
via NAS signalling. The HPLMN updates the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations e.g. depending on the PLMN where the UE is registered
or when required by HPLMN operator policies.
The VPLMN shall not be able to modify the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations sent by the HPLMN. The UE shall be able to verify that
the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations has not
been modified.
The procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN can be initiated by the network
while the UE is trying to register onto the VPLMN as described in subclause
5.2.4.1.2, or after the UE has registered onto the VPLMN as described in
subclause 5.2.4.1.3.
Editor\'s note: SA3 needs to confirm whether it is feasible to ensure the
VPLMN cannot alter the contents of the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations sent to the UE by the VPLMN.
Editor\'s note: End-to-end security between HPLMN and roaming UEs will be
defined following SA3 recommendations.
##### 5.2.4.1.2 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN during registration
###### 5.2.4.1.2.1 Initiation of the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN
during registration
If the network decides to provide a list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations to the UE it shall include the list as part of the authentication
procedure (see subclause 8.5.1.1.3.2). The AMF shall include the received list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message. The UE shall check the indication included in an AV to determine
whether a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations was provided
by the HPLMN and then perform a security check on the received list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations. If the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations is received and the check is successful,
the UE shall proceed as described in subclause 5.2.4.1.2.2. If the indication
included in an AV indicates a list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations was provided by the HPLMN but no list is received, or if the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is received but the security
check is not successful, the UE shall proceed as described in subclause
5.2.4.1.2.3.
Editor\'s note: Additional information included in the NAS message to enable
the UE to verify the integrity of the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations needs to be specified in SA3.
###### 5.2.4.1.2.2 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN during registration
accepted by the UE
Upon receiving an updated list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations which successfully passes the security check, the UE shall:
\- replace the highest priority entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the ME with the received list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations;
\- delete the PLMNs identified by the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list, if they are present in
this list. This includes any information stored in the USIM and the ME
internal memory; and
\- take the new information into account in subsequent attempts to access a
higher priority PLMN.
If the UE determines that there is an available PLMN which is higher priority
than the PLMN which the UE is currently camped on, then the UE shall respond
with an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message so that the AMF releases the current N1
NAS signalling connection and aborts the ongoing registration procedure. The
UE shall then attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts
(see 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]) has expired.
###### 5.2.4.1.2.3 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN not accepted by the
UE during registration
The UE shall discard the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations and attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] by acting as if timer T that controls periodic
attempts (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]) has expired, with an exception that the
current PLMN is considered as lowest priority.
##### 5.2.4.1.3 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN after registration
###### 5.2.4.1.3.1 Initiation of the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN
after registration
The network intiates the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN after
registration using the NAS transport procedure specified in subclause
8.5.1.3.3, with the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message set
to the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations.
Editor\'s note: The encoding of the list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message is FFS.
Editor\'s note: How the need for the UE to send an acknowledgement for the
list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is conveyed to the UE is
FFS.
Editor\'s note: Additional information included in the NAS message to enable
the UE to verify that the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations has not been modified needs to be specified in SA3.
###### 5.2.4.1.3.2 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN after registration
accepted by the UE
Upon receiving an updated list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations, the UE shall verify that the received list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations has not been modified by performing a
security check. If the security check passes, the UE shall:
\- if the UE needs to send an acknowledgement upon receipt of the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the UE shall initiate the NAS
transport procedure specified in subclause 8.5.1.3.3, with the Payload
container type IE of the UL NAS TRANSPORT message indicating that the Payload
container IE contains an acknowledgment for a list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations;
Editor\'s note: The encoding of the acknowledgement for the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Additional information included in the NAS message to enable
the network to verify that the acknowledgement for the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations has not been modified and what kind of
security check the network performs need to be specified in SA3.
\- replace the highest priority entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE with the received list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations;
\- delete the PLMNs identified by the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list, if they are present in
this list. This includes any information stored in the USIM and the ME
internal memory;
\- take the new information into account in subsequent attempts to access a
higher priority PLMN; and
\- attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts (see 3GPP
TS 23.122 [7]) has expired.
###### 5.2.4.1.3.3 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN after registration
not accepted by the UE
If the security check of the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations fails at the UE, the UE shall perform the following steps in the
order in which they are listed:
\- if the UE needs to send an acknowledgement upon receipt of the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the UE shall initiate the NAS
transport procedure specified in subclause 8.5.1.3.3, with the Payload
container type IE of the UL NAS TRANSPORT message indicating that the Payload
container IE contains an acknowledgment for a list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations;
Editor\'s note: The encoding of the acknowledgement for the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Additional information included in the NAS message to enable
the network to verify that the acknowledgement for the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations has not been modified and what kind of
security check the network performs need to be specified in SA3.
\- discard the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations;
and
\- attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts (see 3GPP
TS 23.122 [7]) has expired, with an exception that the current PLMN is
considered as lowest priority. If the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, the UE may locally release the
established N1 NAS signalling connection so as not to delay PLMN selection.
##### 5.2.4.1.4 Completion of the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN at the
network
After initiating the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN, the network may
determine whether the UE has received the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations by:
\- checking whether the UE has attempted registration on the highest priority
VPLMN in the list available in the UE's location within a timer set to an
implementatation specific value; or
\- if the network has requested the UE to send an acknowledgement for the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, checking whether an
acknowledgement from the UE is received within a timer set to an
implementation specific value.
##### 5.2.4.1.5 Stage-2 flow
###### 5.2.4.1.5.1 Stage-2 flow for steering of UE in VPLMN during
registration.
The stage-2 flow for the case when the UE registers with VPLMN AMF is
described below in figure 5.2.4.1.5.1.1:
Figure 5.2.4.1.5.1.1: Procedure for providing list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations
1) The UE to the VPLMN AMF: The UE initiates registration by sending
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the VPLMN AMF, and the VPLMN AMF initiates the
authentication procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24];
2) The VPLMN AMF to the HPLMN AUSF: The VPLMN AMF sends Authentication
Initiation Request (5G-AIR) message to HPLMN AUSF;
3) The HPLMN AUSF to the HPLMN UDM: The HPLMN AUSF sends Auth Info-Req request
message to the HPLMN UDM;
4) The HPLMN UDM decides to provide the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations to the UE,based on operator policy, and then set an
indication in an AV to indicate the UE that the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations are provided;
5) The HPLMN UDM to the HPLMN AUSF: The HPLMN UDM sends the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations in Auth Info-Resp message along with other
existing parameters;
6) The HPLMN AUSF to the VPLMN AMF: The HPLMN AUSF sends the 5G Authentication
Initiation Answer (5G-AIA) message to the VPLMN AMF, which includes the
protected list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and the AV(s);
7) The VPLMN AMF to the UE: The VPLMN AMF transparently sends the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and the AV(s) to the UE in the
NAS AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message; and
8) If the UE has successfully authenticated the network(see 3GPP TS 33.501
[24]), after receiving the NAS AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message:
a) The UE checks the indication included in an AV to determine whether a list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations was provided by the HPLMN and
then performs security check on the received preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations; and
b) If the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is received
and the check is successful in step 8a, then the UE proceeds as described in
subclause 5.2.4.1.2.2. If the UE determines that there is a higher priority
PLMN than currently camped chosen VPLMN, then the UE shall respond with
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indicating VPLMN AMF to release the current N1
NAS signalling connection and abort the ongoing registration procedure before
performing PLMN selection.If the current chosen PLMN is the highest priority
PLMN, the UE shall respond with AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message and may
include a protected acknowledgement IE, if HPLMN requested it. If the
indication included in an AV indicates a list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations was provided by the HPLMN but no list is received; or
if the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is received but
the security check is not successful in step 8a then the UE shall respond with
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message and proceeds as described in subclause
5.2.4.1.2.3.
NOTE 1: The mechanism in which UE determines there is a higher priority PLMN
than currently campend VPLMN in step 8b is UE implementation issue.
NOTE 2: The above procedure shows incremental changes required in
authentication procedure(for both EAP-AKA\' and 5G AKA) as defined in 3GPP TS
33.501 [24], for sending list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations
to the UE.
NOTE 3: The HPLMN UDM decides to provide the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations to the UE,based on operator policy, it is preferred to
use it only for first registration in VPLMN otherwise VPLMN may avoid periodic
re-authentication of the UE for commercial reasons.
Editor\'s note: End-to-end security between HPLMN and roaming UEs will be
defined following SA3 recommendations.
Editor\'s note: CT1 will change above procedure to service based interface
once SA3 adopts it in their specifications.
###### 5.2.4.1.5.2 Stage-2 flow for steering of UE in VPLMN after registration
The stage-2 flow for the steering of UE in VPLMN after registration is
indicated in figure 5.2.4.1.5.2.1.
Figure 5.2.4.1.5.2.1: Procedure for providing list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations after registration
1\. The UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to
the affected AMF by the means of invoking
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification service operation. The
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification service operation contains
the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations that needs to be
delivery transparently to the UE over NAS. If the HPLMN decided that the UE is
to acknowledge successful security check of the received list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification service operation also
contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement from the UE.
2\. The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the transparent container
received from the UDM. If the UE verifies that the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations included in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message
is provided by HPLMN, the UE stores the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations.
Editor\'s note: How the need for the UE to provide an acknowledgment is
encoded in the DL NAS TRANSPORT is FFS.
3\. The UE to the AMF: if the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE
in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message and the UE verified that the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations has been provided by HPLMN, the UE sends
an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with a transparent container
including the UE acknowledgement.
4\. The AMF to the UDM: the AMF sends an N8 message. If a transparent
container with a UE acknowledgement was received in the UL NAS TRANSPORT
message, the AMF includes the transparent container in the N8 message. If the
HPLMN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations in step 1, the
UDM verifies that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE.
Editor\'s note: Further messages and further entities might be involved in
order to secure the solution.
Editor\'s note: FFS whether the N8 message is the
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification response or other N8 message.
##### 5.2.4.1.6 Stage-3 encoding of the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations
Editor's note: It is ffs whether one possibility to encode the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is the secured packet mechanism
as specified in 3GPP TS 31.111 [37], 3GPP TS 31.115 [38], and 3GPP TS31.116
[39].
Editor's note: Other encoding mechanisms are ffs
#### 5.2.4.2 Alternative 2 for steering of UE in VPLMN
##### 5.2.4.2.1 General
The purpose of the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN is to allow the HPLMN
to update the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations at the UE
via NAS signalling. The HPLMN updates the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations e.g. depending on the PLMN where the UE is registered
or when required by HPLMN operator policies. The HPLMN may request the UE to
acknowledge successful integrity verification of the received list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations.
The VPLMN shall not be able to modify the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations sent by the HPLMN.
The ME of the UE shall be able to verify the integrity of the received list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations. If the HPLMN requests the UE to
acknowledge successful integrity verification of the received list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the ME of the UE shall send a
steering acknowledgement to the HPLMN.
The HPLMN shall be able to verify the integrity of the received steering
acknowledgement from the UE.
Editor\'s note: SA3 needs to confirm whether it is feasible to ensure the
VPLMN cannot alter the contents of the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations sent to the UE by the VPLMN and the steering
acknowledgement sent to the HPLMN by the UE via the VPLMN.
Editor\'s note: End-to-end security between HPLMN and roaming UEs will be
defined following SA3 recommendations.
Editor\'s note: Whether the UE needs to maintain a per PLMN counter to track
the number of times the integrity check of the received information has failed
is FFS.
##### 5.2.4.2.2 Initiation of the procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN
In order to provide the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations
to the UE, the AMF shall perform the generic UE configuration update procedure
as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3. The AMF shall include the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message. The AMF shall require a confirmation response in order to ensure that
the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations has been updated by
the UE.
Editor\'s note: Additional information included in the NAS message to enable
the UE to verify the integrity of the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations needs to be specified in SA3.
##### 5.2.4.2.3 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN accepted by the UE
Upon receiving a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with an updated list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the ME of the UE shall verify
the integrity of the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations.
If the integrity check of the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations passes, the UE shall:
\- if the HPLMN requests the UE to acknowledge successful integrity
verification of the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations, the UE shall send a steering acknowledgement to the AMF;
\- replace the highest priority entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the ME with the received list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations;
\- delete the PLMNs identified by the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list, if they are present in
this list. This includes any information stored in the USIM and the ME
internal memory;
\- take the new information into account in subsequent attempts to access a
higher priority PLMN; and
\- attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts (see 3GPP
TS 23.122 [7]) has expired.
##### 5.2.4.2.4 Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN not accepted by the UE
If the integrity check of the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations fails, the UE shall discard the received list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] by acting as if
timer T that controls periodic attempts (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]) has expired,
with an exception that the current PLMN is considered as lowest priority PLMN.
##### 5.2.4.2.5 Stage-2 flow
The stage-2 flow for the procedure is indicated in figure 5.2.4.2.5.
Figure 5.2.4.2.5: Procedure for providing list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations
1\. The UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to
the affected AMF by the means of invoking
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification service operation. The
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification service operation contains
the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations. If the HPLMN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful integrity verification of the
received list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification service operation also
contains the steering acknowledgement requested indication.
2\. The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a UE configuration update command to the
served UE. The AMF includes in the UE configuration update command a UE
configuration update cause indicating that the UE is to acknowledge the UE
configuration update command. The UE configuration update command contains the
list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and, if received from
UDM, the steering acknowledgement requested indication. If the ME of the UE
verifies that the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations
included in the UE configuration update command is provided by HPLMN, the UE
stores the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations.
3\. The UE to the AMF: the UE sends a UE configuration update command ack to
the serving AMF. If the steering acknowledge requested indication was included
in the UE configuration update command and the UE verified that the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations had been provided by HPLMN, the
UE includes the steering acknowledgement in the UE configuration update
command ack.
4\. The AMF to the UDM: the AMF sends a N12 message. If the steering
acknowledgement was received in the UE configuration update command ack, the
AMF includes the steering acknowledgement in the N12 message. If the HPLMN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful integrity verification of the
received list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations in step 1, the
UDM verifies that the steering acknowledgement is provided by the ME of the
UE.
Editor\'s note: Further messages and further entities might be involved in
order to secure the solution.
Editor\'s note: FFS whether the N12 message is the
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement_UpdateNotification response or other N12
message.

# 6 Stage 3 protocol, general aspects
## 6.1 General
This subclause defines the principal architecture of the 5GS NAS layer 3
protocol and its sublayers, including the message format applied by layer 3.
The layer 3 for 5GS services is composed of three sublayers comprising:
\- the 5GS radio resource management (5GRR) functions for NAS over 3GPP
access;
\- the non-3GPP access functions for NAS over non-3GPP access;
\- the 5GS mobility management (5GMM) functions; and
\- the 5GS connection management (5GCM) functions.
The 5GS mobility management (5GMM) sublayer is composed of a functional block
for:
\- the 5GS mobility management (5GMM) functions.
The 5GS connection management (5GCM) sublayer is composed of a functional
block for:
\- the 5GS session management (5GSM) functions.
NOTE: For NAS over non-3GPP access, the non-3GPP access functions can be
supported through functionalities defined in IETF RFC 7296 [36].
## 6.2 Protocols and peer to peer communication
In the model used in the present document, there are:
1) for 5GS services:
\- one 5GRR entity in the MS and one 5GRR entity in the network for NAS over
3GPP access;
\- one non-3GPP access management entity in the MS and one non-3GPP access
interworking entity in the N3IWF for the NAS over non-3GPP access;
\- one 5GMM entity in the MS and one 5GMM entity in the network;
\- for each functional block of the 5GCM sublayer as defined in subclause 6.1
which is supported in the MS (in the network), there are, depending on the
protocol, one or more entities in the MS (in the network). Two different
entities of the same functional block in the MS (in the network) are called
parallel entities. The entities of the same functional block in the MS
correspond in a one-to-one relation to the entities of the functional block in
the network. The corresponding entities are called peer entities.
## 6.3 Basic groups of functions
Most functions of layer 3 and its sub-layers are described by the service
specifications and protocol specifications of the (sub-)layers.
These functions are in the model realized by protocol control entities, see
subclause 6.2.
In addition, routing functions are contained in layer 3 which are related to
the transport of messages, e.g. multiplexing and splitting. These routing
functions are defined in the 5GRR (for NAS over 3GPP access) or non-3GPP
access management (for NAS over non-3GPP access) and 5GMM sub-layers.
1) They have the task to pass the messages from upper (sub-)layers to lower
(sub-)layers.
2) They also have the task to pass messages provided by lower (sub-)layers to
the appropriate (sub-)layer and, if applicable, entity.
The routing functions with task 2 make use of the extended protocol
discriminator (EPD) which is part of the message header, or PDU session
identity.
A 5GCM sublayer protocol may also define a procedure transaction identity
(PTI) as a part of the message header. This is at least the case if there are
parallel entities of the same functional block, see subclause 6.2.
\- The 5GMM-sublayer routing function passes the messages of the 5GCM entities
as well as of the 5GMM entities of its own sublayer to the service access
point of 5GRR. Furthermore, it multiplexes them in case of parallel
transactions.
\- For NAS over 3GPP access, the new radio access stratum (NRAS) sublayer
routing function distributes the messages to be sent according to their
message type and protocol discriminator (PD), to the actual channel
configuration, and, if applicable, to further information received from upper
sub-layers to the appropriate service access point of layer 2. Paging messages
received from the PCH are always routed to 5GMM.
\- For NAS over 3GPP access, the messages provided at the different service
access points of layer 2 are distributed by the 5GRR sublayer routing function
according to their protocol discriminator (PD). Messages with a PD equal to RR
are passed to the 5GRR entity of the own sublayer, all other messages are
passed to the 5GMM sublayer at the service access point RR-SAP.
\- For NAS over non-3GPP access:
\- for initial registration, EAP-5G is used to transfer NAS messages between
the peer entities of the 5GMM sublayers;
\- after successful initial registration, IPSec transport mode and GRE will be
used to encapsulate and un-encapsulate the NAS messages between the peer
entities of the 5GMM sublayers.
\- For 5GS services, the routing function of 5GS NAS passes standard L3
messages according to the protocol discriminator (PD) and, if applicable, the
PDU session identity towards the 5GMM entity or towards the 5GSM entities of
the various 5GS NAS SAP\'s.
The message (message header or other parts of the message) are neither changed
nor removed by the RR routing function or non-3GPP access management or 5GMM
routing function before passing it to the appropriate service access point.
## 6.4 Protocol architecture
The protocol architecture is visualized for each of the 5GS model:
\- Figure 6.4.1 shows the protocol architecture for a MS supporting 5GS
services over 3GPP access.
\- Figure 6.4.2 shows the protocol architecture for a MS supporting 5GS
services over non-3GPP access.
Figure 6.4.1: Protocol architecture of Non Access Stratum supporting MSs,
MSâ€‘side (over 3GPP access)
Figure 6.4.2: Protocol architecture of Non Access Stratum supporting MSs,
MSâ€‘side (over non-3GPP access)
Figure 6.4.1 defines three sublayers for 5GS services:
\- the NRAS sublayer provides services to the 5GMM sublayer;
\- the 5GMM sublayer provides services to the entities of the 5GCM sublayer.
The 5GMM sublayer further includes one 5GMM entity;
\- the 5GCM sublayer includes 5GSM entities;
\- the 5GSM entity provides services to the QoS flow control (QFC) entity and
uses services of the 5GMM sublayer;
\- the QFC entity hides the concepts of radio resources that can be
established/released while an 5GS context is active. If uplink data in the
terminal is to be sent, and 5GS radio resources have been released, the QFC
will trigger a service request procedure in 5GMM.
Figure 6.4.2 defines three sublayers for 5GS services:
\- the Non-3GPP access stratum sublayer provides services to the 5GMM
sublayer;
\- the 5GMM sublayer provides services to the entities of the 5GCM sublayer.
The 5GMM sublayer further includes one 5GMM entity;
\- the 5GCM sublayer includes 5GSM entities;
\- the 5GSM entity provides services to the QoS flow control (QFC) entity and
uses services of the 5GMM sublayer;
\- the QFC entity hides the concepts of non-3GPP access resources that can be
established/released while a 5GS context is active. Whenever such resources
are available, IPSec security associations will be established and maintained.
## 6.5 Standard L3 messages
Editor\'s note: 5GS NAS message IE applicability, 5GS NAS message standard L3
header, 5GS Protocol discriminator values, Possible new 5GS identities for
routing and 5GS message type should be captured in this subclause.
## 6.6 General message format and information elements coding
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
### 6.6.1 Overview
Within the protocols defined in the present document, every 5GS NAS message is
a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [11]. This means that the
message consists of the following parts:
Editor\'s note: The required updates on a standard L3 message definition in
3GPP TS 24.007 [11] are FFS.
1) if the message is a plain 5GS NAS message:
a) extended protocol discriminator;
b) security header type or PDU session identity;
c) procedure transaction identity;
d) message type;
e) other information elements, as required.
2) if the message is a security protected 5GS NAS message:
Editor\'s note: The message parts of a security protected 5GS NAS message are
FFS.
The organization of a plain 5GS NAS message is illustrated in the example
shown in figure 6.6.1.

Figure 6.6.1.1: General message organization example for a plain 5GS NAS
message
Editor\'s note: The organization of a security protected 5GS NAS message is
FFS.
Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of clause 8 and clause
9, a particular information element shall not be present more than once in a
given message.
When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values
progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least significant
bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest
numbered octet of the field.
#### 6.6.2 Extended protocol discriminator
Bits 1 to 8 of the first octet of every 5GS NAS message contain the Extended
protocol discriminator (EPD) IE. The EPD and its use are defined in 3GPP TS
24.007 [11]. Bits 1 to 4 of the EPD in the header of a plain 5GMM message is
encoded as \"1110\".
Editor\'s note: The definition of the extended protocol discriminator in 3GPP
TS 24.007 [11] is FFS.
#### 6.6.3 Security header type
Bits 1 to 4 of the second octet of every 5GMM message contain the Security
header type IE. This IE includes control information related to the security
protection of a 5GMM message. The total size of the Security header type IE is
4 bits.
Editor\'s note: The values of the Security header type are FFS.
#### 6.6.4 PDU session identity
Bits 1 to 8 of the second octet of every 5GSM message contain the PDU session
identity IE. The PDU session identity and its use to identify a message flow
are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [11]. See Annex E.
#### 6.6.5 Spare half octet
Bits 5 to 8 of the second octet of every 5GMM message contains the spare half
octet which is filled with spare bits set to zero.
#### 6.6.6 Procedure transaction identity
Bits 1 to 8 of the third octet of every 5GSM message contain the procedure
transaction identity. The procedure transaction identity and its use are
defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [11].
#### 6.6.7 Message type
The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [11].
Editor\'s note: The values of message type for 5GS NAS messages are FFS.
## 6.7 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
### 6.7.1 General
The procedures specified in the present document apply to those messages which
pass the checks described in this subclause.
This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These
procedures are called \"error handling procedures\", but in addition to
providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility
mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.
Subclauses 6.7.1 to 6.7.7 shall be applied in order of precedence.
Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent
and may vary from PLMN to PLMN. However, when extensions of this protocol are
developed, networks will be assumed to have the error handling that is
indicated in this subclause as mandatory (\"shall\") and that is indicated as
strongly recommended (\"should\").
Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or
strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not reached during
a dedicated connection.
For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 [11],
subclause 11.4.2.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to add more details and further alignment to align
with 3GPP TS 24.301.
### 6.7.2 Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message
type information element, that message shall be ignored, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007
[11].
### 6.7.3 Unknown or unforeseen procedure transaction identity or PDU Session
identity
#### 6.7.3.1 Procedure transaction identity
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to add the content.
#### 6.7.3.2 PDU Session identity
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to add the content.
### 6.7.4 Unknown or unforeseen message type
If UE receives an 5GMM message or 5GSM message with message type not defined
for the extended protocol discriminator (EPD) or not implemented by the
receiver, it shall return a status message (5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS
depending on the EPD) with cause #97 \"message type non-existent or not
implemented\".
If the network receives an 5GMM or 5GSM message with message type not defined
for the EPD or not implemented by the receiver in a protocol state where
reception of an unsolicited message with the given EPD from the UE is not
foreseen in the protocol, the network actions are implementation dependent.
Otherwise, if the network receives a message with message type not defined for
the EPD or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the message except
that it should return a status message (5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending
on the EPD) with cause #97 \"message type non-existent or not implemented\".
NOTE: A message type not defined for the EPD in the given direction is
regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for the EPD, see 3GPP
TS 24.007 [11].
If the UE receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the UE
shall return a status message (5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the
EPD) with cause #98 \"message type not compatible with protocol state\".
If the network receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the
network actions are implementation dependent.
### 6.7.5 Non-semantical mandatory information element errors
#### 6.7.5.1 Common procedures
When on receipt of a message,
\- an \"imperative message part\" error; or
\- a \"missing mandatory IE\" error
is diagnosed or when a message containing:
\- a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE;
\- an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as \"comprehension required\"
(see 3GPP TS 24.007 [11]); or
\- an out of sequence IE encoded as \"comprehension required\" (see 3GPP TS
24.007 [11]) is received,
the UE shall proceed as follows:
If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 6.7.5.3, item
TBD, the UE shall return a status message (5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS
depending on the EPD) with cause #96 \"invalid mandatory information\"; and
Editor\'s note: Specific cases when the above is not applicable are FFS.
the network shall proceed as follows:
If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 6.7.5.3, item
TBD, the network shall either:
\- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or
\- ignore the message except that it should return a status message (5GMM
STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD) with cause #96 \"invalid mandatory
information\".
Editor\'s note: Specific cases when the above is not applicable are FFS.
#### 6.7.5.2 5GS mobility management
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to add the content.
#### 6.7.5.3 5GS session management
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to add the content.
### 6.7.6 Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part
#### 6.7.6.1 IEIs unknown in the message
The UE shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as
\"comprehension required\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [11]).
The network shall take the same approach.
#### 6.7.6.2 Out of sequence IEs
The UE shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded
as \"comprehension required\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [11]).
The network should take the same approach.
#### 6.7.6.3 Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T, TV, TLV, or TLV-E is repeated in a
message in which repetition of the information element is not specified in
clause 8 and clause 9 of the present document, the UE shall handle only the
contents of the information element appearing first and shall ignore all
subsequent repetitions of the information element. When repetition of
information elements is specified, the UE shall handle only the contents of
specified repeated information elements. If the limit on repetition of
information elements is exceeded, the UE shall handle the contents of
information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions and shall
ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element.
The network should follow the same procedures.
### 6.7.7 Non-imperative message part errors
This category includes:
\- syntactically incorrect optional IEs; and
\- conditional IE errors.
#### 6.7.7.1 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a
message as not present in the message.
The network shall take the same approach.
#### 6.7.7.2 Conditional IE errors
When upon receipt of a 5GMM or 5GSM message the UE diagnoses a \"missing
conditional IE\" error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error, or when it
receives a 5GMM or 5GSM message containing at least one syntactically
incorrect conditional IE, the UE shall ignore the message and shall return a
status message (5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD) with cause
#100 \"conditional IE error\".
When the network receives a message and diagnoses a \"missing conditional IE\"
error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when it receives a message
containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the network
shall either:
\- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or
\- ignore the message except that it should return a status message (5GMM
STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD) with cause #100 \"conditional IE
error\".
### 6.7.8 Messages with semantically incorrect contents
When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the UE shall
perform the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of the present document
(i.e. of clauses 8, 9). If, however no such reactions are specified, the UE
shall ignore the message except that it shall return a status message (5GMM
STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD) with cause #95 \"semantically
incorrect message\".
The network should follow the same procedure except that a status message is
not normally transmitted.
# 7 Coordination between the protocols for 5GS mobility management and 5GS
session management
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
A 5GS session management (5GSM) message is piggybacked in specific 5GS
mobility management (5GMM) transport messages. To this purpose, the 5GSM
messages can be transmitted in an information element in the 5GMM transport
messages. In this case, the UE, the AMF and the SMF execute the 5GMM procedure
and the 5GSM procedure in parallel. The success of the 5GMM procedure is not
dependent on the success of the piggybacked 5GSM procedure.
The UE can only initiate the 5GSM procedure when there is a 5GMM context
established at the UE and the AMF can only forward the 5GSM message for the
5GSM procedure initiated by the SMF when there is a 5GMM context established
at the AMF.
Except for the 5GMM procedures piggybacking 5GSM messages, during 5GMM
procedures the UE and the AMF shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages.
Editor\'s note: Which type of procedure will be included as 5GMM procedure is
FFS.
# 8 5GS mobility management
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
## 8.1 Overview
### 8.1.1 General
The main function of the 5GS mobility management (5GMM) sublayer is to support
the identification, security, mobility of a UE as well as generic message
transport.
A further function of the 5GMM sublayer is to provide connection management
services to the other sublayer(s).
Editor\'s note: Sublayer design can be revisited after the protocol framework
is identified.
### 8.1.2 Domain selection
#### 8.1.2.1 UE's usage setting
The UE's usage setting defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [15] applies to voice capable
UEs in 5GS and indicates whether the UE has preference for voice services over
data services or vice-versa, where:
\- voice services include IMS voice; and
\- data services include any kind of user data transfer without a voice media
component.
The UE's usage setting can be set to:
\- \"voice centric\"; or
\- \"data centric\".
If the UE is capable of S1 mode, there is a single UE's usage setting at the
UE which applies to both 5GS and EPS.
Editor\'s note: The definition of the UE's usage setting in TS 24.301 needs to
be updated to be applicable to 5GS.
#### 8.1.2.2 Domain selection for UE originating sessions / calls
The behaviour of the UE for domain selection is determined by:
\- the UE usage setting;
\- the availability of IMS voice; and
\- whether the UE operates in single-registration mode or dual-registration
mode (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]).
In the present document, \"IMS voice not available\" refers to one of the
following conditions:
a) the UE does not support IMS voice;
b) the UE supports IMS voice, but the network indicates in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are not supported; or
c) the UE supports IMS voice, the network indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message that IMS voice over PS sessions are supported, but the upper layers:
\- provide no indication that the UE is available for voice call in the IMS
within a manufacturer determined period of time; or
\- indicate that the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.
NOTE: If conditions a and b evaluate to false, the upper layers need time to
attempt IMS registration. In the event an indication from the upper layers
that the UE is available for voice calls in the IMS takes longer than the
manufacturer determined period of time (e.g. due to delay when attempting IMS
registration or due to delay in obtaining a QoS flow for SIP signalling), the
NAS layer assumes the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.
Other conditions may exist but these are implementation specific.
In the present document, \"IMS voice available\" applies when \"IMS voice not
available\" does not apply.
When IMS voice is not available, if the UE's usage setting is \"voice
centric\" and the UE operates in single-registration mode, the UE shall
disable the N1 mode radio capabilities (see subclause 8.2.6), and attempt to
select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If such a cell is found, the UE shall
then perform voice domain selection procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301
[15].
When IMS voice is not available, if the UE's usage setting is \"voice
centric\" for 5GS and the UE operates in dual-registration mode, the UE may
disable the N1 mode radio capabilities (see subclause 8.2.6), and attempt to
select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If such a cell is found, the UE shall
then perform voice domain selection procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301
[15].
#### 8.1.2.3 Change of UE's usage setting
Whenever the UE\'s usage setting changes, the UE shall execute procedures
according to table 8.1.2.3.1 and table 8.1.2.3.2:
a) The UE is in single registration mode
Table 8.1.2.3.1: Change of UE\'s usage setting for a UE in single registration
mode

mode radio capabilities (see subclause 8.2.6)
* * *
#### 8.1.2.4 Change or determination of IMS voice availability
Whenever the IMS voice availability is determined or changes, the UE shall
execute procedures according to table 8.1.2.4.1 and table 8.1.2.4.2:
a) The UE is in single registration mode
Table 8.1.2.4.1: Change of IMS voice availability for a UE in single
registration mode

capabilities (see subclause 8.2.6)
* * *
### 8.1.3 Types of 5GMM procedures
Depending on how they can be initiated, three types of 5GMM procedures can be
distinguished:
1) 5GMM common procedures
5GMM common procedure can always be initiated when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode. The procedures belonging to this type are:
Initiated by the network:
\- network-initiated NAS transport.
\- primary authentication and key agreement procedure
\- security mode control;
\- generic UE configuration update
\- identification
Initiated by the UE:
\- UE-initiated NAS transport.
Initiated by the UE or the network and used to report certain error conditions
detected upon receipt of 5GMM protocol data:
\- 5GMM status.
2) 5GMM specific procedures:
At any time only one UE initiated 5GMM specific procedure can be running for
each of the access network(s) that the UE is camping in. The procedures
belonging to this type are:
Initiated by the UE and used e.g. to register to the network for 5GS services
and establish a 5GMM context, to update the location/parameter(s) of the UE:
\- registration.
Initiated by the UE or the network and used to deregister from the network for
5GS services and to release a 5GMM context:
\- de-registration.
3) 5GMM connection management procedures:
Initiated by the UE and used to establish a secure connection to the network
or to request the resource reservation for sending data, or both:
\- service request.
The service request procedure can only be initiated if no UE initiated 5GMM
specific procedure is ongoing for each of the access network(s) that the UE is
camping in.
Initiated by the network and used to request the establishment of an N1 NAS
signalling connection or to prompt the UE to perform re-registration if
necessary as a result of a network failure; not applicable for the non-3GPP
access network:
\- paging.
Initiated by the network and used to request re-activation the PDU session(s)
associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access when the UE is in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over either 3GPP access or non 3GPP access:
\- notification.
NOTE: The network can page the UE over 3GPP access for the re-activation of
the PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access.
### 8.1.4 5GMM sublayer states
#### 8.1.4.1 General
In the following subclauses, the 5GS mobility management (5GMM) sublayer of
the UE and the network is described by means of different state machines. The
5GMM sublayer states is managed per access type independently, i.e. 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access. In subclause 8.1.4.2, the states of the 5GMM
sublayer are introduced.
#### 8.1.4.2 5GMM sublayer states
##### 8.1.4.2.1 General
In the following subclauses, the possible 5GMM sublayer states are described.
In subclause 8.1.4.2.2, the states of the 5GMM sublayer in the UE are
introduced. The behaviour of the UE depends on a 5GS update status that is
described in subclause 8.1.4.2.3. The states for the network side are
described in subclause 8.1.4.2.4.
##### 8.1.4.2.2 5GMM sublayer states in the UE
###### 8.1.4.2.2.1 General
In the following subclauses, the possible 5GMM sublayer states of the UE are
described and shown in Figure 8.1.4.2.2.1.1.
NOTE: Not all possible transitions are shown in this figure.
Editor\'s note: The fatal causes and non-fatal causes used in the 5GMM
procedures are FFS.

corresponding file is present in the USIM, else in the non-volatile memory in
the ME.
The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a
registration, network-initiated de-registration, 5GS based primary
authentication and key agreement, service request or paging procedure.
5U1: UPDATED
The last registration attempt was successful.
5U2: NOT UPDATED
The last registration attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response or reject
message was received from the AMF.
5U3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED
The last registration, service request, or registration for mobility or

### 8.1.5 Permanent identifiers
A globally unique permanent identity, the 5G subscription permanent identifier
(SUPI), is allocated to each subscriber for 5GS-based services. In the current
release, the IMSI and the network access identifier (NAI) are valid SUPI
types. Though non-IMSI based SUPIs are possible by using NAI, the IMSI can be
contained within the NAI for the SUPI. The structure of the SUPI and its
derivatives will be specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
A UE supporting NG-RAN includes a SUPI when a valid 5G-GUTI is not available
from the PLMN or equivalent PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register or
if requested by the network, during the registration and generic UE
configuration update procedures.
Each UE supporting NG-RAN contains a permanent equipment identifier (PEI) for
accessing 5GS-based services. In the current release, the IMEI and the IMEISV
are the only PEI format supported by 5GS.The structure of the PEI and its
formats will be specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
A UE supporting NG-RAN includes a PEI:
\- when neither SUPI nor valid 5G-GUTI is available to use for emergency
services in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set
to \"emergency registration\"; and
\- when the network requests the PEI by using the identification procedure, in
the IDENTIFICATION RESPONSE message.
The AMF can request the PEI at any time by using the identification procedure.
### 8.1.6 Temporary identities
A globally unique temporary user identity for 5GS-based services, the 5G
globally unique temporary identity (5G-GUTI), is used for identification
within the signalling procedures. The 5G-GUTI is common to both 3GPP and
non-3GPP access. In the paging and service request procedures, a shortened
form of the 5G-GUTI, the 5G S-temporary mobile subscriber identity (5G-S-
TMSI), is used to enable more efficient radio signalling. The purpose of the
5G-GUTI and 5G-S-TMSI is to provide identity confidentiality, i.e., to protect
a user from being identified and located by an intruder. The structure of the
5G-GUTI and its derivatives is specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. The 5G-GUTI
has two main components:
\- the globally unique AMF id (GUAMI) that uniquely identifies the AMF that
allocated the 5G-GUTI, and
\- the 5G-TMSI that provides for an unambiguous identity of the UE within this
AMF.
The 5G-S-TMSI has three main components:
\- the AMF set ID that uniquely identifies the AMF set within the AMF region;
\- the AMF pointer that uniquely identifies the AMF within the AMF set; and
\- the 5G-TMSI.
A UE supporting N1 mode includes a valid 5G-GUTI, if any is available, in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST and DEREGISTRATION REQUEST messages. In the SERVICE
REQUEST message, the UE includes a valid 5G-S-TMSI as user identity. The AMF
may assign a new 5G-GUTI for a particular UE at successful registration and
generic UE configuration update procedures.
If a new 5G-GUTI is assigned by the AMF, the UE and the AMF handle the 5G-GUTI
as follows:
\- Upon receipt of a 5GMM message containing a new 5G-GUTI the UE considers
the new 5G-GUTI as valid and the old 5G-GUTI as invalid.
\- The AMF considers the old 5G-GUTI as invalid as soon as an acknowledgement
for a registration or generic UE configuration update procedure is received.
### 8.1.7 Mobile initiated connection only mode
The UE can request the use of mobile initiated connection only (MICO) mode
during the registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] and 3GPP TS
23.502[10]).
If the UE requests the use of MICO, the network can accept the use of MICO
mode by providing a MICO indication when accepting the registration procedure.
The UE may use MICO mode only if the network has provided the MICO indication
IE during the last registration procedure.
If the network accepts the use of MICO mode, the UE may deactivate the AS
layer and activate MICO mode by entering the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-
AVAILABLE if:
a) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode; and
b) in the 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state.
When MICO mode is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated
procedures aborted except for periodic registration update timer, any backoff
timers, and the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or
higher prioritized PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]).
The UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at any time. Upon
deactivating MICO mode, the UE may initiate 5GMM procedures (e.g. for the
transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data).
If the AMF accepts the use of MICO mode, the AMF starts the implicit de-
registration timer when entering 5GMM-IDLE mode.
### 8.1.8 Handling of the periodic registration update timer and implicit de-
registration timer
The registration procedure is used to periodically notify the availability of
the UE to the network. The procedure is controlled in the UE by the periodic
registration update timer, T3512.
Upon expiry of the implicit de-registration timer the network shall start the
implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is network
dependent. If MICO is activated, the default value of the implicit detach
timer is 4 minutes greater than timer Te. If the implicit detach timer expires
before the UE contacts the network, the network shall implicitly detach the
UE.
If the AMF provides T3346 value IE in the mobility management messages and
T3346 value is greater than timer T3512, the AMF sets the periodic
registration update timer and the implicit detach timer such that the sum of
the timer values is greater than timer T3346 value.
Editor\'s note: Further details on timer handling are FFS (e.g. if T3512
expires while the UE is registered for emergency bearer services).
## 8.2 5GS mobility functions in IDLE and CONNECTED mode
### 8.2.1 Registration areas in the 5GS
#### 8.2.1.1 General
Within the 5GS, the registration area is managed independently per access
type, i.e., 3GPP access or non-3GPP access. The AMF assigns a registration
area to the UE during the registration procedure. A registration area is
defined as a set of tracking areas and each of these tracking areas consists
of one or more cells that cover a geographical area. Tracking areas cannot
overlap each other. Within the 5GS, the concept of \"registration to multiple
tracking areas\" applies:
\- A tracking area is identified by a TAI which is broadcast in the cells of
the tracking area. The TAI is constructed from a TAC and a PLMN identifier. In
case of a shared network, one or more TAC and multiple PLMN identifiers are
broadcast.
\- In order to reduce the tracking area update signalling within the 5GS, the
AMF can assign several tracking areas to the UE. These tracking areas
construct a list of tracking areas which is identified by a TAI list. When
generating the TAI list, the AMF shall include only TAIs that are applicable
on the access where the TAI list is sent. The AMF shall be able to allocate a
TAI List over different NG-RAN access technologies.
\- The UE considers itself registered to a list of tracking areas and does not
need to trigger mobility registration update procedure (i.e. registration
procedure with registration type set to \"mobility registration update\") as
long as the UE stays in one of the tracking areas of the list of tracking
areas received from the AMF.
Editor\'s note: The maximum number of tracking areas which can be allocated
per UE needs to be defined which can be as in EPS or different.
\- The UE will consider the TAI list as valid, until it receives a new TAI
list in the next mobility registration update or periodic registration update
procedure, or the UE is commanded by the network to delete the TAI list by a
reject message or it is detached from the 5GS. If the registration request is
accepted or the TAI list is reallocated by the AMF, the AMF shall provide at
least one entry in the TAI list. If the new and the old TAI list are
identical, the AMF does not need to provide the new TAI list to the UE during
mobility registration update or periodic registration update.
\- The TAI list can be reallocated by the AMF.
\- When the UE is detached from the 5GS, the TAI list in the UE is invalid.
\- The AMF allocates one 5G-GUTI, which is common between 3GPP and non3GPP, to
the UE.
\- The UE includes the last visited registered TAI, if available, to the AMF.
#### 8.2.1.2 Open issues on registration areas in the 5GS
\- CT1 need to study whether the periodic registration update timer for the
periodic registration updating procedure and the periodic tracking area
updating procedure in EPS can have different values, related values, or the
same value.
\- CT1 need to study the impacts on the periodic registration update timer
when the mobile initiated connection only (MICO) mode (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9])
is used.
### 8.2.2 Service area restrictions
The service area restrictions consist of either an allowed area, or a non-
allowed area. The allowed area can be limited by a maximum allowed number of
tracking areas or include all tracking areas in a PLMN. The non-allowed area
can contain up to 16 tracking areas. The network conveys the service area
restrictions to the UE by including either an allowed area, or a non-allowed
area, but not both, in the Service area list IE of a REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
When the UE receives a Service area list IE with an allowed area indication
during a registration procedure or a generic UE configuration update
procedure:
\- if the \"Type of list\" included in the Service area list IE does not
indicate all TAIs belonging to the PLMN are allowed area, the UE shall delete
the old list of \"allowed tracking areas\" and store the tracking areas in the
allowed area as the list of \"allowed tracking areas\". If the UE has a stored
list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\" for the registered PLMN, the UE shall
delete that list; or
\- if the \"Type of list\" included in the Service area list IE indicates all
TAIs belonging to the PLMN are allowed area, the UE shall treat all tracking
areas in the registered PLMN are allowed area and delete the stored list of
\"allowed tracking areas\" or the stored list of \"non-allowed tracking
areas\" for the registered PLMN.
When the UE receives a Service area list IE with a non-allowed area indication
during a registration procedure or a generic UE configuration update
procedure, the UE shall delete the old list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\"
and store the tracking areas in the non-allowed area as the list of \"non-
allowed tracking areas\". If the UE has a stored list of \"allowed tracking
areas\" for the registered PLMN, the UE shall delete that list.
If the UE has a stored list of \"allowed tracking areas\":
\- while camped on a cell whose TAI is in the list of \"allowed tracking
areas\", the UE is allowed to initiate any 5GMM and 5GSM procedures; and
\- while camped on a cell whose TAI is not in the list of \"allowed tracking
areas\":
1) if the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, the UE:
i) shall not perform the mobility and periodic registration update procedure
with uplink data status IE except for emergency services; and
ii) shall not initiate a service request procedure except for emergency
services or for responding to core network paging; and
2) if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication over 3GPP access, the UE:
i) shall not perform the mobility registration update procedure with uplink
data status IE except for emergency services;
ii) shall not initiate a service request procedure except for emergency
services; and
iii) shall not initiate a 5GSM procedure except for emergency services.
If the UE has a stored list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\":
\- while camped on a cell whose TAI is not in the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\", the UE is allowed to initiate any 5GMM and 5GSM procedures;
and
\- while camped on a cell whose TAI is in the list of \"non-allowed tracking
areas\":
1) if the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, the UE:
i) shall not perform the mobility and periodic registration update procedure
with uplink data status IE except for emergency services; and
ii) shall not initiate a service request procedure except for emergency
services or for responding to core network paging; and
2) if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication over 3GPP access, the UE:
i) shall not perform the mobility registration update procedure with uplink
data status IE except for emergency services;
ii) shall not initiate a service request procedure except for emergency
services; and
iii) shall not initiate a 5GSM procedure except for emergency services.
The list of \"allowed tracking areas\", as well as the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\" shall be erased when:
\- the UE is switched off;
\- the UICC containing the USIM is removed; and
\- periodically (with a period in the range 12 to 24 hours).
When the list of \"allowed tracking areas\" or the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\" is erased, the UE performs cell selection procedure.
The UE shall evaluate the information in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\" and in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\" before evaluating the information in the list
of \"allowed tracking areas\" or the list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\".
### 8.2.3 UE NAS mobility functions in 5GMM-IDLE mode
In 5GMM-IDLE mode a UE with a valid USIM enabled will:
\- when not registered to the 5GCN:
\- perform registration procedure with registration type set to \"initial
registration\" in order to receive services that require registration in the
5GS when not registered to the EPS;
\- perform registration procedure with registration type set to \"mobility
registration update\" when registered to the EPS;
\- when registered to the 5GCN:
\- perform registration procedure with registration type set to \"mobility
registration update\" when:
\- entering a tracking area not in the list of assigned tracking areas, in
order to maintain the registration and enable the AMF to keep track of the UE;
or
\- the UE needs to update its capabilities towards the 5GCN; or
\- the UE receives the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND and detects that
registration update procedure is requested;
\- answer to paging from the AMF by performing a service request procedure,
unless the UE is in MICO mode;
\- perform the service request procedure in order to establish a N1 NAS
signalling connection to the network;
\- perform de-registration procedure when the UE is switched off, the USIM is
removed or disabled, or the 5GS capability of the UE is disabled.
In 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, a UE with a valid USIM enabled will:
\- perform cell selection/reselection procedure according to 3GPP TS 38.304
[27] and PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]; and
\- when registered to the 5GCN:
\- perform registration procedure with registration type set to \"periodic
registration update\" to periodically notify the 5GS that the UE is available;
and
\- perform the service request procedure in order to request the establishment
of radio bearers when uplink user data is to be sent.
In 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access a UE without valid USIM enabled will:
\- perform cell selection/reselection according to 3GPP TS 38.304 [27], but
not PLMN selection;
\- perform registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to
\"emergency registration\" if the UE needs to establish a PDU session for
emergency services.
### 8.2.4 UE NAS mobility functions in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
In 5GMM-CONNECTED mode a UE with a valid USIM enabled will:
\- respond to identification requests from the AMF;
\- perform authentication when requested by the AMF;
\- initiate the ciphering and integrity protection for NAS signalling when
requested by the AMF;
\- not perform periodic registration update procedure (i.e. registration
procedure with registration type set to \"periodic registration update\");
\- perform mobility registration update procedure (i.e. registration procedure
with registration type set to \"mobility registration update\") when after
handover the UE detects that it has entered a tracking area not in the
assigned list of tracking areas or when the UE receives the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND and detects that registration update procedure is requested;
and
\- perform de-registration procedure when the UE is switched off, the USIM is
removed or disabled, the 5GS capability of the UE is disabled, or when
requested by the AMF.
In 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access, a UE with a valid USIM enabled will:
\- perform the service request procedure in order to request the establishment
of the radio bearers when uplink user data is to be sent.
Editor\'s note: The case of the UE without a valid USIM registered to the 5GCN
and using emergency services is FFS.
### 8.2.5 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
This subclause is only applicable for UE\'s 5GMM mode over 3GPP access.
The UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication when the UE is
in:
\- 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access at the NAS layer; and
\- RRC_INACTIVE state at the AS layer (see 3GPP TS 38.300 [26]).
Unless stated otherwise, the UE behavior in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication follows the UE behavior in 5GMM-CONNECTED over 3GPP
access, except that:
\- the UE shall apply the mobility restrictions; and
\- the UE shall perform the PLMN selection procedures
as in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access.
The UE shall transition from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access to 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication upon indication from the lower
layers that the UE has transitioned to RRC_INACTIVE state.
The UE shall trigger a transition from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access upon:
\- uplink data transfer; or
\- mobile originaiting signaling.
The UE shall transition from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access upon receving from the lower layers
indication that the UE has transitioned to RRC_CONNECTED state (see 3GPP TS
38.300 [26]).
NOTE: The AMF can be aware of the transition between 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and
5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication for a UE (see 3GPP TS 23.502
[10]).
The UE shall trigger a transition from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication to 5GMM-IDLE mode upon selection of a PLMN that is not an
equivalent PLMN to the registered PLMN.
The UE shall transition from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
to 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access upon receving from the lower layers:
\- indication that the transition from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED
state has failed;
\- indication of transition from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE;
\- AMF paging notification; or
\- indication of cell selection to E-UTRAN.
The UE shall not trigger a transition from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication to 5GMM-IDLE mode upon entering a new PLMN which is in the
list of equivalent PLMNs.
### 8.2.6 Disabling and re-enabling of UE\'s N1 mode radio capabilities
When the UE supporting both N1 mode and S1 mode is disabling the N1 mode radio
capabilities, it should proceed as follows:
a) select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC of the registered PLMN or a PLMN
from the list of equivalent PLMNs; or
b) if an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from
the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the UE does not have a
registered PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122
[7].
Editor\'s note: Instead of performing PLMN selection, whether the UE can
select another RAT of the chosen PLMN is FFS.
Editor\'s note: If no other allowed PLMN for an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC
are available, the UE's behaviour is FFS.
When the UE supporting both N1 mode and S1 mode needs to stay in E-UTRA
connected to EPC, in order to prevent unwanted handover or cell reselection
from E-UTRA connected to EPC to E-UTRA connected to 5GCN or NR connected to
5GCN, the UE shall disable the N1 mode radio capabilities and:
\- the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of
the N1 mode radio capabilities.
NOTE: The UE can only disable the N1 mode radio capabilities when in 5GMM-IDLE
mode.
Editor\'s note: The N1 mode radio capabilities that the UE needs to disable in
order to not reselect to NR or an E-UTRA cell connected to 5GC (i.e. avoid
ping pong) need to be defined by RAN WGs.
Editor\'s note: To prevent unwanted handover from EPC to 5GCN, it is FFS how
the UE indicates the disabling of the N1 mode radio capabilities to the
network.
The UE shall re-enable the N1 mode radio capabilities when:
\- the UE performs PLMN selection; and
\- the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.
Editor\'s note: When the N1 mode radio capabilities was re-enabled due to PLMN
selection, whether the UE needs to memorize the identity of the PLMNs where N1
mode radio capabilities was disabled and use that stored information in
subsequent PLMN selections, is FFS.
If the disabling of N1 mode radio capabilities was due to IMS voice is not
available and the UE's usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE shall re-
enable the N1 mode radio capabilities when the UE's usage setting is changed
from \"voice centric\" to \"data centric\".
Editor\'s note: Whether the UE starts an implementation specific timer for
enabling N1 mode radio capabilities is FFS.
## 8.3 Establishment of the N1 NAS signalling connection
When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access and needs to transmit an
initial NAS message, the UE shall request the lower layer to establish an RRC
connection. Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has
been established, the UE shall consider that the N1 NAS signalling connection
over 3GPP access is established and enter 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP
access.
When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, and the UE receives an
indication from the lower layers of access stratum connection establishment,
the UE shall consider the N1 NAS signalling connection established, enter
5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access and send an initial NAS message.
Initial NAS messages are:
\- REGISTRATION REQUEST;
\- DEREGISTRATION REQUEST; and
\- SERVICE REQUEST.
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode and lower layers provide an
indication that the current E-UTRA cell is connected to both EPC and 5GCN, for
the routing of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message during the initial
registration procedure to the appropriate core network (EPC or 5GCN), the UE
NAS provides the lower layers with the selected core network type information.
For the routing of the initial NAS message to the appropriate AMF, if the UE
holds a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE NAS provides the lower layers with either the
5G-S-TMSI or the registered GUAMI that consists of the PLMN ID, the AMF region
ID, the AMF set ID and the AMF pointer according to the following rules:
a) When the tracking area of the current cell is in theregistration area, the
UE NAS shall provide the lower layers with the 5G-S-TMSI, but shall not
provide the registered GUAMI to the lower layers;
b) When the tracking area of the current cell is not in theregistration area,
the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers with the GUAMI (AMF identifier part
of the valid 5G-GUTI);
c) When the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the registration type set to
\"initial registration\" is sent over 3GPP access in the same PLMN or
equivalent PLMN to establish the NAS signalling connection, the UE NAS shall
provide the lower layers with the GUAMI (AMF identifier part of the valid
5G-GUTI which is assigned over the non-3GPP access); or
d) When the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the registration type set to
\"initial registration\" is sent over non-3GPP access in the same PLMN or
equivalent PLMN to establish the NAS signalling connection, the UE NAS shall
provide the lower layers with the GUAMI (AMF identifier part of the valid
5G-GUTI which is assigned over the 3GPP access).
## 8.4 Release of the N1 NAS signalling connection
The signalling procedure for the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection
is initiated by the network.
In N1 mode, upon indication from lower layers that the access stratum
connection has been released, the UE shall enter 5GMM-IDLE mode and consider
the N1 NAS signalling connection released.
To allow the network to release the N1 NAS signalling connection, the UE:
a) shall start the timer T3540 if the UE receives any of the 5GMM cause values
#11, #12, #13 (not applicable to the service request procedure);
b) shall start the timer T3540 if:
\- the UE receives a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message;
\- the UE has not set the \"follow-on request pending\" indication in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message;
\- the registration for mobility and periodic registration update procedure
has been initiated in EMM-IDLE mode; and
\- the user-plane radio resources for PDU sessions have not been set up;
c) shall start the timer T3540 if the UE receives a REGISTRATION REJECT
message indicating:
\- the 5GMM cause value #10.
d) shall start the timer T3540 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT message
indicating:
\- the 5GMM cause value #10.
Upon expiry of T3540,
\- in cases a, and b, the UE shall locally release the established NAS
signalling connection; or
\- in cases c, and d the UE shall locally release the established N1 NAS
signalling connection and the UE shall initiate the registration procedure as
described in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.2 or 8.5.2.1.3.2.
In case b,
\- upon an indication from the lower layers that the user-plane radio
resources for PDU sessions are set up, the UE shall stop timer T3540 and may
send uplink signalling via the existing N1 NAS signalling connection or user
data via user plane; or
\- upon receipt of a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer
T3540 and respond to the network-initiated de-registration request as
specified in subclause 8.5.2.2.3.
In case c,
\- upon an indication from the lower layers that the access stratum connection
has been released, the UE shall stop timer T3540 and perform a new
registration procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.2 or 8.5.2.1.3.2.
In cases d,
\- upon an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been
released, the UE shall stop timer T3540 and perform a new registration
procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.2 or 8.5.2.1.3.2.
Editor\'s note: The case of receiving a request from upper layers to establish
a PDU session for emergency bearer services is FFS.
## 8.5 5GS mobility management procedures
### 8.5.1 5GMM common procedures
#### 8.5.1.1 Primary authentication and key agreement procedure
##### 8.5.1.1.1 General
The purpose of the primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to
enable mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to provide
keying material that can be used between the UE and network in subsequent
security procedures, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].
Two methods are defined:
\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
The UE and the AMF shall support the EAP based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure and the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure.
##### 8.5.1.1.2 EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure
###### 8.5.1.1.2.1 General
Extensible authentication protocol (EAP) as specified in IETF RFC 3748 [30]
enables authentication using various EAP methods.
EAP defines four types of EAP messages:
\- an EAP-request message;
\- an EAP-response message;
\- an EAP-success message; and
\- an EAP-failure message.
Several rounds of exchanges of an EAP-request message and a related EAP-
response message can be required to achieve the authentication (see example in
figure 8.5.1.1.2.1.1).
The EAP-request message is transported from the network to the UE using the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message of the EAP message reliable transport
procedure.
The EAP-response message is transported from the UE to the network using the
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message of the EAP message
reliable transport procedure.
If the authentication of the UE completes successfully, the EAP-success
message is transported from the network to the UE using the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message of the security mode command procedure.
Editor's note: The security mode command procedure is not yet included in the
TR, and EAP authentication procedure may need to be aligned when included.
If the authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the EAP-failure
message is transported from the network to the UE in a response of the initial
5GMM procedure as part of which the EAP based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure is performed.
The AMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in IETF RFC
3748 [30] subclause 4.3 to infinite value.
NOTE: The EAP message reliable transport procedure provides a reliable
transport of EAP messages and therefore retransmissions at the EAP layer do
not occur.
The AUSF and the AMF support exchange of EAP messages using N12.
Editor's note: The ngKSI handling at EAP authentication is FFS.
Figure 8.5.1.1.2.1.1: EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure
###### 8.5.1.1.2.2 EAP-AKA\' related procedures
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.1 General
The UE shall support acting as EAP-AKA\' peer as specified in IETF RFC 5448
[35]. The AUSF may support acting as EAP-AKA\' server as specified in IETF RFC
5448 [35].
The EAP-AKA\' enables mutual authentication of the UE and the network.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.2 Initiation
In order to initiate the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure using EAP-AKA\', the AUSF shall send an EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge
message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35]. The AUSF shall set the
AT_KDF_INPUT attribute of the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message to the SNN.
The SNN is in format described in subclause 8.8.1. The AUSF may include
AT_RESULT_IND attribute in the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message.
Upon receiving an EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message, the UE checks whether
the network name field of the AT_KDF_INPUT attribute is the SNN constructed
according to subclause 8.y.1.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.3 UE successfully authenticates network
If the SNN check is successful and procedures for handling of the EAP-
request/AKA\'-challenge message specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35] are
successful, the UE shall generate K~AUSF~, K~SEAF~, and K~AMF~ as described in
3GPP TS 33.501 [24] and shall send an EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message as
specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35].
If the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message contains AT_RESULT_IND attribute,
the UE may include AT_RESULT_IND attribute in the EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge
message.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.4 Errors when handling EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge
message
If the SNN check fails or the UE does not accept AUTN during handling of the
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35], the UE
shall send an EAP-response/AKA\'-authentication-reject message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 [35].
If the SNN check is successful but the UE detects that the sequence number in
AUTN is not correct during handling of the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message
as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35], the UE shall send an EAP-
response/AKA\'-synchronization-failure message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
[35].
If the SNN check is successful, the sequence number in AUTN is correct and the
UE detects another error during handling of the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge
message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35], the UE shall send an EAP-
response/AKA\'-client-error message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35].
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.5 Network successfully authenticates UE
Upon reception of the EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message, if procedures for
handling an EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
[35] are successful, the AUSF may generate K~AUSF~ and shall generate K~SEAF~
as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24] and checks whether the AT_RESULT_IND
attribute is included in the EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message and:
\- if the AT_RESULT_IND attribute is included in the EAP-
response/AKA\'-challenge message, the AUSF shall send an EAP-
request/AKA\'-notification message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35]; and
\- if the AT_RESULT_IND attribute is not included in the EAP-
response/AKA\'-challenge message, the AUSF shall send an EAP-success message
as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35] along with the K~SEAF~ and shall consider
the procedure complete.
NOTE: SEAF generates K~AMF~ based on the received K~SEAF~ immediately
following the primary authentication and key agreement procedure and provides
K~AMF~ to AMF.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.6 UE handling EAP-AKA\' notification
Upon receiving an EAP-request/AKA\'-notification message, the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-notification message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35].
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.7 Network sending EAP-success message
Upon reception of the EAP-response/AKA\'-notification message, if earlier
procedures for handling an EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 [35] were successful, the AUSF shall send an EAP-success message
as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35] along with the K~SEA~ and shall consider
the procedure complete.
NOTE: SEAF generates K~AMF~ based on the received K~SEAF~ immediately
following the primary authentication and key agreement procedure and provides
K~AMF~ to AMF.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.8 UE handling EAP-success message
Upon receiving an EAP-success message, the UE shall consider the procedure
complete.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.9 Network not successfully authenticates UE
Upon reception of the EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message, if procedures for
handling an EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
[35] are not successful, the AUSF shall send an EAP-request/AKA\'-notification
message that implies failure as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35].
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.10 Network sending EAP-failure message
Upon reception of the EAP-response/AKA\'-notification message, if earlier
procedures for handling an EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 [35] were not successful, the AUSF shall send an EAP-failure
message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 [35] and shall consider the procedure
complete.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.2.11 UE handling EAP-success
Upon receiving an EAP-failure message, the UE shall consider the procedure
complete.
###### 8.5.1.1.2.3 EAP message reliable transport procedure
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.3.1 General
The purpose of the EAP message reliable transport procedure is to provide a
reliable transport of an EAP-request message from the network to the UE and of
an EAP-response message from the UE to the network.
The EAP message reliable transport procedure is initiated by an AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message with the EAP message IE.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.3.2 EAP message reliable transport procedure initiation by
the network
In order to initiate the EAP message reliable transport procedure, the AMF
shall create an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to
the EAP-request message to be sent to the UE.
The AMF shall send the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE, and the AMF
shall start timer T3560 (see example in figure 8.5.1.1.2.3.2.1).
Figure 8.5.1.1.2.3.2.1: EAP message reliable transport procedure
Upon receipt of a AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE, the
UE handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE of the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.3.3 EAP message reliable transport procedure accepted by
the UE
The UE shall create a AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message.
If the received EAP message is an EAP-request message, the UE shall set the
EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the EAP-response
message responding to the received EAP-request message.
The UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the AMF.
Upon receipt of a AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the AMF shall stop timer
T3560. If the EAP message IE is included in the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
message, the AMF handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE of the
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message.
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.3.4 Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) T3560 expired
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases are FFS
###### # 8.5.1.1.2.3.5 Abnormal cases in the UE
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases are FFS
##### 8.5.1.1.3 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure
###### 8.5.1.1.3.1 General
The purpose of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure is to provide mutual authentication between the UE and the network
and to agree on a key K~AMF~ (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]). The cases when the 5G
AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is used are
defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].
The 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is always
initiated and controlled by the network. However, the UE can reject the 5G
authentication challenge sent by the network.
The UE shall proceed with an 5G authentication challenge only if a USIM is
present.
A partial native 5GS security context is established in the UE and the network
when an 5G authentication is successfully performed. During a successful 5G
AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the CK and IK
are computed by the USIM. CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to
compute a new key, K~AMF~. K~AMF~ is stored in the 5GS security contexts (see
3GPP TS 33.501 [24]) of both the network and in the volatile memory of the ME
while attached to the network, and is the root for the 5GS integrity
protection and ciphering key hierarchy.
The 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is
initiated by an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message without the EAP message IE.
###### 8.5.1.1.3.2 Authentication initiation by the network
The network may initiate a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure for a UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode at any time. For
restrictions applicable after handover or inter-system handover to N1 mode see
subclause 8.5.1.1.2.3.
The network initiates the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE and
starting the timer T3560 (see example in figure 8.5.2.1.3.2.1). The
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains the parameters necessary to calculate
the authentication response (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]).
If an ngKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during a 5GMM procedure,
the network shall include a different ngKSI value in the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message when it initiates a 5G AKA based primary authentication and
key agreement procedure.
Figure 8.5.1.1.3.2.1: 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure
###### 8.5.1.1.3.3 Authentication response by the UE
The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. With the exception
of the cases described in subclause 8.5.1.1.3.6, the UE shall process the
authentication challenge data and respond with an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
message to the network.
Upon a successful 5G authentication challenge, the UE shall determine the PLMN
identity to be used for the calculation of the new K~AMF~ from the
authentication challenge data according to the following rules:
a) When the UE moves from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, until the
first handover, the UE shall use the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN; and
b) After handover or inter-system handover to N1 mode,
\- if the target cell is not a shared network cell, the UE shall use the PLMN
identity received as part of the broadcast system information;
\- if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI,
the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 5G-GUTI; and
\- if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid 4G-GUTI
and TAI, but not a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is
part of the TAI.
Editor's note: Security context coordination between EPS and 5GS is FFS.
Upon a successful 5G authentication challenge, the new K~AMF~ calculated from
the authentication challenge data shall be stored in a new 5GS security
context in the volatile memory of the ME.
The USIM will compute the authentication response (RES) using the
authentication challenge data received from the ME, and pass RES to the ME.
In order to avoid a synchronisation failure, when the UE receives an
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall store the received RAND together
with the RES returned from the USIM in the volatile memory of the ME. When the
UE receives a subsequent AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, if the stored RAND
value is equal to the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message, then the ME shall not pass the RAND to the USIM, but shall send the
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES. If there is no valid
stored RAND in the ME or the stored RAND is different from the new received
value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the ME shall pass the RAND to the
USIM, shall override any previously stored RAND and RES with the new ones and
start, or reset and restart timer T3516.
The RAND and RES values stored in the ME shall be deleted and timer T3516, if
running, shall be stopped:
\- upon receipt of a
\- SECURITY MODE COMMAND,
\- SERVICE REJECT,
\- REGISTRATION REJECT,
\- REGISTRATION ACCEPT, or
\- AUTHENTICATION REJECT message;
\- upon expiry of timer T3516;
\- if the UE enters the 5GMM state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED or 5GMM-NULL; or
\- if the UE enters 5GMM-IDLE mode.
###### 8.5.1.1.3.4 Authentication completion by the network
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network stops the
timer T3560 and checks the correctness of RES (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]).
If the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure has
been completed successfully and the related ngKSI is stored in the 5GS
security context of the network, the network shall include a different ngKSI
value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates a new 5G AKA
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, the network stops the timer
T3560. In the case where the 5GMM cause #21 \"synch failure\" is received, the
core network may renegotiate with the UDM/AUSF and provide the UE with new
authentication parameters.
###### 8.5.1.1.3.5 Authentication not accepted by the network
Editor's note: Authentication not accepted for normal services by the network
is FFS.
Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency services,
if the UE initiates a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set
to \"emergency registration\" and the AMF is configured to allow emergency
registration without user identity, the AMF needs not follow the procedures
specified for the authentication failure in the present subclause. The AMF may
continue a current 5GMM specific procedure.
###### 8.5.1.1.3.6 Authentication not accepted by the UE
Editor's note: Authentication not accepted by the UE is FFS.
###### 8.5.1.1.3.7 Abnormal cases
Editor's note: Abnormal cases are FFS. However the below message flow is
expected to apply, .i.e. an authentication failure message is needed.
Figure 8.5.1.1.3.7.2: Authentication failure during 5G AKA based primary
authentication and key agreement procedure
#### 8.5.1.2 Security mode control procedure
##### 8.5.1.2.1 General
The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take an 5GS
security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling security
between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5GS NAS keys and 5GS
security algorithms.
Furthermore, the network may also initiate the security mode control procedure
in the following cases:
\- in order to change the NAS security algorithms for a current 5GS security
context already in use; and
\- in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24], subclause
8.3.1.4.2.
For restrictions concerning the concurrent running of a security mode control
procedure with other security related procedures in the AS or inside the core
network see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24], subclause 6.5.3.6.
##### 8.5.1.2.2 NAS security mode control initiation by the network
The AMF initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE and starting timer Tyx (see example in
figure 8.5.1.2.1).
The AMF shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to integrity
protect the initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message if the security mode control
procedure is initiated:
\- to take into use the S security context created after a successful
execution of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure;
\- upon receipt of REGISTRATION REQUEST message including an eKSI, if the AMF
wishes to create a mapped 5GS security context (i.e. the type of security
context flag is set to \"mapped security context\" in the NAS key set
identifier IE included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message).
Editor\'s note: The name of NAS key set identifier used in 5GS is FFS.
The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message unciphered, but shall
integrity protect the message with the 5GS integrity key based on K~AMF~ or
mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI included in the message. The AMF shall
set the security header type of the message to \"integrity protected with new
5GS security context\".
Editor\'s note: Handling at emergency registration and emergency PDU sessions
is FFS.
Upon receipt of a REGISTRATION REQUEST message including an eKSI, if the AMF
does not have the valid current 5GS security context indicated by the UE, the
AMF shall indicate the use of the new mapped 5GS security context to the UE by
setting the type of security context flag in the NAS key set identifier IE to
\"mapped security context\" and the KSI value related to the security context
of the source system.
Editor\'s note: Handling at non-existing 5GS security context indicated by the
UE when an emergency PDU session exists is FFS.
While having a current mapped 5GS security context with the UE, if the AMF
wants to take the native 5GS security context into use, the AMF shall include
the ngKSI that indicates the native 5GS security context in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message.
The AMF shall include the replayed security capabilities of the UE (including
the security capabilities with regard to NAS, RRC and UP (user plane)
ciphering as well as NAS and RRC integrity, and other possible target network
security capabilities, i.e. E-UTRAN if the UE included them in the message to
network), the replayed nonce~UE~ when creating a mapped 5GS security context
and if the UE included it in the message to the network, the selected 5GS
ciphering and integrity algorithms and the Key Set Identifier (ngKSI).
The AMF shall include both the nonce~AMF~ and the nonce~UE~ when creating a
mapped 5GS security context during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode
in 5GMM-IDLE mode.
The AMF may initiate a SECURITY MODE COMMAND in order to change the 5GS
security algorithms for a current 5GS security context already in use. The AMF
re-derives the 5GS NAS keys from K~AMF~ with the new 5GS algorithm identities
as input and provides the new 5GS algorithm identities within the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message. The AMF shall set the security header type of the
message to \"integrity protected with new 5GS security context\".
If, during an ongoing registration procedure, the AMF is initiating a SECURITY
MODE COMMAND (i.e. after receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, but
before sending a response to that message) and the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message does not successfully pass the integrity check at the AMF, the AMF
shall calculate the HASH~AMF~ of the entire plain REGISTRATION REQUEST message
as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24] and shall include the HASH~AMF~ in the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
Additionally, the AMF may request the UE to include its IMEISV in the SECURITY
MODE COMPLETE message.
NOTE 2: The AS and NAS security capabilities will be the same, i.e. if the UE
supports one algorithm for NAS, the same algorithm is also supported for AS.
Figure 8.5.1.2.1: Security mode control procedure
##### 8.5.1.2.3 NAS security mode command accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check whether
the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done by performing
the integrity check of the message and by checking that the received replayed
UE security capabilities and the received nonce~UE~ have not been altered
compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network. However, the UE
is not required to perform the checking of the received nonce~UE~ if the UE
does not want to re-generate the K\'~AMF~ (i.e. the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message is to derive and take into use a mapped 5GS security context and the
ngKSI matches the current 5GS security context, if it is a mapped 5GS security
context).
Editor\'s note: Handling at emergency PDU sessions is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Handling of \"null algorithms\" is FFS.
If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message is set to \"native security context\" and if the KSI matches a valid
non-current native 5GS security context held in the UE while the UE has a
mapped 5GS security context as the current 5GS security context, the UE shall
take the non-current native 5GS security context into use which then becomes
the current native 5GS security context and delete the mapped 5GS security
context.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take the
5GS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE shall in
addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:
\- the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take a 5GS
security context into use created after a successful execution of the 5G AKA
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
\- the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of security
context flag set to \"mapped security context\" in the NAS key set identifier
IE the ngKSI does not match the current 5GS security context, if it is a
mapped 5GS security context.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted and a new 5GS security
context is taken into use and SECURITY MODE COMMAND message does not indicate
the \"null integrity protection algorithm\"5G-IA0 as the selected NAS
integrity algorithm, the UE shall:
\- if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has been successfully integrity
checked using an estimated downlink NAS COUNT equal to 0, then the UE shall
set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5GS security context to 0;
\- otherwise the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5GS security
context to the downlink NAS COUNT that has been used for the successful
integrity checking of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send a
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected 5GS
integrity algorithm and the 5GS NAS integrity key based on the K~AMF~ or
mapped K\'~AMF~ if the type of security context flag is set to \"mapped
security context\" indicated by the ngKSI. When the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message includes the type of security context flag set to \"mapped security
context\" in the NAS key set identifier IE, the nonce~AMF~ and the nonce~UE~,
then the UE shall either:
\- generate K\'~AMF~ from both the nonce~AMF~ and the nonce~UE~ as indicated
in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24];or
\- check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the ngKSI of the
current 5GS security context, if it is a mapped 5GS security context, in order
not to re-generate the K\'~AMF~.
Furthermore, if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE
shall cipher the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message with the selected 5GS
ciphering algorithm and the 5GS NAS ciphering key based on the K~AMF~ or
mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI. The UE shall set the security header
type of the message to \"integrity protected and ciphered with new 5GS
security context\".
From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS
signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering algorithms.
If the AMF indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that the IMEISV is
requested, the UE shall include its IMEISV in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
message.
If, during an ongoing registration procedure, the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message includes a HASH~AMF~, the UE shall compare HASH~AMF~ with a hash value
locally calculated as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24] from the entire plain
REGISTRATION REQUEST message that the UE had sent to initiate the procedure.
If HASH~AMF~ and the locally calculated hash value are different, the UE shall
include the complete REGISTRATION REQUEST message which the UE had previously
sent in the Replayed NAS message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
message.
If, prior to receiving the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE had sent an
initial NAS message containing a limited set of IEs needed to establish
security context, the UE shall include the complete initial message in the NAS
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
##### 8.5.1.2.4 NAS security mode control completion by the network
The AMF shall, upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, stop timer
Tyx. From this time onward the AMF shall integrity protect and encipher all
signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering algorithms.
If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a Replayed NAS container
message IE with an REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the AMF shall complete the
ongoing registration procedure by considering the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
contained in the Replayed NAS message container IE as the message that
triggered the procedure.
##### 8.5.1.2.5 NAS security mode command not accepted by the UE
If the security mode command cannot be accepted, the UE shall send a SECURITY
MODE REJECT message. The SECURITY MODE REJECT message contains an 5GMM cause
that typically indicates one of the following cause values:
#23: UE security capabilities mismatch;
#24: security mode rejected, unspecified.
Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE REJECT message, the AMF shall stop timer
Tyx. The AMF shall also abort the ongoing procedure that triggered the
initiation of the NAS security mode control procedure.
Both the UE and the AMF shall apply the 5GS security context in use before the
initiation of the security mode control procedure, if any, to protect the
SECURITY MODE REJECT message and any other subsequent messages according to
the rules in subclause TBD.
EditorÂ´s note: The NAS security subclause in the present document is FFS.
##### 8.5.1.2.6 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE
REJECT message indication from lower layers (if the security mode control
procedure is triggered by a registration procedure)
The UE shall abort the security mode control procedure and re-initiate the
registration procedure.
b) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE
REJECT message indication with TAI change from lower layers (if the security
mode control procedure is triggered by a service request procedure)
If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the security mode control procedure
shall be aborted and a registration procedure shall be initiated.
If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the security mode control
procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run
the ongoing procedure that triggered the security mode control procedure.
c) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE
REJECT message indication without TAI change from lower layers (if the
security mode control procedure is triggered by a service request procedure)
The security mode control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the security
mode control procedure.
##### 8.5.1.2.7 Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Lower layer failure before the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE or SECURITY MODE
REJECT message is received
The network shall abort the security mode control procedure.
b) Expiry of timer Tyx
The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer Tyx, retransmit the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer Tyx. This
retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer Tyx,
the procedure shall be aborted.
NOTE: If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message was sent to create a mapped 5GS
security context during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, then the
network does not generate new values for the nonce~AMF~ and the nonce~UE~, but
includes the same values in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message (see the
subclause 6.7.2 in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]).
c) Collision between security mode control procedure and registration, service
request or detach procedure not indicating switch off
The network shall abort the security mode control procedure and proceed with
the UE initiated procedure.
d) Collision between security mode control procedure and other 5GMM procedures
than in item c
The network shall progress both procedures.
e) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an intra
AMF handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon
successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. If a failure of the handover procedure is
reported by the lower layer and the N1 signalling connection exists, the AMF
shall retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
#### 8.5.1.3 NAS transport procedures
##### 8.5.1.3.1 General
The purpose of the NAS transport procedures is to provide a transport of
payload between the UE to the AMF. Two alternatives are described: subclause
8.5.1.3.2 describes Alternative 1 where there is a dedicated set of procedures
for each of SM transport and non-SM transport; and subclause 8.5.1.3.3
describes Alternative 2 where there is a single set of procedures for both SM
and non-SM transport.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether to extend the UL SM MESSAGE TRANSPORT
message and the UL GENERIC TRANSPORT message (for alternative 1 for NAS
transport) and the UL NAS TRANSPORT message (for alternative 2 for NAS
transport) to enable their usage as initial 5GMM message.
##### 8.5.1.3.2 Alternative 1 for NAS transport

###### # 8.5.1.3.2.1.1 UE-initiated SM message transport procedure
###### # 8.5.1.3.2.1.1.1 General
The purpose of the UE-initiated SM transport message procedure is to provide
transport of:
\- an SM message; and
\- associated routing information (the PDU session ID, the S-NSSAI, the DNN,
the request type);
from the UE to the AMF in the 5GMM message.
5GSM procedures specified in clause 9 describe conditions for inclusion of the
S-NSSAI, and the DNN.
The request type is not provided along SM messages other than the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

MESSAGE TRANSPORT message to the S-NSSAI.
If a DNN is to be included, the UE shall set the DNN IE of the UL SM MESSAGE
TRANSPORT message to the DNN.
If a request type is to be included, the UE shall set the request type IE of
the UL SM MESSAGE TRANSPORT message to the request type.
The UE shall send the UL SM MESSAGE TRANSPORT message to the AMF (see example
in figure 8.5.1.3.2.1.1.2.1).

###### # 8.5.1.3.2.1.1.3 UE-initiated SM message transport of messages
Upon reception of an UL SM MESSAGE TRANSPORT message, the AMF looks up a PDU
session routing context for the PDU session ID of the UL SM MESSAGE TRANSPORT
message and the UE and:
a) if the AMF has a PDU session routing context for the PDU session ID and the

the S-NSSAI; and
ii) if the SMF selection is successful:
A) the AMF shall set the reallocated SMF ID of the PDU session routing context
to the SMF ID of the selected SMF; and

the PDU session ID;
6) if the AMF does not have a PDU session routing context for the PDU session
ID and the UE, the Request type IE is included and is set to \"existing PDU
session\", and the user's subscription context obtained from the UDM contains
an SMF ID corresponding to:
i) the DNN in the DNN IE, if the DNN IE is included; or
ii) the default DNN, if the DNN IE is not included;
Editor\'s note: FFS how to obtain the correct SMF ID when the UE has several
PDU sessions with a given DNN, each PDU session is provided by a different
SMF, and the UE attempts to handover one of those PDU sessions.
then:
i) the AMF shall store a PDU session routing context for the PDU session ID
and the UE, shall set the SMF ID in the stored PDU session routing context to
the SMF ID corresponding to the DNN in the user's subscription context
obtained from the UDM; and
ii) the AMF shall forward the 5GSM message, the PDU session ID, the S-NSSAI
(if received), the DNN (if received) and the request type towards the SMF

Editor\'s note: Handling of this abnormal case is FFS
e) if the old PDU session ID IE is included in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message,
and the AMF has a PDU session routing context for the PDU session ID and the
UE, the Request type IE is set to \"initial request\" and the AMF has not
received a reallocation requested indication, the AMF should forward the 5GSM
message, the PDU session ID, the old PDU session ID, the S-NSSAI (if
received), the DNN (if received) and the request type towards the SMF ID of

###### 8.5.1.3.3.3 Network-initiated NAS transport procedure
###### # 8.5.1.3.3.3.1 General
The purpose of the network-initiated NAS transport procedure is to provide a
transport of:
a) a single 5GSM message;
b) SMS; or
c) an LPP message
from the AMF to the UE in a 5GMM message.
###### 8.5.1.3.3.3.2 Network-initiated NAS transport procedure initiation
In connected mode, the AMF initiaties the NAS transport procedure by sending
the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, as shown in figure 8.5.1.3.3.3.2.1.
In case a) in subclause 8.5.1.3.3.3.1, i.e. upon reception from an SMF of a
5GSM message without an N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication for a UE or a
5GSM message with an N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication for a UE in the
5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF shall:
\- include the PDU session information (PDU session ID) in the PDU session ID
IE;
\- set the Payload container type IE to \"N1 SM information\"; and
\- set the Payload container IE to the 5GSM message.
In case b) in subclause 8.5.1.3.3.3.1, i.e. upon reception from an SMSF of an
SMS payload, the AMF shall:
\- set the Payload container type IE to \"SMS\";
\- set the Payload container IE to the SMS payload ; and
\- select the access type to deliver the DL NAS TRANSPORT message as follows
in case the access type selection is required:
i) if the UE to receive the DL NAS TRANSPORT message is registered to the
network via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, and the SMS allowed IE in
the 5GMM context of the UE is set to \"both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access\",
then the AMF selects either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access; and
ii) otherwise, the AMF selects 3GPP access.
NOTE: The AMF selects an access type between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
based on operator policy.
Editor\'s note: The cases when the access type selection is required for SMS
delivery are FFS.
In case c) in subclause 8.5.1.3.3.3.1 i.e. upon reception from an LMF of an
LPP message payload,, the AMF shall:
\- set the Payload container type IE to \"LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)
message container\";
\- set the Payload container IE to the LPP message payload received from the
LMF; and
\- set the Additional information IE to the routing information associated
with the LMF from which the LPP message was received.
Figure 8.5.1.3.3.3.2.1: Network-initiated NAS transport procedure
###### 8.5.1.3.3.3.3 Network-initiated NAS transport of messages
Upon reception of a DL NAS TRANSPORT message, if the Payload container type IE
is set to:
a) \"N1 SM information\".the 5GSM message in the Payload container IE and the
PDU session ID are handled in the 5GSM procedures specified in clause 9;
b) \"SMS\", the UE shall forward the content of the Payload container IE to
the SMS stack entity ; and
c) \"LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) message container\", the UE shall forward
the content of the Payload container IE and the routing information included
in the Additional information IE to the upper layer location services
application.
##### 8.5.1.3.4 Criteria for evaluation of alternatives for NAS transport
The following criteria are considered:
\- message size
\- scalability
\- specification and implementation impact
\- extensibility (future proof)
The criteria are not prioritized.
##### 8.5.1.3.5 Evaluation of the alternatives for NAS transport
###### 8.5.1.3.5.1 Message size
Alternative 2 requires to indicate the type of payload/container type carried
inside the NAS transport message. This could be a separate IE, which would
take up two octets, or it could be a field in the payload information IE,
which would take up one octet.
Alternative 1 does not require an indication of the payload/container type in
the SM transport message. The additional code points for the SM transport
message type for Alternative 1 do not have impact on the coded message size.
All other information, such as payload routing information etc., needs to be
present in the messages for both alternatives.
Alternative 2 allows the option of including 5GSM payload and SMS payload in
the same NAS message, which is more efficient. Alternaitve 1 does not allow
for that option.
In conclusion, for transport of SM messages through the AMF, Alternative 1
allows to save one or two of octets in the coded messages, depending on the
coding. Alternative 2 allows to combine 5GSM payload and SMS in the same
message.
###### 8.5.1.3.5.2 Scalability
Alternative 1 assumes that the transport of SM messages through the AMF needs
special consideration and therefore merits a separate procedure.
Alternative 2 uses a single procedure for all types of payload passed
transparently through the AMF.
###### 8.5.1.3.5.3 Implementation and specification impact
Alternative 1 requires a separate SM transport procedure for the transport of
SM payload vs. non-SM transport procedure for the transport of other kind of
payload. If the NAS transport becomes an initial procedure, then Alternative 1
would create two initial procedures. Alternative 1 also requires maintaining
separate subclauses for SM transport procedure vs. non-SM transport procedure.
Separate procedure failure handling would need to be maintained as well.
Alternative 2 requires a single procedure. If the NAS transport becomes an
initial procedure, then Alternative 2 would create one initial procedure.
Each additional procedure entails development and testing effort.
###### 8.5.1.3.5.4 Extensibility
In Alternative 1, the UE-initiated non-SM message transport procedure and the
Network-initiated non-SM message transport procedure can be extended to carry
the new payload by adding new payload type and conainer.
In Alternaitve 2, UL and DL NAS Transport procedure can be extended to carry
new payload type and container.
##### 8.5.1.3.6 Selection of the NAS transport mechanism
Based on the evaluation of the two alternatives in the subsequent subclauses,
both alternatives fulfil the objective of transporting the payload
transparently through the AMF. Both alternatives are extensible to carry new
payload types transparently thorugh the AMF as needed.
Advantages of the Alternative 1 include:
\- smaller message size for SM message transport by one to two octets (the
message size for non-SM message transport is the same for both alternatives)
Advantages of Alternative 2 include:
\- ability to combine 5GSM and SMS payload in the same NAS message; and
\- lower implementation and specification complexity.
Alternative 2 is selected as the way forward in the normative phase.
#### 8.5.1.4 Generic UE configuration update procedure
##### 8.5.1.4.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to allow the AMF to update UE configuration
by providing new parameter information with the command or request the UE to
perform a new registration update with the network to update parameters.
The procedure may be initiated by the network and can only be used when the UE
has an established 5GMM context, and the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode. The AMF
may require a confirmation response in order to ensure that the parameter has
been updated by the UE.
The following parameters are supported by the generic UE configuration update
procedure without the need for triggering UE Registration Update procedure:
a) 5G-GUTI;
b) TAI list;
c) Service area list;
d) Allowed NSSAI;
e) Network Identity and Time Zone information (Full name for network, Short
name for network, Local time zone, Universal time and local time zone, Network
daylight saving time); and
f) LADN information;
Editor\'s note: It is FFS which configuration parameters are updated by this
procedure (e.g. policy information).
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the case when configuration provided by a
different NF than the AMF is covered by this or a different NAS procedure
(e.g. UE route selection policies (URSP) provided by PCF).
The following parameters require triggering UE Registration Update procedure:
a) MICO.
Editor's note: Other parameters requiring negotiation are FFS.
Figure 8.5.1.4.1.1: Generic UE configuration update procedure
##### 8.5.1.4.2 Generic UE configuration update procedure initiated by the
network
The AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration procedure by sending the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.
The AMF shall in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message either:
a) include one or more of 5G-GUTI, TAI list, allowed NSSAI, LADN information,
service area list or NITZ;
b) indicate registration requested; or
c) a combination of both.
If an acknowledgement from the UE is requested, the AMF shall indicate
acknowledgement requested in the Configuration update indication IE in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and shall start timer T3555.
Acknowledgement shall be requested for all parameters except when only NITZ is
included.
To initiate parameter re-negotiation between the UE and network, the AMF shall
indicate \"registration requested\" in the Configuration update indication IE
in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. In this case, the acknowledgement
shall be requested.
If a new allowed NSSAI information or AMF re-configuration of supported
S-NSSAIs requires an AMF relocation, the AMF shall indicate \"registration
requested\" in the Configuration update indication IE and include the Allowed
NSSAI IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. In this case, the
acknowledgement shall be requested.
During an established 5GMM context, the network may send none, one, or more
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND messages to the UE. If more than one
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is sent, the messages need not have the
same content.
##### 8.5.1.4.3 Generic UE configuration update accepted by the UE
Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall use the
contents to update appropriate information stored within the UE.
If acknowledgement requested is indicated in the Configuration update
indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and:
\- if all information elements included are successfully accepted by the UE;
or
\- if \"registration requested\" in the Configuration update indication IE is
indicated;
the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE message.
If the UE receives a new 5G-GUTI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
the UE considers the new 5G-GUTI as valid and the old 5G-GUTI as invalid;
otherwise, the UE shall consider the old 5G-GUTI as valid.
If the UE receives a new TAI list in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as
invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid.
If the UE receives a new service area list in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new service area list as valid and the old
mobility restrictions as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old
service area list, if any, as valid.
If the UE receives a new Allowed NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new Allowed NSSAI as valid, store the
Allowed NSSAI as specified in subclause 13.2.2 and consider the old Allowed
NSSAI as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old Allowed NSSAI as
valid.
If the UE receives an indication for \"registration requested\" in the
Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message
that lacks an Allowed NSSAI IE, the UE shall send a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message immediately as specified in subclause 8.2.4 to re-negotiate MICO mode
with the network.
If the UE receives a new LADN information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new LADN information as valid and the old
LADN information as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old LADN
information as valid.
If the UE receives an allowed NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message and the UE has one or more PDU session contexts associated with
S-NSSAI(s) not included in the received allowed NSSAI, the UE shall locally
release all such PDU session context(s).
If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND indicates \"registration requested\" in
the Configuration update indication IE and a new allowed NSSAI is included,
the UE shall release the existing NAS signalling connection and:
a) deactivate the PDU session(s) context locally, if any; and
b) set the 5G-GUTI as invalid and initiate a mobility registration update
procedure with a REGISTRATION REQUEST message using SUPI as specified in
subclause 8.2.3; and
c) should re-establish any previous active PDU sessions(s).
Editor's note: It is FFS if the UE must wait for AMF to release the N1 NAS
signalling connection prior to the UE attempts to initiate a mobility update
procedure with SUPI.
Editor\'s note: Further details on handling of specific IEs are FFS.
##### 8.5.1.4.4 Generic UE configuration update completion by the network
Upon receipt of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE message, the AMF shall stop
the timer T3555.
If a new 5G-GUTI was included in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the
AMF shall consider the new 5G-GUTI as valid and the old 5G-GUTI as invalid.
If a new TAI list was included in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
the AMF shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as
invalid.
If a new service area list was included in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the AMF shall consider the new service area list as valid and the old
service area list as invalid.
If new allowed NSSAI information was included in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the AMF shall consider the new Allowed NSSAI information as
valid and the old allowed NSSAI information as invalid.
If a new LADN information was included in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the AMF shall consider the new LADN information as valid and the old
LADN information as invalid.
Editor\'s note: Further details on handling of specific IEs are FFS.
##### 8.5.1.4.5 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Transmission failure of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE message.
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases in the UE are FFS.
##### 8.5.1.4.6 Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiry of timer T3555.
The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3555, retransmit the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T3555.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3555, the procedure shall be aborted.
b) Lower layer failure
If a lower layer failure is detected before the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message is received, the old and the new 5G-GUTI shall be considered as valid
until the old 5G-GUTI can be considered as invalid by the AMF. If a new TAI
list was provided in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the old and new
TAI list shall also be considered as valid until the old TAI list can be
considered as invalid by the AMF.
During this period the AMF:
\- may first use the old 5G-S-TMSI from the old 5G-GUTI for paging within the
area defined by the old TAI list for an implementation dependent number of
paging attempts for network originated transactions. If a new TAI list was
provided with old 5G-GUTI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the new
TAI list should also be used for paging. Upon response from the UE, the AMF
may re-initiate the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND. If the response is received
from a tracking area within the old and new TAI list, the network shall re-
initiate the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND. If no response is received to the
paging attempts, the network may use the new 5G-S-TMSI from the new 5G-GUTI
for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts. In this
case, if a new TAI list was provided with new 5G-GUTI in the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message, the new TAI list shall be used instead of the old TAI
list. Upon response from the UE the AMF shall consider the new 5G-GUTI as
valid and the old 5G-GUTI as invalid. If no response is received to the paging
attempts, the AMF may use the IMSI for paging for an implementation dependent
number of paging attempts;
\- shall consider the new 5G-GUTI as valid if it is used by the UE and,
additionally, the new TAI list as valid if it was provided with this 5G-GUTI
in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message; and
\- may use the identification procedure followed by a new generic UE
configuration update procedure if the UE uses the old 5G-GUTI.
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases in the network are FFS.
#### 8.5.1.5 Identification procedure
##### 8.5.1.5.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to to request a particular UE to provide
specific identification parameters, e.g. the SUPI or the PEI. SUPI and PEI
definition and structure are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
##### 8.5.1.5.2 Identification initiation by the network
The AMF initiates the identification procedure by sending an IDENTITY REQUEST
message to the UE and starting timer T3570 (see example in figure
8.5.1.5.2.1). The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the requested
identification parameters in the Identity type information element.
Figure 8.5.1.5.2.1: Identification procedure
##### 8.5.1.5.3 Identification response by the UE
A UE shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any time
whilst in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message the UE shall send an IDENTITY
RESPONSE message to the network. The IDENTITY RESPONSE message shall contain
the identification parameters as requested by the network.
##### 8.5.1.5.4 Identification completion by the network
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE the network shall stop the timer Tf.
##### 8.5.1.5.5 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Transmission failure of the IDENTIFY RESPONSE message (if the
identification procedure is triggered by a registration procedure).
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases in the UE are FFS.
##### 8.5.1.5.6 Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiry of timer T3570
The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3570, retransmit the
IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer T3570. This
retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3570, the network shall abort the identification procedure and any ongoing
5GMM procedure.
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases in the network are FFS.
#### 8.5.1.6 5GMM status procedure
##### 8.5.1.6.1 General
The purpose of the 5GMM STATUS procedure is to report at any time in the 5GMM
STATUS message certain error conditions detected upon receipt of 5GMM protocol
data in the UE. The 5GMM STATUS message can be sent by both the AMF and the UE
(see example in figure 8.5.1.6.1).
Figure 8.5.1.6.1: 5GMM status procedure
##### 8.5.1.6.2 5GMM status received in the UE
On receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message, no state transition and no specific
action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local actions are
possible. The local actions to be taken by UE on receipt of an 5GMM STATUS
message are implementation dependent.
##### 8.5.1.6.3 5GMM status received in the network
On receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message in the AMF, no state transition and no
specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local
actions are possible. The local actions to be taken by the AMF on receipt of
an 5GMM STATUS message are implementation dependent.
### 8.5.2 5GMM specific procedures
#### 8.5.2.1 Registration procedure
##### 8.5.2.1.1 General
The registration procedure is always initiated by the UE and can be used for
the following purposes:
\- initial registration for 5GS services;
\- mobility registration updating to update the registration of the actual
tracking area of a UE in the network;
\- periodic registration updating to periodically notify the availability of
the UE to the network;
\- initial registration for emergency services;
\- initial registration for SMS over NAS service, change in the requirements
to use SMS over NAS service, and de-registration from SMS over NAS service.
Editor\'s note: Further purposes are FFS.
##### 8.5.2.1.2 Registration procedure for initial registration
###### 8.5.2.1.2.1 General
This procedure can be used by a UE for initial registration for 5GS services.
When the UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration, the
UE shall indicate \"initial registration\" in the 5GS registration type IE.
When the UE initiates the registration procedure for emergency services, the
UE shall indicate \"emergency registration\" in the 5GS registration type IE.
###### 8.5.2.1.2.2 Initial registration initiation
The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510. If
timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If timer
T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.
If the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS
mobile identity IE. If the UE does not hold a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall
include the SUPI in the 5GS mobile identity IE.
If the UE operating in the single-registration mode holds a valid 4G-GUTI
only, the UE shall include the 5G-GUTI IE mapped from the 4G-GUTI as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5] in the 5GS mobile identity IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message. If the UE operating in the single-registration mode holds a
valid 4G-GUTI and a valid 5G-GUTI, it shall include in the 5GS mobile identity
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message either 5G-GUTI mapped from 4G-GUTI or
5G-GUTI according to the system (i.e. either EPS or 5GS), where the last
successful EPS attach, tracking area updating or registration procedure was
performed.
If the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE shall include the
UE status IE with the EMM registration status set to \"UE is in EMM-REGISTERED
state\". If the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall include the 5G-GUTI in
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. The UE operating in the dual-registration
mode shall not use 4G-GUTI even if the UE has a valid 4G-GUTI.
If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include the last
visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the UE supports network slicing, the UE shall include the requested NSSAI
containing the S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the slice(s) to which the UE wishes
to register in the REGISTRATION REQUEST. If the UE has allowed NSSAI or
configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the requested NSSAI shall be either:
\- the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as described
below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or
\- the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as described
below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or
\- the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as described
below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for which no
corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those are neither in
the temporarily rejected NSSAI for the current registration are nor in the
permanently rejected NSSAI for the current registration area.
Otherwise if the UE has neither allowed NSSAI nor configured NSSAI for the
current PLMN, the UE shall not include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.
The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one
or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the current PLMN, if:
\- the S-NSSAI is neither in the temporarily rejected NSSAI for the current
registration area nor in the permanently rejected NSSAI for the current
registration area; or
\- the S-NSSAI was not previously added by the UE in a requested NSSAI.
The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one or
more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.
NOTE 1: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed NSSAI to
be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation.
NOTE 2: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot exceed
eight.
If the UE wishes to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after
the completion of the initial registration procedure, it shall set the
\"follow-on request pending\" indication to 1.
If the UE supports S1 mode, the UE shall set the S1 mode bit to \"S1 mode
supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Figure 8.5.2.1.2.2.1: Registration procedure for initial registration
###### 8.5.2.1.2.3 5GMM common procedure initiation
The network may initiate 5GMM common procedures, e.g. the identification,
authentication and security procedures during the registration procedure,
depending on the information received in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
During a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to
\"emergency registration\", if the AMF is configured to support emergency
registration for unauthenticated SUPIs, the AMF may choose to skip the
authentication procedure even if no 5GS security context is available and
proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure.
###### 8.5.2.1.2.4 Initial registration accepted by the network
During a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to
\"emergency registration\", the AMF shall not check for mobility and access
restrictions, regional restrictions or subscription restrictions, when
processing the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the initial registration request is accepted by the network, the AMF shall
send a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE and start timer T3550.
The AMF shall assign and include a TAI list as a registration area the UE is
registered to in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE, upon receiving a
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall delete its old TAI list and store the
received TAI list.
The 5G-GUTI reallocation may be part of the initial registration procedure.
When the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes the SUPI or PEI, or the AMF
considers the 5G-GUTI provided by the UE is invalid, or the 5G-GUTI provided
by the UE was assigned by another AMF, the AMF shall allocate a new 5G-GUTI to
the UE. The AMF shall include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the new
assigned 5G-GUTI together with the assigned TAI list. In this case the AMF
shall shall start timer T3550 and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED
as described in subclause 8.1.4.2.3.3.
If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contained a 5G-GUTI, the UE shall return a
REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the AMF to acknowledge the received 5G-GUTI.
Upon receiving a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message, the AMF shall stop timer T3550
and change to state 5GMM-REGISTERED. The 5G-GUTI, if sent in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message, shall be considered as valid.
The AMF shall include the allowed NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT if the UE
included the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF
allows one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI. The AMF may also include
rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Rejected NSSAI contains
S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the Request NSSAI but rejected by the network
associated with rejection cause(s).
The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message takes
the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected NSSAI:
\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the permanently rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN as specified in subclause 13.2.2 and not attempt to use this
S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC containing
the USIM is removed.
\"S-NSSAI temporarily not available in the current PLMN\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the temporarily rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN as specified in subclause 13.2.2 and consider this S-NSSAI is
temporarily not available in the current PLMN.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI temporarily
not available in this PLMN\" is needed.
\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) with the registration area(s) in the
permanently rejected NSSAI for this PLMN as specified in subclause 13.2.2 and
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the present registration area until
switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current registration area or
the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
\"S-NSSAI temporarily not available in the current registration area\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the tempararily rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN and registration area combination as specified in subclause
13.2.2 and consider the S-NSSAI is temporarily not available in this current
registration area.
Editor\'s note: Further UE action is FFS when the rejection cause is \"S-NSSAI
temporarily not available in the registration area\".
The AMF may include in the allowed NSSAI one or more new S-NSSAIs each of
which is associated with an S-NSSAI contained in the requested NSSAI.
If the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs (containing one or more S-NSSAIs
each of which may be associated with a new S-NSSAI) marked as default are
available, the AMF shall put the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in
the allowed NSSAI of the REGISTRAION ACCEPT message.
If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT contains the allowed NSSAI, then the UE shall store
the included allowed NSSAI together with the PLMN identity of the registered
PLMN and the registration area as specified in subclause 13.2.2.
If the UE included S1 mode supported indication in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, the AMF supporting intersystem change with EPS shall set the dual-
registration supported IE to either:
\- \"dual-registration not supported\" if the AMF supports interworking
procedures with N26 interface; or
\- \"dual-registration supported\" if the AMF supports interworking procedures
without N26 interface.
The UE shall operate in the mode for intersystem change with EPS as follows:
1) if the dual-registration supported IE is set to \"dual-registration not
supported\", the UE shall operate in single-registration mode;
2) if the dual-registration support IE is set to \"dual-registration
supported\" and the UE supports dual-registration mode,, the UE shall operate
in dual-registration mode; or
3) if the dual-registration support IE is set to \"dual-registration
supported\" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall
operate in single-registration mode,
The UE shall treat the received dual-registration supported IE for intersystem
change with EPS as valid in the entire PLMN.
The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS
voice over PS session or emergency services, in the 5G network feature support
information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS session capability, the
IMS voice over PS session indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The
upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account when
selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an
emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS session
indicator and the emergency service support indicator into account for the
access domain selection.
Editor\'s note: Further details on initial registration accepted by the
network are FFS.
If the UE has indicated \"follow-on request pending\" in REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, the AMF shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection
after the completion of the registration procedure.
###### 8.5.2.1.2.5 Initial registration not accepted by the network
If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network, the AMF
shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate
5GMM cause value.
If the initial registration request request is rejected due to general NAS
level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.
The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause value
received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
#xx (N1 mode not allowed);
The UE capable of S1 mode shall disable the N1 mode radio capabilities (see
subclause 8.2.6).
#3 (Illegal UE);
#6 (Illegal ME);
#8 (5GS services not allowed); or
#22 (Congestion);
If the T3346 value IE is present in the REGISTRATION REJECT message and the
value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall
proceed as described below; otherwise it shall be considered as an abnormal
case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in subclause
8.5.2.1.2.7.
The UE shall abort the initial registration procedure, set the 5GS update
status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-
REGISTRATION.
The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.
If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start
timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.
If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP
TS 24.008 [12].
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The initial registration procedure is started if still
needed when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.
Editor\'s note: Further details on initial registration not accepted by the
network are FFS.
###### 8.5.2.1.2.6 Initial registration for emergency services not accepted by
the network
Upon receiving the REGISTRATION REJECT message including 5GMM cause #5 \"PEI
not accepted\", the UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-SUPI.
Upon receiving the REGISTRATION REJECT message including 5GMM cause value
which is not #5 \"PEI not accepted\", the UE shall perform the actions as
described in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.5 with the following addition: the UE shall
inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure.
NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting implementation specific
mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 can result in the
emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.
If the initial registration request for emergency services fails due to
abnormal cases, the UE shall perform the actions as described in subclause
8.5.2.1.2.7 and inform the upper layers of the failure to access the network
or the failure of the procedure.
NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting other implementation
specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 can result in
the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.
In a shared network, upon receiving the REGISTRATION REJECT message, the UE
shall perform the actions as described in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.5, and shall:
a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or
NOTE 1: The upper layers may request implementation specific mechanisms, e.g.
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13] that can result in the emergency
call being attempted to another IP-CAN.
b) attempt to perform a PLMN selection in the shared network and initiate an
initial registration for emergency services to the selected PLMN.
In a shared network, if the initial registration request for emergency
services fails due to abnormal cases, the UE shall perform the actions as
described in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.7 and shall:
a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or
NOTE 2: The upper layers may request implementation specific mechanisms, e.g.
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13] that can result in the emergency
call being attempted to another IP-CAN.
b) attempt the initial registration for emergency services to another PLMN in
the shared network.
###### 8.5.2.1.2.7 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Timer T3346 is running
The UE shall not start the initial registration procedure unless:
\- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN; or
\- the UE needs to initial registration for emergency services
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.
NOTE 1: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate an
initial registration procedure while timer T3346 is running independent on
whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful
case.
###### 8.5.2.1.2.8 Abnormal cases on the network side
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases in the network are FFS.
##### 8.5.2.1.3 Registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration
update
###### 8.5.2.1.3.1 General
This procedure can be used by a UE for mobility and periodic registration
update for 5GS services.
When the UE initiates the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update, the UE shall indicate \"mobility registration update\" or
\"periodic registration update\" respectively in the 5GS registration type IE.
The periodic registration updating procedure is controlled in the UE by timer
T3512. When timer T3512 expires, the periodic registration area updating
procedure is started. Start and reset of timer T3512 is described in subclause
8.9.
###### 8.5.2.1.3.2 Mobility and periodic registration update initiation
The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the mobility and periodic
registration updating procedure by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to
the AMF,
a) when the UE detects entering a tracking area that is not in the list of
tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the AMF; or
b) when the periodic registration updating timer Te expires; or
c) when requested by CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND.
Editor\'s note: Further cases for initiation of mobility and periodic
registration update are FFS.
After sending the REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF the UE shall start
timer T3510. If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer
T3502. If timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.
If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include the last
visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS
mobile identity IE.
If the UE is initiating the mobility registration update procedure, the UE may
include the uplink data status IE to indicate which PDU session(s) have
pending user data to be sent. If the UE is located outside the LADN service
area, the UE shall not include the PDU session for LADN in the uplink data
status IE.
When the registration procedure is initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE may
include a PDU session status IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message,
indicating which PDU session contexts are active in the UE.
If the UE operating in the single-registration mode performs mobility from S1
mode to N1 mode, the UE shall indicate \"mobility registration update\" in the
5GS registration type IE and shall include the UE status IE with the EMM
registration status set to \"UE is in EMM-REGISTERED state\" in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message. In this case, if the UE holds a valid 4G-GUTI,
the UE shall include the 5G-GUTI IE mapped from the 4G-GUTI as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 [5] in the 5GS mobility identity IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message. The UE may include the PDU session status IE in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message indicating the status of the PDU session(s) mapped during the
intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode from the PDN connection(s) for
which the EPS indicated that interworking to 5GS is supported, if any (see
subclause 11.2.4).
If the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode and the UE has a valid
5G-GUTI, the UE shall include the 5G-GUTI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The UE operating in the dual-registration mode shall not use 4G-GUTI even if
the UE has a valid 4G-GUTI.
If the UE supports network slicing, the UE shall include the requested NSSAI
containing the S-NSSAIs corresponding to the slices to which the UE wishes to
register in the REGISTRATION REQUEST. If the UE has allowed NSSAI or
configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the requested NSSAI shall be either:
\- the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as described
below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or
\- the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as described
below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or
\- the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as described
below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for which no
corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and that were not
previously rejected with \"S-NSSAI not available in this PLMN\" or \"S-NSSAI
not available in this registration area\"(see subclause 8.5.2.1.2.4 and
subclause 8.5.2.1.3.4) by the network for the present registration area.
Otherwise if the UE has neither allowed NSSAI nor configured NSSAI for the
current PLMN, the UE shall not include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.
The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one
or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to this PLMN, if:
\- the S-NSSAI was not previously rejected with \"S-NSSAI not available in
this PLMN\" (see subclause 8.5.2.1.2.4 and subclause 8.5.2.1.3.4) by the
network for the present registration area; or
\- the S-NSSAI was not previously added by the UE in a requested NSSAI.
The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one or
more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for this PLMN.
NOTE 1: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed NSSAI to
be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation.
NOTE 2: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot exceed
eight.
If the UE wishes to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after
the completion of the mobility and periodic registration updating registration
procedure, it shall set the \"follow-on request pending\" indication to 1.
Figure 8.5.2.1.3.2.1: Registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update
###### 8.5.2.1.3.3 5GMM common procedure initiation
The network may initiate 5GMM common procedures, e.g. the identification,
authentication and security procedures during the registration procedure,
depending on the information received in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
###### 8.5.2.1.3.4 Mobility and periodic registration update accepted by the
network
If the registration update request has been accepted by the network, the AMF
shall send a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE. If the AMF assigns a new
5G-GUTI for the UE, a 5G-GUTI shall be included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message. In this case, the AMF shall start timer T3550.
The AMF may include a new TAI list for the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message. The UE, upon receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall delete
its old TAI list and store the received TAI list. If there is no TAI list
received, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid.
If the AMF assigns a new 5G-GUTI for the UE, a 5G-GUTI shall be included in
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. In this case the AMF shall start timer T3550
and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause
8.1.4.2.3.3.
If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contained a 5G-GUTI, the UE shall return a
REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the AMF to acknowledge the received 5G-GUTI.
Upon receiving a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message, the AMF shall stop timer T3550
and change to state 5GMM-REGISTERED. The 5G-GUTI, if sent in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message, shall be considered as valid.
The AMF shall include the allowed NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT if the UE
included the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF
allows one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI. The AMF may also include
rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Rejected NSSAI contains
S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the Request NSSAI but rejected by the network
associated with rejection cause(s).
The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message takes
the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected NSSAI:
\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the permanently rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN as specified in subclause 13.2.2 and not attempt to use this
S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC containing
the USIM is removed.
\"S-NSSAI temporarily not available in the current PLMN\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the temporarily rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN as specified in subclause 13.2.2 and consider this S-NSSAI is
temporarily not available in the current PLMN.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI temporarily
not available in this PLMN\" is needed.
\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the permanently rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN and registration area combination as specified in subclause
13.2.2 and not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current registration area
or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
\"S-NSSAI temporarily not available in the current registration area\"
The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the tempararily rejected NSSAI for
the current PLMN and registration area combination as specified in subclause
13.2.2 and consider this S-NSSAI(s) is(are) temporarily not available in the
current registration area.
Editor\'s note: Further UE action is FFS when the rejection cause is\"S-NSSAI
temporarily not available in the registration area\".
If the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are available,
the AMF shall put the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the allowed
NSSAI of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT contains the allowed NSSAI, then the UE shall store
the included allowed NSSAI together with the PLMN identity of the registered
PLMN and the registration area as specified in subclause 13.2.2. If the UE has
one or more PDU session contexts associated with S-NSSAI(s) not included in
the received allowed NSSAI, the UE shall locally release all such PDU session
context(s).
The AMF may include in the allowed NSSAI one or more new S-NSSAIs each of
which is associated with an S-NSSAI contained in the requested NSSAI.
If the uplink data status IE is included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message,
the AMF shall:
\- indicate the SMF to re-activate the user plane for the corresponding PDU
session; and
\- include PDU session reactivation result IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message to indicate the user plane reactivation result of the PDU sessions the
UE requested to re-activate.
If the uplink data status IE is not included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, the AMF may indicate the SMF to re-activate the user plane for the
PDU sessions.
If a PDU session status IE is included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message,
the AMF shall:
\- release all those PDU session locally (without peer-to-peer signalling
between the network and the UE) which are in 5GSM state PDU SESSION ACTIVE on
the AMF side, but are indicated by the UE as being in 5GSM state PDU SESSION
INACTIVE; and
\- include a PDU session status IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to
indicate which PDU sessions are active in the AMF.
If the AMF needs to initiate PDU session status synchronization the AMF shall
include a PDU session status IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to indicate
the UE which PDU sessions are active in the AMF.
The AMF may include the LADN information in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as
described in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.4.
If the AMF does not include the LADN information in the REGISTATION ACCEPT
message during mobility registration update procedure, the UE shall delete its
old LADN information.
If the PDU session status IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message,
the UE shall release all those PDU sessions locally (without peer-to-peer
signalling between the network and the UE) which are in 5GSM state PDU SESSION
ACTIVE on the UE side, but are indicated by the AMF as being in 5GSM state PDU
SESSION INACTIVE.
The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS
voice over PS session, in the 5G network feature support information element.
In a UE with IMS voice over PS session capability, the IMS voice over PS
session indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take
the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account when selecting the access
domain for voice sessions or calls.
Editor\'s note: Further details on mobility and periodic registration update
accepted by the network are FFS.
If the UE has indicated \"follow-on request pending\" in REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, the AMF shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection
after the completion of the registration procedure.
If the UE included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the UE status
information IE with the EMM registration status set to \"UE in EMM-REGISTERED
state\" and the AMF does not support N26 interface, the AMF shall operate as
described in subclause 8.5.2.1.2.4.
###### 8.5.2.1.3.5 Mobility and periodic registration update not accepted by
the network
If the mobility and periodic registration update request cannot be accepted by
the network, the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE
including an appropriate 5GMM cause value.
The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause value
received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
#xx (N1 mode not allowed);
The UE capable of S1 mode shall disable the N1 mode radio capabilities (see
subclause 8.2.6).
#3 (Illegal UE);
#6 (Illegal ME); or
#8 (5GS services not allowed) or
#22 (Congestion);
If the T3346 value IE is present in the REGISTRATION REJECT message and the
value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall
proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be considered as an abnormal
case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in subclause
8.5.2.1.3.6.
The UE shall abort the mobility and periodic registration update procedure. If
the rejected request was not for initiating a PDU session for emergency
services, the UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and change
to state 5GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION-UPDATE.
The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.
If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start
timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.
If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP
TS 24.008 [12].
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The mobility and periodic registration update procedure
is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.
Editor\'s note: Further details on mobility and periodic registration update
not accepted by the network are FFS.
###### 8.5.2.1.3.6 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Timer T3346 is running
The UE shall not start the mobility and periodic registration update procedure
unless:
\- the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode;
\- the UE received a paging;
\- the UE receives a NOTIFICATION message over non-3GPP access when the UE is
in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP
access;
\- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN; or
\- the UE has a PDU session for emergency services established or is
establishing a PDU session for emergency services
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.
NOTE 1: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a
mobility and periodic registration update procedure while timer T3346 is
running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case
or a non successful case.
###### 8.5.2.1.3.7 Abnormal cases on the network side
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases in the network are FFS.
#### 8.5.2.2 De-registration procedure
##### 8.5.2.2.1 General
The de-registration procedure is used:
\- by the UE to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is
registered over 3GPP access;;
\- by the UE to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP
access, or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses;
\- by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS services
over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access;
\- by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS services
over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access, or both when the UE is registered in the
same PLMN over both accesses; and
\- by the network to inform the UE to re-register to the network.
The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type shall be
invoked by the UE:
\- if the UE is switched off.
The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type shall be
invoked by the network:
\- if the network informs whether the UE should re-register to the network.
The de-registration procedure with appropriate access type shall be invoked by
the UE:
\- if the UE wishes to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the
UE is registered over 3GPP access; or
\- the UE wishes to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP
access, or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses.
If the de-registration procedure is triggered due to USIM removal, the UE
shall indicate \"switch off\" in the de-registration type IE.
If the de-registration procedure is requested by the UDM for a UE that has PDU
sessions for emergency services, the AMF shall not send a DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message to the UE.
If the de-registration procedure for 5GS services is performed, the PDU
sessions, if any, for this particular UE are released locally without peer-to-
peer signalling between the UE and the network.
The UE is allowed to initiate the de-registration procedure even if the timer
T3346 is running.
##### 8.5.2.2.2 UE-initiated de-registration procedure
###### 8.5.2.2.2.1 UE-initiated de-registration procedure initiation
The de-registration procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message (see example in figure 8.5.2.2.2.1.1). The De-
registration type IE included in the message indicates whether the de-
registration procedure is due to a \"switch off\" or not. The access type
included in the message indicates whether the de-registration procedure is:
for 5GS services over 3GPP access, or
for 5GS services over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access when the UE is
registered in the same PLMN over both accesses.
If the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall populate the mobile identity IE
with the valid 5G-GUTI. If the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall
populate the mobile identity IE with its SUPI.
If the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI and it does not have a valid SUPI,
then the UE shall populate the mobile identity IE with its PEI.
If the de-registration request is not due to switch off and the UE is in the
state 5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, timer Txa shall be started
in the UE after the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent. The UE shall
enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.
If the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall try for a period of 5 seconds to
send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. During this period, the UE may be
switched off as soon as the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent.
Figure 8.5.2.2.2.1.1: UE-initiated de-registration procedure
###### 8.5.2.2.2.2 UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS
services over 3GPP access
When the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received by the AMF, the AMF shall
send a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE, if the De-registration type IE
does not indicate \"switch off\". Otherwise, the procedure is completed when
the AMF receives the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST indicates that the de-
registration procedure is for 3GPP access, the AMF shall trigger the SMF to
release the PDU session context(s) established over 3GPP access, if any,
locally for this UE without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the
SMF. The UE shall release the PDU session context(s) established over 3GPP
access, if any, locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the
SMF. The UE is marked as inactive in the AMF for 5GS services for 3GPP access.
The AMF shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for 3GPP access.
The UE, when receiving the DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall stop timer
Txa. Furthermore, if the UE supports N1 mode only then:
\- If the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS
services, then the UE shall enter the 5GMM-NULL state for 3GPP access.
\- Otherwise, the UE shall enter the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state for 3GPP access.
###### 8.5.2.2.2.3 UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS
services over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
The description for UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS
services over 3GPP access as specified in subclause 8.5.2.2.2.2 shall be
followed. In addition, the following description for de-registration over
non-3GPP access applies.
If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST indicates that the de-
registration procedure is for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access when the UE
is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses, the AMF shall trigger SMF
to release the PDU session context(s) established over non-3GPP access, if
any, locally for this UE without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and
the SMF. The UE shall release the PDU session context(s) established over
non-3GPP access, if any, locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the
UE and the SMF. The UE is marked as inactive in the AMF for 5GS services for
non-3GPP access. The AMF shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over non-3GPP
access.
If the UE supports N1 mode only then:
\- If the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS
services, then the UE shall enter the 5GMM-NULL state for non-3GPP access.
\- Otherwise, the UE shall enter the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state for non-3GPP
access.

##### 8.5.2.2.3 Network-initiated de-registration procedure
###### 8.5.2.2.3.1 Network-initiated de-registration procedure initiation
The network initiates the de-registration procedure by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE (see example in figure
8.5.2.2.3.1.1).
NOTE: If the AMF performs a local de-registration, it will inform the UE with
a 5GMM messages (e.g. SERVICE REJECT or REGISTRATION REJECT) with 5GMM cause
#10 \"implicitly de-registered\" only when the UE initiates a 5GMM procedure.
The network may include a 5GMM cause IE to specify the reason for the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The network shall start timer T3522. The
network shall indicate whether re-registration is needed or not in the De-
registration type IE. The network shall also indicate via the access type
whether the de-registration procedure is for 3GPP access, or for both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access when the UE is registered in the same PLMN for both
accesses. The network shall release the PDU session context(s) over the
indicated access(es), if any, for the UE locally and enter state 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.

### 8.5.3 5GMM connection management procedures
#### 8.5.3.1 Service request procedure
##### 8.5.3.1.1 General
The purpose of the service request procedure is to change the 5GMM mode from
5GMM-IDLE to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, and/or to request establishment of user-
plane radio resources for PDU sessions which are activated without radio
resources. In latter case, the 5GMM mode can be the 5GMM-IDLE mode or the
5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access if the UE requires radio resources. This
procedure is used when:
\- the network has downlink signalling pending over 3GPP access and the UE is
in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access;
\- the network has downlink signalling pending over non-3GPP access, the UE is
in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
over 3GPP access;
\- the UE has uplink signalling pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in
5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access;
\- the network has downlink user data pending over 3GPP access and the UE is
in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access;
\- the network has downlink user data pending over non-3GPP access, the UE is
in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
over 3GPP access;
\- the UE has user data pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE or
5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access; or
\- the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, receives an indication from
the lower layers of non-3GPP access, that the access stratum connection is
established between UE and network.
This procedure shall not be used for initiating user data transfer or PDU
session related signalling related to a PDU session for LADN when the UE is
located outside the LADN service area.
The service request procedure is initiated by the UE, however, it can be
triggered by the network by means of:
\- the paging procedure (see subclause 8.5.3.2) for the transfer of downlink
signalling or user data pending over 3GPP access to a UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode
over 3GPP access;
\- the paging procedure (see subclause 8.5.3.2) for the transfer of downlink
signalling or user data pending over non-3GPP access to a UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode
over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access;
\- the notification procedure (see subclause 8.5.3.3) for the transfer of
downlink signalling or user data pending over non-3GPP access to a UE in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access; or
\- the notification procedure (see subclause 8.5.3.3) for the transfer of
downlink signalling or user data pending over 3GPP access to a UE in 5GMM-IDLE
mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access.
NOTE: In case the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access and downlink signalling or user data
pending over 3GPP access needs to be transferred, the AMF can trigger either
the notification procedure or the paging procedure based on implementation.
The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:
a) the UE, in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, receives a paging request from
the network;
b) the UE, in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access, receives a notification
from the network;
c) the UE, in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, has uplink signalling pending;
d) the UE, in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, has uplink user data pending;
e) the UE, in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access, has user data pending due
to no user-plane radio resources established for PDU session(s) used for user
data transport;
f) the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, receives an indication from
the lower layers of non-3GPP access, that the access stratum connection is
established between UE and network; or
g) the UE, in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, receives a notification from
the network when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access.
Figure 8.5.3.1.1.1: Service Request procedure
##### 8.5.3.1.2 Service request procedure initiation
The UE initiates the service request procedure by sending a SERVICE REQUEST
message to the AMF and starts timer T3517.
For case a in subclause 8.5.3.1.1:
\- if the paging request includes an indication for non-3GPP access type, the
Allowed PDU session status IE shall be included in the SERVICE REQUEST message
to indicate the PDU session(s) that the UE allows to be re-activate over 3GPP
access;
\- if the UE has uplink user data pending to be sent, the Uplink data status
IE shall be included in the SERVICE REQUEST message to indicate the PDU
session(s) the UE has pending user data to be sent; or
\- otherwise, the Uplink data status IE shall not be included in the SERVICE
REQUEST message.
For case b in subclause 8.5.3.1.1, the Allowed PDU session status IE shall be
included in the SERVICE REQUEST message to indicate the PDU session(s) that
the UE allows to re-activate over 3GPP access.
For case c and f in subclause 8.5.3.1.1, the Uplink data status IE shall not
be included in the SERVICE REQUEST message.
For cases d and e in subclause 8.5.3.1.1, the Uplink data status IE shall be
included in the SERVICE REQUEST message to indicate the PDU session(s) the UE
has pending user data to be sent.
For case g in subclause 8.5.3.1.1, if the UE has uplink user data pending to
be sent, the Uplink data status IE shall be included in the SERVICE REQUEST
message to indicate the PDU session(s) the UE has pending user data to be
sent.
The PDU session status information element may be included in the SERVICE
REQUEST message to indicate the PDU session(s) available in the UE. If the PDU
session status information element is included in the SERVICE REQUEST message,
then the AMF shall release all those PDU session contexts locally (without
peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the network) which are in active on
the AMF side, but are indicated by the UE as being inactive.
##### 8.5.3.1.3 Common procedure initiation
Upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST message, the AMF may initiate the common
procedures e.g. the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure or the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
##### 8.5.3.1.4 Service request procedure accepted by the network
For cases a, b, c, d, e and g in subclause 8.5.3.1.1, the UE shall treat the
reception of the SERVICE ACCEPT message as successful completion of the
procedure and stop timer T3517 and enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.
Editor\'s note: For cases a, b, d, e and g in subclause 8.5.3.1.1, whether the
indication from the lower layers that the user-plane radio resources are set
up needs to be considered as a successful completion of the procedure is FFS.
If the AMF needs to initiate PDU session status synchronization or a PDU
session status IE was included in the SERVICE REQUEST message, the AMF shall
include a PDU session status IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message to indicate
which PDU sessions are active in the AMF. If the PDU session status
information element is included in the SERVICE ACCEPT message, then the UE
shall release all those PDU sessions locally (without peer-to-peer signalling
between the network and the UE) which are in active on the UE side, but are
indicated by the AMF as being inactive.
The AMF may include the rejection cause in the SERVICE ACCEPT message if the
UE initiated the service request procedure for a PDU Session corresponding to
a LADN when the UE is located outside the LADN service area. The rejection
cause indicates the PDU session is not activated due to LADN not available in
the PDU session reactivation result IE.
If the Uplink data status IE is included in the SERVICE REQUEST message, the
AMF shall:
\- indicate the SMF to re-activate the user plane for the corresponding PDU
session contexts; and
\- include the PDU session reactivation result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT
message to indicate the user plane reactivation result of the PDU sessions the
UE requested to re-activate.
If the Allowed PDU session status IE is included in the SERVICE REQUEST
message, the AMF shall:
\- indicate the SMF to re-activate the user plane for the corresponding PDU
session contexts allowed to be re-activated over 3GPP access and have
indicated pending downlink data; and
\- notify the SMF that have indicated pending downlink data, that reactivation
of the corresponding PDU Session contexts user plane cannot be performed if
not allowed to be re-activated over 3GPP access; and
\- include the PDU session reactivation result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT
message to indicate the successfully reactivated PDU session contexts.
##### 8.5.3.1.5 Service request procedure not accepted by the network
If the service request cannot be accepted, the network shall return a SERVICE
REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause value and stop
timer T3517.
If the AMF needs to initiate PDU session status synchronisation or a PDU
session status IE was included in the SERVICE REQUEST message, the AMF shall
include a PDU session status IE in the SERVICE REJECT message to indicate
which PDU sessions are active in the AMF. If the PDU session status IE is
included in the SERVICE REJECT message, then the UE shall deactivate all those
PDU sessions locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the network and
the UE) which are active on the UE side, but are indicated by the AMF as being
inactive.
On receipt of the SERVICE REJECT message, if the message is integrity
protected, the UE shall stop timer Tx if running. If the SERVICE REJECT
message was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard
the message.
If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to
general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall
set the 5GMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off
timer T3346.
The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause value
received in the SERVICE REJECT message.
#xx (N1 mode not allowed);
The UE capable of S1 mode shall disable the N1 mode radio capabilities and
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. The UE shall re-enable the
N1 mode radio capabilities when:
\- the UE performs PLMN selection; and
\- the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.
#xy (Restricted service area):
The UE shall perform the mobility registration update procedure.
Editor\'s note: Whether the existing cause value(s) can be used for this
purpose is FFS.
#3 (Illegal UE);
#6 (Illegal ME); or
#8 (5GS services not allowed).
Editor\'s note: Further details on UE actions upon receipt of the 5GMM cause
value are FFS.
#10 (Implicitly de-registered).
Editor\'s note: Further details on UE actions upon receipt of the 5GMM cause
value are FFS.
#22 (Congestion);
If the T3346 value IE is present in the SERVICE REJECT message and the value
indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall
proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be considered as an abnormal
case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in subclause
8.5.3.1.6.
If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDU session for emergency
services, the UE shall abort the service request procedure and enter state
5GMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3517 if still running.
The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.
If the SERVICE REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start timer
T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.
If the SERVICE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start
timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP TS
24.008 [12].
For all other cases the UE stays in the current serving cell and applies
normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure is started, if
still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.
##### 8.5.3.1.6 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Timer T3346 is running
The UE shall not start the service request procedure unless:
\- the UE receives a paging;
\- the UE receives a NOTIFICATION message over non-3GPP access when the UE is
in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP
access;
\- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11--15 in selected PLMN;
\- the UE has a PDU session for emergency services established or is
establishing a PDU session for emergency services;
If the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE stays in the current serving cell and
applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure is
started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.
##### 8.5.3.1.7 Abnormal cases on the network side
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases on the network side are FFS.
#### 8.5.3.2 Paging procedure
##### 8.5.3.2.1 General
The paging procedure is used by the network to request the establishment of an
NAS signalling connection to the UE. The paging procedure is also used by the
network to request the UE to re-activate the user plane radio resources of PDU
sessions for downlink user data transport. Another purpose of the paging
procedure is to request the UE to re-activate the PDU session(s) associated
with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access.
Additionally, the network can use the paging procedure to initiate the mobile
terminating SMS.
##### 8.5.3.2.2 Paging for 5GS services
###### 8.5.3.2.2.1 General
The network shall initiate the paging procedure for 5GS services when NAS
signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE in 5GMM-IDLE
mode (see example in figure 8.5.3.2.2.1).
Figure 8.5.3.2.2.1.1: Paging procedure
To initiate the procedure the 5GMM entity in the AMF requests the lower layer
to start paging and shall start timer T3513. Upon reception of a paging
indication, the UE shall initiate a service request procedure to respond to
the paging (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]).
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the paging procedure is performed depending on
different UE Identity of the paging message.
If downlink signalling or user data is pending to be sent over non-3GPP
access, the 5GMM entity in the AMF shall indicate the lower layer that the
paging is due to signalling or user data associated to non-3GPP access.
Upon reception of a paging indication, the UE shall stop the timer T3346, if
running, and shall initiate the service request procedure over 3GPP access as
specified in subclauses 8.5.3.1.
The network shall stop timer T3513 for the paging procedure when an integrity-
protected response is received from the UE and successfully integrity checked
by the network. If the response received is not integrity protected, or the
integrity check is unsuccessful, timer T3513 for the paging procedure shall be
kept running.
Upon expiry of timer T3513, the network may reinitiate paging.
If the network, while waiting for a response to the paging sent without paging
priority, receives downlink signalling or downlink data associated with
priority user-plane radio resources for PDU sessions, the network shall stop
the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413), and then
initiate the paging procedure with paging priority.
###### 8.5.3.2.2.2 Abnormal cases on the network side
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases on the network side are FFS.
###### 8.5.3.2.2.3 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Paging message received with access type set to non-3GPP access while the
UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode overnon-3GPP access.
\- The UE shall not respond to paging message.
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases on the UE side are FFS.
#### 8.5.3.3 Notification procedure
##### 8.5.3.3.1 General
The notification procedure is used by the network:
a) to request the UE, by sending the NOTIFICATION message over 3GPP access, to
re-activate the PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP
access when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access and in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access; or
b) to request the UE, by sending the NOTIFICATION message over non-3GPP
access, to re-activate the PDU session(s) associated with 3GPP access over
3GPP access when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access and in
5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access.
##### 8.5.3.3.2 Notification procedure initiation
The network shall initiate the notification procedure by sending the
NOTIFICATION message to the UE and start timer Tx (see example in figure
8.5.3.3.2.1).
For a) in subclause 8.5.3.3.1, the NOTIFICATION message is sent from the
network to the UE via 3GPP access.
For b) in subclause 8.5.3.3.1, the NOTIFICATION message is sent from the
network to the UE via non-3GPP access.
Figure 8.5.3.3.2.1: Notification procedure
Upon reception of NOTIFICATION message, the UE may initiate a service request
procedure over 3GPP access as specified in subclauses 8.5.3.1.
Upon reception of NOTIFICATION message:
\- For case a) in subclause 8.5.3.3.1, if the UE decides not to initiate a
service request procedure over 3GPP access based on UE policy;
\- For case b) in subclause 8.5.3.3.1, if the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-
CELL-AVAILABLE state or 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH state; or
then the UE shall respond with NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message indicating
failure to re-activate the user plane radio resources of PDU sessions.
Editor\'s note: Message coding for NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message is FFS.
For case b) in subclause 8.5.3.3.1, upon reception of NOTIFICATION message,
the UE shall stop the timer T3346, if running.
##### 8.5.3.3.3 Notification procedure completion
Upon reception of SERVICE REQUEST message, the network shall stop T3565 and

See subclause 9.9.3.33 in 3GPP TS 24.301 [15].
### 8.7.18 Service area list
The purpose of the _Service area list_ information element is to transfer a
list of allowed tracking areas for an allowed area or a list of non-allowed
tracking areas for a non-allowed area from the network to the UE.
The coding of the information element allows combining different types of
lists. The lists of type \"00\" and \"01\" allow a more compact encoding, when
the different TAIs are sharing the PLMN identity. The lists of type \"11\"
indicates all TAIs in the PLMN are allowed area.
The _Service area list_ information element is coded as shown in figure
8.7.18.1, figure 8.7.18.2, figure 8.7.18.3, figure 8.7.18.4, figure 8.7.18.5

### 8.7.48 Hash~AMF~
The purpose of the Hash~AMF~ information element is to transfer a 64-bit hash
value to the UE so the UE can check the AMF calculated value against the value
locally calculated by the UE to determine whether the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message sent by the UE has been modified.
The Hash~AMF~ information element is coded as shown in figure 8.7.48.1 and
table 8.7.48.1.
The Hash~AMF~ is a type 3 information element with a length of 9 octets.

## 8.8 3GPP specific coding information defined within present document
### 8.8.1 Serving network name (SNN)
The serving network name (SNN) is used in the network name field of the
AT_KDF_INPUT attribute defined in _IETF RFC 5448_ [35].
SNN shall take the generic format of an octet string without terminating null
characters.
SNN is of maximum length of 1020 octets.
SNN consists of SNN-prefix and SNN-value, delimited by a colon.
SNN-value identifies the serving PLMN.
MCC and MNC in the SNN-PLMN-ID are MCC and MNC of the serving PLMN. If the MNC
of the serving PLMN has two digits, then a zero is added at the beginning.
ABNF syntax of SNN is specified in table 8.8.1.1
Table 8.8.1.1: ABNF syntax of SNN

in lower case
SNN-org-string = %x6f.72.67 ; \"org\" in lower case
NOTE: SNN-prefix allows for distinguishing of ANID specified in 3GPP TS 24.302
[16] and SNN as either of SNN or ANID can be carried in the AT_KDF_INPUT
attribute.
EXAMPLE: If PLMN ID contains MCC = 234 and MNC = 15, SNN is
5G:mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org.
Editors\' note: 3GPP TS 24.302 [16] needs to be extended so that ANID-prefix
\"5G\" points to the SNN.

# 9 5GS session management
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
## 9.1 General
The 5GS architecture reference model defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] shows that
the N11 reference point is used to connect the core access and mobility
management function (AMF) and the session management function (SMF). The SMF
handles the session management part of the NAS signalling exchanged with the
UE. 3GPP TS 23.502 [10] specifies that session management procedures (e.g.,
PDU session establishment) are not performed between the AMF and the SMF but
the UE and the SMF.
CT1 will specify the control-plane 5G session management (5GSM) towards the UE
and the SMF. This includes the procedures, messages, information elements and
the necessary error handling for the session management part of the NAS
signalling.
## 9.2 Overview
### 9.2.1 PDU session types
The following PDU Session types are supported:
\- IPv4;
\- IPv6;
\- Ethernet (EtherType as defined in IEEE 802.3); and
\- Unstructured.
IP Address Allocation for IPv4 and IPv6 PDU session types is described in
subclause 9.3.
Neither a MAC nor an IP address is allocated by the 5GC to the UE for Ethernet
PDU session type.
### 9.2.2 PDU session management
The SMF is responsible for the session management functions to provide the PDU
connectivity service to the UE via the SM signalling between UE and SMF. The
session management procedures includes:
a) the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure;
b) the PDU session establishment authentication and authorization procedure;
c) the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure;
d) the network-requested PDU session modification procedure; and
e) the UE-requested PDU session release procedure; and
f) the network-requested PDU session release procedure.
A UE may establish multiple PDU sessions, to the same data network or to
different data networks, via 3GPP and via and Non-3GPP access networks at the
same time.
The session management messages between UE and SMF are transferred via AMF as
specified in subclause 9.6.
### 9.2.3 Local area data network
The UE can receive the Local area data network (LADN) information consisting
of LADN DNNs and LADN service area (a set of tracking areas that belong to the
current registration area) information based on the UE location during the
registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.501 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]).
The UE may request a PDU session establishment and modification or initiate
the service request to re-active the PDU session for an available LADN when
the UE is located in the LADN service area. If the UE has moved out of the
LADN service area, the PDU session for LADN may be released by the SMF, or the
user-plane resources for the PDU session may be deactivated by the SMF. If the
UE has returned to the LADN service area, and the network has downlink user
data pending, the network re-activates the user-plane resources for the PDU
session for LADN.
NOTE: In this release, LADNs apply only to 3GPP accesses.
### 9.3.4 Types of 5GSM procedures
Three types of 5GSM procedures can be distinguished:
1) Procedures related to PDU sessions:
These procedures are initiated by the network and are used for authentication
and authorization or manipulation of PDU sessions:
\- PDU session establishment authentication and authorization;
\- network-initiated PDU session modification;
\- network-initiated PDU session release.
This procedure is initiated by the UE and to request for establishment of PDU
sessions or to perform handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access
and non-3GPP access, or to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to
the 5GS:
\- UE-requested PDU session establishment.
2) Transaction related procedures:
These procedures are initiated by the UE to request for handling of PDU
sessions, i.e. to modify a PDU session, or to release a PDU session:
\- UE-requested PDU session modification;
\- UE-requested PDU session release.
A successful transaction related procedure initiated by the UE triggers the
network to execute one of the following procedures related to PDU session;
network-initiated PDU session modification procedure or network-initiated PDU
session release procedure. The UE treats the start of the procedure related to
the PDU session as completion of the transaction related procedure.
3) Common procedure:
The following 5GSM procedure can be related to a PDU session or to a procedure
transaction:
\- 5GSM status procedure.
## 9.3 5GSM sublayer states
### 9.3.1 General
In the following subclauses, the possible states of a 5G PDU session context

## 9.4 IP address allocation
### 9.4.1 General
This clause specifies IP address allocation for the PDU session.
In this release of specification, PDU sessions initiated with the PDU session
type IP shall support only one IP version, i.e. IPv4 PDU session type or IPv6
PDU session type.
IP address allocation to the UE shall be performed by SMF based on the
selected IP version and operator policies. If IPv4 PDU session type is
selected, an IPv4 address is allocated to the UE. If IPv6 PDU session type is
selected, an IPv6 prefix and an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local
address are allocated to the UE.
For IPv4 PDU session type, the UE:
1) shall obtain an IPv4 address via:
A) NAS signalling as specified in subclause 9.4.2; or
B) DHCPv4; and
2) may obtain IPv4 configuration parameters (e.g. DNS server address) via
DHCPv4.
For IPv6 PDU session type, the UE:
\- shall obtain /64 IPv6 prefix via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] and IETF RFC 4862 [33]; and
\- may obtain IPv6 configuration parameters via stateless DHCPv6 as specified
in IETF RFC 3736 [29]. The UE shall build an IPv6 link local address based on
the allocated interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address.
The UE capable of IPv6 shall support acting as a type C host as specified in
IETF RFC 4191 [31].
### 9.4.2 IP address allocation via NAS signalling
The UE shall set the PDU session type IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message, based on its IP stack capabilities if the UE requests IP
connectivity as follows:
a) A UE:
\- which is IPv6 and IPv4 capable, shall set the PDU session type IE to IP.
\- which is only IPv6 capable, shall set the PDU session type IE to IPv6.
\- which is only IPv4 capable, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4.
b) When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE (as in the
case when the MT and TE are separated and the capability of the TE is not
known in the MT), the UE shall set the PDU session type IE to IP.
If the UE wants to use DHCPv4 for IPv4 address assignment, it shall indicate
that to the network within the extended protocol configuration options IE in
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST.
On receipt of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message sent by the UE,
the network when allocating an IP address shall take into account the PDU
session type IE, the operator\'s policies of the network, and the user\'s
subscription data and:
\- if the UE requests the PDU session type IP, but the subscription or SMF
configuration is limited to IPv4 only or IPv6 only for the requested DNN, the
network shall set the PDU session type IE to either \"IPv4\" or \"IPv6\" and
the 5GSM cause value to #50 \"PDU session type IPv4 only allowed\", or #51
\"PDU session type IPv6 only allowed\" in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message, respectively. The UE shall not subsequently initiate another UE
requested PDU session establishment procedure to the same DNN to obtain a PDU
session type different from the one allowed by the network;
\- if the network sets the PDU session type IE to IPv4, the network shall
include an IPv4 address in the PDU address IE; and
\- if the network sets the PDU session type IE to IPv6, the network shall
include an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address in the PDU
address IE.
## 9.5 5GS session management procedures
### 9.5.1 General
#### 9.5.1.1 Principles of PTI handling for 5GSM procedures
When the UE or the network initiates a transaction related procedure (i.e. a
procedure consisting of more than one message and the messages are related),
it shall include a valid PTI value in the message header of the request
message or of the command message.
If a response message is sent as result of a received request message or a
received command message, the sending entity shall include in the response
message the PTI value received within the request message or within the
command message (see examples in figure 9.5.1.1.1, figure 9.5.1.1.2, figure
9.5.1.1.3, and figure 9.5.1.1.4).
If a command message is sent as result of a received request message, the
sending entity shall include in the command message the PTI value received
with the request message (see examples in figure 9.5.1.1.3).
If a command message is not sent as result of a received request message, the
sending entity shall include in the command message the PTI value set to \"no
procedure transaction identity assigned\" (see examples in figure 9.5.1.1.3).

network
Figure 9.5.1.1.3: UE-requested transaction related procedure triggering a
network-requested transaction related procedure
Figure 9.5.1.1.4: network-requested transaction related procedure not
triggered by a UE-requested transaction related procedure
### 9.5.2 Local PDU session release without NAS signalling
The UE shall release PDU sessions locally without peer-to-peer 5GSM signalling
in the following cases:
1) during the mobility and periodic registration update procedure or service
request procedure, for PDU sessions which are in 5GSM state PDU SESSION ACTIVE
on the UE side, but are indicated by the network as being in 5GSM state PDU
SESSION INACTIVE in the PDU session status IE; or
2) during the mobility and periodic registration update procedure or generic
UE configuration update procedure, if the UE has one or more PDU sessions
associated with S-NSSAI(s) not included in the received allowed NSSAI.
Editor\'s note: Further cases are FFS.
The SMF shall release PDU sessions locally without peer-to-peer 5GSM
signalling in the following cases:
1) during the mobility and periodic registration update procedure, de-
registration procedure or service request procedure, if the SMF is triggered
by the AMF to locally release the indicated PDU sessions;
2) during the mobility and periodic registration update procedure or service
request procedure, if the UE has moved out of the LADN service area and the
SMF decides to release the PDU session for LADN;
3) during the network-requested PDU session release procedure, if the UE is in
5GMM-IDLE mode and the N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication is sent by the
SMF to the AMF; or
4) during the network-requested PDU session release procedure, it the SMF has
been notified by the AMF that the UE is unreachable.
NOTE: The synchronisation of the PDU session status is achieved in the next
mobility and periodic registration update procedure or service request
procedure.
Editor\'s note: Further cases are FFS.
### 9.5.3 UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
#### 9.5.3.1 General
The purpose of the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure is to
establish a new PDU session with a DN or to perform handover of an existing
PDU session between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or to transfer an existing
PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS. If accepted by the network, the PDU
session enables exchange of PDUs between the UE and the DN. The UE shall not
request a PDU session establishment for an LADN when the UE is located outside
the LADN service area.
#### 9.5.3.2 UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure initiation
In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure, the
UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the PTI IE
of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the allocated PTI value.
If the UE requests to establish a new non-emergency PDU session with a DN and
requests a PDU session type, the UE shall set the PDU session type IE of the
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to one of the following values: the
IP version capability as specified in subclause 9.4.2, \"Ethernet\" or
\"Unstructured\".
NOTE: When the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure to transfer an existing non-IP PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS,
the UE can use locally available information associated with the PDN
connection to select the PDU session type between \"Ethernet\" and
\"Unstructured\".
If the UE requests to establish a new non-emergency PDU session with a DN and
the UE requests an SSC mode, the UE shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the SSC mode.
If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session with a DN, the UE may
include the SM PDU DN request container with a DN-specific identity of the UE
complying with network access identifier (NAI) format as specified in IETF RFC
4282 [32].
If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session of \"IP\", \"IPv4\",
\"IPv6\" or \"Ethernet\" PDU session type and the UE supports reflective QoS,
the UE shall set the RQoS bit to \"Reflective QoS supported\" in the UE SM
capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
If the UE has an emergency PDU session, the UE shall not perform the UE-
requested PDU session establishment procedure to establish another emergency
PDU session.
The UE shall transport:
a) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
b) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established;
c) the S-NSSAI, if the request type is not set to \"initial emergency
request\" and the UE requests a S-NSSAI other than default S-NSSAI;
d) and the requested DNN, if the request type is not set to \"initial
emergency request\" and the UE requests a connectivity to a DNN other than the
default DNN; and
e) the request type set:
1) to \"initial request\", if the UE requests to establish a new non-emergency
PDU session;
2) to \"existing PDU session\", if the UE requests:
i) handover of an existing non-emergency PDU session between 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access; or
ii) transfer of an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS;
3) to \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session; and
f) the old PDU session ID which is the PDU session ID of the existing PDU
session, if the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure upon receiving the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND messages with
the 5GSM cause IE set to #39 \"reactivation requested\";
using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.1, and the
UE shall start timer T3580 (see example in figure 9.5.3.2.1).
Figure 9.5.3.2.1: UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, a PDU session ID,
optionally a S-NSSAI, optionally a DNN, the request type, and optionally an
old PDU session ID, the SMF checks whether connectivity with the requested DN
can be established. If the requested DNN is not included, the SMF shall use
the default DNN. If the S-NSSAI is not included, the SMF may determine a
default S-NSSAI according to the subscription context from UDM and, if
determined, the SMF may use the default S-NSSAI as the S-NSSAI.
If the PDU session being established is a non-emergency PDU session and the
PDU session authentication and authorization by the external DN is required
due to local policy, the SMF shall check whether the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message includes the PDU DN request container.
If the PDU session being established is a non-emergency PDU session, the PDU
DN request container is included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message and the PDU session authentication and authorization by the external
DN is required due to local policy and user\'s subscription data, the SMF
shall:
\- if the information for the PDU session authentication and authorization by
the external DN in PDU DN request container is compliant with the local policy
and user\'s subscription data, proceed with the EAP Authentication procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24] and refrain from accepting or rejecting the
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message until the EAP Authentication
procedure finalizes; and
\- if the information for the PDU session authentication and authorization by
the external DN in PDU DN request container is not compliant with the local
policy, reject the PDU session establishment request including the 5GSM cause
#xx \"DN authentication failed\", in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT
message.
If the PDU session being established is a non-emergency PDU session, the PDU
DN request container is not included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message and the PDU session authentication and authorization by the external
DN is required due to local policy and user\'s subscription data, the SMF
shall proceed with the EAP Authentication procedure specified in 3GPP TS
33.501 [24] and refrain from accepting or rejecting the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message until the EAP Authentication procedure
finalizes.
If the SMF receives the old PDU session ID from the AMF and a PDU session
exists for the old PDU session ID, the SMF shall consider that the request for
the relocation of SSC mode 3 PDU session anchor with multiple PDU sessions as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10] is accepted by the UE.
#### 9.5.3.3 UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure accepted by the
network
If the connectivity with the requested DN is accepted by the network, the SMF
shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message.
The SMF shall set the authorized QoS rules IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT message to the authorized QoS rules of the PDU session. If the received
request type is \"initial emergency request\", the SMF shall set the
authorized QoS rules IE according to the initial QoS parameters used for
establishing emergency services configured in the SMF Emergency Configuration
Data.
The SMF shall set the selected SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT message to:.
\- either the received SSC mode or the SSC mode modified from the received SSC
mode based on the subscription, the SMF configuration, or both if the request
type IE is set to \"initial request\", and the SSC mode IE is included in the
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
\- otherwise, either the default SSC mode for the data network listed in the
subscription or the SSC mode associated with the SMF configuration.
If the PDU session is an emergency PDU session, the SMF shall set the selected
SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message to \"SSC mode 1\".
The SMF shall set the selected S-NSSAI IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT message to the selected S-NSSAI of the PDU session.
The SMF shall set the selected PDU session type IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message to the selected PDU session type of the PDU
session.
If the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message includes a PDU session type
IE set to \"IP\", the SMF shall select either \"IPv4\" or \"IPv6\" as the
selected PDU session type IE of the PDU session. If the subscription, the SMF
configuration, or both, are limited to IPv4 only or IPv6 only for the
requested DNN, the SMF shall include the 5GSM cause value #50 \"PDU session
type IPv4 only allowed\", or #51 \"PDU session type IPv6 only allowed\",
respectively, in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message.
If the selected PDU session type is \"IPv4\", the SMF shall include the PDU
address IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message and shall set the
PDU address IE to an IPv4 address is allocated to the UE in the PDU session.
If the selected PDU session type is \"IPv6\", the SMF shall include the PDU
address IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message and shall set the
PDU address IE to an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address.
The SMF shall set the selected DNN IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message to the selected DNN of the PDU session.
The SMF shall set the selected Session-AMBR IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message to the Session-AMBR of the PDU session.
If the selected PDU session type is \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\" or \"Ethernet\" and if
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message includes a UE SM capability IE
with the RQoS bit set to \"Reflective QoS supported\", the SMF shall consider
that reflective QoS is supported for QoS flows belonging to this PDU session
and include the RQ timer IE set to an RQ timer value.
NOTE: If the 5G core network determines that reflective QoS is to be used for
a QoS flow, the SMF sends reflective QoS indication (RQI) to UPF to activate
reflective QoS. If the QoS flow is established over 3GPP access, the SMF also
includes reflective QoS Attribute (RQA) in QoS profile of the QoS flow during
QoS flow establishment.
If the DN authentication of the UE was performed and completed successfully,
the SMF shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message to an EAP-success message as specified in IETF RFC 3748 [30], provided
by the DN.
The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message.
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.1, the
UE shall stop timer T3580, shall release the allocated PTI value and shall
consider that the PDU session was established.
If the UE requests the PDU session type \"IP\" and:
a) the UE receives the selected PDU session type set to \"IPv4\" and does not
receive the 5GSM cause value #50 \"PDU session type IPv4 only allowed\"; or
b) the UE receives the selected PDU session type set to \"IPv6\" and does not
receive the 5GSM cause value #51 \"PDU session type IPv6 only allowed\";
the UE may subsequently request another PDU session for the other IP version
using the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure to the same DNN
with a single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6) other than the one already
activated.
If the UE requests the PDU session type \"IP\", receives the selected PDU
session type set to \"IPv4\" and the 5GSM cause value #50 \"PDU session type
IPv4 only allowed\", the UE shall not subsequently request another PDU session
for \"IPv6\" using the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure to the
same DNN and the PDU session type \"IPv6\" until the PDU session is released.
If the UE requests the PDU session type \"IP\", receives the selected PDU
session type set to \"IPv6\" and the 5GSM cause value #51 \"PDU session type
IPv6 only allowed\", the UE shall not subsequently request another PDU session
for \"IPv4\" using the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure to the
same DNN and the PDU session type \"IPv4\" until the PDU session is released.
#### 9.5.3.4 UE requested PDU session establishment procedure not accepted by
the network
##### 9.5.3.4.1 General
If the connectivity with the requested DN is rejected by the network, the SMF
shall create a SM PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.
If the UE requests a PDU session establishment for an LADN when the UE is
located outside the LADN service area, the SMF shall reject the request.
The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT
message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU session establishment.
The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause values:
#26: insufficient resources;
#27: missing or unknown DNN;
#31: request rejected, unspecified;
#50 PDU session type IPv4 only allowed;
#51 PDU session type IPv6 only allowed; or
#ss insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN;
#xx: DN authentication failed.
Editor\'s note: Further 5GSM causes are FFS.
Editor\'s note: Further contents of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT are
FFS.
If the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message includes a PDU session type
IE set to \"IPv6\", and the subscription, the SMF configuration, or both, are
limited to IPv4 only for the requested DNN, the SMF shall include the 5GSM
cause value #50 \"PDU session type IPv4 only allowed\" in the 5GSM cause IE of
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.
If the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message includes a PDU session type
IE set to \"IPv4\", and the subscription, the SMF configuration, or both, are
limited to IPv6 only for the requested DNN, the SMF shall include the 5GSM
cause value #51 \"PDU session type IPv6 only allowed\" in the 5GSM cause IE of
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.
The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REJECT message when the 5GSM cause value #26\"insufficient resources\" is
included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message. If the 5GSM cause
value is #26\"insufficient resources\" and the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message was received from a UE configured to use AC11--15 in selected
PLMN or the request type in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message was
set to \"initial emergency request\", the network shall not include a Back-off
timer value IE.
Editor\'s note It is FFS whether both 5GSM cause value #26 and 5GSM cause
values #ss are used or whether 5GSM cause value #26 together with an
indication should be used instead.
The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REJECT message when the 5GSM cause cause #ss \"insufficient resources for
specific slice and DNN\" is included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT
message. If the 5GSM cause value is #ss \"insufficient resources for specific
slice and DNN\" and the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message was received
from a UE configured to use AC11--15 in selected PLMN or the request type is
\"initial emergency request\" in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message, the network shall not include a Back-off timer value IE.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether both 5GSM cause value #26 and 5GSM cause
values #ss are used or whether 5GSM cause value #26 together with an
indication should be used instead.
The SMF shall send the SM PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3, the
UE shall stop timer T3580 shall release the allocated PTI value and shall
consider that the PDU session was not established.
If the DN authentication of the UE was performed and completed unsuccessfully,
the SMF shall include the 5GSM cause value #xx \"DN authentication failed\" in
the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message and shall
set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message to an
EAP-failure message as specified in IETF RFC 3748 [30], provided by the DN.
If the 5GSM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\" and the Back-off
timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different actions depending on
the timer value received for timer T35ab in the Back-off timer value:
1) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and a DNN was
included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, the UE shall stop
timer T35ab associated with the corresponding DNN, if it is running. If the
timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no DNN was included in
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and the request type was
different from \"initial emergency request\", the UE shall stop timer T35ab
associated with no DNN if it is running. The UE shall then start timer T35ab
with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:
\- shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST,or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same DNN that was sent by the UE, until
timer T35ab expires or timer T35ab is stopped; and
\- shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an
DNN and with request type different from \"initial emergency request\", or
another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDU
session established without an DNN provided by the UE, if no DNN was included
in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and the request type was
different from \"initial emergency request\", until timer T35ab expires or
timer T35ab is stopped.
The UE shall not stop timer T35ab upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;
2) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and a DNN was
included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, the UE shall stop
timer T35ab associated with the corresponding DNN, if it is running. If the
timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no DNN was included
in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and the request type was
different from \"initial emergency request\", the UE shall stop timer T35ab
associated with no DNN if it is running. The UE:
\- shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST for the same DNN until the UE is switched off or the USIM
is removed, or the UE receives an PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for
the same DNN from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message
including 5GSM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" for the same DNN from the
network; and
\- shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an
DNN and with request type different from \"initial emergency request\", or
another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDU
session established without an DNN provided by the UE, if no DNN was included
in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and the request type was
different from \"initial emergency request\", until the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message for a non-emergency PDU session established without an DNN provided by
the UE, or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND messages including 5GSM cause IE set
to 5GSM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" for a non-emergency PDU session
established without an DNN provided by the UE.
The timer T35ab remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;
and
3) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:
\- shall stop timer T35ab associated with the corresponding DNN, if running,
and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same DNN; and
\- if no DNN was included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request \", the UE
shall stop timer T35ab associated with no DNN, if running, and may send
another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without a DNN, or another
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an DNN provided by the UE.
If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message
for the same DNN or without a DNN.
When the timer T35ab is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed
to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency services.
If the timer T35ab is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the
UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer
T35ab is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T35ab is running, and if the USIM in
the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall behave as
follows:
\- let t1 be the time remaining for T35ab timeout at switch off and let t be
the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t,
then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of
determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
If the 5GSM cause value is #ss \"insufficient resources for specific slice and
DNN\" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different
actions depending on the timer value received for timer T35cd in the Back-off
timer value:
1) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall
stop timer T35cd associated with the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination as that
the UE provided when the PDU session is established, if it is running. The UE
shall then start timer T35cd with the value provided in the Back-off timer
value IE. The UE shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST with
request type different from \"initial emergency request\", or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination that was
sent by the UE, until timer T35cd expires or timer T35cd is stopped;
The UE shall not stop timer T35cd upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;
2) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall
stop timer T35cd associated with the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination as that
the UE provided when the PDU session is established, if it is running. The UE
shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST with request type
different from \"initial emergency request\", or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination that was sent by the UE, until
the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination
from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message including 5GSM cause
#39 \"reactivation requested\" for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination from
the network; and
The timer T35cd remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;
and
3) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE shall stop timer T35cd associated
with the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination that was sent by the UE, if running,
and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination.
If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message
for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination.
When the timer T35cd is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed
to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency services.
If the timer T35cd is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the
UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer
T35cd is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T35cd is running, and if the USIM in
the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall behave as
follows:
\- let t1 be the time remaining for T35cd timeout at switch off and let t be
the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t,
then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of
determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
##### 9.5.3.4.2 Handling of network rejection due to 5GSM cause #26
Editor\'s note: Handling of network rejection due to 5GSM cause #26 is FFS.
##### 9.5.3.4.3 Handling of network rejection due to 5GSM cause other than
5GSM cause #26
If the 5GSM cause value is #27 \"missing or unknown DNN\", the UE shall not
send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the
same DNN that was sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off, the USIM is
removed, or the network updates the LADN information during the registration
procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure.
Editor\'s note: Handling of network rejection due to 5GSM cause other than
5GSM cause #27 \"missing or unknown DNN\" is FFS.
#### 9.5.3.5 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) T3580 expired
The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3580, retransmit the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3580.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3580, the UE shall abort the procedure.
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases in the UE are FFS.
#### 9.5.3.6 Abnormal cases on the network side
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases in the network side are FFS.
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) If the received request type is \"initial emergency request\" and there is
already another emergency PDU session for the UE, the SMF shall reject the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with ESM cause #31 \"request rejected,
unspecified\" or release the existing emergency PDU session locally without
notification to the UE and proceed the new PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.
b) The information for the PDU session authentication and authorization by the
external DN in PDU DN request container is not compliant with local policy and
user\'s subscription data
If the PDU session being established is a non-emergency PDU session, the PDU
session authentication and authorization by the external DN is required due to
local policy and user\'s subscription data and the information for the PDU
session authentication and authorization by the external DN in PDU DN request
container is not compliant with local policy and user\'s subscription data,
the SMF shall reject the PDU session establishment request including the 5GSM
cause #xx \"DN authentication failed\", in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REJECT message.
### 9.5.4 PDU session establishment authentication and authorization procedure
#### 9.5.4.1 General
The purpose of the PDU session establishment authentication and authorization
procedure is to enable the DN:
1) to authenticate the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU
session;
2) to authorize the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU session;
or
3) both of the above.
The PDU session establishment authentication and authorization procedure can
be performed only during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
establishing a non-emergency PDU session. The PDU session establishment
authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed during the
UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure establishing an emergency PDU
session.
The network authenticates the UE using the Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP) as specified in IETF RFC 3748 [30].
EAP has defined four types of EAP messages:
\- an EAP-request message;
\- an EAP-response message;
\- an EAP-success message; and
\- an EAP-failure message.
The EAP-request message is transported from the network to the UE using the
PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
The EAP-response message to the EAP-request message is transported from the UE
to the network using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION ACCEPT message.
If the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully, the EAP-success
message is transported from the network to the UE as part of the UE-requested
PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message.
If the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the EAP-failure
message is transported from the network to the UE as part of the UE-requested
PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT
message.
There can be several rounds of exchange of an EAP-request message and a
related EAP-response message for the DN to complete the authentication and
authorization of the request for a PDU session (see example in figure
9.5.4.1.1).
The SMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in IETF RFC
3748 [30] subclause 4.3 to infinite value.
NOTE 2: The PDU session establishment authentication and authorization
procedure provides a reliable transport of EAP messages and therefore
retransmissions at the EAP layer of the SMF do not occur.
Figure 9.5.4.1.1: PDU session establishment authentication and authorization
procedure
#### 9.5.4.2 PDU session establishment authentication and authorization
procedure initiation
In order to initiate the PDU session establishment authentication and
authorization procedure, the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message.
The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message
to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".
The SMF shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message to the EAP-request message provided by the DN or generated locally.
The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, and the SMF
shall start timer T3590 (see example in figure 9.5.4.1.1).
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3, the
UE passes to the upper layers the EAP message received in the EAP message IE
of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. Apart from this action, the
authentication and authorization procedure initiated by the DN is transparent
to the 5GSM layer of the UE.
#### 9.5.4.3 PDU session establishment authentication and authorization
procedure accepted
When the upper layers provide an EAP-response message responding to the
received EAP-request message, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
ACCEPT message.
The UE shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION ACCEPT
message to the EAP-response message.
The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION ACCEPT message and the
PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause
8.5.1.3. Apart from this action, the authentication and authorization
procedure initiated by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM layer of the UE.
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION ACCEPT message, the SMF shall
stop timer T3590 and provides the EAP message received in the EAP message IE
of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION ACCEPT message to the DN or handles it
locally.
#### 9.5.4.4 Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) T3590 expired
The SMF shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3590, retransmit the PDU
SESSION AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3590.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3590, the SMF shall abort the procedure.
Editor\'s note: Further abnormal cases are FFS
#### 9.5.4.5 Abnormal cases in the UE
Editor\'s note: Abnormal cases are FFS
### 9.5.5 UE-requested PDU session modification procedure
#### 9.5.5.1 General
The purpose of the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure is to
enable the UE to request modification of a PDU session. The UE shall not
request a PDU session modification for an LADN when the UE is located outside
the LADN service area. If the UE supports Reflective QoS, the UE shall
initiate this procedure to indicate the support of Reflective QoS after an
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode.
#### 9.5.5.2 UE-requested PDU session modification procedure initiation
In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure, the
UE shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.
The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the PTI IE
of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the allocated PTI value.
The UE shall not perform the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure
for an emergency PDU session.
If the UE requests a specific QoS handling, the UE shall include the requested
QoS rules IE indicating requested QoS rules for the specific QoS handling.
The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and the
PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause
8.5.1.3, and the UE shall start timer T3581 (see example in figure 9.5.5.2.1).
Figure 9.5.5.2.1: UE-requested PDU session modification procedure
#### 9.5.5.3 UE-requested PDU session modification procedure accepted by the
network
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, if the SMF accepts
the request to modify the PDU session, the SMF shall perform the network-
requested PDU session modification procedure as specified in subclause 9.5.6.
#### 9.5.5.4 UE-requested PDU session modification procedure not accepted by
the network
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, if the SMF does
not accepts the request to modify the PDU session, the SMF shall create a PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
If the UE requests a PDU session modification for an LADN when the UE is
located outside the LADN service area, the SMF shall reject the request.
The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT
message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU session modification.
The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause values:
#26: insufficient resources;
#31: request rejected, unspecified; or
#ss insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN;
Editor\'s note: Further 5GSM causes are FFS.
The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REJECT message. If the 5GSM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\" and
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message was received from a UE configured
to use AC11--15 in selected PLMN or the request type was set to \"initial
emergency request\" for the establishment of the PDU session, the network
shall not include a Back-off timer value IE.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether both 5GSM cause value #26 and 5GSM cause
values #ss are used or whether 5GSM cause value #26 together with an
indication should be used instead.
The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REJECT message when the 5GSM cause cause #ss \"insufficient resources for
specific slice and DNN\" is included in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT
message. If the 5GSM cause value is #ss \"insufficient resources for specific
slice and DNN\" and the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message was received
from a UE configured to use AC11--15 in selected PLMN or the request type is
set to \"initial emergency request\" for the establisment of the PDU session,
the network shall not include a Back-off timer value IE.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether both 5GSM cause value #26 and 5GSM cause
values #ss are used or whether 5GSM cause value #26 together with an
indication should be used instead.
The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3, the
UE shall stop timer T3581, shall release the allocated PTI value and shall
consider that the PDU session is not modified.
If the 5GSM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\" and the Back-off
timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different actions depending on
the timer value received for timer T35ab in the Back-off timer value:
1) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall
stop timer T35ab associated with the corresponding DNN, if it is running. The
UE shall then start timer T35ab with the value provided in the Back-off timer
value IE and shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same DNN that was sent by the UE,
until timer T35ab expires or timer T35ab is stopped.
If the UE did not provide a DNN for the establishment of the PDU session and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request\", the UE
shall stop the timer T35ab associated with no DNN if it is running. The UE
shall start timer T35ab with the received value and not send another PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an DNN and with request type
different from \"initial emergency request\", or another PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDU session established
without an DNN provided by the UE, until timer T35ab expires or timer T35ab is
stopped.
The UE shall not stop timer T35ab upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.
2) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall
not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same DNN until the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message for the same DNN from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
message including 5GSM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" for the same DNN
from the network.
If the UE did not provide an DNN for the establishment of the PDU session and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request\", the UE
shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an
DNN and with request type different from \"initial emergency request\", or
another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST for a non-emergency PDU session
established without DNN provided by the UE, until the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message for a non-emergency PDU session established without an DNN provided by
the UE, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND messages including
5GSM cause IE set to 5GSM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" for a non-
emergency PDU session established without an DNN provided by the UE.
The timer T35ab remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.
3) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE shall stop timer T35ab associated
with the corresponding DNN, if running, and may send another PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the
same DNN.
if the UE did not provide an DNN for the establishment of the PDU session and
the request type was different from \" initial emergency request \", the UE
shall stop timer T35ab associated with no DNN, if running, and may send
another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an DNN, or another
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message established without an DNN provided
by the UE.
If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message
for the same DNN or without DNN.
If the timer T35ab is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the
UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer
T35ab is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T35ab is running, and if the USIM in
the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall behave as
follows:
\- let t1 be the time remaining for T35ab timeout at switch off and let t be
the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t,
then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of
determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
If the 5GSM cause value is #ss \"insufficient resources for specific slice and
DNN\" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different
actions depending on the timer value received for timer T35cd in the Back-off
timer value:
1) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall
stop timer T35cd associated with the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination as that
the UE provided when the PDU session is establishe, if it is running. The UE
shall then start timer T35cd with the value provided in the Back-off timer
value IE and shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN]
combination that was sent by the UE, until timer T35cd expires or timer Tsm1
is stopped.
The UE shall not stop timer Tsm1 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.
2) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall
stop timer T35cd associated with the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination as that
the UE provided when the PDU session is established, if it is running. the UE
shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, or PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination until the
UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination from the
network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message including 5GSM cause #39
\"reactivation requested\" for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination from the
network
The timer T35cd remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.
3) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE shall stop timer T35cd associated
with the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination, if running, and may send another PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for
the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination.
If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message
for the same [S-NSSAI, DNN] combination.
When the timer T35cd is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed
to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency services.
If the timer T35cd is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the
UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer
T35cd is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T35cd is running, and if the USIM in
the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall behave as
follows:
\- let t1 be the time remaining for T35cd timeout at switch off and let t be
the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t,
then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of
determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
#### 9.5.5.5 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) T3581 expired
The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3581, retransmit the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3581.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3581, the UE shall abort the procedure and shall release the allocated PTI.

## 9.9 Cause values for 5GS session management
### 9.9.1 Causes related to nature of request
Cause #26 -- Insufficient resources
This 5GSM cause is used by the UE or by the network to indicate that the
requested service cannot be provided due to insufficient resources.
Editor\'s note: Semantic of 5GSM cause value #26 includes semantic of 5GSM
cause value #ss. If both 5GSM cause values are needed, semantics of 5GSM cause
values have to be different.
Cause #27 -- Missing or unknown DNN
This 5GSM cause is used by the network to indicate that the requested service
was rejected by the external DN because the DNN was not included although
required or if the DNN could not be resolved.
Cause #29 -- User authentication failed
This 5GSM cause is used by the network to indicate that the requested service
was rejected by the external DN due to a failed user authentication.
Cause #31 -- Request rejected, unspecified
This 5GSM cause is used by the network or by the UE to indicate that the
requested service or operation or the request for a resource was rejected due
to unspecified reasons.
Cause #36 -- Regular deactivation
This 5GSM cause is used to indicate a regular UE or network initiated release
of PDU session resources.
Cause #39 -- Reactivation requested
This 5GSM cause is used by the network to request a PDU session reactivation.
Cause #50 -- PDU session type IPv4 only allowed
This 5GSM cause is used by the network to indicate that only PDU session type
IPv4 is allowed for the requested IP connectivity.
Cause #51 -- PDU session type IPv6 only allowed
This 5GSM cause is used by the network to indicate that only PDU session type
IPv6 is allowed for the requested IP connectivity.
Cause #ss --Insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN;
This 5GSM cause is by the network to indicate that the requested service
cannot be provided due to insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN.
Editor\'s note: Semantic of 5GSM cause value #26 includes semantic of 5GSM
cause value #ss. If both 5GSM cause values are needed, semantics of 5GSM cause
values have to be different.
### 9.9.2 Protocol errors (e.g., unknown message)
Cause #95 -- Semantically incorrect message
This 5GSM cause is used to report receipt of a message with semantically
incorrect contents.
Cause #96 -- Invalid mandatory information
This 5GSM cause indicates that the equipment sending this 5GSM cause has
received a message with a non-semantical mandatory IE error.
Cause #97 -- Message type non-existent or not implemented
This 5GSM cause indicates that the equipment sending this 5GSM cause has
received a message with a message type it does not recognize either because
this is a message not defined, or defined but not implemented by the equipment
sending this 5GSM cause.
Cause #98 -- Message type not compatible with protocol state
This 5GSM cause indicates that the equipment sending this 5GSM cause has
received a message not compatible with the protocol state.
Cause #99 -- Information element non-existent or not implemented
This 5GSM cause indicates that the equipment sending this 5GSM cause has
received a message which includes information elements not recognized because
the information element identifier is not defined or it is defined but not
implemented by the equipment sending the 5GSM cause. However, the information
element is not required to be present in the message in order for the
equipment sending the 5GSM cause to process the message.
Cause #100 -- Conditional IE error
This 5GSM cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a
message with conditional IE errors.

incompatible with the protocol state.
Cause #111 -- Protocol error, unspecified
This 5GSM cause is used to report a protocol error event only when no other
5GSM cause in the protocol error class applies.
# 10 Access to the 5G core network via non-3GPP access networks
## 10.1 General
In this release, the 5GS supports untrusted non-3GPP accesses and does not
support trusted non-3GPP accesses (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]).
Access to the 5GCN via non-3GPP access networks shall be supported by the
non-3GPP interworking function (N3IWF). Between the UE and the N3IWF, an IPsec
SA shall be established. During the IPsec SA establishment, the UE shall be
authenticated by and registered to the 5G core network. The N3IWF interfaces
to 5G core network via N2 and N3 reference points.
Editor\'s note: How to transmit a registration request message is FFS.
If the UE is authenticated by the 5G core network, secure NAS message exchange
between the UE and the 5G core network shall be supported using the N1
reference point over the N3IWF.
When a UE isin 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
over non-3GPP access, two N1 NAS signalling connections shall exist for the
UE.
A UE simultaneously registered to a single PLMN over 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, shall be served by a single AMF. In this case, when a UE is in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP
access, two N1 NAS signalling connections shall exist for the AMF. Otherwise a
UE registered to two different PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks,
shall be served by two AMFs in two different PLMNs. In this case, when a UE is
in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over
non-3GPP access, single N1 NAS signalling connections shall exist for each of
the AMFs.
During the IPsec SA establishment between the UE and the N3IWF, the N3IWF
retrieves the NAI of the UE and the NAI is used to identify the UE in the 5G
core network.

### 10.2.2 User plane protocol stacks
**Legend:**
\- PDU Layer: This layer corresponds to the PDU carried between the UE and the
DN over the PDU Session. E.g. when the PDU Session type is IPV6, it
corresponds to IPv6 packets; When the PDU Session Type is Ethernet, it
corresponds to Ethernet frames.
\- **GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the user plane (GTP-U):** This protocol
supports multiplexing traffic of different PDU Sessions (possibly
corresponding to different PDU Session Types) by tunnelling user data over N3
(i.e. between N3IWF and the UPF) in the backbone network.
\- The N3IWF relays the user data between per PDU Session IPsec tunnel over
NWu and corresponding N3 tunnel.

Editor\'s note: The value of protocol type in GRE header for unstructured PDU
session type packets encapsulation is FFS.
## 10.3 NAS over non-3GPP access
### 10.3.1 General
From the UE\'s NAS perspective, the N1 interface is indistiguishable over the
3GPP access or the non-3GPP access in so much as the peer-to-peer signalling
procedures and messages defined for UE NAS to 5GCN NAS over 3GPP access will
be used for same purposes for UE NAS to 5GCN NAS over non-3GPP access. The 5GS
NAS state machines of both 3GPP access or non-3GPP access should likewise have
minimum differences. Maximum reuse should be the objective with any deviations
or exceptions adopted if without such deviations or exceptions, signalling
procedures and intended services will fail or malfunction, or service or
archtitectural (or both) requirments cannot be met.
### 10.3.2 Mobility management over non-3GPP access
The mobility management procedures defined for N1 over 3GPP access will be re-
used for N1 over non-3GPP access with the following exceptions:
\- the status of the UE\'s non-3GPP 5GMM instance and the status of the UE\'s
3GPP 5GMM instance are independent and can be different.
\- single registration mode and dual registration mode do not apply for 5GMM
over non-3GPP access.
\- there will be one instance of 5GMM for 3GPP access and one instance of 5GMM
for non-3GPP access. The RPLMN over non-3GPP access can be different from the
RPLMN over 3GPP access. The MCC of the RPLMN over 3GPP access and the MCC of
the RPLMN over the non-3GPP access can also be different.
\- as over non-3GPP access the 5GS operates one common registration area for
an entire PLMN, list management of registration areas and resultant
registration updating due to registration area change with the registered PLMN
is not required. Periodic registration over a non-3GPP access shall not be
applied. Registration updating at change of PLMN is still required.
\- the 5GMM over non-3GPP access considers that the N1 NAS signalling
connection is established when the lower layers indicate that the access
stratum connection is established succcessfully.
Editor\'s note: Further exceptions are possible and are FFS.
\- UE-initiated service request procedure via non-3GPP access is supported.
Upon indication from the lower layers of non-3GPP access, that the access
stratum conncetion is established between UE and network, the UE in 5GMM-
REGISTERED state and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access shall initiate the
service request procedure via non-3GPP access to re-activate user plane
connections for all PDU sessions associated with non-3GPP access, but not PDU
sessions associated with 3GPP access.
\- There is no network initiated service request procedure via non-3GPP
Access.
### 10.3.3 Session management over non-3GPP access
The session management procedures defined for N1 over 3GPP access will be re-
used for N1 over non-3GPP access.
Editor\'s note: Further exceptions are possible and are FFS.
## 10.4 Registration over non-3GPP access
### 10.4.1 General
The UE registers separately for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, respectively.
An access stratum connection must exist before the UE can perform the
registration procedure.
The UE shall not perform periodic registration update over a non-3GPP access.
The UE cannot be paged over a non-3GPP access.
### 10.4.2 Registration over non-3GPP access
Upon successful establishment of the N1 NAS signalling connection over
non-3GPP access, the NAS performs the registration over non-3GPP access, to
the selected PLMN by follow the registration procedure for initial
registration given in subclause 8.5.2.1.2, except for the following:-
\- the UE shall not request use of MICO mode.
When the UE is registered with a PLMN over a non-3GPP access, the AMF and the
UE maintain:
\- Registration state and state machine over non-3GPP access;
\- Security context;
\- 5G-GUTI;
\- Registration area for non-3GPP access, which is associated with a fixed
well-known N3GPP TAI; and
\- Non-3GPP de-registration timer in the UE and non-3GPP implicit de-
registration timer in the AMF.
Editor's note: What information the N3IWF maintains for a registered UE is
FFS.
### 10.4.3 Registration over non-3GPP access and 3GPP access
When the UE is registered with a PLMN over a non-3GPP access and over a 3GPP
access, the AMF and the UE maintain:
\- Separate registration states and separate instances of state machines over
3GPP access and non-3GPP access, respectively;
Editor's note: The state machine over non-3GPP access is FFS.
\- Separate registration areas; and
\- Same security context and5G-GUTI, only if the UE is registered with the
same PLMN over both accesses. Otherwise, the security contexts and the 5G-GUTI
shall be separate.
Editor's note: To what extent the security context is the same when the UE is
registered with the same PLMN over both accesses is FFS.
When the UE initiates registration over a non-3GPP access to a PLMN for which
it has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall use this 5G-GUTI during the registration.
When the UE is currently registered with the same PLMN over a 3GPP access, the
5G-GUTI is considered as valid.
When the UE wishes to initiate registration over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access in the same PLMN (e.g. the 3GPP access and the selected N3IWF are
located in the same PLMN), the UE:
\- in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED over 3GPP access shall not initiate
registration over non-3GPP access; or
\- in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED over non-3GPP access shall not initiate
registration over 3GPP access.
NOTE: To which access (i.e. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access) the UE initiates
registration first is up to UE implementation).
### 10.4.4 De-registration over non-3GPP access
The UE and the AMF may initiate de-registration for a non-3GPP access by:
\- Initiating a de-registration request over a non-3GPP access when the UE is
registered over non-3GPP access;
\- Initiating a de-registration request over a 3GPP access when the UE is
registered in the same PLMN over both accesses; or
\- Initiating a de-registration request over a 3GPP access or non-3GPP access
with an indication that it applies to all accesses when the UE is registered
in the same PLMN over both accesses.
When the UE has no PDU sessions over non-3GPP access, or the UE moves all the
PDU sessions over a non-3GPP access to a 3GPP access, the UE and the AMF need
not initiate de-registration over the non-3GPP access.
The AMF shall provide the UE with a non-3GPP de-registration timer Tx.
Once the UE enters the 5GMM-IDLE over non-3GPP access, the UE starts a
non-3GPP de-registraion timer Tx. When the timer Tx expires, the UE shall
perform de-registration for non-3GPP access and enter the state 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED over non-3GPP access.
Once the AMF enters the 5GMM-IDLE, the AMF starts a non-3GPP implicit de-
registration timer Ty. When the timer Ty expires, the AMF shall perform de-
registration for non-3GPP access and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over
non-3GPP access.
The non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer Ty shall be longer than the
non-3GPP de-registration timer Tx.
Editor's note: The non-3GPP de-registration timer Tx and the non-3GPP implicit
de-registration timer Ty are FFS.
## 10.5 Selection of N3IWF
The ePDG selection procedure specified in the 3GPP TS 24.302 [16] is reused as
mechanism for N3IWF selection except for the following differences:
1) The UE performs N3IWF selection based on the information configured by the
HPLMN in the UE and based on the UE\'s knowledge of the PLMN it is attached
to.
Editor\'s note: The format and contents of N3IWF configuration information are
FFS.
2) The input to the DNS query to retrive IP address(es) of the N3IWF is a
N3IWF FQDN (N3IWF fully qualified domain name). A N3IWF FQDN is either
provisioned by the home operator or constructed by UE in either the operator
identifier FQDN format or the tracking area identity FQDN format. Location
area identity FQDN format is not used.
Editor\'s note: The detailed format of the N3IWF FQDN format is FFS and is to
be specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
## 10.6 Procedures between UE and N3IWF
Editor\'s note: This subclause specifies the IKEv2 procedures between the UE
and N3IWF due to UE registration/de-registration, PDU session setup, PDU
session modification and PDU session release.
### 10.7.1 IKE SA creation procedure for UE registration via untrusted
non-3GPP access
#### 10.7.1.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to establish a secure connection between the
UE and N3IWF, which is used to securely exchange NAS signalling messages
between the UE and AMF, via N3IWF.
The IKE SA and first child SA are created between the UE and N3IWF after the
IKE initial exchanges are completed, i.e. after the IKE_SA_INIT exchange and
after the IKE_AUTH exchange (see IETF RFC 7296 [36]).
During UE registration the first child SA established is used to transfer NAS
signalling traffic. The child SA that is used to convey NAS signalling traffic
is termed as the signalling IPsec SA. Additional child SAs (user plane IPsec
SAs) can be established between the UE and N3IWF to transfer user-plane
traffic (see subclause 10.7.2A).
The signalling IPsec SA and IKE SA are established between the UE and N3IWF by
executing the procedure in subclause 10.7.1.2. A vendor-specific EAP method
(EAP-5G) is used to encapsulate NAS messages between the UE and the N3IWF. The
EAP-5G packets utilize the \"Expanded\" EAP type and the existing 3GPP Vendor-
Id registered with IANA under the SMI Private Enterprise Code registry (i.e.
10415). The EAP-5G method is utilized only for encapsulating NAS messages (not
for authentication). The EAP-5G procedure is described in subclause 10.7.1.3.
#### 10.7.1.2 IKE SA and signalling IPsec SA establishment procedure
When the UE is required to initiate UE registration via a non-3GPP access and
has selected an N3IWF (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]) the UE starts to establish an
IKE SA and first child SA (signalling IPsec SA). The UE shall initiate an
IKE_SA_INIT exchange followed by an IKE_AUTH exchange as specified in IETF RFC
7296 [36]. The UE shall indicate the intention to use EAP by not including the
AUTH payload in the initial IKE_AUTH request as specified in IETF RFC 7296
[36].
Upon reception of the IKE_AUTH request without AUTH payload, the N3IWF shall
respond with an IKE_AUTH response with an indication to start an EAP-5G
session in order to convery the initial NAS messages. The EAP-5G procedure is
described in subclause 10.7.1.3.
When the EAP-5G session is completed the UE receives from the N3IWF an
IKE_AUTH response with an EAP-Success packet. The UE completes the IKE SA and
signalling IPsec SA (first child SA) establishment procedure by initiating an
IKE_AUTH exchange including an AUTH payload computed based on the N3IWF key as
described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].
This completes the establishment of the IKE SA and signalling IPsec SA between
the UE and N3IWF. The UE and N3IWF shall send further NAS messages within the
signalling IPsec SA (first child SA) (see example in figure 10.7.1.2.1).
Editor's note: It is FFS how the signalling IPsec SA is handled in case of
rekeying of the IKE SA.
Figure 10.7.1.2.1: IKE SA and first child SA establishment procedure for UE
registration over non-3GPP access
#### 10.7.1.3 EAP-5G procedure for registration over non-3GPP access
The UE and the N3IWF exchange EAP-5G messages within IKE_AUTH request and
IKE_AUTH response messages.The N3IWF on reception of an IKE_AUTH request with
no AUTH payload shall start an EAP-5G session by sending an EAP-
Request/5G-Start message.
The UE acknowledges start of the EAP-5G session by sending an EAP-
Response/5G-NAS message. The 5G-NAS packet shall include:
\- a NAS-PDU attribute that contains a NAS Registration Request message; and
\- an AN-params attribute that contains access network parameters, such as
S-NSSAI, 5G-GUTI, etc. (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]).Further NAS messages between
the UE and the AMF, via the N3IWF, that are required to complete the
registration procedure shall be inserted in NAS-PDU attribute of an 5G-NAS
packet within EAP-Request/EAP-Response messages. If the authentication of the
UE completes successfully the UE receives the SECURITY MODE COMMAND request
from the AMF as described in subclause 8.5.1.1.2.1. The UE creates a NAS
security context and an N3IWF key as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24] and
request the completion of the EAP-5G session. The UE terminates the EAP-5G
session by sending an EAP-Request/5G-Complete message.
Editor's note: The message format of the EAP-Request/5G-Start, EAP-
Request/5G-NAS, EAP-Response/5G-NAS and EAP-Request/5G-Complete messages is
FFS.
When the N3IWF receives the EAP-Request/5G-Complete message and the N3IWF key
from AMF, the N3IWF shall respond with an EAP-Success packet. The UE and N3IWF
proceed to establish an IKE SA and signalling IPsec SA as described in
subclause 10.7.1.2.
An example of an EAP-5G session is shown in figure 10.7.1.3.1.
Figure 10.7.1.3.1: EAP-5G session for UE registration over non-3GPP access
#### 10.7.1.4 Abnormal cases in the UE
Editor\'s note: The abnormal cases in the UE for this specific procedure (not
specified in IETF RFC 7296 [36]) are FFS.
#### 10.7.1.5 Abnormal cases in the N3IWF
Editor\'s note: The abnormal cases in the N3IWF for this specific procedure
(not specified in IETF RFC 7296 [36]) are FFS.
### 10.7.2 User plane Ipse SA creation procedure for UE-requested PDU session
establishment
Editor\'s note: This subclause specifies user plane IPsec (additional child
SA) creation procedure for PDU session setup via untrusted non-3GPP access.
#### 10.7.2.1 General
The purpose of the Child SA creation procedure during the UE-requested PDU
session establishment is to establish a Child SA associating to the QoS
profiles of the PDU session. This procedure shall be initiated by the N3IWF.
One Child SA can be accoiated with one or more QoS profiles of the PDU
session. The N3IWF will determine the number of Child SAs to establish and the
QoS profiles associated with each Child SA based on local policies,
configuration and the QoS profiles received from the network.
#### 10.7.2.2 Child SA creation procedure initiation
The N3IWF shall initiate the Child SA creation procedure by sending a
CREATE_CHILD_SA request message to the UE as specified in IETF RFC 7296 [36].
The CREATE_CHILD_SA request message shall include:

# 11 Interworking with E-UTRAN connected to EPC
## 11.1 General
In order to interwork with E-UTRAN connected to EPC, the UE supporting both S1
mode and N1 mode can operate in single-registration mode or dual-registration
mode (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]). Support of single-registration mode is
mandatory for UEs supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode.
During the attach procedure or initial registration procedure, the mode for
intersystem change is selected if the UE supports both S1 mode and N1 mode,
and the network supports intersystem change. See 3GPP TS 24.301 [15] and
subclause 8.4.2.1 for further details.
## 11.2 Single-registration mode
### 11.2.1 General
If both 5GMM and EMM are enabled, a UE, which is capable of N1 mode and S1
mode in the single-registration mode, shall maintain one common registration
for 5GMM and EMM.
### 11.2.2 Coordination between 5GMM and EMM with N26 interface
A UE that is not registered shall be in state EMM-DEREGISTERED and in state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.
In N1 mode, upon successful registration procedure, the UE operating in the
single-registration mode shall enter substates 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE
and EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.
At intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE shall
stay in state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-
AVAILABLE and initiate a mobility registration update procedure.
In S1 mode, upon successful attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE
operating in the single-registration mode shall enter substates 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and EMM-REGISTERED.NOMRAL-SERVICE.
At intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 modein EMM-IDLE mode when no PDU
session context for which interworking to EPS is supported (specified in
subclause 11.2.4) is active, EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall move to state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED
and state EMM-DEREGISTERED and then initiate the attach procedure. If EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE
shall move to state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and state 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and initiate a tracking area updating procedure.
At intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when at least
one PDU session context for which interworking to EPS is supported (specified
in subclause 11.2.4) is active, the UE shall move to state EMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
initiate a tracking area updating procedure.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether and how the intersystem change for UEs
operating in the single-registration mode in a network supporting N26
interface is impacted due to PDU session context for which interworking to EPS
is not supported.
### 11.2.3 Coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface
A UE that is not registered shall be in state EMM-DEREGISTERED and in state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.
In N1 mode, upon successful registration procedure, the UE operating in the
single-registration mode shall enter substates 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE
and EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.
In S1 mode, upon successful attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE
operating in the single-registration mode shall enter substates 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and EMM-REGISTERED.NOMRAL-SERVICE.
At intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when at least
one PDU session context is active, the UE shall stay in state EMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and then
initiate the attach procedure with request type set to \"handover\" in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message if the UE supports the attach procedure with
request type set to \"handover\". After succesfully attached in S1 mode, the
UE shall transfer all other active PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by
initiating the PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to
\"handover\" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
Editor\'s note: If the UE does not support the attach procedure with request
type set to \"handover\", the UE behaviour is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The paragraph above only implements one option (the first
bullet, i.e. the attach procedure) for mobility from 5GC to EPC as specified
in subclause 5.17.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]. This implies neither that
implementing the other option (the second bullet, i.e. the TAU procedure) is
prohibited, nor that the implemented option is preferred by CT1. Zero, one, or
two of the two options can be implemented for the normative work.
Editor's note: If there is no PDU session context active in N1 mode, the UE
behaviour is FFS.
At intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE shall
stay in state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and state 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and then initiate the mobility registration update
procedure. After succesfully registered in N1 mode and if the handover PDU
session from EPC is supported by the AMF, the UE shall transfer all active PDN
connections from S1 mode to N1 mode by initiating the PDU session
establishment procedure with request type set to \"existing PDU session\". If
the handover PDU session from EPC is not supported by the AMF, the UE shall
re-establish PDU sessions corresponding to all active PDN connections by
initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to
\"initial request\".
### 11.2.4 Coordination between 5GSM and ESM
Interworking to EPS is supported for a PDU session context, if the context
includes one or more QoS rules each of which contains associated EPS bearer
identity, mapped EPS QoS parameters, mapped extended EPS QoS parameters, and
optionally a mapped traffic flow template. The QoS rule for the default QoS
flow does not need to contain a mapped traffic flow template. See coding of
the QoS rules in subclause 12.4.2.1.
Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE uses
the parameters from each PDU session context for which interworking to EPS is
supported to create corresponding default EPS bearer context and optinally
dedicated EPS bearer context(s) as follows:
\- the PDU session type of the PDU session context shall be mapped to the PDN
type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:
1) the PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";
2) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is \"IPv4\";
and
3) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is \"IPv6\";
\- the PDU address of the PDU session context shall be mapped to the PDN
address of the default EPS bearer context;
\- the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default EPS
bearer context;
\- for each PDU session context of a PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION PENDING the UE shall set the state of the mapped
default EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE; and
\- for any other PDU session context of a PDU session the UE shall set the
state of the mapped default EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.
Additionally, the UE shall set for each QoS flow in the PDU session context:
1) the EPS bearer identity to the EPS bearer identity received in the
parameters of a QoS rule for the QoS flow;
2) the EPS QoS parameters to the mapped EPS QoS parameters received in the
parameters of a QoS rule for the QoS flow;
3) the extended EPS QoS parameters to the mapped extended EPS QoS parameters
received in the parameters of a QoS rule for the QoS flow; and
4) the traffic flow template to the mapped traffic flow template received in
the parameters of a QoS rule for the QoS flow.
Interworking to 5GS is supported for a PDN connection, if the corresponding
default EPS bearer context includes a PDU session identity, session AMBR and
one or more QoS rules (see annex D.1).
Upon inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE
uses the parameters from the default EPS bearer context of each PDN connection
for which interworking to 5GS is supported to create a corresponding PDU
session context as follows:
\- the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context optionally associated with
locally available information associated with the PDN connection (either
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\") shall be mapped to the PDU session type of
the PDU session context as follows:
1) if the PDN type is \"non-IP\", the PDU session type is set to the locally
available information associated with the PDN connection (either \"Ethernet\"
or \"Unstructured\"), if available;
2) if the PDN type is \"IPv4\" the PDU session type is set to \"IPv4\"; and
3) if the PDN type is \"IPv6\", the PDU session type is set to \"IPv6\";
\- the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to PDU
address of the PDU session context;
\- the APN of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to the DNN of the
PDU session context;
\- for each default EPS bearer context in state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE or
BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING the UE shall set the state of the mapped PDU
session context to PDU SESSION ACTIVE; and
\- for any other default EPS bearer context the UE shall set the state of the
mapped PDU session context to PDU SESSION INACTIVE.
Additionally, the UE shall set:
\- the PDU session identity of the PDU session context to the PDU session
identity included by the UE in the protocol configuration options IE or
extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message; and
\- the session-AMBR of the PDU session context to the session-AMBR included by
the network in the protocol configuration options IE or extended protrocol
configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER REQUEST message;
and
for each EPS bearer context of the PDN connection, the UE shall create QoS
flow(s) each of which is associated with the QoS rule(s) received in the
protocol configuration options IE or extended protrocol configuration options
IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER REQUEST message, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER REQUEST message, and/or MODIFY EPS BEARER REQUEST message.
## 11.3 Dual-registration mode
If both 5GMM and EMM are enabled, a UE, which is capable of N1 mode and S1
mode in the dual-registration mode, shall maintain independent registrations
for 5GMM and EMM independently and coordination between 5GMM and EMM is not
needed. A UE operating in the dual-registration mode may register to N1 mode
only, S1 mode only, or to both N1 mode and S1 mode.
When no PDU session context is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode
yet, the UE may initiate the attach procedure if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is not supported by the MME. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is supported by the MME, the UE may initiate either the attach
procedure without PDN connection establishment or the attach procedure.
When at least one PDU session context is active and the UE has not registered
to S1 mode yet, the UE may initiate the attach procedure. If necessary, the UE
may transfer an active PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the
attach procedure with request type set to \"handover\" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message. After succesfully attached in S1 mode, if necessary, the UE
may transfer other active PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating
the PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to \"handover\" in the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation to determine which active PDU session is
transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode.
When the UE has not registered to N1 mode, the UE may initiate the initial
registration procedure. After succesfully registered in N1 mode, if necessary,
the UE may transfer one or more active PDN connections from S1 mode to N1 mode
by initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to
\"existing PDU session\".
NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation to determine which active PDN connection
is transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode.
If both the UE and the MME support EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the
UE that transferred all PDN connections to the 5GS, may stay in state EMM-
REGISTERED. Otherwise, the UE shall enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED upon
transferring all PDN connection to the 5GS.
## 11.4 Core Network selection
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode, when the UE needs to use one
or more functionalities not supported in 5GS but supported in EPS, the UE may
disable the N1 mode radio capabilities (see subclause 8.2.6).
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode and lower layers provide an
indication that the current E-UTRA cell is connected to both EPC and 5GCN, the
UE shall select a core network type (EPC or 5GCN) and provide the selected
core network type information to the lower layer during the initial
registration procedure.
Editor\'s note: The indication of the current E-UTRA cell is connected to both
5GCN and EPC provided by lower layers need to be defined by RAN WGs.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the UE selects a core network type, e.g. based
on UE local configuration on core network preference.

forward warning messages to NG-RAN and to subscribe to receive warning
delivery related notifications.
###### 12.1.1.2.2.4 NG-RAN functionality
The NG-RAN may interface to multiple AMFs.
The NG-RAN is responsible for:
1) Upon receipt of the WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-REQUEST message, prioritise its
resources and broadcast the warning message to the warning areas indicated in
the requested Warning area list;
2) Upon receipt of the KILL-REQUEST message, stop broadcasting the warning
message within for that area indicated in the requested Warning area list and
discard the warning message;
3) Inform the AMF that PWS information for some or all cells of the NG-RAN are
available for reloading from the CBCF if needed by sending a PWS RESTART-
INDICATION message to the AMF; and
4) Inform the AMF that ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells of the NG-
RAN has failed by sending a PWS FAILURE-INDICATION message to the AMF.

3GPP TS 23.041 [16].
CBC reuses existing SBc protocol interface for warning message delivery
between AMF and CBC.
###### 12.1.1.3.2.4 NG-RAN functionality
The NG-RAN may interface to multiple AMFs.
The NG-RAN is responsible for:
1) Upon receipt of the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message, prioritise its
resources and broadcast the warning message to the warning areas indicated in
the requested Warning area list;
2) Upon receipt of the KILL REQUEST message, stop broadcasting the warning
message within for that area indicated in the requested Warning area list and
discard the warning message;
3) Inform the AMF that PWS information for some or all cells of the NG-RAN are
available for reloading from the CBC if needed by sending a PWS RESTART-
INDICATION message to the AMF; and
4) Inform the AMF that ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells of the NG-
RAN has failed by sending a PWS FAILURE-INDICATION message to the AMF.
##### 12.1.1.3.3 NG-RAN Protocol Overview
**Legend:**
\- NBc application protocol (NBc-AP): Application layer protocol between CBC
and AMF. This protocol supports transfer of warning messages.
\- NG application protocol (NGAP): Application layer protocol between the
5G-RAN entity (eNodeB and/or gNodeB) and the AMF. The NGAP protocol is defined
in 3GPP TS 38.413 [28].
\- SCTP for the control plane (SCTP): This protocol guarantees delivery of
signalling messages between AMF and NG-RAN (N2) and between CBC and AMF (NBc).
SCTP is defined in IETF RFC 4960 [34].
Figure 12.1.1.3.3.1: CBC - NG-RAN
##### 12.1.1.3.4 CBC-AMF interface
The CBC network function uses Namf_Communication service to communicate with
the NG-RAN for sending warning request primitives and receiving warning
message delivery indication or restart/failure indication primitives.
The requirements are described by primitives.
The following table shows primitives that are expected to be supported using
AMF via Namf interface:

#### 12.1.1.4 Architecture alternative 3: Supporting PWS in 5GS to CBCF and
via PWS-IWF to CBC
##### 12.1.1.4.1 Overview
In this architecture alternative, the AMF interfaces with CBCF and NG-RAN to
enable PWS service with the interface between AMF and CBCF implemented as
service based interface. CBCF uses AMF communication services to forward
warning messages to NG-RAN and to subscribe to receive warning delivery
related notifications. As a deployment option an PWS-IWF can be used as
termination point of the service based interface (Ncbcf) and connect to a CBC
via SBc.
##### 12.1.1.4.2 Architecture description
###### 12.1.1.4.2.1 PWS architecture
Figure 12.1.1.4.2.1.1 shows the basic network structure of PWS architecture in
5GS.
Figure 12.1.1.4.2.1.1: PWS architecture
The cell broadcast centre function (CBCF) is part of the core network and
connected to the AMF via the Ncbcf service based interface. The cell broadcast
centre (CBC) is part of the core network and connected to the PWS-IWF via the
SBc interface. The PWS-IWF is part of the core network, connected to the AMF
via the Ncbcf service based interface and to the CBC via the SBc interface.
Reference point to support PWS architecture:
**N2:** Reference point between the NG-RAN and the AMF.
NOTE: NG-RAN can be NR based or E-UTRA based (See 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] and 3GPP
TS 38.413 [28]).
**SBc:** Reference point between the PWS-IWF and the CBC.
NOTE: SBc is specified for EPS (see 3GPP TS 23.041 [6]).
Service based interface to support PWS in 5GS:
**Namf:** Service-based interface exhibited by AMF.
**Ncbcf:** Service-based interface exhibited by CBCF or PWS-IWF.
The CBE and the interface between CBCF or CBC, and CBE are out of scope of
3GPP specifications.
###### 12.1.1.4.2.2 AMF functionality
The AMF may interface to one CBCF or PWS-IWF, or multiple CBCFs/PWS-IWFs (i.e.
combinations of CBCFs and/or PWS-IWFs). An AMF may interface to several NG-
RANs (i.e. combinations of gNodeBs and/or eNodeBs).
The AMF is responsible for:
1) Interpretation of commands from the CBCF or the CBC;
2) Storage of messages from the CBCF or the CBC;
3) Routing the WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-REQUEST message to the appropriate NG-RAN
entities upon receiving warning message request from the CBCF or the CBCF;
4) Routing the STOP-WARNING-REQUEST message to the appropriate NG-RAN entities
upon receiving STOP-WARNING-REQUEST message from CBCF or the CBC;
5) Warning message delivery success or failure notification
\- Providing to the CBCF, or optionally CBC via an PWS-IWF, acknowledgement of
successful execution of commands received from the CBCF or CBC;
\- Reporting to the CBCF, or optionally CBC via an PWS-IWF, failure when a
command received from the CBCF is not understood or cannot be executed; and
\- Reporting to the CBCF, or optionally CBC via an PWS-IWF, the Broadcast
completed area list, the Broadcast cancelled area list received from NG-RAN;
and
6) Forwarding PWS RESTART-INDICATION message and the PWS FAILURE-INDICATION
message received from NG-RAN entities to all CBCFs or CBCs that the AMF
interfaces with.
###### 12.1.1.4.2.3 CBCF functionality
CBCF is a network function in the 5G core network. The CBCF may be connected
to several AMFs. The CBCF may be connected to several CBEs. The CBCF shall be
responsible for the management of CBS messages as specified in subclause 5 of
3GPP TS 23.041 [16].
CBCF supports service based interface. CBCF uses AMF communication services to
forward warning messages to NG-RAN and to subscribe to receive warning
delivery related notifications.
###### 12.1.1.4.2.4 CBC functionality
CBC is a network function in the EPS core network. In the deployment option
using an PWS-IWF, the CBC functionality and requirements are specified 3GPP TS
23.041 [16].
###### 12.1.1.4.2.5 PWS-IWF functionality
The PWS-IWF is a logical function which functionality is to translate from
Ncbcf to SBc. The PWS-IWF may interface to one or multiple AMFs. The PWS-IWF
may interface to one or multiple CBCs.
NOTE: The present document describes logical functional entities, and how
these are realized in actual deployments is an implementation and deployment
issue. It can however be foreseen that the PWS-IWF functionality can be co-
located with the AMF, with the CBC, or deployed as a stand-alone network
function. At AMF/PWS-IWF co-location, the AMF/PWS-IWF entity provides a SBc
interface towards the CBC. At CBC/PWS-IWF co-location, the CBC/PWS-IWF
provides the Ncbcf interface towards the AMF. At stand-alone PWS-IWF, the PWS-
IWF provides the Ncbcf interface towards the AMF and the SBc interface towards
the CBC.
###### 12.1.1.4.2.6 NG-RAN functionality
The NG-RAN may interface to multiple AMFs.
The NG-RAN is responsible for:
1) Upon receipt of the WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-REQUEST message, prioritise its
resources and broadcast the warning message to the warning areas indicated in
the requested Warning area list;
2) Upon receipt of the KILL-REQUEST message, stop broadcasting the warning
message within for that area indicated in the requested Warning area list and
discard the warning message;
3) Inform the AMF that PWS information for some or all cells of the NG-RAN are
available for reloading from the CBCF if needed by sending a PWS RESTART-
INDICATION message to the AMF; and
4) Inform the AMF that ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells of the NG-
RAN has failed by sending a PWS FAILURE-INDICATION message to the AMF.
##### 12.1.1.4.3 Protocol Stack Overview
Figure 12.1.1.4.3.1 shows the protocol stacks of architecture alternative 3
without PWS-IWF. This alternative is identical to Architecture alternative 1.
Figure 12.1.1.4.3.1: CBCF - NG-RAN, without PWS-IWF
Figure 12.1.1.4.3.2 shows the protocol stacks of architecture alternative 3
with PWS-IWF. In this alternative the AMF protocol stack is identical to
architecture alternative 3 without PWS-IWF and to architecture alternative 1.
Additionally, in this alternative the CBC protocol stack is identical to the
CBC protocol stack in EPS PWS.

CBC is a legacy network element that is already widely deployed. It may be
already connected to BSCs/RNCs/MMEs as well as CBEs. Also NG-RAN can be either
NR or E-UTRA based. NG-eNB can connect to 5GC via N2 interface.
For operators that already deployed PWS services in their network, since SBc
is already used as interface between CBC and MME in the EPC network for
interfacing eNB, it would be desired that the same SBc interface can be used
between CBC and AMF in the NG-CN for interfacing NG-RAN including NG-eNB. If
the interface between AMF and CBC is defined to be service based, besides
implementation efforts, it would also require CBC to maintain separate
interfaces for same warning message delivery operations which is not desired.
For operators that have not deployed PWS services in their network, above
considerations due to existing deployment do not apply.
From the evaluation it can be seen that option 3 is the only option that
allows both new deployments of a fully service based core network and inter-
connection with existing non-service based CBC deployments. Therefore, option
3 is the most flexible alternative supporting legacy deployments, initial
service based and smooth migration from legacy to service based.
### 12.1.2 SMS over NAS
Editor's note: Both the names and codings of the SMS parameters sent from the
UE to the network and from the network to the UE are FFS.
#### 12.1.2.1 Registration requirements
##### 12.1.2.1.1 Initial registration initiation
If the UE requests to use SMS over NAS, the UE shall include the SMS requested
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and set:
1) the \"supported accesses\" bits of the SMS requested IE to:
A) \"SMS over NAS supported via 3GPP access only\" if the UE supports SMS
delivery over NAS via 3GPP access only; or
B) \"SMS over NAS supported via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access\" if the
UE supports SMS delivery over NAS via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access;
and
2) the \"one step\" bit of the SMS requested IE to:
A) \"MO SMS using one step approach not supported\" if the UE does not support
MO SMS using the one step approach in 5GMM-IDLE mode; or
B) \"MO SMS using one step approach supported\" if the UE supports MO SMS
using the one step approach in 5GMM-IDLE mode.
##### 12.1.2.1.2 Initial registration accepted by the network
If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message contained the SMS requested IE with the
supported accesses bits indicating that the UE supports SMS delivery over NAS
via 3GPP access only, or via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, and SMSF
selection is successful, then the AMF shall send the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message either:
a) prior to requesting activation of the SMS service from the SMSF; or
b) after the SMSF has confirmed that the activation of the SMS service was
successful;
NOTE: The decision in the AMF to perform a) or b) above is based upon
implementation.
Editor\'s note: For case a), consideration is needed when SMS activation
subsequently fails at the SMSF.
When sending the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall:
a) store the SMSF address and the contents of the SMS requested IE in the UE
5GMM context, and consider the UE available for SMS; and
b) include the SMS allowed IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with:
1) the \"allowed accesses\" bits of the SMS allowed IE to:
A) \"SMS over NAS supported via 3GPP access only\" if:
i) the UE has set the \"supported accesses\" bits of the SMS requested IE to
\"SMS over NAS supported via 3GPP access only\" and the network allows the SMS
delivery over NAS via 3GPP access; or
ii) the UE has set the \"supported accesses\" bits of the SMS requested IE to
\"SMS over NAS supported via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access\" and the
network allows the SMS delivery over NAS via 3GPP access only; or
B) \"SMS over NAS supported via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access\" if the
UE has set the \"supported accesses\" bits of the SMS requested IE to \"SMS
over NAS supported via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access\" and the network
allows the SMS delivery over NAS via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access; and
2) the \"one step\" bit of the SMS allowed IE to:
A) \"MO SMS using one step approach not allowed\" if the UE indicated the
support of the MO SMS using one step approach in 5GMM-IDLE mode or the network
does not allow the MO SMS using one step approach; or
B) \"MO SMS using one step approach allowed\" if the UE indicated the support
of the MO SMS using one step approach in 5GMM-IDLE mode and the network allows
the MO SMS using one step approach.
If SMSF selection in the AMF or SMS activation via the SMSF is not successful,
then the AMF shall not include the SMS allowed IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message.
If the AMF does not allow the use of SMS over NAS, then the AMF shall not
include the SMS allowed IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
##### 12.1.2.1.3 Mobility and periodic registration update initiation
The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the mobility registration
updating procedure by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF when
the UE needs to request the use of SMS over NAS transport or the current
requirements to use SMS over NAS transport change in the UE, as specified in
subclause 12.1.2.1.1.
When initiating a periodic registration update and the requirements to use SMS
over NAS transport have not changed in the UE, the UE shall not include the
SMS requested IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the UE no longer requires the use of SMS over NAS transport, then the UE
shall include the SMS requested IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with
the \"supported accesses\" bits set to \"SMS over NAS not supported\".
##### 12.1.2.1.4 Mobility and periodic registration update accepted by the
network
If the UE requests the use of SMS over NAS transport or the requirements to
use SMS over NAS transport change in the UE, the AMF shall follow the
procedures specified in subclause 12.1.2.1.2.If the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message contained the SMS requested IE with the \"supported accesses\" bits
set to \"SMS over NAS not supported\", then the AMF shall:
a) if an SMSF address is present in the 5GMM context, delete the SMSF address
from the 5GMM context;
b) mark the 5GMM context to indicate that SMS over NAS is not required by the
UE; and
NOTE: The AMF notifies the SMSF that the UE is deregistered from SMS over NAS.
c) not include the SMS allowed IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
### 12.1.3 Emergency services
#### 12.1.3.1 Indication of support of emergency services
During the registration procedure the AMF includes the emergency PDU session
service support indicator in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (see subclause
8.5.2.1).
Editor's note: The emergency PDU session service support indicator needs to be
aligned with the stage 2 as soon as procedural requirements are in place.
Editor's note: The emergency service support indicator needs to be added in
the subclause 8.5.2.1.
Editor's note: It is FFS in which information element of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message the emergency service support indicator is included.
The received emergency PDU session service support indicator shall be provided
to the upper layers in the UE.
Editor's note: The use of the emergency PDU session service support indicator
by upper layers is FFS.
#### 12.1.3.2 Handling of emergency service for the UE in limited service
state
If the UE in the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state requests to use
emergency services, the UE shall send REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the
5GS registration type IE set to \"emergency registration\".
The UE sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the 5GS registration type
IE set to \"emergency registration\" shall handle identities as follows:
\- if the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, then indicate the 5G-GUTI in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message;
\- if the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI and has a valid SUPI, then indicate
the SUPI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message; and
\- if the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI and does not have a SUPI, then
indicate the PEI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Editor\'s note: When REGISTRATION REQUEST message layout is defined, 5GS
registration type IE and 5GS mobile identity IE need to be included.
Editor\'s note: This subclause describes how to provide emergency bearer
services to the UE in limited services state.
#### 12.1.3.3 Emergency PDU session setup
Editor\'s note: This subclause describes the procedure of PDU session setup.
#### 12.1.3.4 Handling of local emergency numbers
The following mechanism of handling of local emergency numbers applies when
the UE accesses the 5GCN via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
Editor's note: The handling of the case where the UE registers to different
PLMNs via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access simultaneously and receive the
emergency number list from different PLMNs is FFS.
At successful completion of the registration procedure the operator of this
network may provide a list of local emergency numbers to the UE. Optionally to
each local emergency number either an emergency service category or an
associated sos-URN (i.e. URN with top level service type of \"sos\" as
specified in IETF RFC 5031 [69]) may be provided in the local emergency number
list. The emergency number list can be downloaded by the network to the UE at
successful completion of the registration procedure.
The UE shall store and use the local emergency number list received from the
network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the UICC or user
equipment to detect if the user dialled number is an emergency number and use
the corresponding sos-URN to initiate an UE detected emergency session. The UE
shall delete the emergency number list received from the network after
successful registration to a different network.
NOTE 1: The sos-URN used by the UE to setup the emergency session is either
the associated sos-URN or the sos-URN mapped to the emergency service category
(as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13]) if these additional information are
provided.
NOTE 2: The option to provide an emergency list to an UE and the related
content of this emergency list is optional and in responsibility of the
network operator where the UE is registered. This enables the network operator
to identify an emergency service and route the emergency session to the
responsible PSAP in accordance to national regulation.
Editor's note: It is FFS if there is a potential conflict with the emergency
numbers list received via an access and those on the UICC.
The network may send a list of local emergency numbers in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message (see subclause 8.5.2.1).
Editor's note: The emergency number list needs to be added in the subclause
8.5.2.1.
Editor's note: It is FFS in which information element of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message the emergency number list is included.
The local emergency numbers received from the network are valid only in
networks in the same country as where the UE received them and are only used
to establish emergency sessions in the PS domain.
#### 12.1.3.5 Security procedures for handling emergency services
Editor\'s note: This subclause describes the difference on the security aspect
between emergency services procedure and normal procedure.
#### 12.1.3.6 IMS emergency call reattempt
Upon request from upper layers to establish a PS emergency call, if the 5G
core network does not support the emergency PDU session service as described
in subclause 12.1.3.1 and when the UE selects the E-UTRA connected to EPC
according to the core network selection (5GC or EPC) as specified in 3GPP TS
23.501 [9], the UE shall:
\- if the UE operates in single-registration mode, disable the N1 mode radio
capabilities and then proceed with the domain selection as specified in 3GPP
TS.23.167 [8] annex H; and
\- if the UE operates in dual-registration mode, proceed with the domain
selection as specified in 3GPP TS.23.167 [8] annex H.
Editor\'s note: The requirement will be updated by taking RAN definition of
emergency service support indication into account for e.g., UE behavior when
the 5G core network supports the emergency PDU session service but the current
RAT does not.
Editor\'s note: The 5G core network selection requirement for emergency call
needs to be clarified in SA2.
### 12.1.4 Location services
LPP messages shall be transported between the UE and the AMF using the NAS
transport procedures specified in subclause 8.5.1.3.
Editor's note: It is FFS whether transport of supplementary service messages
for location services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.030 is needed in 5G System.
### 12.1.5 Multimedia priority services
#### 12.1.5.1 General
5GS supports MPS with functionality as described in subclause 5.16.5 in 3GPP
TS 23.501 [9]. MPS priority mechanisms can be classified as subscription-
related, invocation-related, and those applied to existing QoS Flows, as
described in subclause 5.22 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
MPS-specific exemptions are provided for 5GS mobility management and 5GS
session management.
#### 12.1.5.2 5GS mobility management priority mechanisms
Membership in the unique special access class assigned for MPS (based on
subclause 4.4A of 3GPP TS 22.011 [2]) provides certain 5GMM priority
treatments and exemptions to MPS-subscribed UEs.
An MPS-subscribed UE is configured with at least one access class in the range
11-15 on the USIM. A UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN shall be
exempt from NAS level 5GMM congestion controls.
Editor's note: NAS level 5GMM congestion control is FFS and will be captured
by CT1 based on stage 2 requirements.
A UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN shall be exempt from 5GMM
procedure backoff timers.
Editor's note: 5GMM procedure backoff timers are FFS.
A UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN shall be exempt from failed
service request procedure retry counter limitations.
Editor's note: Service request procedure retry counters are FFS.
For initial paging to deliver an MPS packet, the network shall initiate paging
procedure with paging priority.
If paging is in progress without priority, and an MPS packet arrives, the
network shall re-start the paging procedure with paging priority.
#### 12.1.5.3 5GS session management priority mechanisms
Membership in the unique special access class assigned for MPS (based on
subclause 4.4A of 3GPP TS 22.011 [2]) provides certain 5GSM priority
treatments and exemptions to UEs configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected
PLMN.
A UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN shall be exempt from 5GSM
procedure backoff timers associated with network congestion at the AMF or SMF.
Editor's note: DN level based congestion control is FFS and will be captured
by CT1 based on stage 2 requirements. 5GSM procedure backoff timers are FFS.
A UE configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN shall be exempt from 5GSM
procedure backoff timers associated with signaling for PDU sessions to
specific DNs.
## 12.2 Access control
### 12.2.1 Unified access control (Alternative 1)
#### 12.2.1.1 General
5GS supports a unified access control by which each access attempt is
categorized into one access category. The network can restrict the access on a
per-access category basis according to the requirement specified in 3GPP TS
22.261 [3].
Access categories include:
\- a set of standardized access categories specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3];
and
\- optionally, operator-specific categories defined using the format specified
in subclause 12.2.1.2.
An access attempt when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode is defined as any event
that requires a transition to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
An access attempt when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
with RRC inactive indication is defined as one of the following events:
1) an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication received from upper
layers;
2) a request to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS from upper layers
3) a request for a new PDU session establishment from upper layers;
4) a request for an existing PDU sessions modification from upper layers;
5) a request for a PDU session release from upper layers; and
6) a request to re-establish the user plane for an existing PDU session from
upper layers.
Editor\'s note: Additional vents qualifying as access attempts in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication are FFS.
#### 12.2.1.2 Operator-specific access categories
Operator-specific access categories can be signalled to the UE using the NAS
transport procedure specified in subclause 8.5.1.3, with:
\- the payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message containing one or
more access category definitions, each consisting of the following parameters:
Editor\'s note: The encoding of the operator-specific access categories in the
Payload container IE is FFS.
1) an access category number in the 32-63 range that uniquely identifies the
access category in the PLMN in which the access categories are being sent to
the UE;
2) a precedence value which indicates in which order the UE shall evaluate the
operator-specific categories for a match; and
3) one or more access category criteria type and associated access category
criteria type values. The access category criteria type can be set to one of
the following:
i) DNN name;
ii) QFI;
iii) 5QI;
iv) OS Id + OS App Id of application triggering the access attempt; or
v) S-NSSAI.
Editor\'s note: Other access category criteria types are FFS.
NOTE: An access category criteria type can be associated with more than one
access category criteria values. In this case, the access attempt matches the
access category if the access criteria for the access attempt matches any of
the associated access criteria type values.
\- the Payload container type IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message indicating
that the Payload container IE contains operator-specific access category
definitions:
Editor\'s note: The encoding of the Payload container type IE for operator-
specific access category definitions is FFS.
Upon receiving a DL NAS TRANSPORT message with a Payload container IE
indicating that the Payload container IE contains operator-specific access
category definitions, the UE shall store the operator-specific access category
definitions for the registered PLMN.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether additional mechanisms are needed to ensure
operator-specific access categories sent to the UE using NAS transport are
delivered reliably.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether other NAS control plane messages can be used
to send operator-specific access categories to the UE.
#### 12.2.1.3 Mapping of an access attempts to access category
When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the upper
layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into
one access category by performing the following steps in order until a match
between the access attempt and an access category is found:
\- The NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches standardized
access category 0 as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3];
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches standardized
access category 1 as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3];
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches standardized
access category 3 as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3];
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches any of the
operator-specific access categories stored in the UE for the registered PLMN,
in order of increasing precedence value; and
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches any of the
remaining standardized access categories as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3].
Editor\'s note: The precedence order of the access categories needs to be
confirmed by SA1.
When a match is found, the NAS shall pass the access category for which there
was a match to the lower layers.
NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.
NOTE 2: If, during an MMTEL voice session, MMTEL video session, SMSoIP
transport or emergency PDU session, the UE has moved back to 5GMM-IDLE mode
and needs to go to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, this is considered a new access
attempt and a new access barring check is performed by the lower layers.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS shall
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the access attempt.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS shall
not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the access
attempt. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is
granted, the NAS may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.
When the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 6) listed in subclause
12.2.1.1,, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access attempt into on
access category by performing the following steps in order until a match
between the access attempt and an access category is found:
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches standardized
access category 0 as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3]; and
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches standardized
access category 1 as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3];
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches standardized
access category 3 as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3];
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches any operator-
specific access categories stored in the UE for the registered PLMN in order
of increasing precedence value; and
\- the NAS shall evaluate whether the access attempt matches any of the
remaining standardized access categories as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3].
Editor\'s note: The precedence order of the access categories needs to be
confirmed by SA1.
When a match is found, the NAS shall pass the access category for which there
was a match to the lower layers.
NOTE 3: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS shall
take the following action depending on the event which triggered the access
attempt:
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-
started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started indication or an MO-SMSoIP-
attempt-started indication, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is allowed;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, the NAS shall initiate the
NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.2.3 to send the SMS in
an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers for a new PDU session establishment, the NAS shall initiate the UE-
requested PDU session establishment procedure as specified in subclause
9.5.2.2;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers for an existing PDU session modification, the NAS shall initiate the
UE-requested PDU session modification procedure as specified in subclause
9.5.4.2; and
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to re-establish the user plane for an existing PDU session, the NAS
shall initiate the service request procedure as specified in subclause
8.5.3.1.2.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS shall
take the following action depending on the event which triggered the access
attempt:
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-
started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started indication or an MO-SMSoIP-
attempt-started indication, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers
that access is granted, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that access is
granted;
NOTE 4: In this case prohibiting the initiation of the MMTEL voice session,
MMTEL video session or prohibiting sending of the SMS over IP is performed by
the upper layers.
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, the NAS shall not initiate
the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.2.3 to send the
SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message. Upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that access is granted, the NAS may initiate the NAS transport
procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.2.3 to send the SMS in an UL NAS
TRANSPORT message, if still needed;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers for a new PDU session establishment, the NAS shall not initiate the UE-
requested PDU session establishment procedure as specified in subclause
9.5.2.2. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is
granted, the NAS may initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure as specified in subclause 9.5.2.2, if still needed;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers for an existing PDU session modification, the NAS shall not initiate
the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure as specified in subclause
9.5.4.2. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is
granted, the NAS may initiate the UE-requested PDU session modification
procedure as specified in subclause 9.5.4.2, if still needed; and
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to re-establish the user plane for an existing PDU session, the NAS
shall not initiate the service request procedure as specified in subclause
8.5.3.1.2. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is
granted, the NAS may initiate the service request procedure as specified in
subclause 8.5.3.1.2, if still needed.
### 12.2.2 Access categories, access categorization and access control
checking (combined Alternative 2 and Alternative 1)
#### 12.2.2.1 General
When the UE wants to access the 5GS, the UE must first perform access control
checks to determine if the access is allowed. Access control checks shall be
perfomed for the access attempts defined by the [ ]{.underline} following list
of events:
\- the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access and an event that requires a
transition to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode occurs;
\- the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
with RRC inactive indication and one of the following events occurs:
1) 5GMM receives an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-
call-started indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication from upper
layers;
2) 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS
over NAS;
3) 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message for the purpose of PDU session establishment;
4) 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message for the purpose of PDU session modification; and
5) 5GMM receives a request to re-establish the user plane for an existing PDU
session.
NOTE 1: 5GMM specific procedures initiated by NAS in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode are
not subject to access control. E.g. a registration procedure after PS handover
will not be prevented by access control.
Editor\'s note: For the case that the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode when 5GMM
receives a request from an upper layer to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message, so
that the procedure for the initial NAS message is followed by a NAS transport
procedure, resolution of double barring is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Whether other events need to be considered in 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, is FFS.
When the NAS detects one of the above events, the NAS needs to perform the
mapping of the kind of request to one or more access identities and one access
category and lower layers will perform access barring checks for that request
based on the determined access identities and access category.
NOTE 2: The NAS is aware of the above events through indications provided by
upper layers or when determing the need to start 5GMM procedures through
normal NAS behaviour, or both.
To determine the access identities and the access category for a request, the
NAS checks the reason for access, types of service requested and profile of
the UE including UE configurations, against a set of access identities and
access categories defined in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], namely:
\- a set of standardized access identities;
\- a set of standardized access categories; and
\- a set of operator-defined access categories, if available.
For the purpose of determining the applicable access identities from the set
of standardized access identities defined in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], the NAS shall
follow the requirements set out in subclause 12.2.2.2 and the rules and
actions defined in table 12.2.2.2.1.
For the purpose of determining the applicable access category from the set of
standardized access categories and operator-defined access categories defined
in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], the NAS shall follow the requirements set out in
subclause 12.2.2.2 and the rules and actions defined in table 12.2.2.2.2.
#### 12.2.2.2 Determination of the access identities and access category
associated with a request for access
When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events listed in
subclause 12.2.2.1, the UE shall determine one or more access identities from
the set of standardized access identities, and one access category from the
set of standardized access categories and operator-defined access categories,
to be associated with that access attempt.
The set of the access identities applicable for the request is determined by
the UE in the following way:
\- for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in table
12.2.2.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is applicable in
the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise if it is applicable
in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and
\- if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access identity
0 is applicable.
**Table 12.2.2.2.1: Access Identities (according to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], table
6.22.2.2-1**)
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **Access Identity number** | **UE configuration** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 0 | UE is not configured with any | | | parameters from this table | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 1 (NOTE 1) | UE is configured for Multimedia | | | Priority Service (MPS). | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 2 (NOTE 2) | UE is configured for Mission | | | Critical Service (MCS). | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 3-10 | Reserved for future use | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 11 (NOTE 3) | Access Class 11 is configured in | | | the UE. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 12 (NOTE 3) | Access Class 12 is configured in | | | the UE. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 13 (NOTE 3) | Access Class 13 is configured in | | | the UE. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 14 (NOTE 3) | Access Class 14 is configured in | | | the UE. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 15 (NOTE 3) | Access Class 15 is configured in | | | the UE. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE 1: Access Identity 1 is | | | used to provide overrides | | | according to the subscription | | | information in UEs configured | | | for MPS.

For | | | this purpose the home country is | | | defined as the country of the | | | MCC part of the IMSI. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
In order to determine the access category applicable for the access attempt,
the NAS shall check the rules in table 12.2.2.2.2, and use the access category
for which there is a match for barring check. If the access attempt matches
more than one rule, the access category of the lowest rule number shall be
selected.

Editor\'s note: The need for and the derivation of the RRC establishment cause
(or its equivalence in 5GS) requires further work by RAN2.
#### 12.2.2.3 Operator-defined access categories
Operator-defined access categories can be signalled to the UE using NAS
signalling. Each operator-defined category consists of the following
parameters:
Editor\'s note: The encoding of the operator-defined access categories is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Whether the operator-defined access categories are sent to the
UE in a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, a DL NAS TRANSPORT message or
another NAS message, is FFS.
\- a precedence value which indicates in which order the UE shall evaluate the
operator-defined categories for a match;
\- an access category number in the 32-63 range that uniquely identifies the
access category in the PLMN in which the access categories are being sent to
the UE; and
\- one or more access category criteria type and associated access category
criteria type values. The access category criteria type can be set to one of
the following:
1) DNN name;
2) 5QI;
Editor\'s note: Whether the 5QI is a suitable access category criteria type is
FFS.
3) OS Id + OS App Id of application triggering the access attempt; or
4) S-NSSAI.
Editor\'s note: Other access category criteria types, in particular whether
QFI is a suitable parameter, are FFS.
NOTE: An access category criteria type can be associated with more than one
access category criteria values. In this case, the access attempt matches the
access category if the access criteria for the access attempt matches any of
the associated access criteria type values.
If the UE is configured with operator-defined access categories for a PLMN,
then access control in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication will only be performed for the events 1) to 5) defined in
subclause 12.2.2.1.
Editor\'s note: Whether access control in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication also needs to be performed when
5GMM receives an indication that an application is started including the OS Id
+ OS App Id from the upper layers is FFS.
Upon receiving a NAS signalling message with operator-defined access category
definitions, the UE shall store the operator-defined access category
definitions for the registered PLMN.
#### 12.2.2.4 Access control and checking
Editor\'s note: it is FFS whether the alleviation of barring is or is not
associated with the access category for which barring is alleviated.
##### 12.2.2.4.1 Access control and checking in 5GMM-IDLE mode
When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the upper
layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into
access identities and an access category following subclause 12.2.2.2, table
12.2.2.2.1 and table 12.2.2.2.2, and subclause 12.2.2.3, and provide the
applicable access identities and the access category to the lower layers for
the purpose of access control checking.
NOTE: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.
Editor\'s note: Whether the applicable access identities also need to be
provided to the lower layers based on other triggers is FFS.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS shall
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the access attempt.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS shall
not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the access
attempt. Additionally, if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, the NAS shall notify
the upper layers that the access attempt is barred. Upon receiving an
indication from the lower layers that access is granted, the NAS may initiate
the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed.
##### 12.2.2.4.2 Access control and checking in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and in
5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
When the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 5) listed in subclause
12.2.2.1, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access attempt into
access identities and an access category following subclause 12.2.2.2, table
12.2.2.2.1 and table 12.2.2.2.2, and subclause 12.2.2.3, and provide the
access identities and the access category to the lower layers for the purpose
of access control checking.
Editor\'s note: Whether one or more applicable access identities also need to
be provided to the lower layers based on other triggers is FFS.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS shall
take the following action depending on the event which triggered the access
attempt:
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-
started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started indication or an MO-SMSoIP-
attempt-started indication, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is allowed;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3 to send the SMS in an UL
NAS TRANSPORT message;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the NAS transport
procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3 to send the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to modify an existing PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3 to send the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message; and
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to re-
establish the user plane for an existing PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the
service request procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.3.1.2.
If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS shall
take the following action depending on the event which triggered the access
attempt:
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-
started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started indication or an MO-SMSoIP-
attempt-started indication, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers
that access is granted, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that access is
granted;
NOTE: In this case prohibiting the initiation of the MMTEL voice session,
MMTEL video session or prohibiting sending of the SMS over IP is performed by
the upper layers.
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall not initiate the
NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3 to send the SMS in
an UL NAS TRANSPORT message. Upon receiving an indication from the lower
layers that access is granted, 5GMM may initiate the NAS transport procedure
as specified in subclause 8.5.1.3 to send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message, if still needed;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall not initiate the NAS
transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is granted, the
NAS may initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause
8.5.1.3, if still needed;
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from upper
layers to modify an existing PDU session modification, 5GMM shall not initiate
the NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is
granted, the NAS may initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 8.5.1.3, if still needed; and
\- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to re-
establish the user plane for an existing PDU session, the NAS shall not
initiate the service request procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.3.1.2.
Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that access is granted, the
NAS may initiate the service request procedure as specified in subclause
8.5.3.1.2, if still needed.
#### 12.2.2.5 Exception handling and avoiding double barring
There are several services for which the NAS needs to be informed when the
service starts and stops,
\- because, while the service is ongoing, the mapping of other access attempts
to a specific access category can be affected; and
\- in order to avoid double barring at the start of these services.
These services are:
i) emergency service;
ii) MMTEL voice;
iii) MMTEL video;
iv) SMSoIP; and
v) SMS over NAS.
The UE considers an emergency service i) as started when 5GMM receives a
request from upper layers to attach for emergency services or to establish a
PDU session with request type = \"initial emergency request\". It considers
the emergency service as stopped when this PDU session is released.
While an emergency service i) is ongoing, any access attempt triggered by the
initiation of a registration, deregistration or service request procedure is
mapped to access category 2 = emergency.
Once the emergency service service has successfully passed access control,
then as long as the service is ongoing, the following access attempts are
allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to avoid
double barring:
\- any service request procedure related to the PDU session associated with
request type = \"initial emergency request\"; and
\- any service request or registration procedure initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode
for the purpose of NAS signalling connection recovery.
NOTE 1: Although the access control checking is skipped, the mapping is
performed in order to derive an RRC establishment cause.
Editor\'s note: The need for and the derivation of the RRC establishment cause
(or its equivalence in 5GS) requires further work by RAN2.
Editor\'s note: If MT LCS are used during an emergency service to locate the
UE, the 5GMM will transfer LCS messages to the network. It is FFS based on
which criteria the UE will determine to skip access control for these
messages.
For services ii) to v) the 5GMM receives explicit start and stop indications
from the upper layers.
Editor\'s note: Whether explicit start and stop indications for SMS over NAS
need to be defined is FFS.
Once the service has successfully passed access control, then as long as the
service is ongoing, the following access attempts are allowed to proceed
without further access control checking in order to avoid double barring:
\- for services ii), iii) and iv), any service request procedure related to
the PDU session established for DNN = \"IMS\"; and
Editor\'s note: It has been observed that some operators use an APN different
from \"IMS\" for SMSoIP. How to handle that case when a DNN different from
\"IMS\" is used, is FFS.
\- for services ii), iii), iv) and v), any service request or registration
procedure initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode for the purpose of NAS signalling
connection recovery.
While an MMTEL voice or video call, or SMS over IMS is ongoing, any of the
above access attempts is mapped to access category 5, 6 or 7 respectively.
NOTE 2: Although the access control checking is skipped, the mapping is
performed in order to derive an RRC establishment cause.
Editor\'s note: The need for and the derivation of the RRC establishment cause
(or its equivalence in 5GS) requires further work by RAN2.
### 12.2.3 Alternative 3
#### 12.2.3.1 General
5GS supports a unified access control by which each access attempt is
categorized into one access category. The network can restrict the access on a
per-access category basis according to the requirement specified in 3GPP TS
22.261 [3].
The access attempts for standardized access categories are described in
subclause 12.2.3.2.
Handling related to operator specific access categories is described in
subclause 12.2.3.2A.
The layers detecting the access attempts are described in subclause 12.2.3.3.
Providing the access category selection assistance information enabling
determination of applicability of access category 1 and of access category 2
is described in subclause 12.2.3.4.
Enforcement of unified access control is described in subclause 12.2.3.5.
#### 12.2.3.2 Access attempts for standardized access categories
Editor\'s note: precedence order among access categories potentially
applicable to an access attempt needs to be checked against stage-1.
Access attempts for the standardized access categories are specified in table
12.2.3.2.1 and table 12.2.3.2.2.

#### 12.2.3.2A Operator specific access categories
The serving PLMN can provide operator specific access categorization policy
(OSACP) to the UE.
The AMF shall include OSACP into the policy IE of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message and shall set the policy type IE of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message to \"operator specific access categorization policy\". The AMF
shall require a confirmation response in order to ensure that the policy has
been updated by the UE.
If the UE receives OSACP in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE
shall shall delete any previously stored OSACP and shall store the received
OSACP. The UE shall also delete the stored OSACP upon selection of a PLMN
other than the PLMN providing the stored OSACP, and when the UICC containing
the USIM is removed.
OSACP consists of OSACP rules.
Each OSACP rule consists of a precedence, a set of criteria and an operator
specific access category number (a number from the range 32-63).
Each criteria can be one of the following:
a) the access attempt relates to a PDU session with the requested DNN set to a
particular value.
b) the access attempt relates to an particular value of the 5QI of a QoS flow
of an uplink user data packet.
Editor\'s note: Other access category criteria types are FFS.
When deriving an access category for an access attempt assigned to a
standardized access category equal to or higher than 4 specified in table
12.2.x.2.1 and table 12.2.x.2.2, the UE evaluates whether the access attempt
matches an OSACP rule in the stored OSACP in decreasing order of precedence of
the OSACP rules.
If the access attempt matches an OSACP rule, the UE shall stop evaluation and
the UE shall consider that the operator specific access category indicated by
the operator specific access category number of the OSACP rule is applicable
for the access attempt.
If the access attempt matches no OSACP rule, the UE shall consider that no
operator specific access category is applicable for the access attempt.
The access attempt matches an OSACP rule if (and only if) all the criteria of
the OSACP rule are satisfied.
#### 12.2.3.3 Layers detecting the access attempts
The layers indicated in table 12.2.3.3.1 shall detect the access attempts
indicated in table 12.2.3.2.1 and table 12.2.3.2.2.
Table 12.2.3.3.1: Layers detecting access attempts

If access category 2 | | | is applicable according to | | | 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] and access | | | category 1 not applicable | | | according to | | | 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], then the | | | access category 2 is used | | | instead of the indicated access | | | category. | | | | | | NOTE 2: access categories 9-31 | | | are not shown as they are | | | reserved. | | | | | | NOTE 3: If access category 1 is | | | applicable according to | | | 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], then the | | | access category 1 is used | | | instead of the indicated access | | | category. If access category 1 | | | is not applicable according to | | | 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], and an | | | operator specific access | | | category is applicable according | | | to subclause 12.2.3.2A, then the | | | applicable operator specific | | | access category is used instead | | | of the indicated access | | | category. If access category 1 | | | is not applicable according to | | | 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], no | | | operator specific access | | | category is applicable according | | | to subclause 12.2.3.2A, and | | | access category 2 is applicable | | | according to | | | 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] then the | | | access category 2 is used | | | instead of the indicated access | | | category.. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
#### 12.2.3.4 Access category selection assistance information
In order to enable determination of applicability of access category 1 and of
access category 2 according to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3], the AS layer shall provide
to the NAS layer as shown in figure 12.2.3.4.1 an access category selection
assistance information consisting of:
a) information whether the access category 1 is applicable to:
1) a UE with access classes 11 configured in UICC;
2) a UE with access classes 12 configured in UICC;
3) a UE with access classes 13 configured in UICC;
4) a UE with access classes 14 configured in UICC;
5) a UE with access classes 15 configured in UICC; or
6) any combination of these; and
b) information whether the access category 2 is applicable to:
1) a UE configured for delay tolerant service and registered in UE's HPLMN or
UE\'s EHPLMN;
2) a UE configured for delay tolerant service and registered in UEs\' most
preferred VPLMN;
3) a UE configured for delay tolerant service and registered in a PLMN other
than UE's HPLMN, other than UE\'s EHPLMN and other than UEs\' most preferred
VPLMN; or
4) any combination of these.
Figure 12.2.3.4.1: AS - NAS interface for providing access category selection
assistance information.
#### 12.2.3.5 Enforcement of unified access control
The AS layer owns barring timers for all the access categories.
When an access attempt is about to start as shown in figure 12.2.3.5.1, the
layer indicated in the table 12.2.3.3.1 shall inform the NAS layer about start
of the access attempt NAS layer derives an access category for the access
attempt and asks the AS layer for authorization for the access category. If
not authorized, the layer indicated in the table 12.2.3.3.1 shall block the
access attempt. If authorized, the layer indicated in the table 12.2.3.3.1
proceeds with the access attempt.
NOTE: The AS layer does not perform blocking of access attempts indicated in
table 12.2.3.2.1 and table 12.2.3.2.2. The AS layer can perform blocking of
any AS layer specific access attempts, unrelated to transmission of NAS
control plane messages and unrelated to transmission of user data packets, if
defined by RAN2.
Figure 12.2.3.5.1: information flow when access attempt is about to start.
When the authorized access attempt is completed as shown in figure 12.2.x.5.2,
the layer indicated in the table 12.2.x.3.1 shall inform the NAS layer about
completion of the access attempt for the category.
Figure 12.2.x.5.2: information flow when an authorized access attempt stops
The NAS layer shall keep track of access categories with an ongoing authorized
access attempt.
Editors\' note: FFS whether the NAS uses information about access categories
with an ongoing authorized access attempt to derive establishment cause
indicated to AS layer when moving from moving from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode and when moving from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
## 12.3 Security
### 12.3.1 General
Security for the NAS signalling for 5GS Phase 1 is terminated in the UE and in
the AMF. The security protection for the NAS signalling includes ciphering and
integrity protection as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].
Security for the user-plane, as well as for AS signalling, is terminated in
the UE and in the NG-RAN.
The keys for NAS signalling security and user-plane security are agreed
between the AMF and the UE by means of a primary authentication and key
agreement procedure as described in subclause 8.5.1.1.
Authentication and authorization of PDU session establishment to an external
DN are performed between the SMF and the UE as described in subclause 9.5.3.
The SMF relies on an external DN-AAA server to authenticate and authorize the
UE\'s request for the establishment of a PDU sessions.
### 12.3.2 NAS security mode command
In order to provide NAS signalling security for 5GS there is an NAS security
function in both the UE and the AMF which performs integrity/replay protection
as well as enciphering/deciphering of NAS signalling messages. This NAS
security function is achieved by means of the NAS security mode control
procedure as described in subclause 8.5.1.2.
### 12.3.3 5G NAS security context
The security parameters for authentication, integrity protection and ciphering
are tied together in a 5G NAS security context and identified by a key set
identifier (ngKSI). The relationship between the security parameters is
defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].
Before security can be activated, the AMF and the UE need to establish a 5G
NAS security context. Usually, the 5G NAS security context is created as the
result of a primary authentication and key agreement procedure between the AMF
and the UE. Alternatively, during inter-system handover from S1 mode to N1
mode, the AMF and the UE derive a mapped 5G security context from an EPS
security context that has been established while the UE was in S1 mode.
The 5G NAS security context is taken into use by the UE and the AMF, when the
AMF initiates a NAS security mode control procedure or during the inter-system
handover procedure from S1 mode to N1 mode. The 5G NAS security context which
has been taken into use by the network most recently is called current 5G NAS
security context. This current 5G security context can be of type native or
mapped, i.e. originating from a native 5G NAS security context or mapped 5G
NAS security context.
The key set identifier ngKSI is assigned by the AMF either during the primary
authentication and key agreement procedure procedure or, for the mapped 5G NAS
security context, during the inter-system handover procedure. The ngKSI
consists of a value and a type of security context parameter indicating
whether a 5G NAS security context is a native 5G NAS security context or a
mapped 5G NAS security context. When the 5G NAS security context is a native
5G NAS security context, the ngKSI has the value of KSI~AMF~, and when the
current 5G NAS security context is of type mapped, the ngKSI has the value of
KSI~ASME~.
## 12.4 Quality of service (QoS)
### 12.4.1 General
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
#### 12.4.1.1 QoS rules
##### 12.4.1.1.1 General
In a PDU session of IPv4, IPv6, and Ethernet PDU session type, the NAS
protocol enables different forwarding treatments of UL user data packets in
one or more QoS flows based on signalled QoS rules, derived QoS rules or any
combination of them.
In a PDU session of Unstructured PDU session type, all UL user data packets
are associated with the same QoS flow.
##### 12.4.1.1.2 Signalled QoS rules
The NAS protocol enables the network to provide the UE with signalled QoS
rules associated with a PDU session.
The network can provide the UE with one or more signalled QoS rules associated
with a PDU session at the PDU session establishment or at QoS flow
establishment.
Each signalled QoS rule contains:
a) an indication of whether the QoS rule is the default QoS rule;
b) a QoS rule identifier (QRI);
c) a QoS flow identifier (QFI);
d) optionally a set of packet filters. If the QoS rule is not the default QoS
rule, the set of packet filters is included and contains at least one packet
filter for UL direction or at least one packet filter for both UL and DL
directions;
e) a precedence value;
f) if the flow is a GBR QoS flow:
1) Guaranteed flow bit rate (GFBR) for UL;
2) Guaranteed flow bit rate (GFBR) for DL;
3) Maximum flow bit rate (MFBR) for UL;
4) Maximum flow bit rate (MFBR) for DL;
5) optionally averaging window for UL; and
6) optionally averaging window for DL; and
g) 5QI, if the QFI is not the same as the 5QI of the QoS flow identified by
the QFI; and
h) optionally a EPS bearer identity (EBI), mapped EPS QoS parameters, mapped
extended EPS QoS parameters and mapped traffic flow template if the QoS flow
can be mapped to an EPS bearer as specified in subclause 4.11.2 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [9].
If the UE requests a new QoS flow, it shall assign a precedence value for the
signalled QoS rule which is not in the range from 70 to 99 (decimal).
If the averaging window for UL is not included in a QoS rule for a GBR QoS
flow with a 5QI indicated in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] table 5.7.4-1, the averaging
window associated with the 5QI in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] table 5.7.4-1 applies for
the averaging window for UL. If the averaging window for DL is not included in
a QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow with a 5QI indicated in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] table
5.7.4-1, the averaging window associated with the 5QI in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]
table 5.7.4-1 applies for the averaging window for DL.
If the averaging window for UL is not included in a QoS rule for a GBR QoS
flow with a 5QI not indicated in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] table 5.7.4-1, the
standardized value of two seconds is used as the averaging window for UL. If
the averaging window for DL is not included in a QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow
with a 5QI not indicated in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] table 5.7.4-1, the standardized
value of two seconds is used as the averaging window for DL.
Editor\'s note: The need of the averaging window for DL is FFS.
Within a PDU session:
a) each signalled QoS rule has a unique QRI;
b) there is at least one signalled QoS rule;
c) there can be zero, one or more signalled QoS rules associated with a given
QFI; and
d) there can be up to one signalled QoS rule without a set of packet filters.
##### 12.4.1.1.3 Derived QoS rules
The reflective QoS in the UE creates derived QoS rules associated with a PDU
session based on DL user data packets received via the PDU session.
Each derived QoS rule contains:
a) a QoS flow identifier (QFI);
b) a packet filter for UL direction; and
c) a precedence value of 80 (decimal).
NOTE: On the network side, the corresponding QoS rule can be associated with a
different precedence value in the range from 70 to 99 (decimal).
Within a PDU session:
a) there can be zero, one or more derived QoS rules associated with a given
QFI; and
b) there can be up to one derived QoS rule associated with a given packet
filter for UL direction.
In the UE, a timer X runs for each derived QoS rule.
Editor's note: Creation and maintaining of derived QoS rules generates
additional requirements for the UE processing capacity. The UE can support
only a limited number of concurrent derived QoS rules. Whether the maximum
number of concurrent derived QoS rules should be standardized or
implementation specific is FFS.
Editor's note: The UE actions when the maximum number of concurrent derived
QoS rules is exceeded (e.g. whether the UE deletes the least used derived QoS
rule or stop deriving new QoS rules etc.) is FFS.
#### 12.4.1.2 Session-AMBR
The NAS protocol enables the network to provide the UE with the session-AMBR
associated with a PDU session.
The standardized value of two seconds is used as the averaging window for the
UE\'s enforcement of the UL rate limitation indicated by the session-AMBR.
#### 12.4.1.3 UL user data packet matching
Upon receiving an UL user data packet from the upper layers for transmission
via a PDU session, the UE shall attempt to associate the UL user data packet
with:
a) the QFI of a signalled QoS rule associated with the PDU session which has a
set of packet filters containing a packet filter for UL direction matching the
UL user data packet or containing a packet filter for both UL and DL
directions matching the UL user data packet;
b) the QFI of a derived QoS rule associated with the PDU session which has the
packet filter for UL direction matching the UL user data packet; or
c) the QFI of a signalled QoS rule associated with the PDU session which does
not have a set of packet filters or has a set of packet filters not containing
a packet filter for UL direction and not containing a packet filter for both
UL and DL directions;
by evaluating the QoS rules in increasing order of their precedence values
until the UL user data packet is associated with a QFI or all QoS rules are
evaluated.
If the UL user data packet is associated with a QFI, the UE shall pass the QFI
along the UL user data packet to the lower layers for transmission.
NOTE: Marking of the UL user data packet with the QFI is performed by the
lower layers.
If all QoS rules are evaluated and the UL user data packet is not associated
with a QFI, the UE shall discard the UL user data packet.
#### 12.4.1.4 Reflective QoS
##### 12.4.1.4.1 General
The UE may support reflective QoS.
If the UE supports the reflective QoS, the UE shall support the procedures in
the following subclauses.
The reflective QoS is applicable in a PDU session of IPv4, IPv6 and Ethernet
PDU session type. The reflective QoS is not applicable in a PDU session of
Unstructured PDU session type.
##### 12.4.1.4.2 Derivation of packet filter for UL direction from DL user
data packet
The UE shall derive a packet filter for UL direction from a DL user data
packet as follows:
a) if the received DL user data packet belongs to a PDU session IPv4 PDU
session type, the packet filter for UL direction contains the following packet
filter components:
1) an IPv4 remote address component set to the source IP address of the
received DL user data packet;
2) an IPv4 local address component set to the destination IP address of the
received DL user data packet;
3) a Protocol identifier/Next header type component set to the value of the
received protocol type field; and
4) if the received protocol type field indicates a protocol specifying usage
of ports:
A) a Single local port type component set to value of the destination port in
the received DL user data packet; and
B) a Single remote port type component set to the value of the source port in
the received DL user data packet;
b) if the received DL user data packet belongs to a PDU session of IPv6 PDU
session type, the packet filter for UL direction contains the following packet
filter components:
1) an IPv6 remote address/prefix length component set to the source IP address
of the received DL user data packet;
2) an IPv6 local address/prefix length component set to the destination IP
address of the received DL user data packet;
3) a Protocol identifier/Next header type component set to the value of the
last received next header field; and
4) if the last received next header field indicates a protocol specifying
usage of ports:
A) a Single local port type component set to value of the destination port in
the received DL user data packet; and
B) a Single remote port type component set to the value of the source port in
the received DL user data packet; and
c) if the received DL user data packet belongs to a PDU session of Ethernet
PDU session type, the packet filter for UL direction contains the following
packet filter components:
1) a destination MAC address component set to the source MAC address of the
received DL packet;
2) a source MAC address component set to the destination MAC address of the
received DL packet;
3) if an 802.1Q C-TAG is included in the received DL packet, an 802.1Q C-TAG
VID component set to the 802.1Q C-TAG VID of the received DL packet and an
802.1Q C-TAG PCP/DEI component set to the 802.1Q C-TAG PCP/DEI of the received
DL packet;
4) if an 802.1Q S-TAG is included in the received DL packet, an 802.1Q S-TAG
VID component set to the 802.1Q S-TAG VID of the received DL packet and an
802.1Q S-TAG PCP/DEI component set to the 802.1Q S-TAG PCP/DEI of the received
DL packet;
5) If the Ethertype field of the received DL packet is set to a value of 1536
or above, an Ethertype component set to the Ethertype of the received DL
packet;
6) if the Ethertype field of the Ethernet frame header indicates that the data
carried in the Ethernet frame is IPv4 data, the UE shall also add to the
packet filter for UL direction IP-specific components based on the contents of
the DL user data IP header as described in bullet a) above; and
7) if the Ethertype field of the Ethernet frame header indicates that the data
carried in the Ethernet frame is IPv6 data, the UE shall also add to the
packet filter for UL direction IP-specific components based on the contents of
the DL user data IP header as described in bullet b) above.
##### 12.4.1.4.3 Creating a derived QoS rule by reflective QoS in the UE
If the UE receives a DL user data packet marked with a QFI and an RQI, the DL
user data packet belongs to a PDU session of IPv4, IPv6, or Ethernet PDU
session type, and the UE does not have a derived QoS rule with the same packet
filter for UL direction as the packet filter for UL direction derived from the
DL user data packet as specified in subclause 12.4.1.4.2, then the UE shall
create a new derived QoS rule as follows:
a) the QFI of the derived QoS rule is set to the received QFI;
b) the precedence value of the derived QoS rule is set to a default
standardized precedence value; and
Editor\'s note: FFS what is the default standardized precedence value.
c) the packet filter for UL direction of the derived QoS rule is set to the
derived packet filter for UL direction;
and the UE shall start the timer X associated with the derived QoS rule with
the RQ timer value received during the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure as specified in subclause 9.5.3. If the RQ timer value was not
received in the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure, the default
standardized RQ timer value is used.
Editor\'s note: FFS what is the default standardized RQ timer value.
##### 12.4.1.4.4 fUpdating a derived QoS rule by reflective QoS in the UE
If the UE receives a DL user data packet associated with a QFI and an RQI, the
DL user data packet belongs to a PDU session of IPv4, IPv6, or Ethernet PDU
session type, and the UE has a derived QoS rule with the same packet filter
for UL direction as the packet filter for UL direction derived from the DL
user data packet as specified in subclause 12.4.1.4.2, then the UE shall re-
start the timer X associated with the derived QoS rule with the RQ timer value
received during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as
specified in subclause 9.5.3. If the RQ timer value was not received in the
UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure, the default standardized RQ
timer value is used.
Editor\'s note: FFS what is the default standardized RQ timer value.
Additionally, if the QFI value associated with the DL user data packet is
different from the QFI value stored for the derived QoS rule, then the UE
shall replace the QFI value stored for the derived QoS rule with the new QFI
value for the derived QoS rule.
##### 12.4.1.4.5 Deleting a derived QoS rule by reflective QoS in the UE
Upon expiration of timer X associated with a derived QoS rule, the UE shall
remove the derived QoS rule.
Upon release of the PDU session, the UE shall remove the derived QoS rule(s)
associated with the PDU session.
### 12.4.2 QoS coding
#### 12.4.2.1 QoS rules coding
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
The purpose of the QoS rules information element is to specify the set of
parameters that are used by the UE:
\- for classification and marking of uplink user traffic; and
\- for identification of a QoS flow which the network is to use for a
particular downlink user traffic.
NOTE: The UE needs to be aware of a QoS flow which the network is to use for a
particular downlink user traffic e.g. to determine whether a resource is
available for downlink media of a media stream of an SDP media description
provided by the UE in an IMS session.
The QoS rules may contain a set of packet filters consisting of zero or more
packet filters for UL direction, zero or more packet filters for DL direction,
zero or more packet filters for both UL and DL directions or any combinations
of these. The set of packet filters determine the traffic mapping to QoS
flows. The QoS rules may contain a EPS bearer identity (EBI), mapped EPS QoS
parameters, mapped extended EPS QoS parameters and mapped traffic flow
template if the QoS flow can be mapped to an EPS bearer as specified in
subclause 4.11.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
The QoS _rules_ information element is a type 6 information element with a
minimum length of 7 octets. The maximum length for the information element is
65538 octets.
The QoS rules information element is coded as shown in figure 12.4.2.1.1 and
table 12.4.2.1.1.

#### 12.4.2.2 Session-AMBR coding
Editor\'s note: The content of this sub-clause has been moved to 3GPP TS
24.501 [17], and therefore this sub-clause is no longer maintained.
The purpose of the Session-AMBR information element is to indicate the initial
subscribed PDU session aggregate maximum bit rate when the UE establishes a
PDU session or to indicate the new subscribed PDU session aggregate maximum
bit rate if it is changed by the network.
The Session-AMBR information element is coded as shown in figure 12.4.2.2.1
and table 12.4.2.2.1.
The Session-AMBR is a type 4 information element with a length of 8 octets.

## 12.5 IM CN subsystem
### 12.5.1 IMS voice over PS Session supported Indication
The network informs the UE about the support of IMS voice over PS session
during the registration procedure. In a UE with IMS voice over PS session
capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator (IMS VoPS) shall be
provided to the upper layers. When initiating a voice call, the upper layers
take the IMS voice over PS session support indicator into account for the
access domain selection.
During the registration procedure the AMF includes the IMS voice over PS
session supported indicator in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (see subclause
8.5.1.1).
Editor's note: The emergency PDU session service support indicator needs to be
aligned with the stage 2 as soon as procedural requirements are in place.
Editor's note: The emergency service support indicator needs to be added in
the subclause 8.5.2.1.
Editor's note: It is FFS in which information element of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message the emergency service support indicator is included.
When indicating support of IMS voice over PS session to the UE, the AMF should
take into account the following factors:
1) the local policy of the PLMN to which the AMF belongs;
2) the capabilities of the network including: IMS voice over PS session
capability of 5GCN and EPC, IMS voice over PS session capability of NR
connected to 5GCN, IMS voice over PS session capability of E-UTRA connected to
5GCN, PS handover to E-UTRA connected to 5GCN capability of NR connected to
5GCN, and PS handover to E-UTRA connected to EPC capability of NR connected to
5GCN;
3) the capabilities of the UE including: PS handover to E-UTRAN capability;
and
4) the roaming agreement between the VPLMN and the HPLMN.
### 12.5.2 P-CSCF address delivery
When the UE requests to establish a PDU session, which can be used for IMS
services, the UE includes in the ePCO IE contained in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message (see subclause 9.6.3) the request for P-CSCF
IPv4 address or P-CSCF IPv6 address or both. The AMF forwards the ePCO IE
transparently via N11 interface towards the SMF.
When receiving an 5GSM request message containing a P-CSCF address request on
the N11 interface, the SMF includes the locally configured P-CSCF address(es)
in the ePCO IE of the corresponding 5GSM response message.
## 12.6 Network sharing
Within the 5GS, a single network can be shared by multiple participating
operators. The shared network includes the NG-RAN and the shared resources
include radio resources.
In a shared network, the UE shall choose one of the PLMN identifiers as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7].
Editor\'s note: It is expected that 3GPP TS 23.122 is updated to refer 3GPP TS
38.304 in describing that the AS indicates multiple PLMN identifiers to the
NAS in case of a shared NG-RAN.
In case of a shared network, one or more TACs and multiple PLMN identifiers
are broadcast and the UE shall construct the TAI of the cell from the chosen
PLMN identifier and the TAC associated with the chosen PLMN identifier, if
needed.
Editor\'s note: The above paragraph can be modified according to the
information broadcast by a shared NG-RAN.
## 12.7 Congestion and overload control
### 12.7.1 Handling of NAS level mobility management congestion control
The AMF may detect 5GMM signalling congestion and perform General NAS level
congestion control. Under the 5GMM signalling congestion conditions the AMF
may reject 5GMM signalling requests from UEs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[9]. The AMF should not reject the following request:
\- requests for emergency services; and
\- requests from UEs configured to use AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN.
When General NAS level congestion control is active, the AMF may include a
value for the mobility management back-off timer T3346 in the reject messages.
The UE starts the timer T3346 with the value received in the 5GMM reject
messages. To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred
requests, the AMF should select the value for the timer T3346 for the rejected
UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised.
If the timer T3346 is running when the UE enters state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the
UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then the
timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T3346 is running, the UE shall behave
as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same:
\- let t1 be the time remaining for T3346 timeout at switch off and let t be
the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t,
then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of
determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
> Editor\'s note: Whether dual priority is supported in 5GS and how it is
> handled in the NAS level 5GMM congestion control are FFS**.**
If the UE enters a new PLMN while timer T3346 is running, and the new PLMN is
not equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started timer T3346, the UE shall stop
timer T3346 when initiating 5GMM procedures in the new PLMN.
### 12.7.2 Handling of DNN based congestion control
The network may detect and start performing DNN based congestion control when
one or more DNN congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] are
met. The network may store a DNN congestion back-off timer on a per UE and
congested DNN basis. If the UE does not provide a DNN for a non-emergency PDU
session, then the SMF uses the selected DNN.
In the UE, 5GS session management timers T35ab for DNN based congestion
control are started and stopped on a per DNN basis.
In case the timer T35ab is provided during the PDU session establishment
procedure, the DNN associated with T35ab is the DNN provided by the UE when
the PDU session is established. If no DNN is provided by the UE along the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, then T35ab is associated with no DNN. For this
purpose the UE shall memorize the DNN provided to the network during the PDU
session establishment. The timer T35ab associated with no DNN will never be
started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session. If the
timer T35ab associated with no DNN is running, it does not affect the ability
of the UE to request an emergency PDU session.
In case the timer T35ab is provided during the UE-requested PDU session
modification procedure or the network-requested PDU session release procedure,
the DNN associated with T35ab is the DNN associated with the PDU session
corresponding to the 5GSM procedure.
If T35ab is running or is deactivated, and the UE is a UE configured to use
AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GSM session
management procedure for the respective DNN.
Editor\'s note: How to capture the aspect of Group specific NAS level
congestion control is FFS.
### 12.7.3 Handling of S-NSSAI based congestion control
The network may detect and start performing S-NSSAI based congestion control
when one or more S-NSSAI congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[9] are met. The network may store a S-NSSAI congestion back-off timer on a
per UE, S-NSSAI, and DNN basis. If the UE does not provide a DNN for a non-
emergency PDU session, then the SMF uses the selected DNN.
In the UE, 5GS session management timers T35cd for the S-NSSAI based
congestion control are started and stopped on a per DNN and S-NSSAI basis.
In case the timer T35cd is provided during the PDU session establishment
procedure, the S-NSSAI associated with T35cd is the S-NSSAI provided by the UE
when the PDU session is established. The DNN associated with T35cd is the DNN
provided by the UE when the PDU session is established. If no DNN is provided
by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, then T35cd is
associated with no DNN and S-NSSAI provided to the network during the PDU
session establishment. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the DNN and
S-NSSAI provided to the network during the PDU session establishment. The
timer T35cd associated with no DNN and an S-NSSAI will never be started due to
any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session. If the timer T35cd
associated with no DNN and a S-NSSAI is running, it does not affect the
ability of the UE to request an emergency PDU session.
In case the timer T35cd is provided during the UE-requested PDU session
modification procedure or the network-requested PDU session release procedure,
the S-NSSAI and DNN associated with T35cd are the S-NSSAI and DNN associated
with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure.
If T35cd is running or is deactivated, and the UE is a UE configured to use
AC11 -- 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GSM session
management procedure for the respective DNN and an S-NSSAI.
Editor\'s note: How to capture the aspect of Group specific NAS level
congestion control is FFS.
Editor\'s note: S-NSSAI based congestion control by AMF is FFS.
## 12.8 Charging
The charging architecture and functionalities for 5GS Phase 1 are studied in
3GPP TR 32.899 [23]. Network slicing aspects and provisioning for 5GS Phase 1
are captured in 3GPP TS 28.530 [20] and 3GPP TS 28.531 [21].
At present, no 5GS Phase 1 charging reqjuirements to NAS protocols have been
identified but are not excluded.
NOTE: Charging aspects for 5GS Phase 1 which can impact NAS protocols has to
be considered and depend on SA5 work but currently not outlined in 3GPP TS
28.530, 3GPP TS 28.531 or 3GPP TR 32.899.
## 12.9 Mission critical services
3GPP TS 23.501 [9] specifies that a mission critical service (MCS) requires a
subscription in place for both 5G QoS profile and the necessary policies. The
standardized 5QI values 65, 69 and 70 are mapped to QoS characteristics for
MCS (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9] subclause 5.7.4).
When the network needs to provide the UE with signalled QoS rules that
includes a 5QI associated with a PDU session for MCS, a standardized 5QI value
may be used for MCS (see sub-clause 12.4.2.1).
# 13 Network slicing
## 13.1 General
The 5GS supports network slicing as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]. Within a
PLMN, a network slice is identified by an S-NSSAI, which is comprised of a
slice/service type (SST) and a slice differentiator (SD). Inclusion of an SD
in an S-NSSAI is optional. A set of one or more S-NSSAIs is called the NSSAI.
There are multiple types of NSSAI (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]):
\- configured NSSAI;
\- requested NSSAI;
\- allowed NSSAI;
\- subscribed NSSAI;
\- temporarily rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN;
\- permanently rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN.
\- temporarily rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and registration area
combination; and
\- permanently rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and registration area
combination.
The HPLMN may configure a UE with the configured NSSAI per PLMN.
Editor\'s note: Terms on network slicing can be revisited.
## 13.2 Mobility management aspects
### 13.2.1 General
Upon registration to a PLMN, the UE shall send to the AMF the requested NSSAI
including one or more S-NSSAIs corresponding to the slice(s) to which the UE
wishes to register if the UE has a configured NSSAI and/or an allowed NSSAI
for the PLMN according to the rules defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]. The UE NAS
shall also provide the lower layers with the requested NSSAI, if available. If
the UE has neither a configured NSSAI nor an allowed NSSAI for a PLMN, the UE
does not send a requested NSSAI when requesting registration towards the PLMN.
In roaming scenarios the requested NSSAI, included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message shall include only the S-NSSAI values that are valid in the VPLMN. The
AMF verifies if the requested NSSAI is permitted based on the subscribed NSSAI
in the UE subscription, and if so then the AMF may provide the UE with the
allowed NSSAI for the PLMN. The AMF may also query the NSSF to determine the
allowed NSSAI for a given registration area. See subclause 8.5.2.2for further
details.
The set of network slice(s) for a UE can be changed at any time while the UE
is registered to a PLMN, and may be initiated by the network, or the UE. In
this case, the allowed NSSAI and associated registration area may be changed
during the registration procedure. The network may notify the UE of the change
of the supported network slice(s) in order to trigger the registration
procedure. Change in the allowed NSSAI may lead to AMF relocation subject to
operator policy.
A single UE can be served by at most eight slices at a time. Multiple
instances of S-NSSAI may be deployed in a given registration area; each of the
network slice instance can correspond to one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed
NSSAI. The AMF is common across multiple such slice instances.
Editor\'s note: The subclause for the notification procedure will be included
in the TR and the subclause will be referred.
### 13.2.2 NSSAI storage
Each of the configured NSSAI, allowed NSSAI, temporarily rejected NSSAI(s),
and permanently rejected NSSA(s)I is a set composed of at most 8 S-NSSAIs
associated with a PLMN identity. The S-NSSAI(s) in the temporarily rejected
NSSAI for the current PLMN and registration area combination and permanently
rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and registration area combination may be
further associated with a registration area where the rejected S-NSSAI is not
available. There shall be no duplicated PLMN identities in each of the list of
configured NSSAI(s), allowed NSSAI(s) , temporarily rejected NSSAI(s), and
permanently rejected NSSAI(s).
If available, the configured NSSAI(s), allowed NSSAI(s) , temporarily rejected
NSSAI(s), and permanently rejected NSSAI(s) shall be stored in a non-volatile
memory in the ME together with the SUPI from the USIM per PLMN. Those NSSAIs
can only be used if the SUPI from the USIM matches the SUPI stored in the non-
volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete them.
The UE stores (S-)NSSAIs as follows:
The configured NSSAI shall be stored until a new configured NSSAI is received
for a given PLMN. When provisioned with a new configured NSSAI for a PLMN, the
UE shall replace any stored configured NSSAI for this PLMN with the new
configured NSSAI, and delete any stored allowed NSSAI, temporarily rejected
NSSAI(s), and permanently rejected NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN.
The allowed NSSAI shall be stored, including when the UE is switched off,
until a new allowed NSSAI is received for a given PLMN. When a new allowed
NSSAI for a PLMN is received, the UE shall replace any stored allowed NSSAI
for the current PLMN with this new allowed NSSAI.
When the UE receives the S-NSSAI(s) included in rejected NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall store the S-NSSAI(s) into
temporarily rejected NSSAI(s) or permanently rejected NSSAI based on the
associated rejection cause(s). Once the UE is deregistered, the temporarily
rejected NSSAI(s) and permanently rejected NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN shall
be deleted.
Editor\'s note: Other conditions when the UE shall delete S-NSSAI(s) from
temporarily rejected NSSAI are FFS.
T**he network may provide to the UE mapping information as to how the
S-NSSAI(s) in the allowed NSSAI maps to S-NSSAI(s) in the configured NSSAI in
the UE. The UE shall store this mapping information** in the ME and use this
information for creating appropriate PDU requests.
Editor's note: The content of the mapping information as to how a particular
S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI maps to a S-NSSAI in the configured NSSAI in the
UE, and how it is conveyed to the UE, are FFS.
## 13.3 Session management aspects
### 13.3.1 General
In order to enable PDU transmission in a network slice, the UE may request
establishment of a PDU session in a network slice towards a data network (DN)
which is associated with an S-NSSAI and a data network name (DNN) if there is
no established PDU session adequate for the PDU transmission. The S-NSSAI
included is part of allowed NSSAI and in roaming scenarios the S-NSSAI value
is valid in VPLMN. See subclause 9.5.3 for further details. The UE determines
whether to establish a new PDU session or use one of the established PDU
session(s) based on NSSP.
### 13.3.2 NSSP
NSSP is a set of one or more NSSP rules, where an NSSP rule is either:
1) a non-default NSSP rule including:
A) an application identifier;
B) an S-NSSAI and/or a DNN; and
C) a precedence value of the NSSP rule; or
2) a default NSSP rule including an S-NSSAI and/or a DNN.
Only one NSSP rule in NSSP can be a default NSSP rule. If a default NSSP rule
and one or more non-default NSSP rules are included in NSSP, any non-default
NSSP rule shall be prioritized over the default NSSP rule.
Editor\'s note: Coding of the NSSP rule is FFS.
When a PDU from an application needs to be transmitted and there exists an
NSSP rule matching the application (including a default NSSP rule):
1) if there exists a PDU session associated with S-NSSAI and/or DNN in the
NSSP rule, the UE shall transmit the PDU via the PDU session; or
2) otherwise, the UE establishes a PDU session with the S-NSSAI and/or DNN in
the NSSP rule in case other conditions do not prohibits the UE from the PDU
session establishment.
The HPLMN may provision the UE with NSSP. The NSSP shall be stored in a non-
volatile memory in the ME together with the SUPI from the USIM. The NSSP shall
be stored until new NSSP are provisioned by HPLMN or the USIM is removed. The
NSSP can only be used if the SUPI from the USIM matches the SUPI stored in the
non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete them.
Editor\'s note: Whether the generic UE configuration update procedure can be
used to provision NSSP is FFS.
# 14 Conclusions and recommendations
## 14.1 Work plan and procedures
CT1 have reached the following agreements with regard to the work plan and
procedures to be used for the start of the normative phase of 5GS:
1\. New TSs are started for the specification work as described in Annex A.1.
2\. The rapporteurs of new TSs are tasked to provide a mapping proposal of the
sections from 3GPP TR 24.890 or any other applicable TS to the new TSs. The
agreed mapping proposals will be documented in the TR.
3\. The rapporteurs will produce new reference versions of the new TSs based
on agreed mapping proposals which will then be used for CT1 as the reference
versions for contributions.
4\. Impacts to existing specifications are described in Annex A.2.
5\. Updates to existing specifications stored in 3GPP TR 24.890 will be
transferred to appropriate TSs.
6\. CT1 will not continue maintaining material in 3GPP TR 24.890 which is
transferred to new or existing TSs to avoid duplication of documentation and
work. Material transferred out of 3GPP TR 24.890 will be marked by means of
editor's note to indicate that has been moved and no longer maintained in the
TR
7\. No new study work would be added to 3GPP TR 24.890 after its approval.
Exceptionally, unresolved contentious issues in 3GPP TR 24.890 could continue
being worked till the next 3GPP TSG CT plenary meeting after approval.
## 14.2 Alternatives on NAS transport mechanism
CT1 have studied two alternatives for the NAS transport mechanism as described
in subclause 8.5.1.3.2 and 8.5.1.3.3. CT1 have done an evaluation of the
alternatives as documented in subclause 8.5.1.3.4 and 8.5.1.3.5. CT1 have
decided to select the alternative 2 as the NAS transport mechanism to be used
(see subclause 8.5.1.3.6).

## 14.5 Alternatives on architecture for PWS in 5GS
CT1 have studied three alternatives for the architecture for PWS in 5GS as
described in subclause 12.1.1.2, 12.1.1.3 and 12.1.1.4. CT1 have done an
evaluation of the alternatives as documented in subclause 12.1.1.5. CT1 have
decided to select the alternative in subclause 12.1.1.4 as the architecture
for PWS in 5GS.
## 14.6 Alternatives on unified access control
CT1 have studied three alternatives for the unified access control as
described in subclause 12.2.1, 12.2.2 and 12.2.3. CT1 have discussed during
their #108 meeting the alternatives and decided to select the alternative in
subclause 12.2.2 as the unified access control mechanism.
NOTE: The alternative 2 indicated by subclause 12.2.2 existed in earlier
versions of this technical report.
## 14.7 Alternatives on steering of UE in VPLMN
CT1 have studied three alternatives for the steering of UE in VPLMN as
described in subclause 5.2.4.1, 5.2.4.2 and 5.2.4.3. CT1 have discussed during
their #108 meeting the alternatives and decided to select the alternative
subclause 5.2.4.1 as the steering of UE in VPLMN mechanism.
The legacy steering of roaming mechanism as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [3]
subclause 4.4.6 is still available.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 23.040
# B.1 First Change
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the Short Message Service (SMS) for
GSM/UMTS/EPS/5GS networks. It defines:
\- the services and service elements;
\- the network architecture;
\- the Service Centre functionality;
\- the SMS Router functionality;
\- the MSC functionality (with regard to the SMS);
\- the SGSN functionality (with regard to the SMS);
\- the MME functionality (with regard to the SMS);
\- the SMSF functionality;
\- the routing requirements;
\- the protocols and protocol layering;
for the Mobile Originated and Mobile Terminated Short Message Service
Teleservices, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.003 [2] and 3GPP TS 22.105 [32].
The use of radio resources for the transfer of short messages between the MS
and the MSC or the SGSN or the MME is described in 3GPP TS 24.011 [13].
The present document also describes the Short Message Service (SMS) for EPS
networks supported via \"SMS in MME\" (see 3GPP TS.23.272 [45], annex C).
The present document also describes the SGSN supporting Diameter based
protocol for SMS between the SGSN and the central SMS functions (SMS-GMSC,
SMS-IWMSC, SMS-Router) in annex J.
The present document describes SMS for 5GS networks (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [xx]
and 3GPP TS 23.502 [yy]).
The network aspects of Short Message Service provision are outside the scope
of the present document (i.e. the provision of network connectivity between
the PLMN subsystems). There is no technical restriction within the present
document for the transfer of short messages between different PLMNs. Any such
restriction is likely to be subject to commercial arrangements and PLMN
operators must make their own provision for interworking or for preventing
interworking with other PLMNs as they see fit.
The required and assumed network service offered to the higher layers is
defined in the present document.

###### ## Annex L (normative): SMS in 5GS
# L.1 General
A 5GS network delivers short message services over 5GS NAS signalling.
For the architecture and the definition of reference points for SMS in 5GS see
3GPP TS 23.501 [xx], subclause 4.2.
Between the architecture and the reference points for SMS in 5GS and the
architecture and the reference points shown in subclause 4.1, and figure 5, of
the present specification the following mapping is used:

For the purpose of supporting SMS in 5GS, the SMSF shall implement the
requirements specified in the present specification for the MSC and the VLR
with the following modifications:
1) \"GSM/UMTS system\" is to be replaced with \"5GS\".
2) Throughout the text and in the figures, message names, parameter names and
cause values:
\"MSC\" is to be replaced with \"SMSF\";
\"VLR\" is to be replaced with \"SMSF internal subscriber register\";
\"HLR\" is to be replaced with \"UDM/HLR\";
\"MS\" is to be replaced with \"UE\"; and
\"non GPRS\" is to be replaced with \"5GS\".
3) Reference point 4 is SMSF internal, and operations performed on this
reference point are not standardized. In the message flows of clause 10, the
SMSF replaces the combination of MSC and VLR, and messages exchanged between
MSC and VLR are replaced with MME internal communication.
The architecture for SMS in 5GS is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [xx] and uses the
following reference points:
**N1** : Reference point between the UE and the AMF.
**N8** : Reference point between the UDM and the AMF.
**N20** : Reference point between the AMF and the SMSF.
**N21** : Reference point between SMSF and the UDM.
The following service based interfaces are used for SMS in 5GS:
**Namf:** Service-based interface exhibited by AMF. Usage of Namf service
operations for SMS in 5GS is defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [yy].
**Nsmsf:** Service-based interface exhibited by SMSF. Usage of Nsmsf service
operations for SMS in 5GS is defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [yy].].
**Nudm:** Service-based interface exhibited by UDM. Usage of Nudm service
operations for SMS in 5GS is defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [yy].
# B.4 Next Change
# L.2 Support for SMS when UE is registered to both 5GS and EPS
When a UE is operating in dual-registration mode as specified 3GPP TS 23.501
[8] and is registered to the network via:
\- MME; and
\- AMF;
and SMS in EPS uses SMS over SGs, the network shall deliver an MT short
message either via SMS over SGs in EPS or SMS over NAS in 5GS based on local
policy. In case the network determines the MT short message delivery fails,
e.g. the UE is not reachable, the network may try delivering the short message
via the not yet tried option for delivering of the MT short message. If the
network tries to deliver an MT short message via SMS over SGs in EPS and SMS
over NAS in 5GS then the mobile not reachable flags specified in subclause
3.2.8 of this specification are only set if MT short message delivery fails
via both options.
NOTE 1: This version of the specification does not specify an architecture
that provides a standardized interface between SMSF and VLR.
Editor's note: Support for SMS in MME specified in Annex I for dual
registration requires further study.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 24.011
# C.1 First Change
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the procedures used across the mobile radio
interface by the signalling layer 3 function Short Message Control (SMC) and
Short Message Relay function (SMâ€‘RL) for circuit switched in A/Gb mode, GPRS,
EPS, and 5GS.

# 2 Overview of Short Message Service (SMS) support
The purpose of the Short Message Service is to provide the means to transfer
messages between a GSM PLMN Mobile Station (MS) and a Short Message Entity via
a Service Centre, as described in 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]. The terms \"MO\" â€‘
Mobile Originating â€‘ and \"MT\" â€‘ Mobile Terminating â€‘ are used to indicate
the direction in which the short message is sent.
The present document describes the procedures necessary to support the Short
Message Service between the MS and the MSC or SGSN or MME or SMSF and vice
versa, as described in 3GPP TS 23.040 [2].
The procedures are based on services provided by the Mobility Management
sublayer as described in 3GPP TS 24.007 [11]/3GPP TS 24.008 [12] for CS in
A/Gb mode and CS/PS services in Iu mode, 3GPP 24.301 [10] for CS/PS services
in S1 mode, and the Logical Link Control layer described in 3GPP TS 44.064
[6a] for GPRS services. For CS/PS service in S1 mode, depending on network
configuration and UE subscription data, network may choose to use either
packet-switched service or circuit-switched service to provide SMS service. If
circuit-switched service is used instead of packet-switched service, then the
messages are tunneled through the MME. In this case the network also uses
procedures described in 3GPP 29.118 [12].
Editor\'s note: Mobility management for UE in N1 mode to be included, only
possible once the new NAS technical specification is available.
## 2.1 Protocols and protocol architecture
In Iu mode only, integrity protected signalling (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [5],
subclause \'Integrity Protection of Signalling Messages\' and in general, see
3GPP TS 33.102 [5b]) is mandatory. In Iu mode only, all protocols shall use
integrity protected signalling. Integrity protection of all SMS signalling
messages is the responsibility of lower layers. It is the network which
activates integrity protection. This is done using the security mode control
procedure (3GPP TS 25.331 [5a]).
The hierarchical model in figure 2.1a shows the layer structure of the MSC and
the MS in A/Gb mode. The hierarchical model in figure 2.1c shows the layer
structure of the SGSN and the MS in Iu mode. The hierarchical model in figure
2.1d shows the layer structure of the MSC and the MS in S1 mode. The

# C.4 Next Change
## 3.2 Service provided by the CMâ€‘sublayer
In order to support the Short Message Service, the CMâ€‘sublayer provides
services to the Short Message Relay Layer.
The CMâ€‘sublayer services are provided using layer specific functions and lower
layer services offered to the CMâ€‘sublayer, controlled by short message service
control entities called SMCs.
An SMC entity in the MS communicates with an SMC entity in the MSC or the SGSN
or the MME or the SMSF by means of a peer protocol, SMâ€‘CP (Short Message
Service Control Protocol). The arrow diagrams in annex A give an overview of
the messaging on the CMâ€‘sublayer during a short message transfer.
A mobile station supporting the Short Message Service shall have a minimum of
two SMC entities per service type (i.e. two for CS GSM and two for GPRS). This
enables the MS to receive MT messages during an MO message transfer.
To ensure that an MS having the minimum of two SMC entities is able to receive
MT messages during an MO message transfer, and to send MO messages during MT
message transfer, parallel message transfer in the same direction is
prohibited. This means that the SMC entities shall not simultaneously perform
messaging in the same direction. The rules for concatenation of message
transfers are described in subclause 5.4.
The MSC or the SGSN or the MME or the SMSF shall have a minimum of two SMC
entities available each during an MT message transfer to a mobile station, one
being reserved for MO message transfer. In an MO message transfer, the MSC or
the SGSN or the MME or the SMSF shall have one SMC entity reserved for
handling of an MT message.
# C.5 Next Change
# 5 CMâ€‘procedures
## 5.1 General
This clause describes the procedures used by the SMC entity on the Connection
Management sublayer. An SMC entity communicates with a corresponding peer
entity using an MMâ€‘connection for CS in A/Gb and Iu mode, or the LLC layer for
GPRS in A/Gb mode, or the GMM-connection for PS in Iu mode, or the EMM-
connection for EPS in S1 mode if packet-switched service is used, or through
the MME for S1 mode if circuit-switched service is used, or through the AMF
for N1 mode.
Editor\'s note: The impact of MO SMS using one step approach in 5GMM-IDLE mode
in case of SMS in N1 mode requires further study.
Multiple MMâ€‘connections may be established at the same time, allowing parallel
transactions. The description of the procedures is related to one single
transaction.
For circuit switched service, the CMâ€‘procedures described can only be
performed if an MMâ€‘connection has been established between the mobile station
and the network.
For GPRS, no connection has to be established, and thus the CM procedures for
GPRS reflect this. Detailed SDL diagrams for SMC entities are contained in
annex B.
For EPS when packet-switched service is used, detailed SDL diagrams for SMC
entities are contained in annex B.

### 5.2.2 SMC-GP, SMC-EP and SMC-5G states at the MS side of the radio
interface
#### 5.2.2.1 Mobile Originating Case
The states described in this clause are for an SMC-GP entity in a GPRS MS, and
for an SMC-EP entity in an EPS MS, and for an SMC-5G entity in a 5GS MS
handling mobile originating short message transfer and notification to the
network that the mobile has memory available to receive one or more short
messages (referred to below as \"notification\").
# C.7 Next Change
### 5.2.4 SMC-GP, SMC-EP and SMC-5G states at the network side of the radio
interface
#### 5.2.4.1 Mobile Originating Case
The states described in this subclause are for an SMC-GP entity in an SGSN and
for an SMC-EP entity in an MSC or an MME and an SMC-5G entity in a SMSF
handling both mobile originating short message transfer and notification to
the network that the mobile has memory available to receive one or more short
messages (referred to below as \"notification\").
# C.8 Next Change
#### 5.3.2.2 RPDU transfer for GPRS, EPS and 5GS
In A/Gb mode, when an SMC-GP or SMC-EP entity or SMC-5G entity is in the Idle
state and transfer of an RPDU is requested, the SMC-GP or SMC-EP or SMC-5G
entity on the originating side forwards the CP-DATA message containing the
RPDU to the lower layer, and sets the timer TC1* and enters the Wait for CP-
ACK state. In A/Gb mode, for the SMC-GP entity, the lower layer is the LLC
sublayer. For the SMC-EP entity on the MS side, the lower layer is EMM. For
the SMC-EP entity on the network side, the lower layer can be either the SGs
association as described in 3GPP TS 29.118 [12] or the EMM sublayer. For the
SMC-5G entity on the MS side, the lower layer is 5GMM. For the SMC-5G entity
on the network side the lower layer is provided by the N20 interface.
Editor's note: Appropriate reference for N20 interface to be included once
available.
In Iu mode, when an SMC-GP entity in the MS side is in the Idle state and
transfer of an RPDU is requested:
\- the SMC-GP entity on the originating side requests the GMM sublayer to
establish a PS signalling connection, and enters the GMM-Connection Pending
state.
\- after completion of the PS signalling connection establishment, a
confirmation is given to the originating side to indicate that the GMM
sublayer is ready for RPDU transfer; and.
\- after confirmation of the PS signalling connection establishment, the SMC-
GP entity on the originating side forwards the CP-DATA message to the GMM
sublayer. This contains the RPDU, and also the SMC-GP entity sets the timer
TC1* and enters the Wait for CP-ACK state.
In S1 mode, when an SMC-EP entity in the MS side is in the Idle state and
transfer of an RPDU is requested:
\- if the MS is not using Control plane CIoT EPS optimization:
1) the SMC-EP entity on the originating side requests the EMM sublayer to
establish a NAS signalling connection, and enters the EMM-Connection Pending
state;
2) after completion of the NAS signalling connection establishment, a
confirmation is given to the originating side to indicate that the EMM
sublayer is ready for RPDU transfer; and
3) after confirmation of the NAS signalling connection establishment, the SMC-
EP entity on the originating side forwards the CP-DATA message to the EMM
sublayer. This contains the RPDU, and also the SMC-EP entity sets the timer
TC1* and enters the Wait for CPâ€‘ACK state; or
\- if the MS is using Control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the SMC-EP entity
on the originating side forwards the CP-DATA message that contains the RPDU to
the EMM sublayer when requesting the EMM sublayer to establish a NAS
signalling connection. The SMC-EP entity then sets the timer TC1* and enters
the Wait for CP-ACK state immediately.
NOTE: If the MS in idle mode is using Control plane CIoT optimization, the
first CP-DATA message is sent by piggybacking on the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message during the service request procedure as specified in 3GPP
24.301 [10].
In N1 mode, when an SMC-5G entity in the MS side is in the Idle state and
transfer of an RPDU is requested:
1) the SMC-5G entity on the originating side requests the 5GMM sublayer to
establish a NAS signalling connection;
2) after completion of the NAS signalling connection establishment, a
confirmation is given to the originating side to indicate that the 5GMM
sublayer is ready for RPDU transfer; and
3) after confirmation of the NAS signalling connection establishment, the
SMC-5G entity on the originating side forwards the CPâ€‘DATA message to the 5GMM
sublayer. This contains the RPDU, and also the SMC-5G entity sets the timer
TC1* and enters the Wait for CP-ACK state.
In Iu mode, when an SMC-GP entity in the network side is in Idle state and
transfer of an RPDU is requested, the SMC-GP entity on the originating side
forwards the C-â€‘DATA message to the GMM sublayer. This contains the RPDU, and
also the SMC-GP entity sets the timer TC1* and enters the Wait for CP-ACK
state.
In S1 mode and the circuit-switched service is used, when an SMC-EP entity in
the network side is in Idle state and transfer of an RPDU is requested, the
SMC-EP entity on the MSC forwards the CP-DATA message to the SGs sublayer.
This contains the RPDU, and also the SMC-EP entity sets the timer TC1* and
enters the Wait for CP-ACK state. The SGs layer transfers the CP-DATA message
by using the procedures specified in 3GPP 24.301 [10].
In S1 mode and the packet-switched service is used, when an SMC-EP entity in
the network side is in Idle state and transfer of an RPDU is requested, the
SMC-EP entity on the originating side forwards the CP-DATA message to the EMM
sublayer. This contains the RPDU, and also the SMC-GP entity sets the timer
TC1* and enters the Wait for CP-ACK state.
In N1 mode and the packet-switched service is used, when an SMC-5G entity in
the network side is in Idle state and transfer of an RPDU is requested, the
SMC-EP entity on the SMSF forwards the CP-DATA message to the N20 sublayer.
This contains the RPDU, and also the SMC-5G entity sets the timer TC1* and
enters the Wait for CP-ACK state.The value of TC1* may vary with the length of
the CPâ€‘DATA. However, the value of TC1* shall be sufficiently great to allow
the lower layers to transmit the CP-DATA and CP-ACK messages and to allow for
some re-transmissions of layer 2 frames.
If an SMC entity in the Wait for CP-ACK state gets an indication that the CP-
DATA message has probably been lost then, as an implementation option, that
SMC-GP entity may reduce the time until expiry of TC1*.
If the timer TC1* expires in the Wait for CP-ACK state, the CP-DATA message is
retransmitted and the state Wait for CP-ACK is reâ€‘entered. The maximum number
of CP-DATA message re-transmissions is an implementation option but shall be
either 1, 2 or 3. If the timer TC1* expires after the maximum number of
retransmission attempts, an error indication is passed to SM-RL. The Idle
state is then entered.
On receipt of the CP-ACK message in response to the CP-DATA (RP DATA) message
in the Wait for CP-ACK state, the SMC-GP resets the timer TC1* and enters the
Wait for CP DATA state.
On receipt of the CPâ€‘ACK message in response to the CP-DATA (RP ACK) message
in the Wait for CP-ACK state, the SMC-GP resets the timer TC1* and enters the
Idle State.
On receipt of the CP-ACK message in response to the CP-DATA (RP DATA) message
in the Wait for CP-ACK state, the SMC-5G resets the timer TC1* and enters the
Wait for CP DATA state.
On receipt of the CP-ACK message in response to the CP-DATA (RP ACK) message
in the Wait for CP-ACK state, the SMC-5G resets the timer TC1* and enters the
Idle State.
In A/Gb mode or S1 mode or N1 mode, when receiving a CP-DATA message from the
lower layer, the SMC-GP or SMC-EP or SMC5G entity checks the parameters
relevant to the CP protocol. If these are valid, the RPDU is passed to the SM-
RL, the CP-ACK message is sent.
In Iu mode, when receiving a CP-DATA message from the GMM sublayer, the SMC-GP
entity checks the parameters relevant to the CP protocol. If these are valid,
the RPDU is passed to the SM-RL, the CP-ACK message is sent.
In S1 mode, when receiving a CP-DATA message from the lower layer, the SMC-EP
entity checks the parameters relevant to the CP protocol. If these are valid,
the RPDU is passed to the SM-RL, the CP-ACK message is sent.
In N1 mode, when receiving a CP-â€‘DATA message from the lower layer, the SMC-5G
entity checks the parameters relevant to the CP protocol. If these are valid,
the RPDU is passed to the SM-â€‘RL, the CP-â€‘ACK message is sent
If an SMC entity in the Idle state is unable to accept a CP-DATA message, it
sends a CP-ERROR message and then enters the Idle state.
# C.9 Next Change
## 5.4 Concatenating short message or notification transfers
If an entity has more than one short message or notification to send, then it
is useful to maintain the Radio Resource (RR) connection (in A/Gb mode) or the
signalling connection (in Iu mode, in S1 mode if packet-switched service is
used, and in N1 mode) in between transfers. For mobile terminated short
messages this is simple because the network decides when, and whether, to
release the RR connection (in A/Gb mode) or the signalling connection (in Iu
mode, in S1 mode if packet-switched service is used, and in N1 mode). However,
for mobile originated transfers, the network does not know whether or not the
mobile has more messages to transfer. For short message transfer through the
EPS in S1 mode if circuit-switched service is used, the network side has no
knowledge of the signalling connection in for both mobile originated and
mobile terminated transfers.
If another short message or a memory available notification is to be sent, an
originating SMR entity in the MS may choose to continue to use the same RR
connection (in A/Gb mode) or the same signalling connection (in Iu mode or in
N1 mode).
In the case of a SMS transfer via the CS domain, when the MS chooses to use
the same RR connection (in A/Gb mode) or CS signalling connection (in Iu
mode), then:
\- the MS shall transmit a CM SERVICE REQUEST for the new CM connection before
the final CPâ€‘ACK (i.e. the one that acknowledges the CPâ€‘DATA that carried the
RPâ€‘ACK) for the old MM connection is transmitted;
\- before transmission of the first CPâ€‘DATA on the new MM connection, the MS
may transmit the CPâ€‘ACK for the old MM connection; the MS shall not transmit
the final CP-ACK after the new CP-DATA;
\- the Transaction Identifier used on the new MM connection shall be different
to that used on the old MM connection; and
\- the MS shall not initiate establishment of the new MM connection before the
final CPâ€‘DATA (e.g. the one carrying the RPâ€‘ACK) has been received.
In the case of a SMS transfer via the PS domain, when the MS chooses to use
the same PS signalling connection (in Iu mode and in S1 mode if packet-
switched service is used); or in the case of a SMS transfer via the PS domain
in A/Gb mode; or in the case of SMS transfer through the EPS; or in the case
of SMS transfer in N1 mode, then:
\- the MS shall transmit the CP-DATA for the successive RPDU and shall not
transmit the final CPâ€‘ACK for the current SMS (i.e. the one that acknowledges
the CPâ€‘DATA that carried the RPâ€‘ACK);
\- the Transaction Identifier used for the successive RPDU shall be different
to that used for the current RPDU; and
\- the MS shall not transmit the CP-DATA for the successive RPDU before the
final CPâ€‘DATA (i.e. the one that carried the RPâ€‘ACK) has been received.
NOTE: When an MS sends successive memory available notifications and/or mobile
originated short messages on different RR connections (in A/Gb mode) or
signalling connections (in Iu mode and S1 mode), the MS is strongly
recommended to use different Transaction Identifiers for the old and new MM
connections.
It is possible that the final CPâ€‘ACK of a short message transfer may not be
received (e.g. due to transmission errors and/or hand overs).
For mobile terminated transfers, if the CPâ€‘ACK is lost, the reception of a
CPâ€‘DATA with a different transaction identifier and carrying an RPDU shall be
interpreted as the implicit reception of the awaited CPâ€‘ACK followed by the
reception of the new CPâ€‘DATA message.
For mobile originated transfers, if the CPâ€‘ACK is lost or not sent by the MS,
the following events shall be interpreted as the implicit reception of the
awaited CPâ€‘ACK:
\- in the case of a SMS transfer via the CS domain,, the reception of a CM
SERVICE REQUEST followed by a CPâ€‘DATA with a different transaction identifier
and carrying an RPDU; or
\- in the case of a SMS transfer via the PS domain, the reception of a CP-DATA
with a different transaction identifier and carrying an RPDU.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 24.301
# D.1 Summary of changes
The list of impacts that should be captured in 3GPP TS 24.301 [15] is as
follows:
1) Attach procedure for EPS services and combined attach procedure for EPS
services and non-EPS services
A) Mode selection for intersystem change with 5GS
i) If the UE supports N1 mode, the UE shall set the N1 mode supported bit to
\"N1 mode supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST
message.
ii) If the MME received the N1 mode supported bit set to \"N1 mode supported\"
in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the MME
supports intersystem change with 5GS, in the ATTACH ACCEPT message the MME
shall indicate either:
a) \"dual-registration not supported\" if the MME supports interworking
procedures with N26 interface; or
b) \"dual-registration supported\" if the MME supports interworking procedures
without N26 interface.
iii) If the MME indicated \"dual-registration not supported\", the UE shall
operate in single-registration mode. If the MME indicated \"dual-registration
supported\" and the UE supports dual-registration mode, the UE shall operate
in dual-registration mode. If the MME indicated \"dual-registration
supported\" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall
operate in single-registration mode. If the MME indicated neither \"dual-
registration not supported\" nor \"dual-registration supported\", the UE shall
operate in single-registration mode. The interworking procedures required for
coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface are specified in
subclause 11.2.3.
B) Temporary identity
i) At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE operating in the
single-registration mode that has a valid 5G-GUTI shall include a 4G-GUTI
mapped from map the 5G-GUTI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5] in the EPS
mobile identity IE, and include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to
\"native GUTI\".
ii) If the UE operating in the single-registration mode holds a valid 4G-GUTI
and a valid 5G-GUTI, it shall include in the EPS mobile identity IE of the
ATTACH REQUEST message either 4G-GUTI or 4G-GUTI mapped from the 5G-GUTI (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]) according to the system (i.e. either EPS or
5GS), where the last successful EPS attach, tracking area updating or
registration procedure was performed. In this case, the GUTI type field of the
Old GUTI type IE shall be set to \"native GUTI\".
iii) At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE operating in the
dual-registration mode that has a valid 4G-GUTI shall include the 4G-GUTI in
the EPS mobile identity IE, and include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to
\"native GUTI\". The UE operating in the dual-registration mode shall not use
the 5G-GUTI even if the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI.
C) Mobility indication
i) The UE shall include a UE status IE with a 5GMM registration status set to
\"UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state\"n in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

registration mode shall not use the 5G-GUTI even if the UE has a valid
5G-GUTI.
C) The UE shall include a UE status IE with a 5GMM registration status set to
\"UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state\" indication in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.
3) UE requested PDN connectivity procedure
A) The PDU CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message(s) triggered by the UE operating in
the dual-registration mode intending to transfer PDU sessions from the 5GS to
the EPS, shall include the request type IE set to \"Handover\" in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
NOTE: The usage of \"Handover\" value in the request type IE needs to be
extended to cover transferring PDU sessions from 5GC to EPS.
B) The PDU Session ID is sent to the network in the protocol configuration
options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message if the UE is operating in the single-registration
mode.
C) 5G QoS parameters including session-AMBR and QoS rules are sent to the UE
in the protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER REQUEST message.
