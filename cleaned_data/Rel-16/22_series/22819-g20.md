# Introduction
Distinguished from the previous generations, a new movement is happening for
5G in 3GPP, i.e. vertical domains started to join 3GPP and requirements from
vertical domains have been provided to 3GPP so that 3GPP takes into account
requirements from vertical domains as well as requirements from legacy ICT
domain to standardize 5G System in 3GPP.
Maritime domain, one of 5G vertical domains in 3GPP, started to be considered
since 2016 to enable 3GPP systems to play the role of mobile communication
platform necessary for the digitalization and mobilization of the maritime
domain that bring about the Fourth Industrial Revolution of the maritime
businesses as well as maritime safety.
Compared to other vertical domains, the maritime domain has the radio
communication environment that 3GPP hasn't considered in detail, which means
that maritime related issues and features were not in the scope of 3GPP
standardization and some of existing 3GPP enabling technologies or solutions
are not able to fully support the optimized performances required by the
maritime domain in a way that has been guaranteed for on-land communication.
In addition, on-board mobile users in a vessel would like to experience the
same rich mobile communication services as they enjoy on land.
Furthermore, it is of the view that the capacity and rate for data
transmission based on legacy maritime radio communication technologies are
indeed not enough for e-Navigation described in IMO Strategy Implementation
Plan (SIP) or Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), which the
International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations specialized
agency, have been working to provide to ship.
Considering that the maritime domain is one of 5G vertical domains that 3GPP
take into account in order for 5G to be able to provide enhanced mobile
broadband services or massive machine-type communication services etc.
everywhere anytime in the world, it is desirable to study use cases and
requirements for maritime communication services over 3GPP system so that 3GPP
system can be a good candidate of innovative tools to help address the
information gap between users on land and users at sea as well as the maritime
safety and vessel traffic management etc. that IMO intends to achieve
especially in 5G era.
# 1 Scope
The present document aims to support the maritime communication services
between users ashore and at sea or between vessels at sea over 3GPP system
that are targeted to improve maritime safety, protect the maritime environment
and promote the efficiency of shipping by reducing maritime casualty caused by
human error, in particular, involving small ships and fishing vessels. In
addition, the outcome of the technical report is expected to narrow the
information gap between mobile users on land and shipboard users on vessels at
sea by making it possible to provide the mobile broadband services.
The document describes use cases and potential requirements for services
between shore-based users such as authorities and shipboard users in the
maritime radio communication environment over 3GPP system. In addition, it
deals with use cases to support Mission Critical Services between authorities
on land and authorities at sea (e.g. maritime police) as well as use cases to
support the interworking between 3GPP system and the existing/future maritime
radio communication system for the seamless service of voice communication and
data communication between users ashore and at sea or between vessels at sea.
Analysis is also made on which legacy services and requirements from the
existing 3GPP system need to be included and which potential requirements need
additional work for new functions to support maritime communication services
over 3GPP system.

# 4 Overview
This Technical Report introduces use cases and potential requirements to
support maritime communication services in maritime communication environment
that hasn't been considered in details in 3GPP for the purpose of maritime
commercial businesses as well as maritime safety and maritime traffic
management over 3GPP system.
Clause 5 and clause 6 describe use cases for mobile broadband services and for
machine type communication services, respectively to satisfy demands for
maritime commercial businesses. Clause 7 describes use cases for maritime
safety as well as IMO MSPs to satisfy demands for authorities in maritime
domain and clause 8 provides the description of the interworking with
satellite access component and VDES.
In addition, some considerations are taken in clause 9 in order to enable 3GPP
enabling technologies supporting legacy (i.e. pre Rel-16) mobile services to
be applicable to maritime areas and to enable 3GPP enabling technologies
supporting machine type communication such as eMTC and NB-IoT features that
were specified from 3GPP Release 13 onwards and are expected to be specified
in 3GPP Release 16 to be applicable to maritime areas.
Clause 10 consolidates potential requirements developed in clause 5 to clause
9 and the conclusion and recommendations are described in clause 11.
# 5 Use Cases for Mobile Broadband Services for Users at Sea
## 5.1 Use case on video streaming service in the cabin or on the deck
### 5.1.1 Description
This use case describes a scenario where users experience video streaming
service in the cabin or on the deck of the vessel.
### 5.1.2 Pre-conditions
Because most of vessels are made of the steel material, UEs on the vessel
(especially in the cabin of the vessel) access 3GPP network via the indirect
network connection provided by another UE that plays a role as a relay UE for
other UEs on the vessel and is deployed at the top of the vessel.
> NOTE: Depending on the vessel capacity and the number of users on the
> vessel, the relay UE might be incapable of supporting the indirect network
> connection for all UEs on the vessel. In this use case, it is assumed that
> the size of a vessel and the number of users on the vessel are reasonable to
> have 3GPP network access via the relay UE.
UEs on the deck are capable of accessing 3GPP networks via direct network
connection or via indirect network connection depending on the UE constraint
related to the uplink transmission capability.
UEs on the vessel are subscribed and connected to a 3GPP network.
### 5.1.3 Service Flows
Bob is now on his yacht that is far away from the shore (e.g. 100 km distance
from the shore) for his holidays.
He turns on the device that is positioned at the top of the yacht and is the
relay UE that connects to 3GPP network.
The device automatically establishes the indirect network connection to
provide 3GPP network access to UEs on the yacht.
Bob moves into the steel cabin of the yacht and enjoys the video streaming
service from his tablet via the indirect network connection.
He wants to watch it on the deck of the yacht because the weather suddenly
turns to be clear so moves out of the steel cabin with his table while keeping
watching the video streaming service.
### 5.1.4 Post-conditions
Bob enjoyed the video streaming service on the deck as well as in the steel
cabin of the vessel.
### 5.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None identified
### 5.1.6 Potential Requirements
[PR-5.1.6-1] 3GPP system shall support the extreme long-range coverage at sea
(up to 100 km).
[PR-5.1.6-2] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism to establish and keep a
3GPP network connection for UEs on the vessel when UEs are to be connected to
3GPP system via an indirect network connection or when there is any UE
constraint on the uplink transmission capability at sea.
[PR-5.1.6-3] Downlink video streaming service shall be accessible by the
direct network connection or the indirect network connection for users at sea.
[PR-5.1.6-4] The 3GPP system shall support service continuity between direct
network connection and indirect network connection at sea or in a vessel.
## 5.2 Use case on transition from IOPS mode to on-network mode
### 5.2.1 Description
Local services in a vessel can be supported in IOPS mode when a vessel moves
away from 3GPP network coverage. When that vessel approaches to the area in
3GPP network coverage, mobile devices of on-board passengers can switch back
to the on-land network connection.
This use case describes a scenario where the network reselection is requested
to be connected to on-land network when a vessel is approaching back to a
maritime region that is in 3GPP network coverage.
### 5.2.2 Pre-conditions
A local 3GPP network operating in IOPS mode is installed in a vessel to
provide local services (e.g. online gaming, video streaming, online duty-free
shopping).
The local 3GPP network operating in IOPS mode turns on when the vessel moves
away from 3GPP network coverage and turns off when the vessel is approaching
back to a maritime region that is in 3GPP network coverage.
### 5.2.3 Service Flows
1\. A cruise stays in a Incheon harbour and UEs of shipboard users in the
cruise are connected to 3GPP system by the direct network connection mode.
2\. The cruise leaves for Kaohsiung harbour and is away from 3GPP network
coverage.
3\. UEs of shipboard users are utilizing the 3GPP network operating in IOPS
mode on board of the vessel to access local services during the cruise.
4\. The cruise is approaching Kaohsiung harbour and is about to enter 3GPP
network coverage.
5\. As soon as the cruise is in 3GPP network coverage in Kaohsiung harbour,
the 3GPP network operating in IOPS mode on board of the vessel switches off
and network reselection is performed by UEs of shipboard users in the cruise.
### 5.2.4 Post-conditions
Shipboard users enjoyed local mobile communication services with their mobile
devices during the cruise and their UEs are successfully attached to the on-
land network by the network reselection procedure.
### 5.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None
### 5.2.6 Potential Requirements
[PR-5.2.6-1] Based on home operator policy, a UE shall be able to perform the
network reselection when on-land networks are available.
[PR-5.2.6-2] A UE shall be able to access local services that are accessible
via a 3GPP network operating in IOPS mode on board of a vessel.
## 5.3 Use case on next positioning technologies
### 5.3.1 Description
The study item FS_HYPOS is under standardization to study positioning use
cases for diverse vertical domains including maritime domain.
Requirements as the outcome of 5G_HYPOS shall be supported for indoor
positioning services inside a vessel over 5G system.
## 5.4 Use case on 5G LAN-type services over 5G system in a vessel
### 5.4.1 Description
5GLAN work is under standardization to support 5G LAN-type services over 5G
system.
Maritime environment inside a vessel is similar to residential environment,
enterprise environment or industrial automation environment depending on the
type of vessels.
Requirements are covered by the outcome of 5GLAN work.
# 6 Use Cases for Machine Type Communication Services inside a Vessel, between
Vessels and between UEs at Sea
## 6.1 Use case on communication between wearable IoT devices and maritime
rescue coordination centre for saving a life
### 6.1.1 Description
This use case describes a scenario where a passenger saves a life by wearing
IoT devices (e.g. air jacket, smart band) and its monitoring system.

Figure 6.1.1-2: Maritime rescue coordination centre monitoring screen
### 6.1.2 Pre-conditions
A passenger buys a boarding ticket at ticket booth. Ticket counter employee
activate UE (e.g. air jacket, smart band) which could be replaced boarding
ticket and register UE device to maritime rescue coordination centre.
UE has the capability of transmitting the data (e.g. location information,
heartbeat information) under the seawater to maritime rescue coordination
centre.
Maritime rescue coordination centre has the capability of ordering and
monitoring rescue based on passenger's location and health information.
Moving UE (e.g. drone) subscribes to 3GPP system and has the capability of
relay as an UE.
Patrol craft connects to the core network of 3GPP system on land and has
moving UE station which services battery charge and control.
### 6.1.3 Service Flows
1\. Maritime collision/accident happens.
2\. A shipboard user (e.g. crew or passenger) pressed a button on his/her
jacket to send a rescue request to maritime rescue coordination centre and a
user at sea who is adrift (e.g. castaway) also presses a button on his/her air
jacket to send a rescue request including the information of the location and
heartbeat to maritime rescue coordination centre.
3\. The maritime rescue coordination centre receives their rescue requests
including the information of their locations and heartbeats. The maritime
rescue coordination centre lets a patrol craft where there are moving UE for
rescue them.
Maritime rescue coordination centre indicates all passengers' current location
and health status and classifies emergency patient who need to rescue right
away.
A user who is adrift is moving along with the flow of the wind and the tide
and now is out of the coverage of 3GPP network when the patrol craft arrives
at the accident place.
4\. Moving UE is flying from the patrol craft and moving around while
extending the coverage of 3GPP network to find out a user who is adrift.
5\. A rescue request is repeatedly transmitted from an air jacket of a user
who is adrift once a user pressed the button and moving UE receives his/her
rescue request so his/her location is identified.

Fig. 6.1.3-1 LTE maritime Service Scenario
### 6.1.4 Post-conditions
All shipboard users who faced the accident at sea are saved.
### 6.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
NOTE: Maritime emergency requests can be transmitted by other means such as
GOSPASS/SARSAT and AIS so maritime rescue coordination centre need to identify
whether maritime emergency requests from several sources are from a same user
and figure out whether such maritime emergency requests are true or false
alarms. It is out of 3GPP scope.
### 6.1.6 Requirements
[PR-6.1.6-1] 3GPP network shall transmit wake up message to UE for activating
[PR-6.1.6-2] UE shall transmit automatic maritime emergency request with
location information and heartbeat information of the UE at the sea to
maritime rescue coordination centre. The 3GPP system shall support to transmit
manual maritime emergency request to maritime rescue coordination centre.
[PR-6.1.6-3] The network shall support the maritime emergency agency to
transmit the list of users who need to be rescued with the vital information
(e.g. heartbeat, user's location) to a MCX UE in the patrol craft.
[PR-6.1.6-4] The 3GPP system shall support moving UE (e.g. drone) to operate
in relay mode for UEs that are out of 3GPP network coverage.
## 6.2 Use case on off-mode of mobility management for group of UEs in a
vessel
### 6.2.1 Description
IoT devices (e.g. location tracking sensors) are attached to containers and
products inside containers to help logistics system keep tracking the status
of them during the transportation on land and at sea. 3GPP systems support
different mobility management depending on UE's movements that are, for
example,
\- stationary during their entire usable life,
\- stationary during active periods, but nomadic between activations,
\- mobile within a constrained and well-defined space, and
\- fully mobile
This use case describes mobility management for IoT devices attached to
containers and products inside containers that can be regarded as stationary
in a vessel once they are on board though a vessel continues to move during
the voyage in order to make a representative UE of all IoT devices attached to
containers and products inside containers carry out necessary procedures for
the mobility management during the voyage and make IoT devices except for a
representative UE skip required procedures that need to be carried out
according to the mobility management procedure specified in 3GPP system
because it does not seem to be efficient to make all IoT devices on board
enforced to carry out mobility management procedure in a vessel especially
when such IoT devices are connected to the 3GPP system via the indirect
network connection.
### 6.2.2 Pre-conditions
Diverse mobility procedures that satisfy requirements specified in the section
6.2 of 3GPP TS 22.261 [x] are supported by 3GPP system.
Legacy mobility management procedures for IoT devices specified in 3GPP
technical specifications are carried out until IoT devices are on board.
Shipping routes of a vessel are in the coverage of 3GPP system.
IoT devices are attached to products that are packed into containers.
IoT devices are attached to containers that are delivered by a vessel.
IoT devices are subscribed to 3GPP system.
### 6.2.3 Service Flows
1\. IoT devices of containers are connected to 3GPP system.
2\. Those containers are completed to be loaded onto a vessel and the vessel
is ready for a voyage to deliver containers from Busan harbour to Mokpo
harbour.
3\. Containers are connected to 3GPP system via the indirect network
connection in the vessel after on board.
4\. The vessel is on voyage where the mobility management procedure is carried
out whenever 3GPP access networks are changed along to the shipping routes.
5\. Information (e.g. current location, estimated port arrival time) required
by shipping companies that need to keep tracking their products packed into
containers in the vessel is periodically transmitted to their shipping systems
over 3GPP system.
### 6.2.4 Post-conditions
Shipping companies took proper actions on time for the land transportation of
products packed into containers after the vessel is arrived at the port.
### 6.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None
### 6.2.6 Potential Requirements
[PR-6.2.6-1] 3GPP system shall provide a means of mapping a representative UE
(e.g. a UE whose identity is related to vessel identity or one of UEs attached
to containers) with all UEs attached to containers and products packed into
containers to enable a representative UE to carry out the mobility management
procedure instead of all of those UEs.
NOTE: A representative UE can be selected by the network based on the strength
of the radio signal transmitted by all of UEs attached to containers.
[PR-6.2.6-2] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of making the mobility
management of UEs attached to containers and products packed into containers
off during the voyage once they are loaded to the vessel and they are
connected to 3GPP system via indirect network connection.
## 6.3 Use case on Push to Location service among vessels
### 6.3.1 Description
When any accident happens in a vessel at sea, neighbouring vessels used to be
faster to go to help shipboard users in the vessel in danger than coastal
guards depending on where they are. Considering different rescue environment
at sea from on land, it is necessary to make it possible for a vessel to send
the location information to neighbouring vessels in a multicast or broadcast
way and for vessels to communicate each other directly.
This use case describes Push to Location service from a vessel to all
neighbouring vessels.
### 6.3.2 Pre-conditions
MCX Services off the network are supported for vessel to vessel communication.
3GPP system provides the solution to satisfy the requirement [R-7.8-001]
specified in the clause 7.8 of 3GPP TS 22.280 and the requirement [R-10-001]
specified in the clause 10 of 3GPP TS 22.280.
Each vessel has a device that is connected to 3GPP system and whose identity
is mapped into the identity of the vessel itself.
### 6.3.3 Service Flows
1\. Vessels are under night fishing and a single shipboard user is on board in
each vessel.
2\. All vessels are connected in off the network mode so shipboard users
communicate each other through MCX Services off the network.
3\. A shipboard user of the vessel A suddenly feels the pain and needs the
help from someone else. However, shipboard users from other vessels cannot see
what is happening to the shipboard user of the vessel A because it is so dark.
4\. The shipboard user of the vessel A push the button to send the location
information of the vessel A that is transmitted to all neighbouring vessels
that are connected together in off the network mode.
5\. Neighbouring vessels receive the location information of the vessel A and
shipboard users of neighbouring vessels move to the vessel A based on the
received location information to check if the shipboard user of the vessel A
is OK.
### 6.3.4 Post-conditions
Shipboard user of the vessel A was found and given proper emergency measures
until the coastal guards come to the vessel A and move the shipboard user of
the vessel A to the hospital on land.
### 6.3.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None
### 6.3.6 Potential Requirements
[PR-6.3.6-1] For maritime usage, off-network use of MCX Services shall be
supported.
[PR-6.3.6-2] The communication range between vessels for the push of the
location information is [15 km] in case of non-SOLAS vessels.
NOTE 1: The KPI of the communication range between vessels for the push of the
location information will be further analysed and can be revised during the
normative work.
NOTE 2: The KPI of the communication range between vessels for the voice call
or group call can be smaller than for the push of the location information.
NOTE 3: As an example, Korean coastal guards have the requirement that the
communication coverage between a large vessel (e.g. a carrier ship) and a
speedboat shall be supported by 7.5 km as a minimum value.
NOTE 4: Location information can be provided based on next positioning
technologies that are outcomes of 5G_HYPOS work.
## 6.4 Use case on small cells deployed in each cabin of a vessel
### 6.4.1 Description
Provision of wireless environment over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access in a
vessel is quite challenging because each cabin in a vessel is separated by
barriers made of steels that make wireless signal too weakened to go through
the barrier and be delivered to neighbouring cabins. In addition, it is also
very challenging to keep tracking the movement of cabin crews in a vessel that
could be one of essential requirements required for the safety of cabin crews
especially in case of a huge vessel where there are only a few cabin crews who
may be exposed to any unexpected risk in an enclosed place of the vessel.
The deployment of small cells in each cabin can be one of possible solutions
to provide wireless environment over 3GPP system in a vessel.
This use case describes the deployment scenario of small cells in each cabin
of a vessel and also the scenario where the movement of cabin crew can be
traceable with the help of the IoT device as well as the location information
of a cabin crew reported to the small cell.
### 6.4.2 Pre-conditions
Wireless backhaul is supported to connect small cells deployed in a vessel
with core networks deployed on land.
Small cells operate in licensed spectrums or unlicensed spectrum to provide
wireless services in a vessel.
Legacy procedures on small cells specified in 3GPP technical specification are
carried out in a vessel.
Isolated networks are built so that wireless services over 3GPP system inside
a vessel can be supported during the voyage regardless of whether the
connection to the core network is kept or lost.
IoT devices used by cabin crews are subscribed to 3GPP system and direct
device connection among IoT devices is supported.
### 6.4.3 Service Flows
1\. A cargo ship where small cells are deployed in each cabin and on the deck,
are on voyage to transport dangerous substance.
2\. A few cabin crews are on board to navigate a cargo ship, manage facilities
during the voyage and periodically go around in a cargo ship alone to check if
everything is OK.
3\. A cabin crew has an IoT device on his wrist that is connected to a small
cell of a cabin and sends the information (e.g. the current location of the
user of IoT device) to the bridge of the cargo ship only if there is no
movement from a user of the IoT device during the given time in order to
prevent cabin crews from being exposed to any risk alone while going around in
a cargo ship.
4\. A cabin crew starts to go around in a cargo ship alone and enters into
cabin A where small cell A is deployed and his IoT device is attached to small
cell A as soon as he enters cabin A.
5\. He moves to cabin B and his IoT device is attached to small cell B that is
deployed in the cabin B. Unfortunately, something wrong happens so he
collapsed there.
6\. After the given time is passed, he is lying unconscious on the floor of
the cabin B so his IoT device transmits the information (e.g. the current
location of the user based on the information of the registered small cell B
as well as other information on his health status) to the devices of other
cabin crews as well as the bridge of the cargo ship.
7\. In addition, his IoT device also transmits the request that will trigger
the activation of all IoT devices (e.g. CCTV cameras, sensors detecting a
dangerous substance) deployed in the cabin B to check if there is any
identifiable risk (e.g. any leak of dangerous substance) by the direct device
connection among IoT devices in the cabin B.
8\. Real time video streaming captured from CCTV cameras in the cabin B is
transmitted to the bridge and a captain who is at the bridge of a cargo ship
notices what is happening to the cabin crew collapsed in the cabin B and based
on the information transmitted from IoT device of the cabin crew in the cabin
B (e.g. information on his health status) as well as from other IoT devices
that detect any leak of dangerous substance, the captain identifies that
fortunately there is no leak of dangerous substance.
9\. Another cabin crew in other cabin nearby cabin B gets informed of the
emergency occurrence to the cabin crew in the cabin B because his device shows
such emergency event with detailed information transmitted from IoT device of
the collapsed cabin crew in the cabin B. So, he runs into the cabin B to help
the cabin crew in the cabin B
### 6.4.4 Post-conditions
Cabin crew collapsed in the cabin B could be recovered soon with the help of
his colleague who were in other cabin nearby cabin B and ran into the cabin B.
### 6.4.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None
### 6.4.6 Potential Requirements
[PR-6.4.6-1] 3GPP system shall provide a means of mapping the location
information of each cabin in a vessel with the location information of a
corresponding small cell deployed in each cabin so that the location
information of devices that is in a cabin is identifiable based on the
location information of a small cell deployed in that cabin.
[PR-6.4.6-2] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of multicasting or
broadcasting the information received from IoT device via a small cell to
devices of shipboard users via only small cells deployed in cabins where there
are shipboard users.
# 7 Use Cases for Maritime Communication Services between Authorities and
Users at Sea
## 7.1 Vessel Shore Reporting
### 7.1.1 Description
The description on IMO MSP 8 (vessel shore reporting) is provided in IMO NCSR
1-28 [3] as follows.
_The aim of vessel shore reporting is to safeguard traffic at sea, ensure
personnel safety and security, ensure environmental protection and increase
the efficiency of maritime operations._
_Maritime single window is one of the most important solutions to reduce the
mariners workload (amount of time spent on preparing and submitting reports to
shore-based authorities). To achieve this, reports should be automatically
generated as much as possible from onboard systems. Some other important
possibilities for vessel shore reporting system may include:_
_\- single-entry of reportable information in single-window solution;_
_\- automated collection of internal ship data for reporting;_
_\- all national reporting requirements to apply standardized digital
reporting formats based on IMO FAL forms; and_
_\- automated or semi-automated digital distribution/communication of required
reportable information._
End-users of vessel shore reporting identified as IMO MSP 8 could be shore-
based users such as national competent authorities, ship owners or operator
and shipboard users such as a ship master who has the access right to vessel
shore reporting.
IMO/IHO HGDM group is under the development of the guideline on IMO MSP till
September 2018 and the guideline on IMO MSP developed by IMO/IHO HGDM group is
planned to be reported to IMO NCSR#6 that is supposed to be held in March
2019. Then, IMO MSC#101 that is supposed to be held in June 2019 is planned to
make a decision on the guideline of IMO MSP based on the report from IMO
NSCR#6. Considering the status of IMO standardisation [4][5], it is not
possible to receive the detailed guidance on this IMO MSP before the
standardisation of this Technical Report is completed. So, the use case on
this IMO MSP is not introduced in this Technical Report.
## 7.2 Use case on communication for search and rescue
### 7.2.1 Description
This use case describes a scenario where a user saves the life by receiving
the immediate emergency treatment by the tele-medical service accessible
between the patrol boat of coast guards at sea and the health organization on
land after the maritime emergency request is transmitted to the maritime
rescue co-ordination centre that transmits the maritime notification message
informing the emergency event to patrol boats of coast guards at sea.
### 7.2.2 Pre-conditions
The patrol boat of the coast guard is equipped with the tele-medical treatment
machine that is connected to national health organization or dedicated health
organization such as a hospital for the tele-medical service over 3GPP system.
In addition, the patrol boat is in the coverage of 3GPP system at sea and
mission critical services such as MCVideo and MCData are supported for the
communication between the coast guard in the patrol boat and a doctor in
health organizations in order to provide tele-medical services.
Because most of yacht are made of the steel material, UEs on the yacht
(especially in the steel cabin of the yacht) access 3GPP network via the
indirect network connection provided by another UE that plays a role as a
relay UE and is deployed at the top of the yacht.
### 7.2.3 Service Flows
When Jiho and her friends are spending their summer vacation on the yacht at
sea, Jiho suddenly collapses in the steel cabin of the yacht so one of her
friends sends a maritime emergency request to the maritime rescue co-
ordination centre using her mobile device through the indirect network
connection provided by the relay UE.
The maritime rescue co-ordination centre transmits the maritime notification
message about the emergency event and the location of the yacht to all patrol
boats of coast guards around the yacht at sea.
One of patrol boats is fortunately very close to the yacht so sends the reply
message back to the maritime rescue co-ordination centre in order to indicate
that they will move to Jiho's yacht.
Jiho needs the immediate medical treatment when the coast guards arrive at the
yacht so they move her to the patrol boat to take her to the hospital on land.
The coast guard requests the maritime rescue co-ordination centre to call for
the ambulance that takes her to the hospital as soon as the patrol boat
arrives at the port while the tele-medical service is provided to her through
tele-medical treatment machine in the patrol boat.
The doctor examines her health status based on the video information
transmitted from the tele-medical treatment machine over the relay UE that is
connected to 3GPP system.
### 7.2.4 Post-conditions
Coast guard took the proper medical action for Jiho according to the
instruction of the doctor thanks to the tele-medical service in the patrol
boat before arriving at the port so they saved her life.
### 7.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None identified

## 7.3 Coastal and local warning service
### 7.3.1 Description
Maritime safety information service provides navigational warning,
meteorological information and other urgent safety-related information.
Navigational warnings are messages containing urgent information relevant to
safe navigation that are broadcast to ships in accordance with the provisions
of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as
amended. There are four types of navigational warnings, i.e. NAVAREA warnings,
Sub-Area warnings, coastal warnings and local warnings. The first two warnings
are broadcast by NAVTEX or SafetyNET and the second two warnings could be
broadcast by other means (e.g. 3GPP system) than NAVTEX or SafeyNET according
to IMO NCSR 1/15/1 [2].
Costal warnings disseminate the information which is necessary for safe
navigation within areas seaward of the fairway buoy or pilot station, and
should not be restricted to main shipping lanes.
Local warnings disseminate the information which covers inshore waters, often
within the limits of jurisdiction of a harbour or port authority. They are
disseminated by other means than NAVTEX or SafetyNET, and supplement to
coastal warnings by giving detailed information within inshore waters.
This use case describes a scenario where coastal and local warnings
disseminate the information relevant to safe navigation over 3GPP system and
vessels automatically monitor disseminated information and display information
which is relevant to their navigation.
### 7.3.2 Pre-conditions
Coastal and local warning service is available to all vessels that are
subscribed to 3GPP system.
Electronic Navigation Chart (ENC) service is available to an authority in
charge of coastal and local warnings and to a vessel and shipboard users (e.g.
mariner or shipmaster) of that vessel
Vessels are in the coverage of 3GPP system.
### 7.3.3 Service Flows
1\. When a vessel is approaching the port, a shipboard user (e.g. a mariner or
a shipmaster) requests a maritime safety information from an authority (e.g.
national administrator of the national coordinator) in charge of coastal and
local warnings.
2\. The authority in charge of coastal and local warnings provides the coastal
and local warnings.
NOTE 1: An authority can provide either coastal warning or local warning or
both depending on marine traffic information and marine environmental
situation near a vessel requesting a maritime safety information.
NOTE 2: According to IMO NCSR 1/15/1 [2], a message that is sent to notify
coastal and local warnings consists of three parts, i.e. preamble, warning and
postscript. The identifier of that message (i.e. message series identifier
followed by the consecutive number) is always included in the preamble of that
message. As a minimum information of coastal and local warnings, the
information about a key subject and a geographical position is included in
that message and the example of key subjects are as follows.
> \- Casualties to lights, fog signals, buoys and other aids to navigation
> affecting main shipping lanes;
>
> \- The presence of dangerous wrecks in or near main shipping lanes and, if
> relevant, their marking;
>
> \- Establishment of major new aids to navigation or significant changes to
> existing ones, when such establishment or change might be misleading to
> shipping;
>
> \- The presence of large unwieldy tows in congested waters;
>
> \- Drifting hazards (including derelict ships, ice, mines, containers, other
> large items over 6 metres in length, etc.);
>
> \- Areas where search and rescue (SAR) and anti-pollution operations are
> being carried out (for avoidance of such areas);
>
> \- The presence of newly discovered rocks, shoals, reefs and wrecks likely
> to constitute a danger to shipping, and, if relevant, their marking;
>
> \- Unexpected alteration or suspension of established routes;
>
> \- Cable or pipe-laying activities, seismic surveys, the towing of large
> submerged objects for research or exploration purposes, the employment of
> manned or unmanned submersibles, or other underwater operations constituting
> potential dangers in or near shipping lanes;
>
> \- The establishment of research or scientific instruments in or near
> shipping lanes;
>
> \- The establishment of offshore structures in or near shipping lanes;
>
> \- Significant malfunctioning of radio-navigation services and shore-based
> maritime safety information radio or satellite services;
>
> \- Information concerning events which might affect the safety of shipping,
> sometimes over wide areas, e.g. naval exercises, missile firings, space
> missions, nuclear tests, ordnance dumping zones, etc;
>
> \- Operating anomalies identified within ECDIS including ENC issues;
>
> \- Acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships;
>
> \- Tsunamis and other natural phenomena, such as abnormal changes to sea
> level;
>
> \- World Health Organization (WHO) health advisory information; and
>
> \- Security-related requirements in accordance with the requirements of the
> ISPS (International Ship and Port Facility Security) only.
3\. The authority provides another message to the vessel requesting maritime
safety information in order to provide enough extra data for shipboard users
of that vessel to be able to recognize the hazard and assess its effect upon
their navigation.
4\. The authority periodically broadcasts coastal and local warnings at a
scheduled notification time as well to all vessels in the coverage of 3GPP
system.
NOTE 1: Same coastal and local warnings can be disseminated at a scheduled
notification time if they are valid.
NOTE 2: Cancellation details are included in a message notified in order to
inform that coastal and local warnings related to that message is cancelled
and not valid any more.
NOTE 3: A message indicating no warnings can be periodically disseminated at a
scheduled notification time though there are no coastal and local warnings to
be notified.
5\. Source data relating to coastal and local warnings that are notified are
recorded with coastal and local warning messages including message series
identifier according to the requirement of the national administration.
6\. The shipboard user receives messages notified by the authority in charge
of coastal and local warnings and identifies some important information
included in that message on the ENC in the vessel.
### 7.3.4 Post-conditions
The vessel safely entered to the port by avoiding potential risks that were
notified by coastal and local warning service.
### 7.3.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None
### 7.3.6 Potential Requirements
[PR-7.3.6-1] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of correlating a UE
identity with a vessel identity (e.g. a national vessel identification number
managed by a national authority or an IMO number that is a unique
international vessel identification number consisting of 7-digit number).
[PR-7.3.6-2] The information related to a vessel-dedicated UE's actual
position where the vessel is located and is expected to be located along with
a navigational route shall be included in a message sent from a UE in order to
request a maritime safety information.
NOTE: The example of the information related to a vessel-dedicated UE's actual
position is current position, heading and speed of a vessel and scheduled
navigational routes, heading and speed of a vessel.
[PR-7.3.6-3] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of notifying a message on
coastal and local warnings to a sea area that includes the position, heading
and speed of other UEs in the area.
[PR-7.3.6-4] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of enabling only the UE
that requested a maritime safety information to identify a message notified
from an authority in charge of coastal and local warnings.
[PR-7.3.6-5] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of enabling all UEs of
vessels that are in the coverage of 3GPP system to identify a message
broadcast from an authority in charge of coastal and local warnings.
## 7.4 Pilotage service
### 7.4.1 Description
This use case describes the pilotage service that provides shipboard users
such as a pilot or a shipmaster and shore-based users such as pilot
authorities, pilot organization or bridge personnel the exact information
necessary to manoeuvre vessels through pilotage areas such as dangerous or
congested waters and harbours or to anchor vessels in a harbour in order to
safeguard traffic at sea and protect the environment.
### 7.4.2 Pre-conditions
Shipboard users such as a pilot who has a pilotage certificate or licensing or
a shipmaster who has a pilotage exemption certificate are subscribed to
pilotage service.
Vessels are subscribed to pilotage service and to 3GPP system so that the
information about their neighbouring situations including other vessels that
are operating in a pilotage area is able to be timely provided over 3GPP
system to make vessels successfully pass through a pilotage area.
Vessels are subscribed to electronic navigation chart (ENC) service so the ENC
is updated as the latest version when a vessel is in a pilotage area.
NOTE: A shipboard user can identify the latest information about a port or sea
area such as the depth of water, buoys, navigational route, berth information
from the ENC.
Pilotage service is accessible to ENC service.
Vessels are subscribed to coastal and local warning service so the maritime
safety information including the meteorological information is updated as the
latest version when a vessel is in a pilotage area.
A drone with a 3D-LiDAR sensor that is operated by a pilot authority or pilot
organisation is subscribed to pilotage service and to 3GPP system.
A pilotage area is in the coverage of 3GPP system.
### 7.4.3 Service Flows
1\. A shipboard user (e.g. mariner or shipmaster) on a vessel A sends an
online request on pilotage service to a pilot authority or pilot organisation
such as a (local) pilot office when the vessel A is approaching a pilotage
area.
NOTE: A ship company or an agent in charge of the vessel A can request a pilot
assignment to a pilot authority or pilot organisation instead of a shipboard
user on the vessel A in advance before the vessel A's entry or departure.
2\. A shipmaster on a vessel B who has the pilotage exemption certificate also
sends a request on pilotage service to a pilot authority or pilot organization
when the vessel B is approaching the same pilotage area. He informs a pilot
authority or pilot organization of his pilotage exemption certificate in order
to manoeuvre his vessel by himself and pass a pilotage area.
3\. The pilot authority or pilot organization accept requests on pilotage
service for the vessel A and the vessel B. In addition, they inform the vessel
A of the assignment of a pilot after assigning a pilot to provide pilotage
service for the vessel A and permit the shipmaster on the vessel B to access
the pilotage service that is available to a pilot.
4\. The pilot embarks on the vessel A and logs in the pilotage service. Then,
the pilotage service authenticates the pilot on the vessel A and authorises
the pilot to the pilotage service that is available to a pilot.
NOTE: A pilot can log in the pilotage service using a device that is one of
communication equipment inside the vessel A or using a device that is brought
by a pilot and is connected to an equipment of the vessel A.
5\. The pilotage service provides the shipboard user (i.e. a pilot or a
shipmaster with the pilotage exemption certificate) with the latest
information such as a port guideline of a pilotage area that helps the
shipboard user understand the characteristics of sea area corresponding to a
pilotage area and the standard piloting method in advance.
6\. The shipboard user (i.e. a pilot or a shipmaster with the pilotage
exemption certificate) identifies the marine traffic information about all
vessels in a pilotage area from the pilotage service. The example of the
marine traffic information is as follows.
\- static information about vessels such as IMO number as a vessel
identification number consisting of 7-digit number and vessel particulars)
> NOTE: Vessel particulars include vessel name, call sign, IMO number, MMSI
> number, type, flag/port of registry, gross tonnage/net tonnage, dead weight,
> LOA (Length Over All), width, depth etc.
\- dynamic information about the movement of vessels such as direction, speed,
rate of turn (ROT) expressed in degrees per second of heading change that
vessels make, and position of vessels
\- navigational information (e.g. cargo, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and
destination of a vessel)
7\. A drone with a 3D-LiDAR sensor that is operated by a pilot authority or a
pilot organisation is flying above the vessel A and the information captured
from the 3D-LiDAR sensor is transmitted in real time to the vessel A, a pilot
authority or a pilot organisation and a bridge personnel until the shipboard
user (i.e. a pilot or a shipmaster with the pilotage exemption certificate)
completes his mission on the pilotage.
NOTE: Information that is captured by a 3D-LiDAR and is transmitted to the
vessel A, a pilot authority or a pilot organisation and a bridge personnel can
be displayed in the ENC if the ENC supports 3D data.
8\. The pilotage service provides the prediction of vessels' movement in a
pilotage area based on the information of the current vessels' movement that
is obtained from AIS, radar sensor of vessels or 3D-LiDAR sensor of a drone.
In addition, the pilotage service provides a piloting route automatically
proposed by the pilotage service or manually planned by the shipboard user
(i.e. a pilot or a shipmaster with the pilotage exemption certificate).
9\. In order to avoid any collision between vessel A and vessel B in a
pilotage area, the information relevant to safe navigation is exchanged
between vessel A and vessel B directly. Such information is also transmitted
to a pilot authority, a pilot organization or a bridge personnel who are
involved in supporting the pilotage service for the vessel A and vessel B
10\. A bridge personnel transmits a local warning that in advance informs
vessel A and vessel B of any potential risk (e.g. a collision between two
vessels or a collision between a vessel and any obstacle) if it is anticipated
by the pilotage service.
10\. The shipboard user (i.e. a pilot or a shipmaster with the pilotage
exemption certificate) manoeuvres his vessel and passes a pilotage area with
the help of several useful information provided by pilotage service.
11\. The pilotage service records vessel routes passed in real time.
### 7.4.4 Post-conditions
Vessel A and vessel B are safely anchored to the port without any collision or
accident.
### 7.4.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None
### 7.4.6 Potential Requirements

identity with a vessel identity (e.g. IMO number that is a unique
international vessel identification number consisting of 7-digit number).
[PR-7.4.6-3] 3GPP system shall support to transmit the information about the
movement of vessels obtained from diverse sensors (e.g. 3D-LiDAR, radar, GPS)
in real time.
[PR-7.4.6-4] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of synchronising the
information used by shipboard users (i.e. a pilot or a shipmaster with
pilotage exemption certificate) and shore-based users (e.g. a pilot authority
or a pilot organisation and a bridge personnel).
[PR-7.4.6-5] 3GPP system shall support the data rate and the latency that
enable a shipboard user not to recognise any gap between the real vessel
movement and the vessel movement shown through the pilotage service.
NOTE: Depending on the size and weight of a vessel, it may cause a large
movement of a vessel within a very short time that is difficult to restore to
the original status. Very short latency is also as important as the high data
rate when transmitting information obtained from sensors such as 3D-LiDAR.
[PR-7.4.6-6] 3GPP system shall support real-time data streaming service.
## 7.5 Tugs service
### 7.5.1 Description
A tug is a boat or ship that manoeuvres vessels by pushing or towing them.
Tugs move vessels that either should not move by themselves (e.g. vessels
passing in a narrow canal, berthing and unberthing operations) or those that
cannot move by themselves (e.g. barges, disabled ships, oil platforms).
This use case describes the tugs service that are for ship assistance (e.g.
mooring), towage (in harbour/ocean), or escort operations to safeguard traffic
at sea and protect the environment.
### 7.5.2 Pre-conditions

request on tugs service to a port tug organisation when a vessel is
approaching a waiting point of a tug area.
NOTE: A ship company or an agent in charge of a vessel can request the
assignment of tug boats to a port tug organisation instead of a shipboard user
on a vessel in advance before a vessel's entry or departure.
2\. The port tug organisation accepts the request on tugs service for the
vessel, assign four tug boats to move that vessel and inform the vessel
requesting tugs service of the assignment of tug boats.
NOTE: The number of tug boats assigned by a port tug organisation may be
decided depending on the size of a vessel that tug boats move.
3\. Tug boats approach the vessel and are attached to that vessel with tugboat
ropes. In addition, tug boats and the vessel are connected together through
indirect network connection between tug boats and the vessel via a drone with
a 3D-LiDAR sensor or through direct network connection between them over 3GPP
system in order to directly exchange the information necessary for tugs
service depending on the capability of the vessel.
4\. Shipmasters of four tug boats receive the marine traffic information about
all vessels in a tug area from the pilotage service. In addition, they share
information about tug boats and the vessel that tug boats move with bridge
personnel or pilots manoeuvring other vessels in a tug area through pilotage
service in real-time.
NOTE: The shipmasters of the four tug boats receive all information from the
pilotage service that is available to a pilot in a tug area. They may receive
the information about the vessel that tug boats move either via the indirect
network connection through the drone or via the direct network connection
between tug boats and the vessel that tug boats move.
5\. A drone with a 3D-LiDAR sensor that is operated by a port tug organisation
is flying above tug boats and the vessel and the information captured from the
3D-LiDAR sensor is transmitted in real time to tug boats, the vessel, a port
tug organisation and a bridge personnel until shipmasters of tug boats
complete their mission on the tugs service.
NOTE: Information that is captured by a 3D-LiDAR and is transmitted to tug
boats, the vessel, a port tug organisation and a bridge personnel can be
displayed in the ENC if the ENC service supports 3D data.
6\. A bridge personnel transmits a local warning that informs shipmasters of
tug boats of any potential risk (e.g. a collision between tug boats and other
vessels).
7\. Tugs service provides the prediction of the movement of tug boats.

## 7.8 VTS Information Service
### 7.8.1 Description
The description on IMO MSP 1 (VTS Information Service) is provided in IMO NCSR
1-28 [3] as follows.
_Vessel traffic service (VTS) is a shore-side system which range from the
provision of simple information messages to ships, such as position of other
traffic or meteorological hazard warnings, to extensive management of traffic
within a port or waterway._
_Generally, ships entering a VTS area report to the authorities, usually by
radio, and may be tracked by the VTS control centre. Ships must keep watching
on a specific frequency for navigational or other warnings, while they may be
contacted directly by the VTS operator if there is risk of an incident or, in
areas where traffic flow is regulated, to be given advice on when to proceed._

packed into containers) during the voyage once they are loaded to the vessel
and they are connected to 3GPP system via indirect network connection.
[PR-10.2.2-10] The communication range between vessels for the push of the
location information shall be [15 km] as minimum in case of non-SOLAS vessels.
NOTE 1: The KPI of the communication range between vessels for the push of the
location information will be further analysed and can be revised during the
normative work.
NOTE 2: The KPI of the communication range between vessels for the voice call
or group call can be smaller than for the push of the location information.
NOTE 3: As an example, Korean coastal guards require that the minimum
communication range between a large vessel (e.g. a carrier ship) and a
speedboat is larger than 7.5 km.
NOTE 4: Location information can be provided based on positioning technologies
that are outcomes of HYPOS work.
[PR-10.2.2-11] 3GPP system shall provide a means of mapping the location
information of each cabin in a vessel with the location information of a
corresponding small cell deployed in each cabin so that the location
information of devices that is in a cabin is identifiable based on the
location information of a small cell deployed in that cabin.
[PR-10.2.2-12] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of multicasting or
broadcasting the information received from IoT device via a small cell to
devices of shipboard users via only small cells deployed in cabins where there
are shipboard users.
[PR-10.2.2-13] 3GPP system shall support the capability of transmitting
vessel's location information used in the legacy maritime communication in
case there is any equipment providing such location information inside the
vessel.
[PR-10.2.2-14] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of correlating a UE
identity with a vessel identity (e.g. a national vessel identification number
managed by a national authority or an IMO number that is a unique

### 10.2.3 Potential requirements dedicated to authority-related usage on
maritime safety and traffic management
This section consolidates potential requirements dedicated to authority-
related usage for the purpose of maritime safety and traffic management (e.g.
IMO MSPs) over 3GPP system.
[PR-10.2.3-1] UE shall transmit automatic maritime emergency request with
location information and heartbeat information of the UE at the sea to
maritime rescue coordination centre. The 3GPP system shall support to transmit
manual maritime emergency request to maritime rescue coordination centre.
[PR-10.2.3-2] The network shall support the maritime emergency agency to
transmit the list of users who need to be rescued with the vital information
(e.g. heartbeat, user's location) to a MCX UE in the patrol craft.
[PR-10.2.3-3] A UE shall transmit the maritime emergency request with the
location information of the UE at sea to the mission critical organisation
(e.g. maritime rescue co-ordination centre) when the UE transmits the maritime
emergency request via the indirect network connection.
[PR-10.2.3-4] The 3GPP network shall transmit the maritime notification
message including the user's location information extracted from the maritime
emergency request and optionally emergency event information to inform.
[PR-10.2.3-5] An MCX UE shall receive the maritime notification message
transmitted from the mission critical organisation over 3GPP system and an MCX
UE may receive the maritime notification message transmitted from the mission
critical organisation via the indirect network connection provided by the
relay UE connecting to 3GPP system.
[PR-10.2.3-6] A UE at sea may receive the maritime notification message
transmitted from the mission critical organisation over 3GPP system.
[PR-10.2.3-7] The MCX UE shall transmit the maritime response message
including the location information of the authority (e.g. the location of the
patrol boat of the coast guard) at sea to the mission critical organization
over 3GPP system.
[PR-10.2.3-8] A remote MCX UE shall be capable of accessing MCVideo service
and MCData service via the relay UE (i.e., a UE that is a vessel, itself) for
the communication between the coast guard of the patrol boat and a doctor in a
health organisation to support the tele-medical service.
[PR-10.2.3-9] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of notifying a message on
coastal and local warnings to a sea area that includes the position, heading
and speed of other UEs in the area.
[PR-10.2.3-10] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of enabling only the UE
that requested a maritime safety information to identify a message notified
from an authority in charge of coastal and local warnings.
[PR-10.2.3-11] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of enabling all UEs of
vessels that are in the coverage of 3GPP system to identify a message
broadcast from an authority in charge of coastal and local warnings.
[PR-10.2.3-12] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of authenticating a UE
transmitting an online request on pilotage service and authorising such a UE
to access the pilotage service.
[PR-10.2.3-13] 3GPP system shall support the data rate and the latency that
enable a shipboard user not to recognise any gap between the real vessel
movement and the vessel movement shown through the pilotage service.
NOTE: Depending on the size and weight of a vessel, it may cause a large
movement of a vessel within a very short time that is difficult to restore to
the original status. Very short latency is also as important as the high data
rate when transmitting information obtained from sensors such as 3D-LiDAR.
[PR-10.2.3-14] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism for tugs service to
authenticate and authorise a UE to access the tugs service.
[PR-10.2.3-15] 3GPP system shall support handling of an online request for
tugs service from an authorised UE.
[PR-10.2.3-16] 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism of registering the UEs
that are dedicated to tug boats and a vessel moved by tug boats as a group of
UEs.
[PR-10.2.3-17] Group communication among a group of UEs that are dedicated to
tug boats and a vessel moved by tug boats shall be supported via the direct
network connection or via indirect network connection.
NOTE 1: The example of a relay UE providing the indirect network connection
mode is a drone that is regarded as one of UEs or a UE deployed in the highest
place of a vessel or one of tug boats where the group communication among a
group of UEs is available.
NOTE 2: Group communication specified by off-network MC can be used to support
the group communication among a group of UEs dedicated to tug boats and a
vessel moved by tug boats.
NOTE 3: Existing ProSe enabling technologies can be suitable to vessel to
vessel communication in spite of the limitation of the communication range
between vessels that is a few hundred meters to less than 2 kilometers in case
of SOLAS vessels.
[PR-10.2.3-18] 3GPP system shall support the data rate and the latency that
enable shipboard users (e.g. shipmasters of tug boats) to exquisitely
coordinate tug boats based on all information available to them (e.g. the
information captured from the 3D-LiDAR sensor in real-time during tugs
service) while manoeuvring tug boats to move a vessel to the destination.
NOTE: Depending on the size and weight of a vessel, it may cause a large
movement of a vessel within a very short time that is difficult to restore to
the original status. Very short latency is also as important as the high data
rate when transmitting information obtained from sensors such as 3D-LiDAR.
[PR-10.2.3-19] 3GPP network shall transmit warning message received from
maritime authorities to neighbouring ships.
# 11 Conclusion and Recommendations
## 11.1 Conclusion
This Technical Report studied use cases and potential requirements for the
support of maritime communication services over 3GPP system so that 3GPP
system can be a good candidate of innovative tools to help address the
information gap between users on land and users at sea as well as the maritime
safety and vessel traffic management etc. that IMO intends to achieve
especially in 5G era.
Consolidated potential requirements are specified in the section 10.2.1 to
enable existing 3GPP enabling technologies to be applicable for the support of
maritime communication services over 3GPP system. Example of existing features
are as follows.
\- Mobile services such as mobile internet access, real time audio and video
streaming for transmission and reception, TV broadcast and multicast services,
SMS, MSM, voice call and video call etc.
\- Machine type communication such as eMTC and NB-IoT feature
\- Public warning service for PWS-UEs and ePWS-UEs
\- Mission Critical Services on-network and off-network
\- General 5G services developed by SMARTER work
\- Enabling technologies developed by 5GSAT work and 5GLAN work
\- Indoor positioning services developed by 5G_HYPOS
Consolidated potential requirements dedicated to maritime usage are described
in the section 10.2.2 and 10.2.3.
\- In the section 10.2.2, consolidated potential requirements that are common
requirements for the general maritime usage applicable for commercial maritime
usage as well as authority-related usage for the purpose of maritime safety
and traffic management over 3GPP system.
\- In the section 10.2.3, consolidated potential requirements dedicated to
authority-related usage on maritime safety and traffic management over 3GPP
system.
## 11.2 Recommendations
It is recommended to start the normative work on consolidated potential
requirements described in the clause 10.
Work is ongoing in the maritime domain for the digitalisation and mobilisation
of maritime related businesses as well as maritime safety and traffic
management. New movement towards the 4^th^ Industrial Revolution of maritime
domain is getting to recognise that mobile communication tools such as 3GPP
system need to be taken into account for the realization of maritime
autonomous ship, maritime smart shipping or smart port that requires the
performance incapable of being satisfied by legacy maritime communication
systems or evolved ones.
Therefore, it is also recommended to continue to study new maritime use cases
that 3GPP need to take into account so that 3GPP system can be a good
candidate of innovative tools as mobile communication platform necessary for
the digitalization and mobilization of the maritime domain that bring about
the Fourth Industrial Revolution of the maritime businesses as well as
maritime safety and traffic management.
Annex A (informative): Status of existing and future communication

is described in Table A-3 that is included in IALA Maritime Radio
Communication Plan [9].
NOTE: From 3GPP perspective, the information given in Table A-3 for 4G
(including LTE) and 5G need to be revised to reflect what 3GPP enabling
