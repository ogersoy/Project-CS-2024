# Introduction
The present document addresses a challenging class of vertical applications,
namely cyber-physical control applications, which require very high levels of
communication service availability, and some of them also require very low
end-to-end latencies.
Real-time Ethernet is one of the established wireline communication
technologies for cyber-physical control applications, and this specification
identifies requirements that 5G systems must meet to support real-time
Ethernet.
The present document provides new Stage 1 requirements based on the input from
relevant stakeholders of the respective vertical domains.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides Stage 1 normative service requirements for 5G
systems, in particular service requirements for cyber-physical control
applications in vertical domains. In the context of the present document,
cyber-physical systems are to be understood as systems that include
engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational components;
control applications are to be understood as applications that control
physical processes.
Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to
be ultra-reliable and, in some cases, the end-to-end latency must be very low.
Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation in
various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation and energy
automation.
The aspects addressed in the present document include:
\- end-to-end service performance requirements and network performance
requirements related to these end-to-end service performance requirements;
\- support for LAN-type services specific to industrial/high performance use
cases. Related Ethernet functionalities include, for example, those in IEEE
802.1Qbv.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Introduction
For the purpose of this document, a vertical domain is a particular industry
or group of enterprises in which similar products or services are developed,
produced, and provided. Automation refers to the control of processes,
devices, or systems in vertical domains by automatic means. The main control
functions of automated control systems include taking measurements, comparing
results, computing any detected or anticipated errors, and correcting the
process to avoid future errors. These functions are performed by sensors,
transmitters, controllers, and actuators.
In the context of this document, cyber-physical systems are referred to as
systems that include engineered, interacting networks of physical and
computational components. Cyber-physical control applications are to be
understood as applications that control physical processes. Cyber-physical
control applications in automation follow certain activity patterns, which are
open-loop control, closed-loop control, sequence control, and batch control
(see Clause 4.2).
Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to
be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service availability,
and often require low or (in some cases) very low end-to-end latency.
Communication in automation in vertical domains follows certain communication
patterns. The most well-known is periodic deterministic communication, others
are aperiodic deterministic communication and non-deterministic communication
(see Clause 4.3).
Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation in
various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation and energy
automation. This document addresses service requirements for cyber-physical
control applications and supporting communication services from the vertical
domains of factories of the future (smart manufacturing), electric power
distribution, and central power generation. Service requirements for cyber-
physical control applications and supporting communication services for rail-
bound mass transit are addressed in TS 22.289 [23].
## 4.2 Activity patterns in automation
**Open-loop control:** The salient aspect of open-loop control is the lack of
feedback from the output to the control; when providing commands to an
actuator, it is assumed that the output of the influenced process is
predetermined and within an acceptable range. This kind of control loop works
if the influences of the environment on process and actuator are negligible.
Also, this kind of control is applied in case unwanted output can be tolerated
[8].
**Closed-loop control:** Closed-loop control enables the manipulation of
processes even if the environment influences the process or the performance of
the actuator changes over time. This type of control is realised by sensing
the process output and by feeding these measurements back into a controller
[8].
**Sequence control:** Sequence control may either step through a fixed
sequence or employ logic that performs different actions based on various
system states and system input [8]. Sequence control can be seen as an
extension of both open-loop and closed-loop control, but instead of achieving
only one output instance, an entire sequence of output instances can be
produced [9].
**Batch control:** Batch processes lead to the production of finite quantities
of material (batches) by subjecting input materials to a defined order of
processing actions by use of one or more pieces of equipment [10].
## 4.3 Communication attributes
**Communication in automation can be characterised by two main attributes:
periodicity and determinism.**
Periodicity means that a transmission interval is repeated. For example, a
transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical transmission can be
the periodic update of a position or the repeated monitoring of a
characteristic parameter. Most periodic intervals in communication for
automation are rather short. The transmission is started once and continuous
unless a stop command is provided.
An aperiodic transmission is, for example, a transmission which is triggered
instantaneously by an event, i.e., events are the trigger of the transmission.
Events are defined by the control system or by the user. Example events are:
\- Process events: events that come from the process when thresholds are
exceeded or fallen below, e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.
\- Diagnostic events: events that indicate malfunctions of an automation
device or module, e.g., power supply defective; short circuit; too high
temperature; etc.
\- Maintenance events: events based on information that indicates necessary
maintenance work to prevent the failure of an automation device.
Most events, and especially alarms, are confirmed. In this context, alarms are
messages that inform a controller or operator that an event has occurred,
e.g., an equipment malfunction, process deviation, or other abnormal condition
requiring a response. The receipt of the alarm is acknowledged usually within
a short time period by the application that received the alarm. If no
acknowledgment is received from the target application after a preset time,
the so-called monitoring time, the alarm is sent again after a preset time or
some failure response action is started.
Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and
receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds).
Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given
threshold for the latency/transmission time. **In case of a periodic
transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.**
## 4.4 Control systems and related communication patterns
**There are preferences in the mapping between the type of control and the
communication pattern. Open-loop control is characterised by one or many
messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic
pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since
typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving
application is expected.**
**Closed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication
patterns. Closed-loop control is often used for the control of continuous
processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control of a printing
press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic communication patterns.
Note that in both the aperiodic and periodic case, the communication needs to
be deterministic.**
**Logging of device states, measurements, etc. for maintenance purposes and
such typically entails aperiodic communication patterns. In case the
transmitted logging information can be time-stamped by the respective
function, determinism is often not mandatory.**
In practice, vertical communication networks serve a large number of
applications exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. In order
to facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network during
engineering and for reducing the complexity of network optimisation, traffic
classes or communication patterns have been identified [6]. There are three
typical traffic classes or communication patterns in industrial environments
[6], i.e.,
\- deterministic periodic communication: periodic communication with stringent
requirements on timeliness of the transmission.
\- deterministic aperiodic communication: communication without a preset
sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of communication
is suitable are event-driven actions.
\- non-deterministic communication: subsumes all other types of traffic,
including periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic.
Periodicity is irrelevant in case the communication is not time-critical.
Some communication services exhibit traffic patterns that cannot be assigned
to one of the above communication patterns exclusively (mixed traffic).
## 4.5 Implications for 5G systems
In order to be suitable for automation in vertical domains, 5G systems need to
be dependable and flexible to meet specific KPIs to serve specific
applications and use cases. They need to come with the system properties of
reliability, availability, maintainability, safety, and integrity. What
particular requirements each property needs to meet depends on the
particularities of the domain and the use case. The requirements in this
document provide various sets of performance criteria that need to be met to
satisfactorily support different use cases of cyber-physical control
applications used by various vertical markets.
# 5 Performance requirements
## 5.1 Overview
There are two fundamental perspectives concerning dependable communication in
5G systems: the end-to-end perspective of the communication services and the
network perspective (see Figure 5.1-1).
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.0in"}
Figure 5.1-1: Network perspective of 5G system
The Communication Service in Figure 5.1-1 may be implemented as a logical
communication link between a UE on one side and a network server on the other
side, or between a UE on one side and a UE on the other side.
In some cases, a local approach (e.g. network edge) is preferred for the
communication service on the network side in order to reduce the latency, to
increase communication service availability, or to keep sensitive data in a
non-public network on the factory site.
The tables in Clauses 5.2 through 5.5 below provide sets of requirements,
where periodicity and determinism are critical to meeting cyber-physical
control application needs in various vertical scenarios. While many use cases
have similar KPI values, the important distinction is that in order to meet
the needs of different verticals and different uses, the 5G system will need
to be sufficiently flexible to allow deployment configurations that can meet
the different sets of KPIs specific to each use.
Communication service availability is considered an important service
performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for
applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service
availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network
layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical
communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical
application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).
The communication service reliability requirements also depend on the
operation characteristics of the corresponding cyber-physical applications.
Typically, the communication services critical for the automation application
also come with stringent communication service reliability requirements. Note
that the communication service reliability requirement has no direct
relationship with the communication service availability requirement.
The \"# of UEs\" in the tables in clauses 5.2 to 5.5 is intended to give an
indication of the UE density that would need to be served within a given
service area (e.g. to understand the kind of capacity demand it puts on the 5G
system).
Clock synchronisation is needed in many \"vertical\" use cases. The
requirements and tables in Clause 5.6 provide specific criteria for managing
time sensitive communications in an industrial environment.
High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the Future.
The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well as mobile
assets is becoming increasingly important in improving processes and
increasing flexibility in industrial environments, Clause 5.7 provides
positioning requirements for horizontal accuracy, availability, heading,
latency and UE speed in an industrial use case scenario.
An example of the relationship between reliability (in the context of network
layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]), survival time, and
communication service availability of a logical communication link is
illustrated in the following Table 5.1-1.

22.261) and communication service availability when the survival time is equal

on timeliness and availability of the communication service. A transmission
occurs every transfer interval. A description of periodic deterministic
communication can be found in Clauses 4.3 and 4.4. Additional information on

## A.2.3 Process automation
### A.2.3.1 Closed-loop control
In the closed-loop control use case for process automation, several sensors
are installed in a plant and each sensor performs continuous measurements. The
measurement data are transported to a controller, which takes decision to set
actuators. The latency and determinism in this use case are crucial. This use
case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and service
availability. The required service area is usually bigger than for motion
control use cases. Interaction with the public network (e.g., service
continuity, roaming) is not required.
Table A.2.3.1-1: Service performance requirements for closed-loop control in
process automation
* * *
Use case # Characteristic parameter Influence quantity  
Communication service availability: target value in % Communication service
reliability: mean time between failures End-to-end latency: maximum Message
size [byte] Transfer interval: lower bound Transfer interval: target value
Transfer interval: upper bound Survival time UE speed # of UEs Service area
(note) 1 99,9999 to 99,999999 ≥ 1 year \ 5 Mbit/s | – | –  99,9 \~ 1 month \ stipulated maximum).
If the survival time (see Table C.2.3-1) is larger than zero, consecutive
impairments and/or delays are ignored until the respective time has expired.
For the mapping of communication service availability on network KPIs such as
packet error rate, it may be assumed that network equipment failures do not
happen or only with negligible probability. In this case, only the
unavailabilities caused by actual transmission errors (e.g. lost packets,
exceeded maximum end-to-end latency) will be considered for the design of
network KPIs of the 5G system.
_End-to-end latency_
This parameter indicates the time allotted to the communication system for
transmitting a message and the permitted timeliness.
_Communication service reliability_
Mean time between failures is one of the typical indicators for communication
service reliability. This parameter states the mean value of how long the
communication service is available before it becomes unavailable. For
instance, a mean time between failures of one month indicates that a
communication service runs error-free for one month on average before an
error/errors make the communication service unavailable. Usually, an
exponential distribution is assumed. This means, there will be several
failures where the time between two subsequent errors is below the mean value
(1 month in the example).
Communication service availability and communication service reliability (mean
time between failures) give an indication on the time between failures and the
length of the failures.
_Service bit rate_
_a) deterministic communication_
The target value indicates committed data rate in bit/s sought from the
communication service. This is the minimum data rate the communication system
guarantees to provide at any time, i.e. in this case target value = user
experienced data rate.
_b) non-deterministic communication_
The target value indicates the target data rate in bit/s. This is the
information rate the communication system aims at providing on average during
a given (moving) time window (unit: s). The user experienced data rate the
lower data rate threshold for any of the time windows.
_Update time_
Applicable only to periodic communication, the update time indicates the time
interval between any two consecutive messages delivered from the egress (of
the communication system) to the application.
**Traffic classes**
In practice, vertical communication networks serve applications exhibiting a
wide range of communication requirements. In order to facilitate efficient
modelling of the communication network during engineering, and for reducing
the complexity of network optimisation, disjoint QoS sets have been
identified. These sets are referred to as traffic classes [6]. Typically, only
three traffic classes are needed in industrial environments [6], i.e.
\- deterministic periodic communication;
\- deterministic aperiodic communication; and
\- non-deterministic communication.
Deterministic periodic communication stands for periodic communication with
stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.
Deterministic aperiodic communication stands for communication without a pre-
set sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of
communication is suitable are event-driven actions.
Non-deterministic communication subsumes all other types of traffic. Periodic
non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic are subsumed by the non-
deterministic traffic class, since periodicity is irrelevant in case the
communication is not time-critical.

**Parameter description**
_Burst_
The transmission of, for instance, program code and configuration data may be
handed to the 3GPP system as data burst. In this case, the ingress data rate
exceeds the capacity of the network, which implies that some of the data has
to be stored within the ingress node of the communication system before it can
be transmitted to the egress interface(s). However, the data of a burst needs
be transmitted completely. This is in contrast to periodic data transmission,
where new messages overwrite old ones.
Typical metrices for bursts:
\- aperiodic data transmission: maximum user data length and minimum transfer
interval;
\- non-deterministic transmission: message length and line rate of the service
interface.
_Survival time_
The maximum survival time indicates the time period the communication service
may not meet the application\'s requirement before the communication service
is deemed to be in an unavailable state.
NOTE 1: The survival time indicates to the communication service the time
available to recover from failure. This parameter is thus tightly related to
maintainability [7].
_Transfer interval_
Applicable only to periodic communication, the transfer interval indicates the
time elapsed between any two consecutive messages delivered by the automation
application to the ingress of the communication system.
_Message size_
The user data length indicates the (maximum) size of the user data packet
delivered from the application to the ingress of the communication system and
from the egress of the communication system to the application. For periodic
communication this parameter can be used for calculating the requested user-
experienced data rate. If this parameter is not provided, the default is the
maximum value supported by the PDU type (e.g. Ethernet PDU: maximum frame
length is 1522 octets, IP PDU: maximum packet length is 65 535 octets).
# C.3 Up time and up state vs. down state and down time
The assessment of periodic deterministic communication services is based on
the assessment of successful message transmission over a logical communication
link. Message transmission is either:
_\- successful, if it is correctly and timely received, or_
_\- unsuccessful, if it is incorrectly received, lost or untimely._
Up time and down time can be derived from received messages. As far as timely
received messages are correct, the logical communication link status is _up_.
If a message loss or an incorrectly or untimely received message is detected
the logical communication link status is _down_. To denote up and down states
the terms "up time interval" and "down time interval", or alternatively
"_available"_ and "_unavailable"_ may be used. An example of the relation
between logical communication link status, communication service status and
application status is presented in Figure C.3-1.
Figure C.3-1: Relation between logical communication link, communication
service and application statuses (example with lost messages)
The flow of events in Figure C.3-1 is as follows:
a) The logical communication link is up and running (blue line is UP). A
source device starts sending periodic messages to a target device (orange
arrows), on which an automation function (application) is running. The
communication service is, from the point of view of the target application, in
an up state (violet line is UP) and so is the application (green line is UP).
b) The logical communication link status changes to down state if it no longer
can support end-to-end transmission of the source device\'s messages to the
target device in agreement with the negotiated communication requirements.
Once the application on the target device senses the absence (or unsuccessful
reception) of expected messages (\"Deadline for expected message\" in Figure
C.3-1), it will wait a pre-set period before it considers the communication
service to be unavailable ; this is the so-called survival time. The survival
time can be expressed as
\- a period or,
\- especially with cyclic traffic, as maximum number of consecutive
incorrectly received or lost messages.
c) If the survival time has been exceeded, both the communication service and
the application transition into a down state (violet and green lines change to
DOWN in Figure C.3-1). The application will usually take corresponding actions
for handling such situations of unavailable communication services. For
instance, it will commence an emergency shutdown. Note that this does not
imply that the target application is \"shut off\"; rather it transitions into
a pre-defined state, e.g. a safe state. In the safe state, the target
application might still listen to incoming packets or may try to send messages
to the source application.
d) Once the logical communication link status is in the up state again (blue
line in Figure C.3-1 changes to UP), the communication service state as
perceived by the target application will change to the up state. The
communication service is thus again perceived as available (violet line
changes to UP in Figure C.3-1). The state of the application, however, depends
on the counter measures taken by the application. The application might stay
in down state if it is in a safe state due to an emergency shutdown. Or, the
application may do a recovery and change to up state again. The time needed
for the application to return to the up state after the communication service
is restored is shown as "Application recovery time" in Figure C.3-1.
The availability of the communication service is calculated using the
accumulated down time. For instance, in case the communication service is
expected to run for a time _T_ , the unavailability _U_ of the communication
service can be calculated as
{width="0.6805555555555556in" height="0.3541666666666667in"}
Where Δ _t~i~_ is the length of the _i_ -th downtime interval of the
communication service within the time period _T._ The communication service
availability _A_ can then be calculated as
_A =_ 1--_U._
# C.4 Timeliness as an attribute for timing accuracy
## C.4.1 Overview
There are several time parameters in dependability assessment. A required
value is specified for every time parameter. This value can be a maximum,
mean, modal, minimum etc. Typically, there is a deviation from the desired
value to the actual value. Jitter is often used to characterise this
variation. Since jitter generally is used for characterising the behaviour of
a measured parameter, for instance the scatter of measured end-to-end
latencies (\"the world as it is\"), it can be quite confusing to use it for
formulating service performance requirements (\"the world as we want it to
be\"). What is needed is a concept and related parameters that allow for
formulating and talking about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5
and Annex A.
The most important attribute is timeliness. Timeliness can be formulated a
permitted interval for the actual value of the time parameter. Accuracy,
earliness and lateness describe the allowed deviation from a target value.
Accuracy is the magnitude of deviation. It can be negative (early) or positive
(tardy).
## C.4.2 Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness
In 5G networks, the end-to-end latency KPI is a critical KPI in order to
ensure that the network can deliver the packet within a time limit specified
by an application: not too early and not too late.
In cyber-physical automation, the arrival time of a specific packet should be
strictly inside a prescribed time window. In other words, a strict time
boundary applies: [minimum end-to-end latency, maximum end-to-end latency].
Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although most use cases that require
timely delivery only specify the maximum end-to-end latency, the minimum
latency is also sometimes prescribed. In the latter case, a communication
error occurs if the packet is delivered earlier than the minimum end-to-end
latency. An example for a related application is putting labels at a specific
location on moving objects, and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a
trigger for this action. In other words, the application does not keep its own
time, but interprets the message arrival as clock signal. Maximum and minimum
end-to-end latency alone do not disclose which value is preferred, i.e. target
value. The next three subclauses introduce concepts help with relating maximum
end-to-end latency, minimum end-to-end latency, and target vale to each other.
## C.4.3 Timeliness
Timeliness is described by a time interval (see Figure C.4.3-1). The interval
is restricted by a lower bound (_t_ ~LB~) and an upper bound (_t_ ~UB~). This
interval contains all values _t_ ~A~ that are within an accepted \"distance\"
to the target value _t_ ~R~.
{width="5.29375in" height="2.7805555555555554in"}
Figure C.4.3-1: Timeliness function
A message reception is considered in time, if it is received within the
timeliness interval. If it is received outside the timeliness interval, the
message reception is considered invalid. This is related to the communication
error \"unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency\" (see Subclause
B.6). In other words, maximum end-to-end latency = _t_ ~UB~ and minimum end-
to-end latency = _t_ ~LB~.
Timeliness is related to deviation (see Subclause C.4.4), the lower bound _t_
~LB~ is related to earliness (see Subclause C.4.5), and the upper bound _t_
~UB~ is related to lateness (see Subclause C.4.6).
## C.4.4 Deviation
The term deviation describes the discrepancy between an actual value (_t_ ~A~)
and a target value (_t_ ~R~).
Deviation(_t_ ~A~) = _t_ ~A~ -- _t_ ~R~.
Figure C.4.4-1 shows two examples. The target value is 10 time units (_t_ ~R~
= 10) in both cases. In the first case (blue) the actual value measures 12
time units (_t_ ~A~ = 12). The difference of both amounts to +2 time units,
which means that the deviation is 2 time units [Accurracy(_t_ ~A~) = 2]. The
second case (purple) shows the actual value as 9 time units (_t_ ~A~ = 9). The
difference of both amounts to -1 time unit, which means that the deviation is
--1 time units [Accuracy(_t_ ~A~) = --1].
Figure C.4.4-1: Examples for accuracy values
Figure C.4.4-2 shows the deviation with respect to the target time (t). The
following applies:
Deviation(_t_) \ 0 for _t_ > _t_ ~R~; that is, the arrival is late (see also
C.4.6)
{width="3.573611111111111in" height="2.520138888888889in"}
Figure C.4.4-2: Accuracy function
## C.4.5 Earliness
Earliness describes how early the actual value is: earliness is greater than 0
if the actual value is less than the target value (see Figure C.4.5-1). The
following applies:
Eearliness(_t_ ~A~) = _t_ ~R~ -- _t_ ~A~ = --Deviation(_t_ ~A~) for _t_ ~A~ \ _t_ ~R~.
In an example, the target value is 10 time units (_t_ ~R~ = 10), and the
actual value measures 14 time units (_t_ ~A~ = 14). The difference of both is
4 time units with respect to being late. That means that the lateness is 4
time units [L(_t_ ~A~) = 4].
{width="2.5131944444444443in" height="1.675in"}
Figure C.4.6-1: Lateness function
## C.4.7 Conclusion
Using the concepts of earliness and lateness (see Subclauses C.4.5 and C.4.6,
respectively), the maximum and minimum end-to-end latency can be rewritten as
follows.
_Maximum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency + maximum lateness;_
_Minimum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency -- maximum earliness._
# C.5 Communication service terminology w.r.t. 5G network and vertical
applications
This section clarifies the wording and terminology with respect to
communication interfaces that are relevant for vertical applications. Because
the 3GPP network does not cover the complete ISO-OSI communication stack, it
is important to distinguish between
\- the vertical applications' point of view, and
\- the 3GPP network's point of view.
In this section, the relation between those two is clarified.
Figure C.5-1 shows a simplified version of the communication stack. The PHY
layer, the MAC layer and some parts of the IP layer are part of the 3GPP
network. The layers that are part of the 3GPP network are referred to as lower
communication layers (LCL). The communication stack also includes an
application. The OSI layers related to providing data to the application are
referred to as the higher communication layers (HCL). The interface between
LCL and HCL is referred to as communication service interface (CSIF).
For the assessment of the overall system performance, it is important to
differentiate between the 3GPP network's performance (i.e., including only the
LCL and measured at the CSIF) and the overall system performance including the
application layer (i.e., including both, the LCL and the HCL). In Figure
C.5-1, the orange arrow depicts the vertical application's point of view. The
blue arrows indicate two options to measure the 3GPP network's performance,
i.e., including and excluding the IP layer.
{width="6.747916666666667in" height="2.857638888888889in"}
Figure C.5-1: Network performance measurements at different communication
system interfaces (CSIF)
Figure C.5-2 illustrates how messages are transmitted from a source
application device (e.g., a programmable logic controller) to a target
application device (e.g. an industrial robot). The source application function
(AF) is executed in the source operating system (OS) and hands over a message
to the application layer interface of the source communication device. In the
higher communication layers (HCL), which are not part of the 3GPP system, the
data is processed. From the HCL the data is transferred to the lower
communication layers (LCL), which are part of the 3GPP system. After
transmission through the physical communication channel and the LCL of the
target communication device, the data is passed to the HCL and lastly to the
target application device. Characteristic parameters with respect to time are
defined in Figure C.5-2.
From 3GPP system point of view:
\- Transfer interval of 5G system: Time between the arrival of two pieces of
data at the source CSIF.
\- End-to-end latency: Time measured from the point when a piece of data
received at the CSIF in the source communication device until the same piece
of data is passed to the CSIF in the target communication device.
From vertical application point of view:
\- Transfer interval of vertical application: Time between the transmission of
two successive pieces of data from the source application.
\- Transmission time: Time measured from the point when a piece of data is
handed from the application layer interface of the source application device,
until the same piece of data is received at the application layer interface of
the target application device.
\- Update time: Time between the reception of two consecutive pieces of data
at the application layer interface to the target application device.
If not stated otherwise, the terms \"end-to-end latency\" and \"transfer
interval\" refer to the 3GPP system / 5G network parameters in this document.

###### ## Annex D (informative): 5G in industrial automation: different and
multiple time domains for synchronization
# D.1 Description
The required synchronization precision is usually given as the maximum
absolute value of the time difference between sync master and any device in
the synchronisation domain (time domain or clock domain). A common example is
a synchronisation precision of ≤ 1 µs. This is equivalent to ± the precision
value, so ±1 µs between sync master and any device in the synchronisation
domain, resulting in two times this value as maximum absolute time difference
between any two devices in the synchronisation domain (2 µs in the example).
An industrial automation network generally consists of two distinct time
domains.
First is the _global time domain_. This is the time used for overall
synchronization in the system (e.g. the factory). It is used to align
operations and events chronologically. Industrial automation uses the term
_universal time domain_ [20] for the global time domain described in this
document. Global time is known as a synonym for universal time in industrial
automation. Global time is called wall clock in certain areas and standards.
The synchronization precision is typically ≤ 1µs [20]. In some areas, a
precision of ≤ 100 µs might be sufficient for the global time domain if a
working clock with precision of ≤ 1 µs is available. The assigned timescale is
usually the International Atomic Time (TAI, _temps atomique international_),
based on the precision time protocol (PTP) epoch (starting from 1 January 1970
00:00:00 TAI) [22]. While there is usually only one global time, multiple
global time domains are possible.
Clock synchronization in the global time domain usually applies to all UEs
within the industrial facility in industrial automation. That is, a global
time domain covers usually the industrial facility.
Second is the _working clock domain_. Working clock domains are constrained in
size. They often consist of a single machine or a set of neighbouring machines
that physically collaborate. The restricted size allows very precise time
synchronization (≤1µs) with efficient network components. Synchronisation to a
working clock is used to align e.g. production lines, production cells, or
machines/functional units. In these cases, the application synchronizes
locally within the working clock domains (Figure D.1-1), allowing precise
synchronization with more efficient components. A global time domain usually
contains multiple working clock domains. The starting point (epoch) is the
start of the working clock domain.
{width="3.9819444444444443in" height="3.077777777777778in"}
Figure D.1-1: Global time domain and working clock domains
The assigned timescale of a working clock domain is arbitrary (timescale ARB
[22]). Therefore, different working clock domains may have different
timescales and different synchronisation accuracy and precision. Robots,
motion control applications, numeric control, and any kind of clocked /
isochronous application rely on the timescale of the working clock domain to
make sure that actions are precisely interwoven as needed.
Clock synchronization in the working clock domain is constraint in size. A
specific working clock domain will contain only a subset of the UEs within the
industrial facility. Often, the UEs of the working clock domain are connected
to the same gNB. However, it is also possible that a working clock domain
contains multiple neighbouring gNBs. This depends on the actual use case and
its vertical application.
Devices may be part of multiple time domains leading to overlapping working
clock domains.
The required precision (usually ≤ 1 µs) is between the sync master and any
sync slaves (device) of the clock domain, both, global time domain and working
clock domain.
Clock domains might be called sync domains in certain areas and standards.
# D.2 Merging of working clock domains
One key issue of the integration of TSN and 5G wireless networks that has to
be handled is mobility. The integration of 5G wireless communication into the
industrial communication infrastructure allows for mobility in the
manufacturing process. This mobility enhances flexibility in the manufacturing
process, e.g. through adding certain manufacturing capabilities on-demand by
having a machine move to the respective production line. This means that
machines that are synchronized to different working clock domains may need to
interact with each other.
The following scenario illustrates this. After the mobile machine has arrived
at the intended location and is stationary again, the two interacting working
clock domains have to be synchronized with each other. Otherwise interaction
might not be possible without interfering with ongoing operations. An example
is an autonomous mobile handling robot adding parts to an assembly line.
Without synchronization between both, correct placement of the parts would be
impossible.
However, it is not feasible to schedule these interactions beforehand.
Therefore, the interaction between different working clock domains requires a
concept for handling the communication. TSN provides already mechanisms for
this. The 5G systems and the UEs need to provide an interface in order to
exchange information of the clock domain.
{width="6.745833333333334in" height="2.7736111111111112in"}
Figure D.2-1: Working clock domain interactions \"Merge\" and \"Separate\"
When members of different working clock domains interact, there are two
possible options (Figure D.2-1). Which option is used depends on the
application and its requirements.
\- Merge: The working clock domains merge into one. This option can be used in
applications where synchronization is critical, e.g. high precision robots
interacting with each other.
\- Separate: The members of the different working clock domains interact while
keeping their own separate time synchronizations. This option can be used in
applications where synchronization is non-critical, e.g. an AGV collecting
finished products from a production line.
# D.3 Time synchronization with 5G networks
For the time synchronization with 5G networks, we consider two possible
options.
The 5G system uses the 802.1AS time sync domains: In this case, the 5G system
provides a media dependent interface to the 802.1AS sync domain [21], which
the application can use to synchronize to the sync domain. In the IEEE 802.1AS
standard [22], a similar concept is detailed in the MDSyncSend and
MDSyncReceive structures.
The 5G system provides the working clock domains and global time domain: In
this case, the 5G system has to provide an interface which the application can
use to derive their working clock domain or global time domain. A device can
belong to multiple working clock domains. An application can use each of these
as the reference clock for synchronization (reference clock model).
NOTE: The required precision (usually ≤ 1 µs) is between the sync master and
any sync slave (device) of the clock domain.
