# 4 Overview
Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) is one of key market segments of 5G. The
typical IoT device communication is sending and receiving small data which can
be delivered just in a message. Although an IoT application may implement its
own message enabler or data communication enabler, it will introduce problems
such as interoperability, signalling overhead etc. For the benefit of the IoT
ecosystem, it is expected that MNOs provide advanced message service for MIoT.
Today SMS is used as message enabler for some IoT applications. However SMS
has limitation in term of service capabilities (e.g. 140 bytes payload) and
performance (e.g. long latency), in addition, the overhead of control plane
resource is high. There have been enhancements and optimizations on the 3GPP
network capabilities to facilitate IoT applications including device
triggering, small data transfer, Non IP Data Delivery (NIDD), and group
messaging etc. Nevertheless, MIoT will bring various new demands on message
communication, e.g. light weight message communication for provision and
monitoring, ultra low delay and high reliability message communication for
remote control, and extremely high resource efficiency for large scale
connections.
5GMSG Service is to be developed for this new and huge market segment. It
enables an UE sending/receiving message of text, voice, video or data to/from
another UE or application server. While SMS is originally designed for person-
to-person communication, 5GMSG Service is basically designed for IoT device
communication, including thing-to-thing communication and person-to-thing
communication. The emerging IoT device communication will introduce new
requirements of messaging service in terms of service capabilities,
performance, charging, and security etc.
The 5GMSG Service enables various messaging communications models including:
\- MOMT: UE A sends a message to UE B
\- MOAT: UE A sends a message to Application Server
\- AOMT: Application Server sends a message to UE A
\- MOMT-G: UE A sends a message to a group of UEs
\- AOMT-G: Application Server sends a message to a group of UEs
\- AOMT-B: Application Server broadcast a message to all UEs ( in a specific
service area)
The UEs can be handset and IoT devices. The message communication between two
UEs can be with or without a 5GMSG Proxy/Gateway.
# 5 Use cases
## 5.1 Shared bike communication
### 5.1.1 Description
The shared bike service allows a rider to rent a bike via a mobile app and
drop it off anywhere for the next rider. This service offers the citizens a
cheap and convenient way for city trip, and getting more and more popular in
some cities. In shared bike services, there are message communications between
the riders and the bikes via the service platform for locating, reserving,
unlocking the bikes. In some hot spots, the density of station bikes is very
high, e.g. up to 1000 bikes within 500m * 3m area. The message communications
will consider the case where there is no handset/device to be operated by the
rider, or there is no coverage for the handset, but the device in the bike has
coverage.
The message communications for the bikes need to be light weight in order to
save power and data traffic. The network needs to be able to support high
density of UEs sending and receiving messages in real time.
### 5.1.2 Pre-conditions
The shared bike is equipped with smart lock and 5G message communication
module, and has a voice input device.
Case1: Tom's smart phone installs the shared bike Client which utilizes 5G
message service to communicate with the Server for renting a shared bike.
Case 2: Tom's smart phone has no client installed, or smart phone has no
power, or smart phone is not under coverage but the device in the shared bike
is under coverage.
### 5.1.3 Service Flows
Case 1:
1) Tom uses the Client to send a message to Server to request unlocking the
bike;
2) The Server sends a message to the bike to unlock the bike;
3) The bike is unlocked and sends a message to the Server to report the
result.
Case 2:
1) Tom verbally provides some indication to the shared bike through the voice
input device, for example, "I am Tom, I want to use this bike to go to the X
Street."
2) The shared bike records the voice, and transfer the voice message to the
server in the network.
3) The Server receives the voice message and through the voice analysis
recognizes that it is Tom and that he wants to use the shared bike, and the
server sends a message to the bike to unlock the bike. The server may also
send another voice message to the bike, for example, "the bike is unlocked",
"this bike is broken, please choose another one", etc.
4) The bike is unlocked and sends a message to the Server to report the
result. The bike may play the voice message received from the server.

support an object model.
## 5.2 Monitoring data reporting
### 5.2.1 Description
In environmental monitoring, the outdoor monitoring devices with sensors are
powered by batteries or small solar photovoltaic equipment. The devices send
messages to the server to report the monitoring data collected by the sensors
periodically (e.g. every one hour). There are no terminating messages for such
devices.
To minimize the resource usage, a monitoring device does not need to be always
online for 5GMSG service; instead it connects to the 5GMSG Service only when
it needs to send a message.
### 5.2.2 Pre-conditions
The monitoring devices are equipped with a 5GMSG communication model.
### 5.2.3 Service Flows
The device sends a message to the server to report the monitoring data

products, communications products. Usually their operations are very simple
and require only simple messages. For example, in the cold winter, Ryder wants
to open the air conditioner ahead of time, or turn off some dangerous
electrical equipment remotely when he forgot. These are some PTP operations.
But now it\'s hard to control multiple devices with one app.
### 5.3.2 Pre-conditions

terminal, like Mobile phone, watch, pad, which may be MIoT terminal or not.
\- Terminal receives instructions may under WLAN, blue tooth, or attach to
MIoT network.
\- Terminal A may attach to macro network as well as MIoT network.
\- The receiving terminal may also be in power saving.
\- A MSG proxy/Gateway, in the network provides access to different MIoT
terminal devices for different access. The MSG proxy/gateway also perform
protocol conversion so that the different terminals do not need to support the
same protocols.
\- The MSG proxy/Gateway can also provide additional value-added services,
e.g. device monitoring and trouble shooting.
### 5.3.3 Service Flows
The following figure shows the service flows for Unified remote control of
intelligent terminal.

network through any heterogeneous network (e.g. an industrial network). The
protocol used by terminal D may be ZigBee technology which is outside the 3GPP
scope.
\- Terminal B, C and D may access the 5G network by WLAN with HTTP and other
light weight technology. The MSG proxy/Gateway needs to convert different
popular device access technologies and protocols into unified MSG service on
the northbound side of the MSG proxy/Gateway. Then terminal B, C and D may
receive instructions from the terminal A forwarded from the 5G network MSG
proxy/Gateway.
\- B, C or D power on immediately after receiving instructions and begin to
work.

But the IMS protocol is huge and the process is complex. MIoT terminal vendors
are hard to embed IMS in lower cost terminal devices. Therefore, a relatively
simple mechanism is needed to control access and security of the terminals,
which may offer even faster, lighter, and easier. A mechanism which is
flexible and can integrate different messaging protocols used by different
types of devices on different accesses and enable communication between
devices and smart phones on the internet.

## 5.8 Personal Possession Tracking
### 5.8.1 Description
A user tags many his personal possessions (wallet, keys, bike, bike helmet,
rucksack) with IoT tags. The purpose of these IoT tags is to allow the user to
remotely ping the device and receive back the location of the object. In order
to extend the life of these tags, there is no continuous mobile originated
(MO) data uplink, only on request from the user. The key performance metrics
for IoT tags such as this are battery lifetime (order of \~10yrs), latency
(order of \~1 minute), size and weight (order of \~20cm^3^, 40g).
The tags remain in a dormant state for extended periods of time, consisting of
periods of power saving mode and discontinuous reception. In between the
dormant states, the tags check for incoming messages from the serving network.
When the tag receives an incoming message requesting a location upload, the
device calculates its location based on available sources (e.g. GPS, cell ID,
OTDOA, UTDOA, beacon systems) and sends this message to the user.
### 5.8.2 Pre-conditions
The user's wallet is tagged with an IoT device supporting the location request
function.
The user has a UE capable of sending an IoT message to the IoT device attached
to the user's wallet.
### 5.8.3 Service Flows
The user loses his wallet.
The user discovers that he has lost his wallet and uses his cell phone to find
the location of his wallet. He uses an app to send a message to the IoT tag.
The message is sent from the user's cell phone UE to the serving network and,
if required, is passed to the PLMN currently serving the IoT tag.
The PLMN serving the IoT tag attempts to deliver the message. If the IoT tag
acknowledges receipt of the message, the PLMN serving the IoT may return an
acknowledgement message to the user's cell phone (if requested). If the IoT
tag does not acknowledge the receipt of the message, or if deliver was not
attempted as the PLMN serving the IoT tag knew that the IoT tag was in power
saving mode, the PLMN serving the IoT tag retains the message and will attempt
to deliver it to the IoT tag at the earliest possibility.
Receiving the message at the IoT tag triggers the device to fully wake up and
establish a PDN connection to the serving PLMN. The IoT tag calculates its
position and transmits this data to the user's cell phone. Once the data has
been transmitted and acknowledged, the UE returns to low power consumption
states such as DRX and PSM.
### 5.8.4 Post-conditions
The user receives the location of the wallet and sets off to find it.
### 5.8.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None.
### 5.8.6 Potential Requirements
The 5GMSG Service shall support mobile originated -- mobile terminated
messaging.
The 5GMSG Service shall support triggering a device.

5.11 Optimization of Experience and Performance
5.11.1 Description
There are many types of IoT terminals, and a large number of them. Most of the
existing networks do not know what kinds of IoT devices are carrying, or the
states of device on the network.
5.11.2 Pre-conditions
  * The terminal A and terminal B of the IoT are controlled by the mobile terminal M.
  * Terminal A is a relatively static terminal connected network, like Sweeping robot.
  * Terminal B is a physical device of relative movement, such as a personal vehicle.
5.11.3 Service Flows
```{=html}
``` \- The terminal B is an IoT device, which is connected through eMBB
network slice. At this point, the mobile terminal M can control the car door
to open or close through eMBB network slice.
  * The terminal A is connected to the network through WiFi or NB-IoT. The mobile terminal M can control terminal A by WiFi network or NB-IoT network.
  * The terminal A's battery is exhausted. When the mobile terminal M initiates an instruction to the terminal A through the network. If the network saves the state of the De-registration from terminal A, it could feed back the correct reason to mobile terminal M.
  * The terminal B is accessed from the eMBB network slice.
  * The sleep time of terminal B is usually in the specific time period in the evening, and the terminal A is usually in the daytime. The periodic signaling of 5G message service, including login and security detection, can be simplified according to the sleep time of different terminals.
5.11.4 Post-conditions

None.
5.11.6 Potential Requirements

reason of failure.
5.12 Building Automation
5.12.1 Description
Building automation [9] refers to the management of equipment in buildings
such as heaters, coolers, and ventilators. Automation of such systems brings
several benefits, including the reduction of energy consumption, the
improvement of comfort level for people using the building, and the handling
of failure and emergency situations. Sensors installed in the building perform
measurements of the environment and report these measurements to Local
Controllers. Local Controllers (LC), in turn, report these results to a
Building Management System.
A Building Management System (BMS) may then execute different operations:
> \- Store the information into a database (e.g., for histogram purpose);
>
> \- Send an alarm to a (third-party) Building Management System;
>
> \- The Building Management System sends a command to an actuator (e.g.,
> command to increase room temperature, turn on a light).
The key performance metrics for the sensors that are typically battery powered
are battery lifetime (order of \~10yrs), latency to be reached from network
(order of \~5 seconds), size and weight (order of \~20cm3, 40g).
5.12.2 Pre-conditions
A building with a building automation system gets an indication from one
sensor that something is not correct e.g. too high temperature deviation.
5.12.3 Service Flows
The local controller gets a value form one of the temperature sensors of a
"too high value". The local controller then immediately initiate a process to
poll the other sensors nearby to get more information of this potential issue.
The local controller requests e.g. the fire detection sensors and temperature
sensors to report current values. The local controller can then decide upon
this additional information whether it is a false alarm or it is a fire and in
that case how far in the building it had spread.
5.12.4 Post-conditions
The local Controller can report to the management system if there is a fire or
not, or if there is an issue with one sensor.
5.12.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None.
5.12.6 Potential Requirements
The 5GMSG Service shall support Application Originated Mobile Terminated
messaging service with maximum latency of 5 seconds while maintaining the long
battery life +10 years for normal small data traffic once a day and typical
sized IOT battery [200-500mAh].
## 5.13 Health monitoring
### 5.13.1 Description
Health control sensors typically require long standby to avoid charging of
battery. Today sensors like heart rate, blood sugar and blood pressure sensors
exists but also more like fall detection etc. for elderly. All this types of
sensors do have a web application where you can monitor the different values.
Typically there are also built in alarms if values goes beyond defined typical
values. There is however no way to reach the sensors and get an instant value
if you suspect something is wrong without significantly impacting the battery
life.
The key performance metrics for the sensors that are typically battery powered
are battery lifetime (order of \~3 months), latency to be reached from network
(order of \~10seconds), size and weight (order of \~20cm^3^, 40g).
### 5.13.2 Pre-conditions
A blood sugar sensor is reporting the values once every hour to the
application server and network. During the time in-between measure reporting
the parent would like get an instant value.
### 5.13.3 Service Flows
The application server gets values as they are reported from the IOT sensor.
An authorized person would like to get an instant value from the sensor to
check that everything is all right.
### 5.13.4 Post-conditions
The IoT sensor reports the requested data with a low delay
### 5.13.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None.
### 5.13.6 Potential Requirements
The 5GMSG service shall support Application Originated Mobile Terminated
messaging service with max latency of 10 seconds while maintaining battery
life of 3 months for normal small data traffic once every hour and typical
sized IOT battery [200-500mAh].
# 6 Considerations
## 6.1 Considerations on charging
The business model of MIoT market may be different from that of consumer
market. The MNO may need flexible policy for charging of the 5GMSG Service,
e.g. flat rate, charge per message, charge by amount of data, and charge per
UE per month or per year. For different message communication models (MOMT,
MOAT, AOMT, MOMT-G, AOMT-G, AOMT-B), the charging policy may be distinguished.
The 5GMSG Service need to provide charging information to support different
charging policy.
## 6.2 Considerations on security
The 5GMSG Service enables messaging communication of thing-to-thing and
person-to-thing. This kind of messaging communication might trigger actions of
devices, for example remote control. Several security requirements need to be
taken into account in the 5GMSG Service. First, authorization is required for
message communication between two UEs, e.g. UE B is allowed to send messages
to UE A, while UE C is not allowed to send messages to UE A. Second, the
messages need to be integrity and confidentiality protected.

# 8 Gap analysis
## 8.1 Unified remote control of intelligent terminal
For 5G system in Rel-15, there is no existing technology to meet the
requirements of the use case: Unified remote control of intelligent terminal.
If MNOs want to be able to implement 5GMSG service with 5GMSG proxy/gateway,
then new technologies need to be introduced. Here are some possible potential
ways to describe 5GMSG proxy/gateway. These potential ways do not limit the
specific implementation of the next step.
As the 5GMSG proxy/gateway of 5G system, it has several possible capabilities,
which are based on different models.
1) 5GMSG Gateway Model ï¼š
The M2M system may be deployed by industry manufacturers. At this time, the
IoT Devices' identification and terminal information management and control of
terminal B, C, D described in the case of Supporting messaging with different
types of UEs may be implemented by the M2M system, but not include the
terminal A.
5GMSG Gateway needs to realize the control of the terminal B, C, D accessed
the M2M system by the terminal A.
As shown in the following diagram of terminal A (unified 5G control terminal),
for example, there is an table for lighting control, discomfort information
collection, washing machine, and air conditioning control.
Figure 8.1-1 5GMSG Gateway Model
At that time, the gateway of 5G needs to convert 5G messages and
intercommunicate with terminals using different protocols in the M2M network,
such as ZigBee and LWM2M/CoAP messaging, etc., as shown on the red circle in
3GPP scope. In case of adding more IoT terminals based on different
technologies, only the gateway is required to be upgraded. The implementation
of the gateway can refer to the standardized mechanisms done in other
organizations (e.g. oneM2M).
2) 5GMSG proxy Model
The M2M system may be deployed by MNOs. At this time, the IoT devices'
identification and terminal information management and control of terminal B,
C, D described in the case of Unified remote control of intelligent terminal
may be implemented by the 5G system.
5GMSG Proxy needs to realize the access of the terminal B, C, D accessed from
e.g. WLAN, by the terminal A.
The 5GMSG Proxy can also achieve the packet data acquisition and the control
of the IoT terminals of the terminal A.
The following is an example of an intelligent washing machine, which is in a
bathroom and supports smart washing services. Herein, the 5GMSG Proxy plays
the role of convey the control from terminal A, in case of the terminal A want
to change the brand of the terminal D through the 5GMSG Proxy, as shown on the
red circle in 3GPP scope.
Figure 8.1-2 5GMSG proxy Model
## 8.2 5G Message Size
One of the most commonly technology used by IoT is Bluetooth Technology. The
link layer of BLE packet has only one packet format used for both advertising
channel packet and data channel packets, with the following format:
\- Preamble: 1 octet,
\- Access Address: 4 octets,
\- PDU: 2 to 39 octets,
\- And CRC: 3 octets.
The date channel PDU has a 16 bit header, a variable size payload, and may
include a Message Integrity Check(MIC) field, like:
\- Header: 16 bits,
\- Payload: ,
\- And MIC: 32 bits
The length field of the Header indicates the length of the Payload and MIC if
included. The length field has the range of 0 to 31 octets. The Payload field
shall be less than or equal to 27 octets in length. The MIC is 4 octets in
length. Other details of packet size definition may refer to "2 AIR INTERFACE
PACKETS".
But for small devices, the implementation of TCP and HTTP protocol is
obviously an excessive requirement. In order to enable small devices to access
the network, the CoAP protocol is designed. CoAP is an application layer
protocol running on the UDP protocol instead of running on TCP like HTTP. The
CoAP protocol is very compact, and the smallest packet is only 4 bytes.
The common size of the IoT message packet ranges from tens of bytes to
hundreds of bytes. According to the different consumer behaviour of the
operator market, different packet sizes are set in different regions to meet
the optimization of network performance.
8.3 Message Encoding
While supporting message encoding, the network needs to refer to some message
model information. The IoT devices can be modelled according to the physical
functions of the devices, taking home cases as an example. For household
ClothesDryer, properties such as switch, running mode and running state can be
defined.
  * The switch properties of the ClothesDryer have only two settings: power on or off,
  * The ClothesDryer's running mode may include the setting of: Normal, QuickDry, PermanentPress, HeavyDuty, Delicates, AirDry and ExtendedTumble,
  * The ClothesDryer's running state may include the setting of: idle, preActive, active, reserved, stopped, error, diagnostic, test, maintenance, clear and charging.
For all brands of ClothesDryer, these properties are very similar. Besides,
the running state of most electronic devices includes the above parameters
alike. For house physical equipment properties, we can refer to the work of
related specifications, such as [2]. Meanwhile, there is more detailed models
definition for other device types of other scenarios.
8.4 Lightweight message communication
One of the general requirements of the 5GMSG Service for MIoT is that the
communication between devices or between persons and devices need to be
lightweight, in terms of power and data traffic consumption in the device and
resource usage in the network.
Non-IP data delivery(NIDD)[3] is part of the CIoT EPS optimizations for small
data of both mobile originated (MO) and mobile terminated (MT). With NIDD,
data packets are transmitted over control plane -- SRB (Signal Resource
Bearer), without requiring the establishment of DRB (Data Resource Bearer).
Due to the resource limitation of SRB, NIDD is appropriate for infrequent
transmission of small data.
Device Triggering (DT)[3] is the means to trigger an UE to perform application
specific actions. The payload in the trigger message provides information to
the application that may trigger application related actions. DT is for AOMT
communication that can be done in one message. It is not applicable to MOMT
communication.
OMA LWM2M [6] uses light and compact protocol (i.e. CoAP) as well as an
efficient resource data model for IoT device management, service enablement
and information reporting. LWM2M enables both AOMT and MOAT communication
between a server and a device, but does not support MOMT communication.
8.5 Broadcast and multicast message delivery
The 5GMSG Service for MIoT needs to support broadcast and multicast message
delivery in order to handle the massive communications efficiently without
long delay. The receivers of broadcast/multicast messages can be all UEs
within a cell or multiple cells.
Short Message Service -Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB) [5] is a messaging service that
allows messages to be broadcast to all UEs within a designated geographical
area of a cell or a set of cells. With SMS-CB, a message can be delivered to
millions of UEs in seconds. The size of a SMS-CB message can be up to 1395
characters, so it is well fit for a text or small data message, but not for a
multimedia message.
Group Message Delivery (GMD) [3] utilizes MBMS capability to efficiently
distribute the same content to the members of a group that are located in a
particular geographical area.
8.6 Group message communication
In group message communication, the members of a group can be persons and
things that are located in different geographical areas. All the members can
send messages to the group. Group management mechanism is required to support
the members joining or leaving a group.
SMS-CB and GMD use broadcast or multicast delivery which are fit for a large
group in a designated geographical area. However, they are not fit for a small
group whose members are located in different geographical areas. A more
flexible mechanism other than broadcast or multicast is preferred. The
messaging service in Rich Communication Services (RCS) [7] defined by GSMA
provides group chat feature that enables an UE sends a message (text, picture,
voice, video etc.) to a group whose members can be in any location. However,
RCS is on top of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) stack and IMS (IP
Multimedia Subsystem) , which is not lightweight enough for the IoT devices.
8.7 Summary
There are messaging capabilities defined by several SDOs, including SMS, NIDD,
DT and GMD by 3GPP, MMS and LWM2M by OMA, RCS by GSMA. Table 8-1 summarizes
the gaps between 5GMSG Service requirements and existing services
capabilities. None of these message capabilities can meet all the requirements
of the 5GMSG Services.

# 9 Conclusion and recommendations
The feasibility study on 5G message service for MIoT develops a number of use
cases and conducts the potential requirements based on the use cases. It
further analyzes the gaps between 5GMSG Service requirements and existing
services capabilities. For the benefit of the IoT ecosystem, a new MNOs
message service for MIoT - the 5GMSG Service needs to be developed.
It is recommended that the requirements identified in this Technical Report
are considered for the development of normative requirements. A new Technical
Specification is expected to address the service level requirements of the
5GMSG Service, and the new requirements on 5G System to support the 5GMSG
Service are to be input to TS 22.261.
