SHE service hosting environment
# 4 Overview
Mobile network operators are deciding to use LTE based system to support
streaming services. A content provider can use content caching technology in
the application in the UE to improve user experience by intelligent access
technology selection (e.g. application update or content pre-download
automatically in WLAN environment). At the same time, the network resources
are not fully utilized in certain cases (e.g. night time). The key factor to
enable "anywhere, anytime of streaming service" reachability is to optimize
network resource usage of streaming services in an efficient manner to promote
the consumption of content by the user. New technology e.g. local data center
will help to streaming transmission more efficiently.
This technical report is to study potential service requirements for
optimization of both Over-The-Top and operator managed streaming service
considering possible use cases e.g. caching, content-aware service delivery,
delay tolerate delivery, local streaming transmission etc. This study will
provide gap analysis and identify these potential requirements.

Bob subscribed the local streaming service supplied by Operator A.
### 5.4.3 Service Flows
Bob is going to the stadium to watch football match.
The system of operator A identifies Bob's UE is entering the stadium area.
The system of operator A notifies Bob that he can enjoy the football match
through his streaming service during the match.
When the match begins, the streaming are real-time uploaded to the local
streaming servers and the system of operator A can get the specific streaming
from the local streaming servers and deliver them to users in the stadium area
according to user's requests. The streaming delivery can be real time or non-
real time which is dependent on audience's request. The real time streaming
delivery means that once the user presses the request button in his smart
phone, the specific streaming can be received in real time.
The interactions among users in the stadium are also supported by the system
of operator A.
When Bob leaves the stadium, the system of operator A identifies and notifies
Bob that the football match streaming service will be stop.
### 5.4.4 Post-conditions

duration of streaming watched by kids.
This use case describes the authorization for streaming delivery.
### 5.6.2 Pre-conditions
Bob is an eight year old boy and he often watches the videos through his smart
phone.
Bob's farther subscribes the streaming service for kids that specifies
corresponding content classification of streaming service and duration of
watching video, for example Bob can only watch the video one hour and do not
watch the violent video.
Noteï¼šThe content classification may be specific countries and may depend on
local regulation.
### 5.6.3 Service Flows
Bob wants to watch video online through his smart phone.
In the connection set up phase, 3GPP system should check the subscription of
Bob. If the watched video fits the subscribed grade, then the 3GPP system set
up the connection for Bob. If the video don\'t fit the subscription, the 3GPP
system shall reject to set up the connection for Bob.
The 3GPP system shall disconnect the session for Bob after subscribed
duration.
### 5.6.4 Post-conditions

delivery based on subscription and on policy defined by the third party.
## 5.7 Application user profile support for streaming delivery
### 5.7.1 Description
Today, some application server supplies one kind of pay video service. Once
user buys the pay video e.g. 9.99 USD per month for video provider's server,
he has higher priority to see the most popular and most fresh videos from the
application server.
When user watches these videos through smart phone, the 3GPP system also need
to support the application layer user priority from end to end aspect although
this kind of user profile is defined from one application server not 3GPP
system.
### 5.7.2 Pre-conditions
Bob is one premium user of "OuyTube", a video sharing web site.
Bob and Tom subscribed with operator A.
"OuyTube" and Operator A have agreement to supply high quality video service
to "OuyTube" premium users.
### 5.7.3 Service Flows
Bob and Tom want to watch "OuyTube" video online through their smart phones.
In the connection set up phase, the application server of "OuyTube" notifies
3GPP system that Bob's is in premium class.
According to agreement between "OuyTube" and Operator A, the 3GPP system sets
up high priority radio connection for Bob. But for Tom, the 3GPP system set up
normal radio connection.
In some cases, the video application server may be hosted in local, with the
help of local service hosting environment, the 3GPP system also can be
notified the application user's priority.
### 5.7.4 Post-conditions
Bob can watch "OuyTube" video through his smart phone with high quality.
Tom can watch "OuyTube" video through his smart phone with normal quality.
### 5.7.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

system shall support the operator or the 3^rd^ party to configure which user
profile information belonging to the application server should be shared with
the 3GPP system.
## 5.8 Network assistant application optimization for streaming delivery
### 5.8.1 Description
For achieving better user experience for streaming service, local streaming
service has been deployed. Some popular streaming content in the local
streaming server is distributed from one same cloud video application server.
But when the streaming content in the local streaming server is continuously
delivered to the end user through 3GPP system, it has to face different radio
environment in different local area which will greatly impact the streaming
delivery quality.
So, it is suggested that different radio condition and local traffic context
should be considered in the local streaming server to adjust application layer
transmission to help to achieve better user experience. That means when the
local streaming server gets the radio environment information e.g. radio
condition, local traffic context, etc. it can decide whether the application
level video optimization function should be utilized to achieve better user
experience.
### 5.8.2 Pre-conditions
Bob and Tom subscribed streaming service with 4K quality in default from
operator A.
Operator A deploys multiple local service hosting environments (SHE) in
different area e.g. airport, CBD etc. And "News Today" which is one popular
video application runs in these SHEs.
### 5.8.3 Service Flows
Bob is in the airport waiting for board.
Bob wants to watch video "News today" on line through his smart phone.
According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system selects the airport local
server and routes Bob's smart phone to the airport local server to watch
video.
The airport local server requests the 3GPP system to share the airport radio
environment information and decides to utilize its most efficient video
compress function in application layer to help the 4K video successfully to be
delivered over airport radio environment.
At the same time, Tom is in CBD and also wants to watch video "News today" on
line through his smart phone.
According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system selects the CBD local server
and routes Tom's smart phone to the CBD local server to watch video.
The CBD local server requests the 3GPP system to share the information of CBD
radio environment and decides that the radio environment is good and there is
no need to invoke the most efficient video compress function.
### 5.8.4 Post-conditions
Bob receives the 4K format streaming in the airport.
Tom receives the 4K format streaming in the CBD.
### 5.8.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
Editor's Note: text to be provided or section to be voided.
### 5.8.6 [Potential] Requirements
According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall support the SHE which is
deployed in different local area (no matter belongs to operator or the 3^rd^
party) to configure which radio environment information can be shared to the
application layer which is hosted in the SHE.
According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall support the SHE which is
deployed in different local area (no matter belongs to operator or the 3^rd^
party) to get radio environment information based on the configuration.
# 6 Considerations
