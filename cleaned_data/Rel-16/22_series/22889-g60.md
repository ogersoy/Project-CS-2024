# Introduction
The railway community is considering a successor communication system to
GSM-R, as the forecasted obsolescence of the 2G-based GSM-R technology is
envisaged around 2030, with first FRMCS trial implementations expected to
start around 2020.
The Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) Functional Working
Group (FWG) of the International Union of Railways (UIC) have investigated and
summarised their requirements for the next generation railway communication
system in the Future Railway Mobile Communication User Requirements
Specification (FRMCS URS) [2]. **The present document is based on this input
given by the UIC/** ETSI TC-RT
# 1 Scope
**The present document** analyses FRMCS Use cases, system principles of FRMCS
and Interworking between GSM-R and FRMCS in order to derive potential
requirements.

# 4 Overview
The present document is an 800 series Technical Report (TR) written by 3GPP
TSG SA WG1 (SA1). Such a TR is not normative, i.e. cannot be used for
implementation directly and cannot be referred to by other 3GPP
specifications. It was primarily written by SA1 to summarise the high-level
communication needs of the railway community and to identify the corresponding
requirements, which, in another step have been introduced into normative
Technical Specifications (TS) of 3GPP.
An 800 series TR will not be updated when in the process of introduction of
the requirements to TS changes are made to those requirements, i.e. the text
of the requirements listed here in this TR will not be aligned with the
requirements in the TS. Due to the fact that most of the requirements
identified in this document were introduced in already existing Mission
Critical Communication (MCX) TS, an alignment with the MCX terminology and
functionality was made resulting in most of the requirements in here being
reworded in the TS. Also, TS requirements changes due to future work affecting
requirements stemming from this TR will not result in updates of this TR.
However, the columns "Comments" of the requirements tables listed below were
updated to indicate the disposition of the requirement in the TS and most of
the time summarising deviations and decisions taken when introducing those
requirement into normative TS. By following these references into the
normative TS the functionality provided by 3GPP for railway communication can
be derived by the reader.
FRMCS will adapt 3GPP transport to provide communication to railway users. It
eventually will resemble GSM-R and will additionally provide communication
capabilities beyond what GSM-R has been able to. It will provide higher data
rates, lower data latencies, multimedia communication, and improved
communication reliability. FRMCS considers end-to-end use cases and also
provides requirements that might or might not be in scope of 3GPP existing
specifications. To facilitate smooth migration from legacy communication
systems (e.g. GSM) to FRMCS, interworking requirements between legacy
communication systems and FRMCS are provided.
FRMCS Equipment shall connect to application domain through 3GPP radio access
or other access. It provides emergency group communication, low latency and
high reliable data and video service in high speed train environment. Amongst
others it has the following important features:
\- Prioritized emergency group communication, train control data and video
service
\- Seamless connectivity in high speed railway moving environments
\- Low latency and high reliable data and video service
\- Real time train monitoring and management for safe train operation
\- Reliable location tracking including in tunnel tracking
\- Legacy railway communication interworking to GSM-R system

Figure 4-1: High-level relation of FRMCS and legacy systems
Basically, railway communication services [5] can be categorized into
\- Train control services
\- Maintenance services
\- Railway specific services (such as Railway Emergency Call, functional
addressing, and location-based addressing)
\- Other services (providing train crews or train Drivers with information of
train operation and interworking with the existing railway communication
systems)
This study categorizes all the use cases by considering inherent
characteristics of railway applications. Specifically, the following
categories of use cases are considered.
\- Basic functionality
\- Critical communication applications
\- Performance communication applications
\- Business communication applications
\- Critical support applications
\- Performance support applications
\- Business support applications
\- FRMCS System principles
The categories can be depicted conceptually as follows:

# 6 Critical communication applications related use cases
## 6.1 Introduction
Critical communications applications are essential for train movements,
safety, shunting, presence, trackside maintenance, legal aspects such as
emergency communications, etc.
## 6.2 Multi-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s)
### 6.2.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to the function of Multi-train voice
communication from the Drivers and/or a Ground FRMCS User towards the Driver
and/or Ground FRMCS Users are defined. Ground FRMCS Users may include
Controllers. The following use cases are defined:
  * Initiation of Multi-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
  * Termination of Multi-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
  * Interworking GSM-R and FRMCS for Multi-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
### 6.2.2 Use case: Initiation of Multi-train voice communication for Drivers
and Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
#### 6.2.2.1 Description
A Driver and/or a Ground FRMCS User shall be able to initiate a voice
communication to other Drivers and/or Ground FRMCS Users.
#### 6.2.2.2 Pre-conditions
The Driver and the Ground FRMCS User are authorised to initiate the
communication. This is managed by the authorisation of communication
application.
The authorisation application authorises the Driver and the Ground FRMCS User
to use the Multi-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS
User(s)
#### 6.2.2.3 Service flows
The Driver and/or Ground FRMCS User initiates the voice communication to the
(other) Driver(s) and/or Ground FRMCS Users. The priority of the communication
is managed by the prioritisation application.
The FRMCS System determines the Driver(s) and the Ground FRMCS User(s) to be
included in the communication, based on:
  * location information of all users provided by the locations services application, and/or
  * functional identity of all users provided by the Role management and presence application.
The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication within a setup time
specified as NORMAL (see 12.10). The information from the Role management and
presence application is used to present the identities for both Driver(s) and
Controller(s). The initiating Driver is indicated to the Controller(s). Also
the location of the Driver(s) in the voice communication is presented to the
Controller(s) which is retrieved from the location services application.
If the Driver and/or Ground FRMCS User is connected to more than one Drivers
and/or Controllers, the multi user talker control application is used.
The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Driver and the
Controller is managed by the prioritisation application.
The voice communication is recorded by the Voice recording and access
application.
#### 6.2.2.4 Post-conditions
The Driver and/or the Controller is connected to requested Driver(s) and/or
Controller(s).

### 6.2.4 Use case: Service Interworking and service continuation between
GSM-R and FRMCS for Multi-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground
FRMCS User(s) communication
#### 6.2.4.1 Description
For migration purposes the service interworking and service continuation
between the GSM-R system and FRMCS System for Multi-train voice communication
for Drivers including Ground FRMCS User(s) communication needs to be defined.
Interworking between FRMCS and GSM-R shall not require any changes in the
GSM-R system.
Depending on the migration scenario a Ground FRMCS User or a Driver can be
attached to the FRMCS system, to the GSM-R system or both. The Driver can be
attached either in the GSM-R system or in the FRMCS System. Functional
identities are applicable in one system only.
This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS and GSM-R
systems.
#### 6.2.4.2 Pre-conditions
None.
#### 6.2.4.3 Service flows
**Driver attached to GSM-R**
When the Driver is attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating voice
communication to other Drivers and Ground FRMCS User, the GSM-R system will
route the voice communication to other Drivers the Ground FRMCS User (s)
accordingly.
If the Driver or the Ground FRMCS User is located in the FRMCS System, the
GSM-R system can only route the call if it can be reached by an address or
identity understood by the GSM-R system. The Role management in FRMCS provides
the appropriate address or identity e.g. by providing a mapping of GSM-R
identities and FRMCS identities.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
route the communication and to present the identities of both Driver and
Ground FRMCS User.
**Driver attached to FRMCS**
When the Driver is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating voice
communication to other Drivers and Ground FRMCS User, the FRMCS System will
route the communication to the Ground FRMCS User accordingly. The information
from the Role management and presence application is used to route the
communication and to present the identities of both Driver and Ground FRMCS
User. The Role management in FRMCS shall provide the appropriate address or
identity e.g. by provide a mapping of GSM-R identities and FRMCS identities.
**Driver moving from GSM-R to FRMCS**
When the GSM-R user equipment of the Driver is detached from the GSM-R system
the FRMCS end user device shall provide service continuation by setting up the
communication via the FRMCS System. An interruption of voice communication is
acceptable.
Note: This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS and
GSM-R systems, i.e. contains a FRMCS UE and a GSM-R UE. It is assumed the
FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment will have some control of the GSM-R
part of the UE.
**Driver moving from FRMCS to GSM-R**

## 6.3 On-train outgoing voice communication from the Driver towards the
Controller(s) of the train
### 6.3.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to the function of On-train outgoing
voice communication from the Driver towards the Controller(s) of the train are
defined. This use case allows the Driver to only communicate with Controllers.
The following use cases are defined:
  * Initiation of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication
  * Termination of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication
  * Interworking GSM-R and FRMCS of Driver to Controller(s) communication
### 6.3.2 Use case: Initiation of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication
#### 6.3.2.1 Description
The Driver shall be able to initiate a voice communication to the
Controller(s) that was, is, or will be responsible for the movement of the
train.
#### 6.3.2.2 Pre-conditions
The Driver is authorised to initiate the voice communication to the
Controller. This is managed by the authorisation of voice communication
application.
The Driver is authorised to use the On-train outgoing voice communication from
the Driver towards the Controller(s) of the train application by the
application authorisation of application.
#### 6.3.2.3 Service flows
**Driver to responsible Controller(s)**
The Driver initiates the voice communication to the Controller. The priority
of the communication is managed by the prioritisation application.
The FRMCS System determines the responsible Controller(s), based on:
  * location information of the train provided by the locations services application, and/or
  * functional identity provided by the Role management and presence application.
  * system configuration on which Controller is responsible for which part of the track/station/etc.
The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication to the Controller(s)
within a setup time specified as NORMAL (see 12.10). The information from the
Role management and presence application is used to present the identities for
both Driver and Controller. Also, the location of the Driver is presented to
the Controller which is retrieved from the location services application.
If the Driver is connected to more than one Controller, the multi user talker
control application is used.
The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Controller is
managed by the prioritisation application.
The voice communication is recorded by the voice recording and access
application.
**Driver to another Controller(s)**
The Driver initiates the voice communication to the Controller who was or will
be responsible for the movement of the train. The addressing is performed by
selecting an entry from a list or entered manually. The priority of the
communication is managed by the prioritisation application.
The FRMCS System presents the list of Controllers to the Driver, based on:
  * location information provided by the locations services application, and/or
  * functional identity provided by the Role management and presence application.
  * system configuration on which Controller is responsible for which part of the track/station/etc.
The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication to the Controller(s)
within a setup time specified as NORMAL (see 12.10). The information from the
Role management and presence application is used to present the identities for
both Driver and Controller. Also, the location of the Driver is presented to

The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Controller is
managed by the prioritisation application.
The voice communication is recorded by the Voice recording and access
application.
#### 6.3.2.4 Post-conditions
The Driver is connected to the requested Controller.

When the Driver is attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating voice
communication to Controller(s), the GSM-R system will route the voice
communication to the Controller(s) accordingly.
If the Controller is located in the FRMCS System, the GSM-R system can only
route the call to the Controller if the Controller can be reached by an
address or identity understood by the GSM-R system. The Role management in
FRMCS provides the appropriate address or identity e.g. by providing a mapping
of GSM-R identities and FRMCS identities.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
route the communication and to present the identities of both Driver and
Controller.

**Driver moving from GSM-R to FRMCS**
When the GSM-R user equipment of the Driver is detached from the GSM-R system
the FRMCS end user device shall provide service continuation by setting up the
communication via the FRMCS System. An interruption of voice communication is
acceptable.
Note: This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS and
GSM-R systems, i.e. contains a FRMCS UE and a GSM-R UE. It is assumed the
FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment will have some control of the GSM-R
part of the UE.

## 6.4 Railway emergency communication
### 6.4.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to Railway emergency communication are
defined. The following use cases are defined:
\- Initiation of the Railway emergency alert
\- New entry to the Railway emergency alert
\- Changing of the Railway emergency alert
\- Leaving of the Railway emergency alert
\- Termination of the Railway emergency alert;
\- Initiation of railway emergency voice communication
\- Termination of railway emergency voice communication
\- Initiation of Data communication during Railway emergency Alert
\- Service interworking and service continuation with GSM-R
\- Interface to train borne recorder
### 6.4.2 General overview
Railway emergency communication serves two main purposes in railway operation
\- Alert Drivers or other railway staff about an emergency. Receiving such
alert will result in immediate actions to be taken by the recipients. These
actions are defined by operational rules, e.g. a Driver will slow down train
speed to 40km/h, drive on sight, etc.
\- Based on operational rules, additional information about the emergency can
be exchanged using voice and/or data communication.
While the alert needs to be setup very fast, the information part that may
follow is less time critical and not always required. The Railway emergency
Communication consists of:
  1. A mandatory alert phase indicating the emergency;
  2. An optional voice and/or data communication phase depending on operational situation and / or operational rules.
> Alert is the general term used that encompasses the different phases
> initiation, continuation and termination. This receives priority handling
> which is linked to the application category within the FRMCS System (see
> 12.10).
When a railway emergency alert is triggered by a FRMCS User, the FRMCS System
determines which other FRMCS Users shall receive an alert, depending on
following conditions:
\- Location, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity, direction
of movement, speed of the initiating entity
\- Location, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity, direction
of movement, speed of the FRMCS Users which are concerned of the emergency
\- Any additional information provided by the initiating entity
By applying alert conditions, only FRMCS Users who are concerned by this
emergency will receive an alert. Figure 6.4.2-1 outlines this principle.
{width="6.988194444444445in" height="4.790972222222222in"}
Figure 6.4.2-1 Illustration of FRMCS Users in an railway emergency alert area
Independently of any ongoing interactions between the FRMCS User and the FRMCS
Equipment, the railway emergency alert has to be continuously indicated to the
FRMCS User until the railway emergency is over (alert is terminated).
While an alert is active, the FRMCS System shall continuously check:
\- If additional FRMCS Users do match to the conditions of the railway
emergency alert. FRMCS User entering the emergency area/location/etc. will
receive the alert.
\- If an FRMCS User does not fulfil the conditions to be alerted anymore,
because the FRMCS User has moved away from the emergency area, the alert will
be withdrawn from this FRMCS User.
A Controller is able to change the conditions to select the applicable FRMCS
Users while an alert is active.
While an alert is active on a FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS User is still able to
establish and / or receive other types of communication. If a railway
emergency voice communication is established by the FRMCS User of an ongoing
alert, any other ongoing voice communications are terminated.
### 6.4.3 Use case: Initiation of the railway emergency alert
#### 6.4.3.1 Description
An FRMCS- user is able to initiate a railway emergency alert. Based on a set
of conditions the FRMCS System will determine which FRMCS Users that shall be
informed about the emergency.(see 6.4.2 General overview) The targeted FRMCS
User can be e.g. a mobile FRMCS User, a Driver, an External System, a
Controller, maintenance staff or a member of a shunting team.
#### 6.4.3.2 Pre-conditions
The initiating FRMCS User is authorised to establish a railway emergency
alert.
#### 6.4.3.3 Service flows
In any service flow, a mobile FRMCS User, e.g. a Driver, a maintenance staff
or a member of a shunting team, is not able to leave or terminate the railway
emergency alert.
**Controller initiated**
The Controller provides the conditions (e.g. train number/area/track
section/station) to the FRMCS System selecting the appropriate recipients of
the railway emergency alert. The conditions (e.g. train number/area/track
section/station) can be pre-configured for comfortable selection by the
Controller. The Controller may need to confirm the selection.
The FRMCS System will determine, based on the conditions, which FRMCS Users
are to receive the railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS Users within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which is presented to the FRMCS User.
The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority which matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In case a FRMCS User is already involved in another railway emergency alert,
FRMCS System does not forward new alerts to this particular FRMCS User. The
waiting alert is send as soon as the FRMCS User is no longer involved in the
other railway emergency alert.
The Controller is informed about the alerted FRMCS Users.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
**External system initiated**
FRMCS System receives the conditions from the External System (e.g. a
list/train number/area/track section/station) to address/determine the
appropriate recipients of the railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS System will determine, based on the conditions, which users will
receive the railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS Users within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are presented to the FRMCS Users.
The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority which matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In the case that a mobile FRMCS User is already active in another railway
emergency alert, the FRMCS System does not forward new alerts to this
particular FRMCS User. A waiting alert is send as soon as the FRMCS User is no
longer involved in an ongoing railway emergency alert. The Controller is
informed about the alerted FRMCS Users and the alert initiating External
System.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
**Mobile FRMCS User initiated**
A FRMCS User, like a Driver, maintenance staff or a member of a shunting team,
presses the railway emergency button.
The FRMCS Equipment requests the alert communication to the FRMCS System.
The FRMCS System determines the FRMCS Users to be included in the railway
emergency alert. This is based on the location information of the initiator
and certain conditions (e.g. functional identity, track area, accuracy of the
location, maximum track speed, station, shunting yard,
location/speed/direction of users).
The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS- users within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are forwarded to the concerned
FRMCS Users.
The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority that matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In the case that a mobile FRMCS User is already active in another railway
emergency alert, the FRMCS System does not forward new alerts to this
particular FRMCS User. A waiting alert is sent as soon as the FRMCS User is no
longer involved in an ongoing railway emergency alert. The applicable
Controller(s) is informed about the alerted FRMCS Users, including which user
initiated the alert.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
#### 6.4.3.4 Post-conditions
The applicable FRMCS Users are alerted.

### 6.4.5 Use case: Changing of the railway emergency alert
#### 6.4.5.1 Description
The Controller or an External System is able to change the conditions
selecting the appropriate recipients of the railway emergency alert. The
change may result in an expansion or a reduction of FRMCS Users that shall be
informed about the emergency.
#### 6.4.5.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS User (Controller) is authorised to initiate the railway emergency
alert. This is managed by the application authorisation of application.
There is an ongoing railway emergency alert.
#### 6.4.5.3 Service flows
The Controller or an External System shall be able to change the conditional
criteria selecting the appropriate recipients of the railway emergency alert.
The change of the conditions could imply the merge of multiple ongoing railway
emergency alerts.
The FRMCS System shall continuously check if users still meet the conditions
of the railway emergency alert. The user can be e.g. a mobile FRMCS User, a
Driver, maintenance staff, a member of a shunting team or a Controller.
The FRMCS System shall forward the railway emergency alert to all additional
users within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert
notification can include additional information (e.g. text, voice prompts)
which are forwarded to the FRMCS -user.
The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority that matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In case of an ongoing railway emergency voice communication, the additional
FRMCS Users are added.
In case FRMCS User is already active in another railway emergency alert, the
new alert is not forwarded by the FRMCS System to this particular FRMCS User.
If the FRMCS User is no longer involved in an ongoing railway emergency alert,
the waiting alert is forwarded by the FRMCS System.
The FRMCS System shall update the FRMCS Users for whom the railway emergency
alert is no longer applicable and terminates the alert. The termination
notification of the alert can include additional information (e.g. text, voice
prompts) which are forwarded to the FRMCS User.
The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority that matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In case railway emergency alert conditions does not match any longer to a
FRMCS User and if there is an ongoing railway emergency voice communication,
the FRMCS User will remain in the ongoing railway emergency voice
communication.
FRMCS System informs the Controller about the FRMCS Users who have left and
have joined the railway emergency alert.
A mobile FRMCS User, e.g. a Driver, maintenance staff or a member of a
shunting team, is not able to leave or terminate the Railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.

### 6.4.10 Use case: Initiation of Data communication during railway emergency
alert
#### 6.4.10.1 Description
Based on operational rules, additional information about the emergency can be
exchanged using data communication. A system or a user is able to send the
additional information (e.g. text, voice prompts).
#### 6.4.10.2 Pre-conditions
The railway emergency alert is active.
#### 6.4.10.3 Service flows
A FRMCS User, Controller or an External System is able to send additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts).
All the FRMCS Users shall receive the additional information.
The FRMCS System establishes the data communication within a setup time
specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The information from the Role management
and presence application is used to present the identities to the users
involved in communication.
The location of the initiator of the data communication is presented to a
mobile FRMCS User, Controller or to an External System. The location
information is retrieved from the location services application.
The handling of the incoming data communication is managed by the
prioritisation application. The alert has the priority which matches the
application category of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
It shall be possible to receive data communication during railway emergency
voice communication.
In the case of an ongoing Data communication during railway emergency alert,
the additional user is added to the ongoing Data communication during railway
emergency alert.
The communication is recorded by the FRMCS System Data recording and access to
recorded data application.
#### 6.4.10.4 Post-conditions
Data communication is initiated.
#### 6.4.10.5 Potential requirements and gap analysis
Independently on any actions between the user and the end user device, the

### 6.4.11 Use case: Service interworking and service continuation with GSM-R
#### 6.4.11.1 Description
For migration purposes, the service interworking and service continuation
between the GSM-R system and FRMCS System for railway emergency alerts and
railway emergency voice communication needs to be defined.
Service interworking between FRMCS and GSM-R shall not require any changes in
the GSM-R system specifications.
Depending on the migration scenario, a Controller can be attached to the FRMCS
System, to the GSM-R system or both. The mobile FRMCS User can be attached
either to the GSM-R system or to the FRMCS System.
The service continuation use cases only apply where a FRMCS Equipment and a
GSM-R UE are linked together.
#### 6.4.11.2 Pre-conditions
None.
#### 6.4.11.3 Service flows
**Mobile FRMCS User attached to GSM-R**
When the mobile FRMCS User is attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating a
Railway Emergency Call, the GSM-R system, (in parallel to processing the
railway emergency call internally according to GSM-R definitions), routes the
Railway Emergency Call to the FRMCS System, which requires the FRMCS System to
be reachable by identities that are understood by the GSM-R system. The FRMCS
System will determine, based on configuration, if a railway emergency alert
needs to be established. If a railway emergency alert is established a railway
emergency voice communication is initiated automatically.
The Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and the railway emergency voice
communication in the FRMCS System are linked together and controlled by the
FRMCS System.
Service interworking between the talker control in the GSM-R system and the
FRMCS System is required, but without changing the GSM-R system.
When the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system is terminated, the railway
emergency alert and the railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS
System is terminated too.
When the railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System is
terminated and there is a Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system linked
together, Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and railway emergency
alert / the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System are
terminated too.
When the railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is terminated and there
is a railway emergency Call in the GSM-R system connected, both the Railway
Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and Railway emergency voice communication
in the FRMCS System are not terminated.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
forward the identities between the systems. The identity of the initiator of
the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system is made available to the FRMCS
System.
**Mobile FRMCS User attached to FRMCS**
When the FRMCS User is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating a
railway emergency alert, and the railway emergency alert is also relevant for
the GSM-R system based on configuration, the railway emergency voice
communication becomes initiated in the FRMCS System and as railway emergency
Call in the GSM-R system.
The railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System and Railway
Emergency Call in the GSM-R system are linked and controlled by the FRMCS
System.
Service interworking between the talker control in the FRMCS System and the
GSM-R system is required, but without changing the GSM-R system.
When the railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System is
terminated and there is a railway emergency Call in the GSM-R system linked,
railway emergency Call in the GSM-R system and Railway emergency alert / the
Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System are also terminated.
When the railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is terminated and there
is a linked Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system, both the Railway
Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and railway emergency voice communication
in the FRMCS System remain active.
When the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system is terminated, the railway
emergency alert and the railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS
System is terminated.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
forward the identities between FRMCS System and GSM-R system. The identity of
the initiator of the railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is made
available to the GSM-R system to be used accordingly.
**Mobile FRMCS User moving from GSM-R to FRMCS**
When the GSM-R system becomes unavailable e.g. lack of coverage, the FRMCS
Equipment should provide service continuation by setting up the communication
via the FRMCS System. An interruption of voice communication is acceptable. It
is up to the end user device implementation how this service continuation is
as seamless as possible presented to the user.
**Mobile FRMCS User moving from FRMCS to GSM-R**
When the FRMCS radio access becomes unavailable, the FRMCS Equipment shall
able to provide service continuation by setting up the communication via the
GSM-R system. An interruption of voice communication is acceptable. It is up
to the end user device implementation how this service continuation is as
seamless as possible presented to the user.
Note: Both scenarios described above only apply when a FRMCS Equipment and a
GSM-R UE are linked together. It is further assumed the FRMCS Application on
the FRMCS Equipment to have some control of the GSM-R UE.

## 6.5 Use case: Automatic Train Control (ATC) support by the FRMCS System
### 6.5.1 Description
For Automatic Train Control (ATC) the train transmits its information (such as
current location, current speed, etc.) to a radio block centre (RBC). As soon
as a connection has been established between a train, a radio block centre and
a train centre, the train sends its position and speed information
periodically. The RBC uses the received information to decide movement
authority of the train.

## 6.6 Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication related use cases
### 6.6.1 Introduction
Generally, trackside maintenance occur during daily train operation. For
safety reasons trackside maintenance staff need to be informed about
approaching trains entering the area of maintenance. Thus, the intention of a
trackside warning system is to inform trackside staff about the approaching
train.
Trackside warning system consists of several specific sensors and warning
entities. The sensors are responsible to detect the approaching train and
warning entities indicate trackside workers about the approaching train. A
warning entity provides this indication in form of visual signal e.g. flashing
light and an audio signal e.g. tone. In addition, the local maintenance staff
will receive the train approaching indication on its FRMCS Equipment. When the
train has left the track section, the warning system withdraws the indication.
Sensors and warning entities constitute the warning system that requires
continuous communication between the sensors and the warning entities. In
addition, it encompasses the communication among the warning system and the
FRMCS Equipment of the local maintenance staff.
Due to the fact that such a warning system deployment is temporary and not
always fixed network communication facilities are available at the track,
FRMCS System provides necessary mobile communication services for the
trackside warning system.
Hence this chapter describes the use cases related to Trackside Maintenance
Warning System communication. The following use cases are identified:
  * Initiation of a Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication
  * Termination of a Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication
### 6.6.2 Use case: Initiation of a trackside maintenance warning system
communication
#### 6.6.2.1 Description
The FRMCS User (sensors of the warning system entity) shall be able to
initiate data communication to the FRMCS Equipment of trackside maintenance
staff and/or trackside warning indication entities (FRMCS User) in the
applicable area/track.
When a train approaches that FRMCS User (FRMCS Equipment of the trackside
maintenance staff) and/or the warning indication entities of the warning
system get notified.
#### 6.6.2.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS Users as part of the warning system and the FRMCS Users as part of
the maintenance crew are authorised to initiate the trackside maintenance
warning system communication.
#### 6.6.2.3 Service flows
The FRMCS Users (trackside maintenance warning system) and FRMCS User
(trackside workers in the applicable area) initiate the trackside maintenance
warning system communication to the receiving side.
A secure data communication application is used for the trackside maintenance
warming system communication. The communication requests the QoS class which
matches the application category of CRITICAL DATA (see QoS section 12.10)
within the FRMCS System.
The arbitration is managed by the arbitration application.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording application.
#### 6.6.2.4 Post-conditions
The FRMCS Users are part of the (warning system) communication are able to
exchange data.

## 6.7 Pushed Real Time Video streaming
### 6.7.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to real time video streaming are
described, the following use cases are identified
  * Initiation of a real time video streaming
  * Termination of a real time video streaming
### 6.7.2 Description
The video image quality depends on the application needs, e.g. lip reading,
pattern detection.
Video based supervision for rail operational purposes requires also the
support of Real time video capabilities from the FRMCS System. Multiple
recipients are able to use the real time video for different purposes.
The FRMCS Users in this case are applications both onboard of the train and on
the ground, for example FRMCS Users in a train control center.
For real time video streaming, both video and audio information are combined.
### 6.7.3 Use case: Initiation of a real time video streaming
#### 6.7.3.1 Description
Video is streamed between FRMCS Users or FRMCS Equipment.
#### 6.7.3.2 Pre-conditions
The streaming FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment has registered to a functional
identity that is authorised to initiate a real time video stream.
Note: Successful registration of a functional identity authorised to stream
video implies the FRMCS Equipment is able to support streaming video (e.g.
camera available)
The receiving FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment has registered to a functional
identity that is authorised to receive a real time video stream.
Note: Successful registration of a functional identity authorised to receive
streaming video implies the FRMCS Equipment is able to support streaming video
(e.g. monitor or recording device available)
#### 6.7.3.3 Service flows
The initiating FRMCS User requests a real time video streaming to another
FRMCS User.
The video streaming requests the QoS class which matches to the application
category of VIDEO or CRITICAL VIDEO within the FRMCS System, depending on the
application needs.
The video quality requested to the FRMCS System by the FRMCS User is checked
by the FRMCS Application.
If the requested quality can be reached, the FRMCS System establishes the real
time video data communication with a setup time specified as NORMAL (see
12.12).
If the requested quality cannot be reached, the FRMCS Application or the FRMCS
User can decide to stop the request or to continue the setup of video
streaming with a lower video quality, depending on the application needs.
During the real time video streaming the FRMCS Application constantly monitors
the quality. If the delivered quality of the real time video data
communication changes, the FRMCS Application or the FRMCS User is informed
about the change. The FRMCS Application or the FRMCS User may decide to change
the quality of the real time video streaming, depending on the applications
needs.
If authorized, the real time video communication is recorded by the data
recording and access to recorded data application.
The arbitration is managed by the arbitration application.
#### 6.7.3.4 Post-conditions
Depending on the QoS offered, the FRMCS Application or a FRMCS User decide if
video streaming is set up.

## 6.8 Public emergency call related use cases
### 6.8.1 Introduction
FRMCS Users have to indicate events that endanger public safety or emergency
that requires the public safety involvement. For this reason, the FRMCS System
is able to route the emergency call based on the current position of the

## 6.18 Train Integrity monitoring data communication
### 6.18.1 Introduction
Train integrity encompasses the continuous verification of the train
completeness, i.e. trains integrity status, for the time of mission. The
safety system on-board the train and/or at the ground will apply the foreseen
safety reaction when the train integrity status becomes undefined or is
unknown.
Due to its safety relevance, train integrity information exchange requires a
very high reliable communication as well as very low packet data latency.
### 6.18.2 Use case: Data communication for train integrity information
exchange
#### 6.18.2.1 Description
The FRMCS System will be used to exchange such train integrity information.
Every train regardless the type of composition requires this kind of data
communication in a fully automated train operation scenario.
The FRMCS Users in this case are the train integrity entities on-board of the
train and the ground system. There several options to determine train
integrity:
  1. Train integrity information will be only determined by the applicable entities at the train. For this approach train integrity entities are located at the front and the end of the train as well as on demand partially between the front and the end. The front entity supplies the train's integrity status to the safety entity on-board the train responsible for Control Command Signalling. This scenario requires Off-network communication bearer services for multi-user communication.
  2. Train integrity information will be determined by the applicable entities at the train and the ground. Train integrity entities are distributed equally over the total length of a train.

## 6.21 Automatic Train Control data communication
### 6.21.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related Automatic Train Control (ATC) data
communication are described, the following use cases are identified:
  * Initiation of an Automatic Train Control data communication
  * Termination of an Automatic Train Control data communication
  * Service interworking with GSM-R
### 6.21.2 Description
Automatic Train Control (ATC) is the application which performs some or all
the functions that ensures the safe movement of a train. ATC supervises the
train ensuring that speed and movement limits are kept and the train proceeds
only when it is allowed to do so.
Some ATC systems require radio communication to interchange safety relevant
data between a train and the corresponding control center.
The FRMCS Users in this case are the Automatic Train Control applications both
on-board of the train and in the control center at the trackside (ground
system).
Depending on the implementations, ATC systems require communication between
on-board applications of different trains using On-network communication mode.
ATC is considered to be user-to-user communication. Due to safety relevance of
Automatic Train Control (ATC), data communication requires a non-delay
tolerant bearer service.
### 6.21.3 Use case: Initiation of an Automatic Train Control data
communication
#### 6.21.3.1 Description
The FRMCS Application is able to initiate data communication for communication
having continuous characteristics between the on-board applications and ground
system and/or the on-board applications of other trains.6.21.3.2 Pre-
conditions
The FRMCS User at the train and at the FRMCS User at ground are authorised to
initiate the Automatic Train Control data communication.
The receiving application is authorised to use the Automatic Train Control
data communication.
#### 6.21.3.3 Service flows
The FRMCS User (i.e. on-board of the train or the control center at the track
side) initiates the Automatic Train Control data communication (i.e. control
center at the trackside or on-board the train).
For the operation of ATC, a non-delay tolerant bearer service is required that
corresponds to application category CRITICAL DATA/VERY CRITICAL DATA according
to QoS definition in chapter 12.10.
The FRMCS system takes into account the appropriate access criterion to
establish the data bearer service within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE
(see QoS).
The arbitration among ATC and other applications applies. The communication is
recorded by the data recording application.
#### 6.21.3.4 Post-conditions
ATC related data can be exchanged between the Automatic Train Control
communication entities.

## 9.3 Functional identities and role management
### 9.3.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to functional identities and role
management are defined:
\- Registration to a functional identity
\- Deregistration of a functional identity
\- FRMCS User changing functional identity
\- User log-in to the system
\- User log-out from the system
\- Presentation of identities
\- Interrogation of identities within a certain context
Examples of Role management, like functional identities, FRMCS Equipment
Identities, etc. in the railway environment are covered by annex A.
### 9.3.2 General pre-conditions
In order to fully understand the uses cases in this chapter, Figure 9.3.2-1
illustrates the different steps required to complete the registration process.
Figure 9.3.2-1: Example of Role management
In this definition, it is needed to make a distinction between different types
of FRMCS Equipment. The following are, as a principle, defined:
a) FRMCS Equipment without MMI, without the possibility to be addressed via a
functional identity related to the equipment (e.g. sensor in the track or
simple modem operation)
b) FRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity related to
the equipment (e.g. maintenance log collecting device connected to a power
station) but without other FRMCS User login
c) FRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity and that
allows a FRMCS User to login and register to functional identities related to
the user (e.g. cab radio)
d) FRMCS Equipment that cannot register to a functional identity, but that
allows a FRMS User to login and to register to functional identities related
to the user (e.g. a generic handheld device)
Steps:
  1. [UE-Power on]{.underline}: The UE has started up and is attached to the FRMCS network on telecoms level. The UE is reachable via its subscriber identity address.
  2. [Start FRMCS Application]{.underline}: On the UE the FRMCS Application start up and is ready for use.
  3. [FRMCS Equipment login]{.underline}: The FRMCS Application is logging in into the FRMCS System and the FRMCS Equipment becomes known to the FRMCS System.
  4. [Initialise]{.underline} FRMCS Equipment [type]{.underline}: the type of FRMCS Equipment used is identified.
At this stage of the user flow four different routes can be followed, based on
the determined FRMCS Equipment type of the FRMCS Equipment.
Type a) "sensor":
  * No action required. The FRMCS Equipment is now reachable via its subscriber identity address.
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Type b) "Announcement System":
  * [Register to a functional]{.underline} identity: the FRMCS Equipment will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional number is related to the equipment and identifies the device, like a PA system on a train.
  * [Functional identity added]{.underline}: the request for a functional identity is granted by the FRMCS System. The end user device is now reachable via its functional identity.
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Type c) "cab radio":
  * Register to a functional identity: the FRMCS Equipment will request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity is related to the FRMCS Equipment and identifies the environment where the equipment is used, like a cab radio in a cabin of a train.
  * Functional identity added: The FRMCS User is now only reachable via all of its functional identities related to the FRMCS Equipment.
Type d) "Handheld":
Next, for both the types c) and d) the following steps apply:
  * User login dialog: the user is presented with a log-in MMI action. The user can now login into the FRMCS System. By successfully logging into the FRMCS System the user becomes a FRMCS User.
  * FRMCS User: The FRMCS User is now reachable via its FRMCS User Identity (and in case c) the functional identity registered by the FRMCS Equipment).
  * Register to a functional identity: the FRMCS User may request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity relates to the FRMCS User and identifies the role of the FRMCS User e.g. driver, controller etc. and the environment e.g. train number.
  * Functional identity added: The FRMCS User is now reachable via all the functional identities registered to the user (Further, the FRMCS Equipment is reachable via its registered functional identity(ies).
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Note: Use cases related to power up the UE until complete initialisation of
the equipment type are covered in chapter 5.

### 9.3.3 Use case: Registration to a functional identity
#### 9.3.3.1 Description
A FRMCS User or the FRMCS Equipment shall be able to register to one or
multiple functional identities. A functional identity can therefore be
equipment related or user related.
#### 9.3.3.2 Pre-conditions
The equipment type is identified.
Functional registration of the user, the user is logged in into the FRMCS
System.
#### 9.3.3.3 Service flows
**Requested functional identity is not in use**
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment selects the functional identity. The
identity can be selected from a list based on the location of the FRMCS User,
operational schedules, etc. or the functional identity can be entered
manually.
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment requests the FRMCS System to register
the new functional identity.
The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment about the
outcome of the registration request.
**Requested functional identity that is in use**
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment selects the functional identity. The
identity can be selected from a list based on the location of the FRMCS User,
operational schedules, etc. or the functional identity can be entered
manually.
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment requests the FRMCS System to register
the new functional identity.
The FRMCS User is or the FRMCS-equipment informed of the functional identity
already in use.
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment shall be able to select from the
following options:
  * Cancel the registration
  * If the selected functional identity allows take over the functional identity.
  * If the selected functional identity allows register as an additional FRMCS User to this functional identity.
The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User about the outcome of the registration
request.
In the case of taking over a functional identity, the FRMCS System deregisters
the other FRMCS User or FRMCS-equipment from this particular functional
identity. The deregistered FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment gets informed
about the deregistration by the FRMCS System.
**Registration by the Railway Subsystem of the FRMCS System**
Based on the user identification, operational conditions, like schedules when
entering the train, location, time, recent activity etc., the Railway
Subsystem shall be able automatically register a FRMCS User or an FRMCS
Equipment to a functional identity.
The FRMCS User gets informed about the registration by the FRMCS System.
#### 9.3.3.4 Post-conditions
In case of successful registration, the FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment can
be reached based on the functional identity. The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-
equipment can be registered to different functional identities. The FRMCS User
or the FRMCS-equipment are also reachable by using the FRMCS Equipment
Identity, the FRMCS User Identity (if logged in) and its subscriber identity.
In case of successful registration and based on system configuration, the
FRMCS System shall be able to notify a specific group of FRMCS User(s)
registered to functional identity(ies) with similarities in the structure of
the successfully registered functional identity.
If the FRMCS System has not accepted the registration, the FRMCS User or the
FRMCS-equipment cannot be reached on a particular functional identity.

### 9.3.4 Use case: Deregistration of a functional identity
#### 9.3.4.1 Description
A FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment shall be able to deregister from one or
multiple functional identities.
#### 9.3.4.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment has at least one functional identity.
#### 9.3.4.3 Service flows
**Deregistration functional identity initiated by the FRMCS User**
The FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment chooses the functional identities to be
deregistered among the list of currently registered functional identities by:
  * electing a set of functional identities (the application may select the appropriate set of functional identities automatically)
  * selecting one functional identity
The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment about the
outcome of the registration request.
**Deregistration by the Railway Subsystem**
Based on certain criteria the FRMCS System deregisters a FRMCS User or the
FRMCS-equipment from one or multiple functional identities and informs the
FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment about the deregistration.
For example, possible criteria are timer, location, operational schedules,
another FRMCS User taking over the functional identity.
#### 9.3.4.4 Post-conditions
If the FRMCS System has deregistered the functional identity, the previously
registered FRMCS User (s) or FRMCS-equipment are not any longer reachable on
this particular functional identity.
If the FRMCS System has deregistered the functional identity and based on
system configuration, the FRMCS System shall be able to notify a specific
group of FRMCS User(s) registered to functional identity(ies) with
similarities in the structure of the successfully deregistered functional
identity.
If the FRMCS System was unable to deregister the functional identity, the
actually registered FRMCS User or FRMCS-equipment remains active and can be
reached on this functional identity.
In addition, the FRMCS User is reachable using the FRMCS Equipment Identity,
its user identity (if logged in) and its subscriber identity.

9.3.9 Use case: Service interworking with GSM-R
9.3.9.1 Description
Service interworking with legacy communication systems is of importance for
the time period both systems have to coexist. In this section service
interworking between the GSM-R System and the FRMCS System for functional
identities and its associated roles will be addressed.
**Functional Address**
On top of the E.164 numbering plan alternative addressing scheme called
functional addressing is used in the context with GSM-R. Functional addressing
scheme allows the establishment of communication without knowing each E.164
number associated with a particular train. A functional address consists of:
> IC+CT+UN
IC International code is used to route calls to the appropriate GSM-R network
CT Call Type prefix defines how to interpret the User Number (UN) as train
function number, engine function number, group calls etc.
UN User Number is of variable length and depends on the information i.e. train
function number etc. Within the UN a Functional Code (FC) is associated and
provides the information of the person or equipment on a particular train, or
a particular team within a given area. Therefore, the UN consists of User
Identification Number (UIN) i.e. train number etc. and the Functional Code
(FC) resulting into: UN= UIN+FC
A functional address only consists of numeric characters.
9.3.9.2 Pre-conditions
Following user addressing scenarios applies between FRMCS System and GSM-R
system when using alternative addressing schemes in FRMCS:
A GSM-R user is able to obtain communication services from the GSM-R system.
E.164 numbering plan and functional addressing scheme applies.
A FRMCS User is able to obtain communication services from the FRMCS System or
from the GSM-R system. If the FRMCS User, in this sense the FRMCS Equipment is
registered to the FRMCS System, user addressing of the FRMCS system applies
comprising the use of functional identity addressing scheme. If the FRMCS
Equipment is registered to the GSM-R system, E.164 numbering plan and
functional addressing i.e. IC+CT+UIN+FC scheme applies.
For a train route which encompasses both GSM-R and FRMCS coverage areas the
functional identity registration for users and equipment travelling this route
shall be made in two parallel entries in the respective GSM-R functional
addressing and FRMCS Functional Aliasing databases.
Any subsequent modification of functional addressing or functional aliasing
while the user or equipment is registered shall be done in parallel on both
systems
The deregistration of the functional aliasing or functional addressing for the
user or equipment with parallel registration shall be deregistered in
parallel.
9.3.9.3 Service flows
**FRMCS** U**ser relocates from GSM-R system to the FRMCS System**
When the FRMCS Equipment relocates from GSM-R system to the FRMCS System, the
applicable functional address(es) associated with the FRMCS User require(s) a
conversion to the functional identity format applicable within the FRMCS
System. The functional address remains active until the corresponding
functional identity becomes deactivated.
**FRMCS** **User relocates from FRMCS System to the GSM-R system**
When the FRMCS Equipment relocates from RMCS System to the GSM-R system, the
applicable functional identity or identities associated with FRMCS user
require(s) a conversion to the functional address format applicable within the
GSM-R system. The functional identity or identities remains active until the
corresponding functional address becomes deactivated.
**Bilateral communication addressing between FRMCS System and GSM-R**
A FRMCS User establishes a communication using the functional identity of
another FRMCS User whose FRMCS Equipment is registered to GSM-R.
A FRMCS User establishes a communication using the functional address of a
GSM-R user whose GSM-R equipment is registered to GSM-R.
A GSM-R user establishes a communication using the functional identity of a
FRMCS User.
9.3.9.4 Post-conditions
After successful relocation following is applicable:
  * From GSM-R point of view, the FRMCS User is reachable for communication by its functional address.
  * From FRMCS System point of view, the FRMCS User is reachable for > communication by its functional identity.

## 9.4 Location services related use cases
### 9.4.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to location services are defined. The
following use cases are defined:
  * Provide location information
  * Request for location information
  * Request for identities based on location
### 9.4.2 Use Case: Provide location information
#### 9.4.2.1 Description
The FRMCS Equipment provides its location information to the FRMCS System for
further processing e.g. for automatic train operation. External systems can be
supported in providing additional location information with or without
functional identity reference to the FRMCS System for further processing.
The location information may be shared directly with other applications on the
same FRMCS Equipment without the involvement of the FRMCS System.
#### 9.4.2.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS Equipment supports some mechanisms to obtain its location.
#### 9.4.2.3 Service flows
The FRMCS Equipment determines its current location in a periodic or an event-
triggered manner. The frequency of the location reporting may change according
to the application requirements.
The FRMCS Equipment reports location information that may include its
applicable FRMCS Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request, the FRMCS
Equipment shall be able to report its location information.
External systems can provide additional information to the FRMCS System in
order to improve location accuracy of an FRMCS Equipment.
The received location information is stored by FRMCS System.
In case of periodic location reporting, the FRMCS System supervises the
continuous supply of the location information. If the supply of periodic
location information by the FRMCS Equipment stops, the FRMCS System initiates
the re-establishment of the periodic location information data flow. The FRMCS
System can correlate other identities from the FRMCS Equipment Identity.
#### 9.4.2.4 Post-conditions
The location information of the FRMCS Equipment is available in the FRMCS
System.

## 9.7 Multi user talker control related use cases
### 9.7.1 General Description and potential requirements
#### 9.7.1.1 General Description
In this chapter the use cases related to multi user talker control for voice
communication are defined. The following use cases are defined:
  * Set the number of simultaneous talkers
  * Set initial talker permissions and priorities
  * Request permission to talk
  * Grant permission to talk
  * Revoke permission to talk
Note: For examples of Role management, like functional identities, FRMCS

Comments [R-9.7.1-001] Multi user talker control shall be available for both
on-net and off-net communication. A 22.179 Covered for On-net only
* * *
### 9.7.2 Use case: Set the number of simultaneous talkers
#### 9.7.2.1 Description
For multi user communication, i.e. when several users are involved in the same
communication, the number of users that are granted the right to talk at the
same time can be limited to either one, a limited number or unrestricted
number.
The communication application (e.g. shunting team communication) will set the
number of simultaneous talkers and/or the identities of involved FRMCS Users
and if required other application specific criteria.
#### 9.7.2.2 Pre-conditions
An active communication application capable to use the multi user talker
control.
#### 9.7.2.3 Service flows
The communication application sends the number of simultaneous talker(s)
information to the multi user talker control.
This information is used by multi user talker control when setting up the
communication.
If there is a need to change the number of simultaneous talkers, it is the
communication application which sends this information to the multi user
talker control.
The multi user talker control then uses this updated information for
controlling the number of simultaneous talkers in the communication.
#### 9.7.2.4 Post-conditions
The multi user talker control is aware about the number of simultaneous FRMCS
Users and uses this information during communication.

### 9.7.3 Use case: Set initial talker permissions and priorities
#### 9.7.3.1 Description
There are different requirements for talker permissions and to prioritise
talkers in different communication applications.
The FRMCS Users are identified by their functional identities.
The communication application defines the talker permissions and priorities
based on the functional identities and the type of communication application,
e.g. railway emergency call, shunting, multi train.
One or multiple FRMCS Users can be granted with the permission to perform as
talker in a certain communication. These FRMCS Users are able to request
permission to talk during communication.
Certain FRMCS User (s) that have requested the permission to talk at the same
time or while another user is talking can be granted with an initial talker
permission i.e. they will be given the permission first before requests of
others are served independent of whether they were the first requesting the
permission to talk or not.
Different FRMCS Users can be granted with a different talker priority. In case
of parallel requests for permission to talk, the permission is granted to the
FRMCS User (s) with highest talker priority. The requests with identical
talker priorities will be queued based on the time of request.
#### 9.7.3.2 Pre-conditions
An active communication application capable to use the multi user talker
control.
#### 9.7.3.3 Service flows
The communication application sends information about talker permissions and
talker priorities to the multi user talker control application.
This information is used in multi user talker control when setting up the
communication.
If there is a need to change the information about talker permissions and
talker priorities, it is the communication application that sends this
information to multi user talker control.
The multi user control then uses this updated information for controlling the
talker permissions and talker priorities in the communication.
#### 9.7.3.4 Post-conditions
The multi user control is aware of the talker permissions and talker
priorities and uses this information for communication control/setup.

### 9.7.4 Use case: Request permission to talk
#### 9.7.4.1 Description
There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to mitigate
the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for example:
  * Emergency communication
  * Shunting communication
  * Trackside worker communication
The system shall therefore be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers
in a voice communication.
An entitled FRMCS User shall be able to select and de-select FRMCS User (s)
being able to talk in a voice communication.
The FRMCS User shall be able to request the permission to talk (raise the
hand).
#### 9.7.4.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS User is involved in an active voice communication. The number of
simultaneous talkers is limited in this communication.
#### 9.7.4.3 Service flows
The FRMCS User requests permission to talk on the MMI of the communication
application (e.g. by pressing a Push-to-talk button)
The communication application sends the request to the multi user talker
control in the FRMCS System.
The communication application indicates on the MMI that talker permission has
been requested.
#### 9.7.4.4 Post-conditions
Permission to talk has been requested and a response from the multi user
talker control in the FRMCS System expected.

### 9.7.5 Use case: Grant permission to talk
#### 9.7.5.1 Description
There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to mitigate
the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for example:
  * Emergency communication
  * Shunting communication
  * Trackside worker communication
The system shall be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers in a
voice communication.
The list of FRMCS Users with permission to talk and those who have requested
it, shall be available to the Multi User Talker Control application.
#### 9.7.5.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS User is an active voice communication.
Multi User Talker Control is configured by the communication application to
limit the number of simultaneous talkers.
By default, the Multi User Control uses a set of criteria, like priorities,
identities, etc. to manage the requests automatically
In addition, an entitled FRMCS User (i.e. based on functional identity) who is
monitoring the progress of the communication can select and de-select
simultaneous talkers.
#### 9.7.5.3 Service flows
**Automatic management of requests**
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS System receives a request to talk
from a FRMCS User.
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS System verifies the number of FRMCS
Users who already have permission to talk.
If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk does not exceed the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control grants
automatically the permission to the requester.
If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk exceeds the maximum
number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control decides based on
certain criteria, like priorities, functional identity, etc. who will keep the
right to speak and who will be granted the permission to talk the Multi User
Talker Control configures the system accordingly.
If the number of talker permissions are reduced and the reduction results in
having more active talkers than permitted, the active talkers lose their
permission to talk as soon as they stop talking (i.e. release PTT) until the
new maximum allowed number of talkers is met.
The Multi User Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS Users
whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.
**Management of requests by an entitled FRMCS User**
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS System receives a request to talk
from a FRMCS User.
The Multi User Talker Control service in the FRMCS System verifies the number
of FRMCS Users who already have permission to talk.
If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk does not exceed the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control service
grants automatically the permission to the requester.
If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk exceeds the maximum
number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control service alerts
the entitled FRMCS User that is monitoring the communication, who is presented
with the list of simultaneous talkers and the list of pending requests and
decides who will keep the right to speak and who will be granted the
permission to talk by selecting and de-selecting the corresponding FRMCS User.
The Multi User Talker Control service configures the system accordingly.
The Multi User Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS Users
whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.
#### 9.7.5.4 Post-conditions

## 9.8 Authorisation of communication
### 9.8.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to authorisation of communication are
described, the following use cases are identified:
  * Permit / deny communication
### 9.8.2 Use case: Permit / deny communication
#### 9.8.2.1 Description
The purpose of the authorisation function it to allow the network operator to
control and regulate communications in order to avoid disruption/distraction
to the users (for example Drivers during voice communication) and preventing
unauthorised communication and to minimise network load.
The system may therefore restrict communication based on a configurable access
matrix related to the FRMCS subscriber identity, the FRMCS Functional Identity
of the equipment, the FRMCS User Identity, the FRMCS Functional Identity of
the FRMCS Users considering the source and destination address.
#### 9.8.2.2 Pre-conditions
The user attempts to establish a communication.
#### 9.8.2.3 Service flows
Upon an attempt to establish a communication, the system checks if the source
FRMCS User address is allowed to invite the destination FRMCS User address.
FRMCS System shall consider for the verification process the source and
destination FRMCS User address.
If multiple identities are simultaneously active to a FRMCS User, the
following order shall be applied to determine the authorisation of the
communication establishment:
  * Functional identities related to the FRMCS User
  * FRMCS User Identity
  * FRMCS functional identities related to the equipment
  * FRMCS subscriber identity
If the FRMCS User is allowed to establish the communication, the FRMCS System
proceeds the communication setup.
If the FRMCS User is not allowed establish the communication, the FRMCS System
shall reject the attempt including the reason of the rejection.
#### 9.8.2.4 Post-conditions
Either the communication has been established or the FRMCS User has been
informed about the denial of the call attempt.

the FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS System enables the FRMCS Application(s) on the
FRMCS Equipment according to the Role related to the FRMCS subscriber
identity.
**Change of registration status**
Upon a change in registration status by registration / deregistration to /
from a functional identity, change of a functional identity, user login
/logout to / from the FRMCS System, the FRMCS System enables / disables
applications.
If multiple identities are active, the following order is used to determine
the correct state:
  * FRMCS functional identities related to the FRMCS User
  * FRMCS User identity
  * FRMCS functional Identities related to the FRMCS Equipment
  * FRMCS subscriber identity
If a FRMCS User has registered to multiple functional identities, the FRMCS
User is authorised to use all applicable FRMCS Applications related to the
different FRMCS functional identities.

### 9.9.1 Use case: Robust mission critical group communication services
#### 9.9.1.1 Description
For reliable railway services, conventional way is to use dualization
methodology. Most of railway services are based on on-network communication,
which is supported by base station and core networks under 3GPP standard.
However, when disaster happens so that the communication infrastructure is not
feasible, railway service based on the communication infrastructure cannot be
maintained any more. From 3GPP Rel. 12, device-to-device communications has
been considered to be supported not only in the transport layer but also in
the application layer. In addition, interworking of FRMCS System with legacy
systems including GSM-R and TRS is expected to be supported in Rel. 15. As a
consequence, off-network and legacy systems will become feasible for group
communication services in 3GPP technology. Therefore, by considering not only
off-network but also legacy systems, reliability of mission critical group
communication service in the on-network can be enhanced. Figure 9.9-1 depicts
a required transformation of group communication service mode.
#### 9.9.1.2 Pre-conditions
FRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train operations
staff support device to device communications in the perspective of transport
layer.
FRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train operations
staff support on-network, off-network group communication services in the
perspective of applications layer.

Figure 9.9.1.3-1. Transformation of group communication service mode
#### 9.9.1.3 Service Flows
1\. After initial disaster happens, emergency message (including voice or
data) delivery service based on on-network group communication among train
driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff have been preceded
without any problem.
2\. Disaster becomes worse, and associated communication infrastructure is
destroyed and is not usable anymore.
3\. Transformation of on-network group communication service into off-network
or legacy network based group communication service is accomplished among
group members for maintaining the group communication services even in the
worse disaster.
#### 9.9.1.4 Post-conditions
Off-network or legacy network based group communication among train driver,
customer service staff, or train operations staff is activated and group
communication service is maintained normally.

## 9.10 Sharing FRMCS Equipment by FRMCS Users
### 9.10.1 Description
Commonly, FRMCS Users may share FRMCS Equipment, e.g. a trainborne UE. To use
the shared equipment securely, it is needed to identify the user for the
equipment.
### 9.10.2 Pre-conditions
A train driver is in a train.
The train driver has an identification card.
### 9.10.3 Service Flows
The train driver wants to use a trainborne UE to make communication to train
control centre.
The train driver puts his/her identification card in the trainborne UE to
identify himself/herself. In this case, the identification card is an example.
It can be a type of ID number, finger-print, etc. instead.
The trainborne UE reads the identification information from the card and
requests authentication to FRMCS security server.
FRMCS security server confirms the information and replies the authentication
information to the trainborne UE.
FRMCS registers the train driver as the user of the trainborne UE to relay a
call for the train driver to the trainborne UE.
The trainborne UE indicates readiness to use for the train driver.
### 9.10.4 Post-conditions
The train driver makes a call to the train control centre.
The train driver receives a call using the trainborne UE that is relayed by
FRMCS.

## 9.12 Wayside-Centric Automatic Train Control
### 9.12.1 Description
Signalling block system, which is a fundamental factor in the perspective of
train control, enables the safe and efficient operation of railways to avoid
collisions between trains. The signalling block system basically keeps a train
away from entering the block occupied by the other train. It is commonly known
that moving block system compared to fixed block system. As shown in Figure
9.12-1, the train in moving block system can approach the leading train more
closely.
Figure 9.12-1 Examples of various railways block systems
One way to realize the moving block system is that a centralized server
communicates with trains and manages the moving block based on the positions
of the trains. The On-board Automatic Train Protection (OATP), which is on the
train, report the position of the train to the Wayside Automatic Train
Protection (WATP), and the WATP decides and provide the movement authority of
the train to the OATP. The train controls itself based on the movement
authority, and trigger brake when it approaches the border of its authorized
moving area.
### 9.12.2 Pre-conditions
1\. The user equipment dedicated to train control gets power-on, and registers
to the train control system.
2\. WATPs are located in the Packet Data Network (PDN), and each train knows
the nearby WATP which can offer a movement authority and make it move.
3\. The user equipment establishes a connection through the 3GPP network for
transporting periodical data between WATP and OATP.
### 9.12.3 Service flows
1\. The OATP periodically report its position to the serving WATP.
2\. The WATP periodically provide movement authority to the OATP
3\. The train accelerates, or triggers brake based on the last received
movement authority. It moves till the position that it is authorized to move,
and stops if it reaches to the border of the authorized area.
### 9.12.4 Post-conditions
The train triggers emergency brake and stops immediately if the connection is
lost and data is not received for a certain time from WATP.

## 9.13 Autonomous Train Control and Operation
### 9.13.1 Description
In legacy train control systems, trains typically decide its movement by
interacting with trackside devices (e.g. track circuits, balise, radio block
system) or communicating with a trackside server. If a train can autonomously
figure out the positions of the nearby trains and decide its movement
authority, the transport capacity of the railway will be enhanced. In the
autonomous train control system whose service concept is aligned to the eV2X
service, trains share its position by exchanging the information without any
centralized server, and each train decides how far it can be authorized to
move based on the position information. It is expected that main application
area will be mass transportation such as subway.
Figure 9.13.-1 An example of autonomous train control scenario
### 9.13.2 Pre-conditions
1\. Trains know the overall schedule, and the user equipment of each train is
connected to the user equipment of the other trains operating at the same
time.
2\. A user equipment of each train is able to establish a connection with the
object Controller for the nearby point machine.
### 9.13.3 Service Flows
1\. A train gets started and try registration to the currently operating
trains. The registration message includes the position of the train.
2\. The train gets the responses of the registration from the other trains and
estimates the positions of the trains.
3\. The train decides its movement authority based on the position information
and starts moving.
4\. The train positions in the corresponding areas are shared through
multicasting.
5\. Based on the periodically updated information, each train updates its
movement authority and conduct train control based on it.
6\. If needed, the train connects to the nearby point machine and sends switch
command.
### 9.13.4 Post-conditions
The autonomous train control is achieved by activating movement authority for
each train or activating object Controller for nearby point machine.

## 9.14 Virtual Coupling
### 9.14.1 Description
One of the important missions that the future railway service should achieve
is to increase its transport capacity. A straight-forward solution is to
minimize the distance between successive trains so that train interval is
reduced. It is difficult to do so in a legacy train control system, because
the successive trains need to have distance as much as a safety margin, which
should be larger than the full braking distance.
{width="6.741666666666666in" height="2.5006944444444446in"}
Figure 9.14-1 Sharing acceleration and braking control information to shorten
safety margin
This safety margin can be further shortened if the successive trains share
control information (acceleration and braking) and apply it to its own train
control. As shown in Figure 9.14.1, the safety margin can be shortened if the
following train immediately knows that the leading train starts braking and
also triggers braking. This is the fundamental principle and the main purpose
of virtual coupling. Figure 9.14.2 shows the basic concept of the virtual
coupling scenario. Multiple trains which are in close distance move together
_as they are physically coupled_. As the distance between two trains gets
smaller, the control information of a train should be delivered to the other
in shorter time.

### 9.14.2. Pre-conditions
1\. The leading and following trains in operation recognize each other and
have just got configured to be coupled virtually.
2\. The user equipment for train control support device to device
communications in the perspective of transport layer.
{width="5.739583333333333in" height="4.1875in"}
Figure 9.14-3 Overall procedure of virtual coupling
### 9.14.3 Service Flows
1\. The following train begins to approach to the leading train by exchanging
the information about their position. The two trains, which are far enough to
allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, are initially connected through
the 3GPP network.
2\. As the following train approaches to the leading train, they start
exchanging the information about movement control and each train then controls
itself while considering the control of the other train. The two trains, which
are still far enough to allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, keep the
connection through the 3GPP network.
3\. As the following train further approaches to the leading train, the safe
braking distance gets shorter and they are required to have a connection of
which end-to-end latency is very short for delicate train control. At this
moment, they seamlessly switch the connection from the 3GPP network to PC5
interface
### 9.14.4 Post-conditions
For safety train operation, integrity needs to be checked for train control
information delivery in the perspective of application or transport layer. Any
error on integrity check shall be immediately reported to the train control

## 9.17 Data communication to exchange key information for train safety
application use cases
### 9.17.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to Key management communication are
defined. The following use cases are defined:
  * Initiation of a Key Management data communication
  * Termination of a Key Management data communication
  * Service interworking and service continuation with GSM-R
### 9.17.2 Use case: Initiation of a Key Management data communication
#### 9.17.2.1 Description
Key Management communication is the application which performs the functions
that ensure the exchange of credentials/keys required by other applications
(such as ATO, ATC) to ensure the correct authentication of the end users of
each application and the integrity of the messages exchanged.
Some Key Management systems require radio communication to interchange the
relevant data between a train and its corresponding key distribution centre
(Key Management Center). This key distribution centre may be located in the
same network or in an external network.
The users in this case are the Key Management applications both on-board of
the train and in the key distribution centre at the trackside (ground system).
Key Management communication is considered to be user-to-user data
communication.
The communication of keys may be requested each time that an ATC or ATO
communication session is established or at any other time, depending on the
specific configuration of the Key Management application.
#### 9.17.2.2 Pre-conditions
The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to initiate
the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the authorisation of
communication application.
The receiving application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to use the Key
Management data communication. This is managed by the authorisation of
communication application.
#### 9.17.2.3 Service flows
The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment (e.g. on-board of the train
or the key distribution centre at the track side) initiates the Key Management
data communication to the receiving side on the FRMCS equipment (e.g. key
distribution centre at the trackside or on-board of the train). The QoS
profile of the communication is managed by the QoS Profile application. The
data communication requests the QoS profile which matches the application
category of CRITICAL DATA (see [QoS]) within the FRMCS system, depending on
the application needs.
The FRMCS system establishes the bearer service required for the data
communication within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see [QoS]).
The arbitration is managed by the arbitration application on the FRMCS
equipment.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
#### 9.17.2.4 Post-conditions
The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is connected to the
receiving application.
Data can be exchanged between the Key Management applications.

### 9.17.4 Use case: service interworking and service continuation with GSM-R
#### 9.17.4.1 Description
For migration purposes the service interworking and service continuation
between the GSM-R system and FRMCS system for Key Management data
communication needs to be clear.
Depending on the migration scenario a key distribution centre can be attached
to the FRMCS system, to the GSM-R system or both. The on-board Key Management
application can be attached either in the GSM-R system or in the FRMCS system.
Functional identities are applicable in one system only.
This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS and GSM-R
systems.
Online Key Management data exchange is supported only with a packet switched
(PS) bearer in the GSM-R system. Therefore, for service interworking and
service continuation only the PS bearer is required.
#### 9.17.4.2 Pre-conditions
The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to initiate
the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the authorisation of
communication application.

When the initiating Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment is
attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating data communication to another
Key Management application, the GSM-R system will route the data communication
accordingly.
If the other Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment is attached to
the FRMCS system, the GSM-R system can only route the data communication if
the destination can be reached by an address or identity understood by the
GSM-R system. The role management in FRMCS provides the appropriate address or
identity e.g. by providing a mapping of GSM-R identities and FRMCS identities.
The information from the role management and presence application is used to
route the communication and to present the identities.
**[Initiating Key Management application attached to FRMCS]{.underline}**
When the initiating Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment is

## 12.9 Use case: Bearer flexibility
### 12.9.1 Description
FRMCS envisages bearer flexibility to allow a certain level of independence
between Railway Applications and the underlying transport system. FRMCS
includes wireless and wireline access. It comprises multiple access systems
and shall support various voice and data applications.
The rationale behind these requirements is that the lifecycle of railway
applications is in general much longer than the lifecycle of telecommunication
access/transport systems. Moreover, bearer flexibility aims at improving
service availability and performance.
The characteristics of bearer flexibility are:
  1. A Railway Application may use one or several access systems as > appropriate.
  2. Connection of FRMCS Equipment to different access systems is dynamic > (i.e. the most appropriate 3GPP or non-3GPP access technologies > are selected automatically, potentially using multiple access > technologies for one or more Railway Applications).
  3. The set of access systems chosen meets the defined QoS and the > service requirements e.g. FRMCS User mobility and connectivity > which are necessary to guarantee the functionality.
  4. The introduction of a new access system should not negatively impact > existing Railway Applications.
The approach taken within FRMCS allows the integration of 3GPP and non-3GPP
radio access evolution.
IP is used as a generic interface towards Railway Applications, facilitating
connectivity, quality of service control, security and the separation of
transport system and applications. NOTE: Non-3GPP access can consist of non-
terrestrial e.g. Satellite as well as of terrestrial access systems.
### 12.9.2 Pre-conditions
The Railway Adaptation Sub-System as part of the FRMCS System is embedded
between the Railway Applications and the Multi Access Core Network (MACN) and
enables the access system independence towards those applications. This Sub-
System adapts application characteristics to the access systems. It manages
e.g. QoS, address conversion, functional roles and train location information.
The MACN has the ability to manage and interwork with wireless access systems
(i.e. 3GPP and non-3GPP) as well as with wireline access systems. It
encompasses for example the management of FRMCS User mobility, FRMCS User
session/communication handling and control of end-to-end communication
prioritisation. The MACN interworks with legacy communication systems and
other FRMCS Systems.
The Access Control & Management function of the FRMCS Equipment is able to
manage the different access systems as well as access via GSM-R (for roaming
and simultaneous operation).
### 12.9.3 Service flows
**Case 1 (data communication)**
As an example the Automatic Train Control (ATC) application of a train
establishes a data communication session with the applicable ground
communication entity which is connected via the fixed network service. For ATC
message exchange, the on-board system can encompass a railway operated private
3GPP 4G access system and a public 3GPP 5G access system (e.g. a VPN service)
as part of the FRMCS System. ATC periodically reports train position
information and receives Control Command instructions from the ground
communication entity. The FRMCS Equipment is registered to both access systems
and uses these simultaneously if applicable.\ Simultaneous use of radio access
systems may improve communication resilience, availability, and QoS and
increases bandwidth.
The concept as described here can generally be extended to other data
communication applications and (non-)3GPP access systems.
**Case 2 (railway emergency voice communication)\** The on-board FRMCS Users
are registered to the FRMCS System. An on-board FRMCS User establishes a
Railway Emergency Communication (REC) from a specific location in the FRMCS
network. This particular communication request takes into account the most
appropriate radio access system, for example the railway-operated private 3GPP
network. The FRMCS System notifies the applicable users determined by the
location of the initiator of the communication by using all available access
system(s) e.g. 3GPP (public and private), WLAN or wireline. The applicable
Controller is notified via the wireline access system. The intended recipients
of the call may be using different access systems.
The concept as described here can in general be extended to other voice group
communication applications and point to point communication services.
**Case 3 (telemetry operation at a railway depot)\** A train is located in a
railway depot where only WLAN coverage (non-3GPP access) as part of the FRMCS
System is provided. FRMCS Users of this train are attached to the FRMCS
System. An FRMCS User starts a data session towards the applicable vehicle
diagnostic entity. At that point in time WLAN provides the radio access system
for this telemetry communication. Once the train leaves the depot and enters
into a 3GPP coverage area, the FRMCS Equipment adapts the transmission of the
telemetry data session to the most QoS effective radio access system (3GPP
access). The telemetry session continues uninterrupted when the train changes
its location.
The concept as described here can in general be extended to other voice and
data applications where other combinations of access systems at specific
locations are possible.
**Case 4 (Backup operation/resilience)**
In a certain area with dedicated 3GPP access, coverage fails. Despite
unavailability of the dedicated railway 3GPP access, FRMCS Users have the
capability to continue communications by using public 3GPP access using an
access system which may support the required or some degraded form of QoS and
which is provided in the area and which serves as a backup or complementary
system. Communication applications on trains continue to operate, service
continuity is preserved. When the functionality of the dedicated 3GPP access
system is restored, the FRMCS Equipment resumes operation on that system.
The concept as described here can generally be extended to any combination of
access systems, e.g. WLAN and private 3GPP access.
**Case 5 (Notification of radio bearer availability)**
In general, there is only little radio spectrum resources allocated to
railways in most regions. These should be preferably used for operational rail
communication purposes. In parallel, there are communications that require
broadband wireless communication services. The availability of broadband
wireless access can be limited e.g. to railway stations. Thus, the FRMCS
System is able to take into account radio bearer availability at the FRMCS
User's position allowing to start communication such as a file download/upload
not harming operational rail communication.
**Case 6 (Use of Satellite Communication)**
In some regions, trains are circulating in rural areas, on low traffic lines.
For such situation, deploying dedicated rail terrestrial radio access is not
economically viable and public mobile operator's service is very limited due
to low population density rate. Satellite access is foreseen as an alternative
to terrestrial radio access that reduces investment in access infrastructure.
In this first approach, satellite access is considered as an enabler to extend
communication service of rail lines with FRMCS.
Some rail applications require service continuity for railways operation. In
some situation, rail traffic is stopped when communication services are not
available. To overcome situations of temporary outage or total destruction of
terrestrial access, use of non-terrestrial access systems by the FRMCS system
could be envisaged to deliver a highly resilient transport service. In this
second approach, satellite access is foreseen as a backup from terrestrial
radio access.
It is envisaged that the FRMCS application could be configured with
preconditions that trigger an alternate mode of operation.
### 12.9.4 Post-conditions

without service interruptions of the communication.

## 12.10 Use Case: QoS in a railway environment
### 12.10.1 Introduction
This system principle use case provides the framework for Quality of Service
within the FRMCS System including the railway applications. The main purpose
is to specify the list of attributes applicable to the FRMCS bearer service.
Railway applications exhibit different characteristics, e.g., in terms of
latency or reliability. On the other hand, the FRMCS System offers bearer
services with different properties.
In this context, two types of applications can be distinguished:
  1. Applications that are aware of their transport service requirements and that are able to request those from the FRMCS System.
  2. Applications that are not aware of their transport service requirements and that are therefore not able to request those.
Railway applications require a QoS classification ranging from high to low as
low is "best effort". The most important QoS parameters that determine the
quality of the transport system are latency of the user data and reliability
of the communication. In addition, guaranteed bandwidth assures the
continuation of critical communication.
QoS impacts train punctuality and the entire utilisation of the track system.
Therefore, the FRMCS System has to consider the various QoS requirements.
Apart from high train speed operation, which goes up to 500kmh^-1^, other
fundamental factors affect wireless communication. Railways are facing various
radio signal propagation conditions such as in free space and in tunnels. Free
space encompasses various structural and constructional scenarios. Railway
corridors in hilly terrain or forest aisle are some examples.
Radio propagation in large railway stations and shunting yards is different
from the one of the main lines. Moving trains in stations or moving cargo
wagons in shunting yards cause different propagation conditions.
Radio tower site-to-site distance requires special attention. This distance
varies depending on the type of area (rural or urban) and is determined by the
boundary conditions of the RF signal (e.g. frequency band and power budget).
Railways clearly require to deploy FRMCS while keeping the same distance
between the radio towers in order to reuse the infrastructure deployed for
GSM-R.
Voice communication is commonly used during rail operation to give
instructions to a driver of a locomotive in shunting operation, track
maintenance etc. Rail environmental conditions like slowdown or movement of a
train can impact the understandability of the voice.
Radio propagation conditions in a rail environment are quite specific. For
example train speed up to 500km/h or the insertion loss of the radio signal
into a train. Staff has to work in the train, beside a train or under the
train etc. while voice communication is ongoing. Such conditions shall not
lower the intelligibility of the voice.
Radio spectrum constraints in some regions require high efficiency in terms of
radio bandwidth utilisation where voice communication coexists with other
communication types simultaneously. The resulting voice codec has to consider
these specific conditions.
## 12.10.2 Use case: Quality of Service and railway environment
#### 12.10.2.1 Description
The basis for this use case is the UIC FRMCS URS wherein communication
attributes define the QoS to be achieved for the various kinds of railway
applications. These attributes are not part of the functional use case
description but relevant for the FRMCS System and therefore subject of this
use case.
Regarding the URS communication attributes, not all attributes are covered in
the QoS use case. The following items are considered:
  * Type of communication
  * Latency, the delay between action and reaction
  * Session Reliability
  * Setup of communication, the time to establish a voice or data communication session
  * Talker assignment time in group communication
  * Audio (Voice) Quality
For further details, refer to the corresponding use cases in chapters 5 \-- 9.
In these chapters the QoS requirements are specified on functional level. A
reference is used which refers to real values' in this QoS use case.
#### 12.10.2.2 Pre-conditions
The pre-conditions of the functional use cases out of chapter 5 -- 9 are
applicable.
#### 12.10.2.3 Service flows
The service flows of the functional use cases out chapter 5 -- 9 are
applicable.
**Application categories**
Application categories describe the data transfer characteristic to be
achieved by a bearer service. The FRMCS System shall consider the following
user plane application categories:
> **Voice** for user to user or multiuser communication; Voice follows the
> typical conversational pattern and requires low delay inside the transport
> system;
>
> **Critical Voice** follows the voice conversational pattern but requires
> immediate session setup;
>
> **Video** used for general observations purposes, e.g. maintenance;
>
> **Critical Video** with indirect impact on train operation, e.g. passenger
> surveillance;
>
> **Very Critical Video** with direct impact on safety- related critical train
> control and operation, e.g. used in driverless ( e.g. GoA3/GoA4) operation
> for automated detection of objects (no human in the loop) or video-based
> remote control (human in the loop).
>
> **Very critical data** for future rail applications;
>
> **Critical data** follows the response pattern and requires high reliable
> transport. This category comprises future and legacy applications e.g. ETCS;
>
> **Non-Critical data** used for the exchange of railway system or
> communication relevant information; requires high reliable transmission and
> preservation of the response pattern;
>
> **Messaging** for the exchange of non-critical short information messages,
> recorded voice (for example voicemail), data, pictures, video; requires
> reliable transmission;
**Priority Level**
In order to reach the QoS applicable for each application category, transport
priority levels are required to differentiate among the communication urgency.
Priority handling of communication service encompasses the assignment of a
priority to a communication and involves the seizing of resources, which are
in use by a communication having a lower ranking in the absence of idle
resources. Priority handling includes as well discontinuation of an ongoing
communication having a lower priority to allow an incoming communication of
higher priority. Priority handling needs to be provided to a FRMCS User for
all communications.
Priorities are treated by the FRMCS User/Equipment in the FRMCS System based
on the following conditions:
  * The priority level depends on the FRMCS User initiating the communication.
  * The communication can have the priority level selected by the FRMCS User at setup or the priority level is predefined at registration. The treatment of priority level also applies when the FRMCS User is registered to a visited FRMCS network.
  * The definition of the priority level which may cause preâ€‘emption of another ongoing communication needs to be stored and can be changed by the FRMCS User.
  * The FRMCS System is able to allocate setup classes i.e. communication setup time requirements and resource pre-emption capabilities to each priority level.
  * In case of resource preâ€‘emption, the preâ€‘empted FRMCS user needs to be provided with a suitable indication.
  * The priority level can be selected by the FRMCs User on a per communication basis.
The FRMCS User may select any priority level up to the authorised priority
level. The maximum priority level needs to be stored on the UICC. At
communication setup, the FRMCS Equipment and the FRMCS System verify the
priority level at setup against the maximum authorised priority level. If the
FRMCS User has not selected a priority level at setup, the FRMCS System
applies a FRMCS User specific default priority level. If the FRMCS User has
selected at setup a priority level higher than the maximum authorised priority
level, the maximum authorised priority level is applied for the communication.
**Service Attributes**
From FRMCS User point of view there are two main service attributes latency
and communication reliability.
For the **Latency** two classifications are applicable:
> Low User data delay harms the functioning of the application.
>
> Normal User data delay does not harm the sequence and progress of the
> application.
From FRMCS System point of view, latency quantifies the end-to-end user data
transport delay between the involved communication entities.
**Reliability** (in accordance to TS 22.261): in the context of network layer
packet transmissions, percentage value of the amount of sent network layer
packets successfully delivered to a given system entity within the time
constraint required by the targeted service, divided by the total number of
sent network layer packets.
Two levels are to be taken into account:
> High The packet loss at transport level is exceptional rare.
>
> Normal The packet loss at transport level is seldom.
The FRMCS System is able to assign multiple individual FRMCS User
communications having individual QoS profile to a single IP address.
To meet the different application characteristics e.g. conversational pattern,
real-time or critical data further itemisation is necessary. The mapping of
the service attributes latency and reliability among functional requirements
and FRMCS System as well as their target values are summarised in Table
12.10-1.
* * *
Service Attribute FRMCS - Functional Requirement FRMCS -- System Requirement
Service Attribute value Latency Low Ultra-Low â‰¤10ms Low â‰¤100ms Normal Normal
â‰¤500ms Best Effort >500ms Reliability High Ultra-High 99.9999% High 99.9%
Normal Normal 99%
* * *
Table 12.10-1 - Service attribute mapping
Some application categories are time stringent e.g. critical voice or critical
data.
The range of latency and reliability requirements have a certain dependency on
the speed of the trains. In general, the requirement is that the service
attributes can be guaranteed up to 500kmh^-1^. Certain combinations of latency
and reliability apply only to **Low Speed** (â‰¤ 40kmh^-1^**).**
The applications are considered as real-time when the FRMCS functional
requirement for the latency is specified as "Low" and "Ultra Low", according
to table 12.10 1.
**Session handling**
**Setup time** of a communication session is essential because of their safety
related character. Communication session setup encompasses the value of the
elapsed time between the communication establishment request and the
indication of successful communication session establishment. The FRMCS User
requires two classes:
> **Immediate** The FRMCS User requires immediate setup of the communication
> session. The duration of the immediate communication session establishment
> shall not exceed 1 second.
>
> **Normal** Normal communication session setup time range does not harm the
> use of the application. The time duration of the normal communication
> session establishment shall not exceed 3 seconds.
**Talker assignment time** comprises the timeframe between talker request and
the permission to talk applicable to group communication. This timeframe shall
be lower than 300ms. Talker assignment time assumes that a group communication
has been set up.
**Session Loss Rate (SLR)** indicates the number of sessions released
unintentionally per accumulated session time. SLR shall be \ Note 1: | | | | | | > The | | | | | | > latency | | | | | | > "Ultra | | | | | | > low" is | | | | | | > | | | | | | restricted | | | | | | > to low | | | | | | > speed â‰¤40 | | | | | | > | | | | | | kmh^-\ 1^. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+

## 12.19 Allocation and isolation of FRMCS communication resources
### 12.19.1 Introduction
Rail communication distinguishes between critical, performance and business
applications. It is an essential task of the FRMCS System to support
segregation of data transmission, in this context the isolation of railway
application data utilizing the same available transport resources. The
principle of segregation of data transmission applies to:
  * FRMCS communication infrastructure may be shared by multiple railway undertakings;
  * Different railway applications of one railway undertaking require isolated and customized communication resources (transport resources and functionalities) for each application.
In general, it is anticipated that isolated transport services can be provided
with a predictable and guaranteed QoS.
### 12.19.2 Use case: Isolation of FRMCS communication resources
#### 12.19.2.1 Description
**Scenario 1: Isolation for individual railway undertakings**
An FRMCS System infrastructure manager may have to host different railway
undertakings. Due to isolation reasons, these railway undertakings require
segregation of their communication and a predictable and guaranteed QoS.
**Scenario 2: Isolation among categories of applications belonging to one
railway undertaking**
Railway community has classified their application to different categories,
i.e. critical, performance and business. Due to isolation reasons, the related
communications require segregation of data transmission having a predictable
and guaranteed QoS for the different categories of applications.
#### 12.19.2.2 Pre-conditions
**General**
Segregation of data transmission is supported by the FRMCS system.
**Scenario 1: Isolation reasons for individual railway undertakings**
Railway undertakings need their own segregated transport resources and network
functionalities needed for their communications.
**Scenario 2: Isolation among categories of applications belonging to one
railway undertaking**
Railway undertaking assigns each application category to their own segregated
transport resources and network functionalities needed for their
communications.
#### 12.19.2.3 Service flows
**Scenario 1: Isolation reasons for individual railway undertakings**
Each railway undertaking in a country utilises dedicated and isolated
transport resources and network functionalities.
**Scenario 2: Isolation among categories of applications belonging to one
railway undertaking**
Each application category of one railway undertaking utilises dedicated and
isolated transport resources and network functionalities.
#### 12.19.2.4 Post-conditions
**Scenario1**
Each railway undertaking in a country obtains dedicated and segregated
transport resources and network functionalities.
**Scenario2**
Each application category of one railway undertaking obtains dedicated and
segregated transport resources and network functionalities.

## 12.20 FRMCS Equipment capabilities for multiple FRMCS Users
### 12.20.1 Introduction
For communication, rail vehicles today have a dedicated terminal approach. For
each type of application, voice or data (e.g. ATC), one (1:1) or several
mobile terminals (1: n) are used. Multiple Mobile Terminals for one
application are required for operational or availability reasons.
With the introduction of the FRMCS System, the number of applications will
multiply. More recent train compositions already have a large number of
sensors whose information is exchanged for control or diagnosis between the
vehicle and the ground control centre.
With the continuation of the 1:1 principle (application equals mobile
terminal) this would correspond to a multiplication of the mobile terminals.
In addition, the space required for mobile terminals and roof antennas would
significantly increase.
### 12.20.2 Description
In the case of vehicle/train composition, FRMCS Users can take full advantage
of the transport facilities of the 3GPP system while ensuring priority,
latency and reliability for each communication. FRMCS User and the associated
communication applications need to be decoupled from the FRMCS Equipment.
### 12.20.3 Pre-conditions
At least one FRMCS Equipment is installed at the vehicle/train that provides
transport capabilities between vehicle/train to ground or vice versa.
### 12.20.4 Service flows
Multiple FRMCS Users starts communication, for example:
â€¢ ATC;
â€¢ ATO;
â€¢ Sensor information exchange.
### 12.20.5 Post-conditions
FRMCS Users on the vehicle/train are able to communicate to FRMCS Users on the
ground or to other vehicles/trains.

## 12.21 FRMCS System/FRMCS User roaming capabilities
### 12.21.1 Introduction
FRMCS Roaming use cases address the ability for an FRMCS User to make use of
FRMCS Applications when he is provided service by a network different from his
Home FRMCS Network. A specific use case applies for FRMCS Functional
Identities (see 12.21.3 use case).
It is essential for the operation of international trains, transporting
passenger or freight across borders, that FRMCS Users are using the
capabilities and services of other FRMCS networks.
The situations envisaged also encompass situations where trains are moving to
an area where a dedicated FRMCS network has been deployed for an urban area,
for a region, for a rail track operated by a different company in a tunnel, in
a large industrial area.
Other cases are pertinent for rail operation such as trains running in
countries or regions where communications services provided by the local
responsible Rail Infrastructure Manager are different from the one where they
have subscription or where service can only be provided by a Public Mobile
Network Operator.
FRMCS Roaming capabilities are necessary to ensure that Railways Undertaking
will be able to use a single FRMCS Equipment for their FRMCS Users while
roaming.
### 12.21.2 Use case: FRMCS User is relocating towards a Visited (FRMCS)
Network
#### 12.21.2.1 Description
This use case addresses the situation where an FRMCS User is moving beyond the
coverage of its Home FRMCS Network and where communications services can be
provided by another Visited (FRMCS) Network. Following scenarios for an FRMCS
User are:
  * Relocation from Home FRMCS Network to a Visited (FRMCS) Network and vice versa;
  * Relocation from a Visited (FRMCS) Network to another Visited (FRMCS) Network.
#### 12.21.2.2 Pre-conditions
The Visited (FRMCS) Network is capable to retrieve FRMCS Users information
from applicable Home FRMCS network.
#### 12.21.2.3 Service flows
FRMCS User is relocating from Home FRMCS Network to Visited (FRMCS) Network,
or from a Visited (FRMCS) Network to another Visited (FRMCS) Network.
FRMCS User makes use of FRMCS Applications that are applicable in the Home
FRMCS Network and the FRMCS Application that are applicable in the Visited
(FRMCS) Network.
#### 12.21.2.4 Post-conditions
FRMCS User is able to use FRMCS Applications after relocating to a Visited
(FRMCS) Network.
FRMCS User has not experienced service interruption of FRMCS Application while
relocating.

### 12.21.3 Use case: Functional Identities in FRMCS Roaming situations
#### 12.21.3.1 Description
This use case addresses the situation where an FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment
is moving beyond the coverage of its Home FRMCS Network and where
communications services can be provided by another Visited (FRMCS) Network.
An FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment in FRMCS Roaming situations (referring to
12.21.2 use case) shall be able to make use of FRMCS Functional Identities,
from its Home FRMCS Network and, when applicable, from Visited (FRMCS)
Networks. For instance, an FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment in a train can be
registered to a permanent FRMCS Functional Identity with its Home FRMCS
Network (associated with the engine), and an FRMCS Functional Identity
registered with a Visited (FRMCS) Network. For train cross border operations
(e.g. FRMCS Roaming situations), some registered FRMCS Functional Identities
shall remain valid for the duration of the train international run, the same
FRMCS Functional Identity keeping the same association to FRMCS Equipment
while border crossing.
Each FRMCS Network shall maintain its own FRMCS Functional Identity addressing
scheme. For the purpose of FRMCS roaming, an international FRMCS Functional
Identity scheme will be used and national scheme will align on it. If a train
(e.g. an FRMCS User) is involved in cross border operation, the FRMCS System
shall detect automatically if an activated FRMCS Functional Identity requires
a re-association to the local applicable addressing domain. The responsible
local functional addressing entity in the Visiting (FRMCS) Network aligns the
Home FRMCS Network functional addressing entity about FRMCS Functional
Identity re-association. The activation status of the re-associated FRMCS
Functional Identity will be aligned accordingly. The responsible entity of the
functional address is keeping the status (active/inactive).
#### 12.21.3.2 Pre-conditions
FRMCS User is registered to at least one FRMCS Functional Identity F1 with its
Home FRMCS Network.
FRMCS Equipment is associated with a permanent Functional Identity
administrated by the Home FRMCS Network.
The Visited (FRMCS) Network is capable to retrieve FRMCS Users information
from applicable Home FRMCS network.
#### 12.21.3.3 Service flows
FRMCS User is relocating from Home FRMCS Network to Visited (FRMCS) Network,
or from a Visited (FRMCS) Network to another Visited (FRMCS) Network.
FRMCS Users and FRMCS Equipment register to at least one FRMCS Functional
Identity F2 with the Visited (FRMCS) Network.
FRMCS User makes use of FRMCS Functional Identities associated with the Home
FRMCS Network, at least F1, and the FRMCS Functional Identities associated
with the Visited (FRMCS) Network, at least F2.
#### 12.21.3.4 Post-conditions
An FRMCS User and FRMCS Equipment in FRMCS Roaming situations are able to use
FRMCS Functional Identities associated with both Home FRMCS Network and

## 12.22 Use case: Availability -- increasing measures
### 12.22.1 Description
In some regions railways are a major constituent for the economy. Disturbance
in the complex railway system can have a significant impact for example in the
manufacturing process if components cannot be delivered in-time. There are
significant improvements in train punctuality and track utilisation by using
Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems. Unavailability of the FRMCS System,
FRMCS sub-systems or simple components can cause a significant impact to
railway operation.
ATC provides different levels of operation. The moving block mode is the most
demanding one that requires multiple times more information in one second,
e.g., position reports from the train towards the ground controlling entity
which computes continuously the risk that consecutive trains can collide.
In order to minimise the risk of FRMCS System unavailability, Single Point of
Failures (SPOF) need to be eliminated. There are different strategies such as
duplication of components, subsystems or the entire system. The mode of system
redundancy ranges from hot-standby, warm-standby to cold-standby. Hot-standby
is the most demanding mode and requires an instantaneous continuation of the
end-to-end service. Also the use of only one spectrum block represents a SPOF.
In case one spectrum block become unavailable due to wideband jamming or
similar, the FRMCS System needs to be able to make flexible use of spectrum to
minimize the risk of radio path unavailability.
FRMCS System or sub-system maintenance may cause outages of some minutes or
hours. Today, a high utilisation of rail tracks already reduces the number of
maintenance windows. A redundant deployment of the radio access sub-system
allows continuation of rail operation while one part of radio access sub-
system is under maintenance.
### 12.22.2 Pre-conditions
The basis for setting up the FRMCS System takes into account the elimination
of Single Point Of Failure which encompasses:
  * Usage of multiple independent spectrum blocks;
  * Duplication of system functionalities/entities of the FRMCS System.
### 12.22.3 Service flows
**Case 1:**
During train control operation, some portion of the used spectrum block is
disturbed, e.g., through interference from an external source.
**Case 2:**
During train control operation a FRMCS sub-system fails or has been put under
maintenance.
### 12.22.4 Post-conditions
The communication service continues without interruption.
Train operation efficiency is not affected in any way despite the disturbances
caused by:
  * Interference (intentional or unintentional);
  * Unavailability of FRMCS sub-systems due to planned (maintenance) or unplanned (outage) reasons.

## 12.23 Use case: Flexible use of available contiguous spectrum blocks(s) and
related bandwidth(s)
### 12.23.1 Introduction
Globally, different contiguous spectrum block(s) with related bandwidth(s) may
be available for rail communication in different areas. An FRMCS Equipment may
also support different contiguous spectrum block(s) with related bandwidth(s)
than the infrastructure deployed in the area. The use case addresses the
general requirements related to the ability of the FRMCS System to flexibly
use the maximum extent of rail spectrum available in an area, also considering
the capabilities of the FRMCS Equipment that is served.
### 12.23.2 Description
It is essential that the FRMCS system can flexibly utilize the available
bandwidth of the contiguous spectrum block(s), for both On-network and Off-
network communication, also considering the contiguous spectrum block(s) and
related bandwidth(s) supported by served FRMCS Equipment.
### 12.23.3 Pre-conditions
In certain areas, specific contiguous spectrum block(s) and related
bandwidth(s) are available for rail communication. An FRMCS Equipment served
in the area supports (possibly different) specific contiguous spectrum
block(s) and their related bandwidth(s).
### 12.23.4 Service flows
The FRMCS System obtains information about the specific contiguous spectrum
block(s) and their related bandwidth(s) supported by the FRMCS Equipment.
The FRMCS System allocates the locally available contiguous spectrum block(s)
and their related bandwidth(s), and serves FRMCS Equipment according to its
supported contiguous spectrum block(s) and their related bandwidth(s).
### 12.23.5 Post-conditions
The FRMCS System is able to flexibly use the maximum extent of rail spectrum
available in a given area, also considering the capabilities of the FRMCS
Equipment that is served.

# 13 Potential New Requirements
This chapter lists the potential new requirements that have been considered
for introduction in Rel-15 normative specifications. Only parts of "9.3 Role
management and presence" and "9.7 Multi user talker control related use cases"
were introduced. All other requirements identified in the TR above but not
listed below are not covered in Rel-15.
The third column "SA1 spec covering" identifies the specification and the
requirement number within that specification where the 22.889 requirement with
the number as specified in the first column of the table is covered. The
fourth column provide additional explanation if needed.
# 14 Conclusion and Recommendations
This TR provides use cases and potential requirements for Railway
Communication. It is proposed to start normative work based on these potential
requirements.
Where applicable, it is proposed to include the requirements identified by
this work into the set of existing stage 1 missing critical and other
specifications.
Requirements not fitting to any existing specification are proposed to go into
a new TS.
###### ### Annex A: Examples of Role management
This annex gives some examples on how Role management is used in the railway
environment. This is to better understand the use.
**[Functional identity]{.underline}**
Every operational railway function e.g. train driver, a shunter or Controller
is identified by their functions. A non-exhaustive list is provided in the
table underneath.
* * *
Functional identities Leading train driver Driver 2 Driver 3 Shunting leader
Shunting member Track side maintenance leader Track side maintenance member
Primary train controller Secondary train controller Power controller Shunting
controller Trackside maintenance controller Platform inspector Public
announcement Chief conductor Second conductor Third conductor Catering staff
chief Diagnostics
* * *
In order to make a function of a user known to other users, the user has to
register itself to a specific functional identity.
For example, user can be authorised by the railway undertaking to be a train
driver (functional Role) of a train. When the Driver starts the scheduled
train ride, from A to B at time x, the train running schedule assigns a
specific train running number for this train. In principle the train keeps
this number for the complete journey. The train driver uses his communication
equipment to register himself, as the leading train driver (functional Role),
of train number 123 (functional identity). After registration the train driver
is now registered to the FRMCS System as the leading train driver of train
123. In some cases there can be multiple Drivers on one train, so the
individual Drivers can register themselves accordingly.
**[FRMCS Equipment Type]{.underline}**
The equipment used in the railway environment can be very specific. The FRMCS
Equipment is constituted of an UE and the FRMCS Application on this UE. This
depends on the location and situation the equipment is used. The following
different equipment types can be used, as an example:
* * *
Equipment type Equipment Capabilities (Examples) Cabin radio Emergency button,
external loudspeaker Shunting radio Loudspeaker, hands free Trackside
maintenance radio  
Security staff radio Emergency button, public emergency call button Catering
staff radio  
Train controller device Emergency button, call to maintenance staff button,
call to power controllers button Shunting controller device  
Sensor No HMI
* * *
These different types of FRMCS Equipment are relevant for the registration
process of functional identities. For example a train driver cannot register
to a functional identity using a FRMCS Equipment which is not fit for the
train driver to perform his Role. So a train driver cannot perform a
registration as train driver of train 123 if he uses a catering staff FRMCS
Equipment (where there is no train emergency button available, no loudspeaker
and handset, etc.). The registration request will be rejected by the FRMCS
System.
The FRMCS Equipment shall also be reachable based on the identity of the FRMCS
Equipment. For example the cabin radio of a specific train can be reached by
their FRMCS Equipment Identity.
**[FRMCS User identity]{.underline}**
The railway employee (a specific person) is also reachable even if no
functional identity has been assigned. This is done by using a unique FRMCS
User identity. This can be an E.164 number, any other number according to a
specific railways numbering plan or by fully qualified domain names (FQDN).
Such a number or FQDN is dedicated/ assigned to a specific railway employee.
After the employee has performed the log-in procedure to the FRMCS System, he
is reachable via his individual FRMCS User identity.
###### ### Annex B: Minimum functional and performance requirements for FRMCS
from a perspective of Korea LTE-based railway services
In this annex, minimum functional and performance requirements [5]-[6] are
introduced for FRMCS from a perspective of Korea\'s LTE-based railway
services. Here, the term 'minimum' is used from the fact that the requirements
are expected to be satisfied even with previous Rel. version of 3GPP LTE.
Specifically, all the functionalities and performance requirements except for
the high speed (500km/h) listed in the above have been shown to be fully
supported by LTE Rel. 9, which have been validated in a commercial railway
with a length of 54.2km [7]. Also, train control service named as Korea Radio-
Based Train Control System (KRTCS) has been shown to be feasible by handling
priorities among multiple data, where the level of KRTCS is equivalent to
European Train Control System (ETCS) level 3 in a train control perspective.
All the specific test scenarios regarding functional and performance
requirements including KRTCS have been validated in a commercial railway [8].
For promising FRMCS supporting LTE Rel. 15, more enhanced and sophisticated
requirements should be provided. In that sense, these requirements can be
considered as basic functional and performance requirements for FRMCS.
**[Minimum functional requirements]{.underline}**
In a communication perspective, the followings can be minimum functional
requirements for LTE based railway communication systems. The contents of each
function and each digital radio equipment are described in detail in [5]-[6].
