# 1 Scope
This technical report relates to a study on positioning use cases for both
outdoor and indoor environments. It analyses positioning use cases and
complements existing work on 5G use cases involving positioning needs in order
to identify potential requirements for 5G positioning services.
This document also identifies new use cases, their scope and environment of
use along with the related KPIs. For use cases already addressed (fully or
partially) in other 3GPP studies, it consolidates and validates the KPI and
assumptions.
The document further develops the identified use cases by providing some
considerations on the suitability of positioning technologies to these use
cases. These considerations support the identification of potential
requirements that can be achieved with 3GPP positioning technologies or with a
combination of 3GPP and non-3GPP positioning technologies. The use cases and
performance targets are independent of specific solutions even though, in
order to support these considerations, the report provides some illustrative
allocation between existing positioning technologies and 3GPP new positioning
technologies (e.g. NR-based).

Clause 5 describes the positioning use cases, categorized by verticals, as
follows:
\- Regulatory (e.g. emergency call, LI)
\- Mission Critical
\- Location-Based Services (e.g. LCS, gaming, social networking, position-
enabled advertisement)
\- Industry and eHealth (e.g. automation, asset management and tracking,
device telemetry -- metering, patient monitoring)
\- Road (e.g. vehicle environment, road-user charging)
\- Railway
\- Maritime
\- Aerials (e.g. UAV/UAS)
\- Others
A synthesis of all the use cases requirements is provided in Clause 6
summarising targets for positioning services along with a grouping of some use
cases, when this grouping is possible and relevant.
Clause 7 develops some considerations on the suitability of positioning
technologies for the identified use cases, considering both 3GPP and non-3GPP
positioning technologies. The related mapping builds on a background material
to reveal the use cases that can be covered by existing technologies
(standalone or combined) and the use cases for which 3GPP new positioning
technologies (e.g. NR-enabled) are needed to cope with the shortcomings of
existing technologies.
Clause 8 identifies initial potential requirements for 5G positioning services
based on the considerations developed in Clause 7.
# 5 Use cases
## 5.1 Foreword
### 5.1.1 Key Performance Indicators and Key attributes for positioning use
cases
The following KPI apply to the definition of the use-cases positioning
requirements:
\- **Position accuracy** : describes the closeness of the measured position of
the UE to its true position value. The accuracy can describe the accuracy
either of an absolute position or of a relative position. It can be further
derived into a horizontal position accuracy -- referring to the position error
in a 2D reference or horizontal plane, and into a vertical position accuracy
-- referring to the position error on the vertical axis or altitude.
\- **Speed accuracy** : describes the closeness of the measured magnitude of
the UE's velocity to the true magnitude of the UE's velocity.
\- **Bearing accuracy** : describes the closeness of the measured bearing of
the UE to its true bearing. Both the measured and the true bearing are defined
in a common base coordinate system, using yaw-pitch-roll as for aircraft
principal axes. For a moving UE, the bearing is a measure of the velocity's
direction and this KPI can be combined with speed accuracy into the velocity's
accuracy.
\- **Timestamp accuracy** : the position-related data (e.g. position,
velocity) are usually associated to a timestamp, marking the time when the
position-related data has been determined. The timestamp accuracy describes
the closeness of the timestamp value to the true instant when the related data
was computed.
\- **Availability** : percentage of time when a positioning system is able to
provide the required position-related data within the performance targets or
requirements.
\- **Latency** : time elapsed between the event that triggers the
determination of the position-related data and the availability of the
position-related data at the positioning system interface. At initialisation
of the positioning system, the latency is also defined as the Time to First
Fix.
\- **Time to First Fix (TTFF)** : time elapsed between the event triggering
for the first time the determination of the position-related data and the
availability of the position-related data at the positioning system interface.
TTTF is greater or equal to Latency.
\- **Update rate** : rate at which the position-related data is generated by
the positioning system. It is the inverse of the time elapsed between two
successive position-related data.
**\- Power consumption** : electrical power (usually in mW) used by the
positioning system to produce the position-related data.
**\- Energy per Fix** : electrical energy (usually in mJ per fix) used by the
positioning system to produce the position-related data. It represents the
integrated power consumption of the positioning system over the required
processing interval. It considers both the processing energy and the energy
used during the idle state between two successive productions of position-
related data. This KPI can advantageously replace the power consumption when
the positioning system is not active continuously (e.g. device tracking).
**\- System scalability** : amount of devices for which the positioning system
can determine the position-related data in a given time unit, and/or for a
specific update rate.
The aforementioned Key Performance Indicators can be dependent of the UE's
dynamic and/or dependent of its location in the cell. The KPI defines a target
either for each dependence, or for the worst-case.
Furthermore, some applications can have specific needs in terms of insurance
of the quality of service, usually addressed in dedicated certification
process and standards outside 3GPP. Most of the time, these applications are
safety-critical or liability-critical applications.
For the purpose of this document, the following additional KPIs can be
considered on a case-by-case basis.
**\- Continuity** : likelihood that the positioning system functionality will
be available during the complete duration of the intended operation if the
positioning system is operational at the beginning of the operation.
**\- Reliability** : measure of the ability of a positioning system to provide
the position-related data under stated conditions for a specified period.
**\- Integrity** : measure of the trust in the accuracy of the position-
related data provided by the positioning system and the ability to provide
timely and valid warnings to the UE and/or the user when the positioning
system does not fulfil the condition for intended operation.
**\- Time to alert** : time elapsed between a change of the integrity (as
defined above) and the information to the UE and/or the user.
**\- Authentication** : provision of assurance that the position-related data
associated with the UE has been derived from trusted and authorised sources
(e.g. real signals and not falsified signals). This KPI is different from
security, which defines the measures to ensure that the position-related data
is safeguarded against unapproved disclosure or usage inside or outside the
positioning-system. Because it cannot be summarised and quantified as a scalar
target, this KPI is managed as a binary field in the present report: yes or no
provision of positioning authentication is needed.
**\- Security / Privacy** : measures to ensure that the position-related data
is safeguarded against unapproved disclosure or usage inside or outside the
positioning system and/or to ensure that a non-authorized party cannot access
information relating to the privacy of the user. Because it cannot be
summarised and quantified as a scalar target, this KPI is managed as a binary
field in the present report: yes or no security and/or privacy is needed.
In addition to the aforementioned KPIs, the use cases' description can
consider the following key attributes, because they affect significantly the
positioning performances and operating conditions of the related technologies:
**\- Environment of use** : the physical environment in which the UE operates.
It describes the service area or volume (e.g. building, cell or network
coverage, regional, global coverage) as well as the high-level properties
affecting radiofrequency propagation and positioning such as the nature of the
service area (open i.e. no obstruction, aerial, sub-urban, canyons urban or
natural, indoor including tunnels). In case of multiple environments, the
attribute shall also define whether the use case is expected to operate
seamlessly in all these environments.
\- **5G positioning service area** \- a service area where positioning
services would solely rely on infrastructures and positioning technologies
that can be assumed to be present anywhere where 5G is present (e.g. a
country-wide operator-supplied 5G network, GNSS, position/motion sensors). It
corresponds to the so-called "identical communication and positioning coverage
area" in 5.55 from 3GPP TR 22.891-e20 (Feasibility study on New Services and
Markets Technology Enablers). This includes both indoor and outdoor
environment, and for the latter, any outdoor environment (rural with low
density of node but little obstruction, urban with high density of node and
obstruction by building, etc.). The 5G positioning service area can be
considered for use cases that must work in any 5G environment, for example in
any building -- commercial, public or residential alike -- e.g. to localize a
patient getting a heart attack in an apartment building
\- **Bounded service area** or **Dedicated service area** \- a subset of the
5G positioning service area where specific positioning services can be
provided (e.g. enhanced performances when compared to the performances
achieved in the whole 5G positioning service area).
\- **Enhanced positioning area** \- a subset of the 5G positioning service
area that is assumed to be provided with additional infrastructure or deploy a
particular set of positioning technologies to enhance positioning services. It
corresponds to the term "Enhanced positioning coverage area" in 5.55 from 3GPP
TR 22.891-e20 (Feasibility study on New Services and Markets Technology
Enablers). For example, a hospital (campus) could be equipped to enable
tracking of patients, personnel and assets throughout the hospital with
improved accuracy and availability (e.g. using a higher density of small
cells, nodes or WLAN access points). This additional infrastructure could use
a combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies, and cover both
indoor and outdoor environments.
**\- UE dynamic** : the UE can be either static or moving. In the latter, the
attribute shall also provide some elements about its motion, e.g. maximum
speed, trajectory.
**\- UE density** : defined as the number of UEs per kmÂ².
**\- Consideration on positioning sources (or reference nodes) density with
impact on positioning KPI** \- for example, some use case may consider a
specific density or deployment to improve KPI target in a well-defined service
area (e.g. hospitals, factory floor, etc.).
## 5.2 LBS-related use cases
### 5.2.1 Accurate positioning for shared bikes
#### 5.2.1.1 Description
The shared bike service allows a rider to rent a bike via a mobile app and
drop it off anywhere for the next user. The accurate locations of shared bikes
are available in the mobile app for the riders to find the nearest bike.
This service offers the citizens a cheap and convenient way for city trip.
However, the ruthless management of bike parking will cause the problems such
as blocking sidewalks. Electronic fence is used as a tool for regulating the
parked bikes, and it requires high accuracy positioning of shared bikes.
#### 5.2.1.2 Pre-conditions
Tom downloads an app on his smart phone, which allows him to locate and unlock
a nearby shared bike.
The shared bikes are equipped with 5G communication modules, smart lock as
well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination
of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not limited
to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems
(TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and sensors.
The parking areas are categorized as strictly parking-controlled areas and
non-strictly parking-controlled areas.
For strictly parking-controlled areas which are mainly near bus hubs, subway
stations and shopping centres, riders who park bikes outside the allowed areas
(i.e., electronic areas) cannot lock them and will continue to be charged.
For non-strictly parking-controlled areas, instead of being forced, riders are
just encouraged to park at any public bike rack or public location that does
not interfere with pedestrians or traffic.
#### 5.2.1.3 Service Flows
1\. Tom locates a nearby shared bike and unlocks it to start the trip. 5G
provides positioning service with 2m horizontal position accuracy, 90%
availability, less than 1s latency.
2\. Tom rides the bike to the destination at the speed of 15-20km/hour, and
during the trip the bike will report its location to the server frequently. 5G
provides positioning service with 2m horizontal position accuracy, 90%
availability, less than 1s latency.
3\. Tom has completed his trip.
a) If the parking area is non-strictly parking-controlled area, Tom could park
the bike freely at any public location and then lock the bike. The bike
reports its location to server. 5G provides positioning service with 2m
horizontal position accuracy, 90% availability, less than 1s latency.
b) If the parking area is strictly parking-controlled area, the mobile app
will indicate him to park the bike in a designated electronic fence nearby.
Otherwise, Tom cannot lock the bike and will continue to be charged. The app
needs to check if the bike is precisely parked into the dedicated area. 5G
provides a positioning service with 0.2m horizontal position accuracy, 99%
availability, less than 1s latency.
#### 5.2.1.4 Post-conditions
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.2.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.2.1.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide a positioning service with 2m
horizontal position accuracy, 90% availability, and less than 1s latency for
the moving UE at the speed of 15-20km/hour outdoor.
The 5G system shall be able to provide a positioning service with 0.2m
horizontal position accuracy,99% availability, and less than 1s latency for
the static UE in a enhanced positioning area outdoor.
The 5G System shall be able to provide a positioning service with a TTFF less
than [10] s
### 5.2.2 Accurate positioning to support Augmented Reality (AR)
#### 5.2.2.1 Description
Augmented reality (AR) goggles and Head-up displays (HUD) superpose contextual
information relating to the user's position and motion on the user's field of
view. AR goggles allow, for instance, the user to navigate, record video,
identify targets and gather information about the surrounding environment for
improved performance. They also allow the user to communicate with other users
by sharing location and sending messages or communicate with those at home
privately or on social media by sharing live video.
AR is enabled by the knowledge of the user's position, motion and eventually,
direction of view, and by access, with low latency, to databases of contextual
information and geo-localized information systems (GIS). All users willing to
interact with each other in an AR application should be equipped and
communicate among each other with low latency.
In the field of LBS, AR supports multiple applications, including outdoor
sports and leisure activities (skiing, motorcycling, sailing, surfing, rally,
aviation and gaming) as well as social networking. Information about the
weather conditions such as strength of wind or depth of snow layer may improve
performance and help prevent dangerous situations such as avalanches. AR may
also support "Blue forces", like firefighters, that need to know real-time
information about the fire such as temperature and severity of smoke, identify
targets, safe location, etc. This area is not covered is the current use case.
At least for gaming and sports applications, the position-related data need to
be secured and protected against tampering to dissuade from any attempt to
fraud or cheat.
#### 5.2.2.2 Pre-conditions
The UE comprises at least a self-powered AR goggles, associated to a 5G
communication module and a 5G positioning module. The 5G modules can be
integrated in the goggles or held by the user and connected to the goggles.
The users have access to the AR Application Server through a 5G Network. The
AR Application Server has access to all relevant contextual information,
including maps of the user's surrounding. Mapping and establishment of
contextual information database are done beforehand.
#### 5.2.2.3 Service Flows
The user turns on the UE, and allows the system to initialise and eventually
calibrate (e.g. heading, field of view).
The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine position,
velocity and goggles heading at a high rate. The frequency of the
determination may vary according to the application requirements. This
information is reported to the AR Application Server to provide the AR goggles
with contextual information.
While moving, the user visualises messages and contextual information on the
screen of the goggle. He can use the navigation feature to find a specific
location or a target, follow a friend or pursue a track (for instance, a ski
track, a route, etc.). He can use the communication feature to find out where
friends or colleagues are and what they want to do next. He can also share
live video to social media, or to a hospital in the case of an emergency.
The user can use the additional information available on the screen of the
goggle to find out where it is best to go next for a safer and more enjoyable
journey. This information can be a weather report, heart rate, steepness of
slopes, altitude, temperature of the surroundings, etc.
#### 5.2.2.4 Post-conditions
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.2.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.2.2.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support AR
applications with [1-3] m horizontal position accuracy, 80% availability, for
static or UE moving at speed below 50km/h outdoor.
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support AR
applications with better than [10] m horizontal position accuracy, 80%
availability, for UE moving at speed up to 130 km/h outdoor.
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support AR
applications with [0.1-3] m vertical position accuracy, 80% availability.

applications with a TTFF less than [10] s.
The 5G system shall be able to fulfil the requirements of the positioning
service using less than [5] % of the UE's power consumption on average and
less than [10] % of the UE's power consumption in the worst case.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related data
against tampering and spoofing.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing
attempts on the position-related data.
The 5G System shall be able to ensure the positioning related data are
secured, and shall allow the protection of the user's privacy.
### 5.2.3 Power saving mechanism of wearable devices
#### 5.2.3.1 Description
Wearable device applications are becoming more and more grateful. Some of the
top wearable device manufacturers are constantly providing new features, such
as smart watches. For some areas, smart watches can replace mobile terminals
to provide basic services, such a tracking, activity monitoring and emergency
messages, especially for minors or the elderly people. Smart terminals focus
on providing location services and provide better positioning and monitoring
functions for these populations. But these wearable devices require higher
power durability.
#### 5.2.3.2 Pre-conditions
Ryder is a minor, and his parents want to monitor his location by a smart
watch. His range of motion is regular but calls for different working point of
the monitoring function:
\- When Ryder is in school, his environment's security is relatively high and
there is less need for continuous monitoring of his location.
\- When Ryder is outside school, in various environment less secured than the
school, it is desirable for his parents to monitor continuously his location.
Ryder wears a smart watch. As a 5G UE, it is equipped with 5G communication
and 5G positioning modules.
\- Wearable devices, such as smart watches, can be accessed into a macro
network or any 5G enabled access network.
\- Intelligent control terminals, such as mobile phones and pad, access to the
same network, and to monitor the location of the selected wearable devices.
They run a monitoring function making them a monitoring terminal.
\- A security range set, Ryder's parents using the monitoring terminal may
access the 5G network and set the security area on the positioning modules.
#### 5.2.3.3 Service Flows
1\. The monitoring terminal (that is an intelligent control terminal) sets one
or several security ranges through the network. The security ranges are stored
in the positioning modules of network.
2\. Ryder enters his school, identified as one of the security range in the
positioning modules of the network. His current location is determined and
available to the network. The smart watch is informed to switch into the
power-saving mode.
3\. The position update rate of the smart watch is reduced, lengthening the
update interval to save power.
4\. Ryder arrives at the school boundary or crosses the boundary. The smart
watch returns to its normal position update rate, according to the network
instruction.
#### 5.2.3.4 Post-conditions
Power normal mode, is that the smart watch provides the nominal positioning
update rate in areas where continuous monitoring is needed, with an update
interval of the position between 1s and 10s. And if the UE is in the normal
mode, the positioning service update is 2m horizontal position accuracy, 99%
availability, and less than 1s latency.
Power saving mode, is that the smart watch switch to power saving mode with
lower update rate when the user is in secured or trusted ranges, with an
update interval of the position between 30s and 300s. By adapting its
positioning update rate to the effective monitoring needs, the smart watch
lengthens its battery lifetime. And if the UE is in the power saving mode, the
positioning service update is 2m horizontal position accuracy, 90%
availability, and less than 1s latency.
The use case could be expanded to other verticals and categories, for instance
e-health for patient tracking, industry for mobile security monitoring, etc.
#### 5.2.3.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None identified.
#### 5.2.3.6 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with 2m horizontal
position accuracy, indoor [1-3] m vertical position accuracy, 90%
availability, and less than 1s latency for the UE in the location power saving
mode.
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with 2m horizontal
position accuracy, indoor [1-3] m vertical position accuracy, 99%
availability, and less than 1s latency for the UE in normal mode.
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide its location
periodically with an update rate ranging from one location every [1s-10s] in
location normal mode to one location every [30s-300s] in location power saving
mode.
The 5G network shall be able to request the UE to provide its location
wherever it is indoor or outdoor.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with TTFF less than
[10] s.
### 5.2.4 Location-based advertising push
#### 5.2.4.1 Description
Data mining has been widely used in OTT (over the top). However, operators do
not have a flexible mechanism to apply location data. People's activity is
regular and causal. According to the records of the UE's location in a period
of time, comfort active areas can be formed. People don\'t want to be bothered
by unnecessary advertisements, except things that are closely related to
themselves in the comfort active areas. Therefore, data analysis based on
human activity location needs to be introduced into location-based advertising
push.
#### 5.2.4.2 Pre-conditions
Users of the 5G network are equipped with 5G communication module, as well as
a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not limited to,
GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems
(TBS), sensors, WLAN, and Bluetooth-based positioning.
In the network, there will be user location analysis equipment. Users of the
5G network periodic send location to the network. Their daily location habits
will be recorded into the analysis equipment. The analysis of equipment will
form a comfortable area of activity.
Operators have business location and advertising information in the comfort
active area.
#### 5.2.4.3 Service Flows
1\. Ryder uses 5G terminals, and often goes to the local supermarket near
home.
2\. He also plays football every week.
3\. And stick to the training centre to learn Spanish.
4\. His locations form the triangle region at the top of these three places.
5\. The network analysis the comfort active area according to his locations
and residence time.
6\. The operator extracts the location and advertising information of shops in
his comfort area based on the analysis of his locations and residence time.
7\. For example, Ryder often stays on the football field. Therefore, the
network extracts the advertising information of some football related stores.
8\. The network pushes him discount information on nearby local supermarkets
and drink price tips for use during the football match in bars in the
neighbourhood.
#### 5.2.4.4 Post-conditions
None identified.
#### 5.2.4.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
None identified.
#### 5.2.4.6 [Potential] Requirements
Subject to regulatory requirements and user consent, the 5G System shall be
able to provide the UE's location information, with less than 3m horizontal
position accuracy, [3 m] vertical position accuracy, over 90% availability,
and less than 1min latency.
### 5.2.5 Flow management in large transportation hubs
#### 5.2.5.1 Description
Airports are getting bigger and busier which calls for efficient flow
management to maximise punctuality to the benefit of passengers and airline
companies. By using a location-based mobile application, the passengers can
easily find their way around, even in unknown airports and in a hurry,
reducing time of transit in the airport and lowering risk of delays and missed
connections. In the eventuality of work or maintenance performed in the
passengers' halls, the application will propose alternative routes to
passengers.
Airline companies can be informed, by the airport and the application server,
of their passengers' situation in near real-time: they can use the information
to optimise their embarking operations and reduce risk for last minutes call
to gate, flight delays because of one passenger, etc.
Using passengers' location information, the airport will be able to elaborate
statistics on passengers flow to optimise their organisation and signalling to
passenger.
By extension, the use case may encompasses applications for any transportation
hub (metro or rail station, etc.) facing large passenger flows, connection and
transit time issues.
#### 5.2.5.2 Pre-conditions
The passenger has a UE equipped with 5G communication modules, and 5G
positioning module.
The passenger downloads a mobile application to his UE allowing him to find
the quickest way to the gate, define a transit route accounting for his
personal needs and matters (shopping, lunch, etc.) as well as for the need to
proceed with security controls.
The application server has access to all relevant contextual information,
including a map of the airport, flight information, and estimates transit time
between different locations in the airport, including waiting time of security
lines.
Mapping and establishment of contextual information database are done
beforehand and updated in near-real time with the information reported by the
users.
#### 5.2.5.3 Service Flows
1\. The passenger turns on the application as he reaches the airport.
2\. The application will suggest an itinerary to the gate of departure
depending on preferences of the passenger (as quickly as possible, as little
walking as possible, wheelchair friendly, shopping friendly, etc.).
3\. The passenger will be notified of the estimated time to reach the gate, if
there is a change of gate, time of departure or congestion or queues in some
areas. The application will suggest a new route if relevant. The information
in the application is provided in the language of preference of the passenger.
4\. The passenger can use the app to find specific locations in the airport
such as information desks, bathrooms, elevators, restaurants, shops, taxis,
etc.
5\. Based on the location of the passenger, the app can mark an alert if he is
short of time and needs to proceed to the gate immediately.
6\. In real time, airport and airlines operations are notified if passengers
are delayed within their transit into the airport, or if they face risk of
being delayed (security control, shopping, etc.). They have access to
estimations of the expected time the passenger will need to reach gate
(considering its effective position and real time flow estimation). They can
use the information to organise individual call to gate (last minute calls,
etc.) and make the overall flow more fluent.
#### 5.2.5.4 Post-conditions
Passengers can get to their gates more quickly, which reduces time of transit
and time of travel in general. This will reduce delays, improve customer
experience and optimise airport operations.
Airport authority and airline companies optimise their operations thanks to
low management and improve their punctuality and efficiency.

[0.1] Hz in a enhanced positioning area, primarily indoor.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with TTFF less than
[10] s.
The 5G System shall be able to ensure the protection and the privacy of the
user's position-related data.

## 5.3 Industry and eHealth related use cases
### 5.3.1 Person and medical equipment location in hospitals
#### 5.3.1.1 Description
In some hospitals like psychiatry or geriatrics, it is necessary to locate the
patients in real time on the site of the hospitals (indoor and outdoor) and to
notify the medical staff if the patients reach a non-authorised area in order
to avoid runaway patients.
Additionally, it is necessary to locate caregivers and medical equipment (e.g.
crash cart), especially in emergency situations.
It is necessary to take into account the environment of hospitals: some are
made up of several buildings on several hectares with large green areas and
others are buildings of several floors and basements.
#### 5.3.1.2 Pre-conditions
The patient wears a device, e.g. a wrist-band which supports some mechanisms
to obtain its location, as part of a 5G positioning module. The caregiver
carries a mobile phone or tablet. The medical equipment has a built-in 5G
positioning module. It is assumed that the 5G positioning module is linked to
a communication module together forming a UE. The positioning module can use a
combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. The positioning
module and related communication module have to be able to operate with very
low energy consumption, given that the device in which it is used (e.g.
patient worn wrist band) may have very limited battery and form factor.
NOTE: the hospital can be considered an enhanced positioning area.
#### 5.3.1.3 Service Flows
The UE enables the 3GPP system to determine its current location in a periodic
or an event-triggered manner. The frequency of the location reporting may
change according to the application requirements.
The UE reports location information that may include its applicable Equipment
Identity. At any time, upon request, the UE shall be able to report its
location information.
External systems can provide additional information to the Hospital System in
order to improve location accuracy of a UE.
In case of periodic location reporting, the Hospital System supervises the
continuous supply of the location information.
The received location information is stored by Hospital System.
#### 5.3.1.4 Post-conditions
The location information of the person or medical equipment is available in
the Hospital System.
#### 5.3.1.5 Potential Requirements
The UE shall be able to provide its location to the Hospital System.
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide its location.
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide its location
periodically.
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to stop providing its location
periodically.
The 5G System shall be able to handle additional location information from
other external sources.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a horizontal
accuracy less than [3 m], a vertical accuracy less than [2 m] (i.e. floor
accurate), an availability over [99%] and a latency lower than [1 minute]. The
environment of use for the provision of the service shall be both indoor
(including underground) and outdoor within the boundaries of the Hospital.
The 5G System shall support positioning of UEs using very little energy
consumption on the UE.
NOTE1: the solution should consider UEs with limited form factor, limited CPU
power, limited peak power, and limited radio access technology support (e.g.
eMTC type communication only).
NOTE2: The aforementioned potential requirements do not preclude whether the
position is computed in the UE or elsewhere in the 5G System (e.g. core
network). Indeed, the determination of the UE's position or location requires
the UE to transmit some information (e.g. position, OTDOA measurements made on
PRS, some signal allowing the UE's identification and UTDOA measurements in
the nodes, etc.) which refers to position-related data.
### 5.3.2 Patient location outside hospitals
#### 5.3.2.1 Description
In some hospitals like psychiatry or geriatrics, it is necessary to locate the
patients in real time to notify the medical staff if the patient reaches a
non-authorised area in order to avoid runaway patients.
When a patient manages to leave the hospital without authorisation, it is
necessary to locate him (in a city and in rural area) in order to bring him
back to the hospital.
Additionally, ambulatory patients with a potentially critical condition (e.g.
cardiac, diabetes, high-risk pregnancy), as well as frail elderly, need to be
localized in case their condition gets critical (e.g. elderly falling).
#### 5.3.2.2 Pre-conditions
The patient wears a device containing a 5G communication module, and a 5G
positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies. The patient's wearable device should
have a battery life of at least several days.
#### 5.3.2.3 Service Flows
The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine its current
location in a periodic or an event-triggered manner. The frequency of the
location reporting may change according to the application requirements.
The 5G positioning module reports location information that may include its
applicable Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request, the 5G positioning
module shall be able to report its location information.
External systems can provide additional information to the Hospital System in
order to improve location accuracy of a 5G positioning module.
In case of periodic location reporting, the Hospital System supervises the
continuous supply of the location information.
Hospital System stores the received location information.
#### 5.3.2.4 Post-conditions
The medical staff localizes the patient.
#### 5.3.2.5 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a horizontal
accuracy less than [10] m both indoors and outdoors. Furthermore, for indoors,
the 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a vertical
accuracy sufficiently accurate to determine the floor, so typically less than
[3] m. This localization accuracy needs to be achieved throughout the 5G
positioning service area.
### 5.3.3 Trolley location in factories
#### 5.3.3.1 Description
Factories use mobile trolleys and it is necessary to monitor their location
and track the movement of these trolleys.
It is necessary to take into account the environment of factories: buildings
have several floors and may have deep basement, some factories are made up of
several buildings distributed over several hectares (e.g. campus with large
green areas, trees, etc.). In addition, factories may be spread over several
sites in vicinity.
In addition, exchanges of trolleys between factories are possible, and this
includes exchanges between international locations: it shall therefore be
ensured that the monitoring may be enabled in multiple locations, including in
different countries.
#### 5.3.3.2 Pre-conditions
The trolleys are equipped with 5G communication modules, smart lock as well as
a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies.
#### 5.3.3.3 Service Flows
The 5G system shall be able to determine the current location of the UE in a
periodic or an event-triggered manner. The frequency of the location reporting
may change according to the application requirements. The 5G communication
module reports location information that may include its applicable Equipment
Identity. At any time, upon request, the 5G communication modules shall be
able to report its location information.
External systems can provide additional information to the Factory System in
order to improve location accuracy of 5G modules.
In case of periodic location reporting, the Factory System supervises the
continuous supply of the location information.
The Factory System stores the received location information.
#### 5.3.3.4 Post-conditions
The location information for the connected trolley is always accessible in the
Factory System.
#### 5.3.3.5 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with [50] cm
horizontal position accuracy, [1-3] m vertical position accuracy, and less
than [20] ms latency for the moving UE at the speed of [50] km/hour indoor,
taking into account at least a service area from [1 000 to 100 000] mÂ².
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service in case of roaming.
### 5.3.4 Waste Management & Collection
#### 5.3.4.1 Description
Cities and urban population are expending and growing generating more and more
waste to be managed and collected. Traditionally, waste collection was
organized on fixed schedules through a given route, whether containers were
full, partially full or even empty.
In order to reduce costs as well as to reduce drastically the impacts on the
environment, municipalities are required to have smarter waste collection and
management which is more efficient and optimize in particular the collection
route.
Residential bins are including sensors that can signal when they need to be
emptied. The routes taken by waste collection vehicles can then be optimised
accordingly.
The connected bins can be configured to only send a message when they are full
or to send updates once a day or even on a more regular basis (typically every
2 hours which could be configurable to 3h, 6h...). This allows for the
reduction in number of vehicles needed for waste collection and thereby curbs
greenhouse gas emissions. The sensors can also detect fires in the bins and
send an alarm accordingly.
Trucks and vehicles in charge of the waste collection are equipped with
positioning technology and can be send based on dedicated route to collect
only the bins that have to be collected. In particular cases, some of these
vehicles equipped to handle particular waste can be easily diverted to address
urgent needs.
Furthermore, there are more and more waste containers not only for residential
use but as well for use for retail stores, restaurants, hotels, etc. and other
uses such as construction or building sites. For this particular case, very
often these containers are not on a regular position and are moved to new site
as soon as they are not needed anymore in their previous site. Companies that
are managing many waste containers need then to know where are their
containers to be able to re-allocate them when their use for a particular need
is done.
#### 5.3.4.2 Pre-conditions
The waste bins and containers are equipped with a UE including a 5G
communication module, as well as a 5G positioning module. This location
equipment supports some mechanisms to allow the 5G System to determine the
bin's (or container's) position either on demand or on a regular basis.
The waste collection vehicles are equipped with on-board unit including a 5G
communication module, as well as a 5G positioning module.
The two aforementioned positioning modules can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies such as GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo,
GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors, WLAN, and
Bluetooth-based positioning.
The 5G system is interfaced to an application server (e.g. Waste Management
and Collection System).
#### 5.3.4.3 Service Flows
The waste collection teams prepare their work plan. For that, they download
information from the Waste Management and Collection System, these includes
information relating to the waste bins and containers under their
responsibility and supposed to be located in their area of work: filling
percentage, most recent use (e.g. bin opening and evolution of filling
following opening), position (or most recent positions log)
The Waste Management and Collection System determines whether the bins needs
to be collected (it is full, it is expected to be full within the week, it is
not full, but is rarely filled, therefore content may degrade and generate
inconvenience to the neighbourhood: bad smell, animals trying to get bins
content, etc.).
It also identifies a few container with waste requiring some specific handling
as per regulation. The Waste Management and Collection System checks the
identification and location of the container to verify if these are in line
with regulation, and to check if owner is indeed complying with regulation.
If a bin or container is identified in the wrong place, the Waste Management
and Collection System reports the incident, and notifies its owner to dissuade
him from using the bin beyond its purpose. The Waste Management and Collection
System may consider charging more the owner.
Knowing the bins and container to be collected, as well as the estimation of
waste, the Waste Management and Collection System can determine the optimal
work plan for the collect: number of vehicles involved, their trajectory, as
well as their size and type tailored to the quantity and type of waste to be
collected.
With the plan established, the team start the collect. They follow the
scheduled work plan and route, guided in this thanks to the trucks position
which is also determined by the 5G System
During the collect, a container equipped to report its status with low latency
reports to the System it needs to be emptied. As its location is nearby the
route of one of the collect vehicles, the Waste Management and Collection
System updates the work plan, informs the vehicle and team (through the on-
board unit) of the update. The team reroutes itself in due time to consider
the new container to be collected.
#### 5.3.4.4 Post-conditions
The bin or waste containers are collected only when relevant. The collection
vehicles collect only the relevant bins or containers, and are guided towards
these by the Waste Management and Collection System with an optimised route.
The waste collection process is more efficient and this benefits to all
stakeholders.
#### 5.3.4.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.3.4.6 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G System shall be able to determine the position of the UEs (bin, waste
container) as well as the on-board units (waste collection vehicles) and
report these positions to an application server (e.g. Waste Management and
Collection system).
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE (bin/waste container) to provide
its location.
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE (bin/waste container) to provide
its location periodically with an update rate ranging from one location every
[2 hours] to one location every [several days].
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a horizontal
accuracy less than 3m, a vertical accuracy less than 2m, an availability over
[99%] and a latency lower than 1 minute. The environment of use for the
provision of the service shall be both outdoor (main use) and indoor
(including underground parking...).
The 5G system shall be able to fulfil the requirement of the positioning
service without affecting the UE's battery overall lifetime by more than [5] %
(e.g. 9 months out of a total of 15 years' lifetime).
### 5.3.5 Support to accurate and reliable handling of containers
#### 5.3.5.1 Description
Products are transported mainly in containers and autonomous container
management is becoming more and more frequent. Containers are stored in varied
places as ships, docks or factories. In order to take up as little space as
possible, they are stacked on several level and/or floors.
In addition to the possibility of locating them, it is very useful to have
information the location on the container of the reference point used for
their location, to determine the attitude or bearing of bearing of the
container as well as to acces information on their size (width, height, depth
among the possible standards). This then helps their autonomous handling and
also allows a better spatial representation of the 3D arrangement of
containers on a storage site. The containers doors must be well oriented in
any case and this orientation must be known by the handling system.
In addition, containers are often handled in challenging environments for
positioning technologies (For example, the high density of containers in
harbour or on board ships, the way they are stacked, etc. create many
obstructions for radio waves used by most positioning technologies). It is
therefore relevant to consider the use of multiple sensors, sometime of
different positioning technologies, to allow the system to enhance positioning
performances like accuracy, availability even in complex situation.
A minimum of two sensors is needed in order to identify the direction of the
container. Two or more sensors enable measurement diversity which can in turn
improve availability and reliability of the measurements when the containers
are located in harsh conditions for wireless systems (e.g. when they are
stacked).
#### 5.3.5.2 Pre-conditions
The containers are equipped with 5G communication modules, smart lock as well
as a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of
3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies, involving multiple sensors. For
different reason, including accommodation of physical constraints, protection
against shock, and others, these sensors are distributed in different places
on the containers. A minimum of two sensors is needed to determine the
position and the heading of the container.
The 5G System knows the position of the different sensors placed on a
container involved in the determination of both the position and the heading.
The Factory System knows the relative position of the sensors involved in the
determination of both the position and the heading.
The Factory System knows the dimension of the container.
#### 5.3.5.3 Service Flows
Container C reaches an intermodal node by rail and needs to be stored for a
while before being transborded on a cargo ship. This handling involves some
automatic operation managed by the Factory System, using among other inputs,
the position and the heading of the container.
Multiple positioning sensors distributed on container C are activated and
enable the 5G System to collect the associated position-related data. The 5G
system combines these information to determine the position and the
orientation of the container C. The 5G system can also combine data from
different sensors and technologies in order to enhance the overall
performances of the positioning service (accuracy, availability in harsh
environments, reliability, etc.).
The 5G system provides all information concerning the container C (positioning
sensors and their reference) to the Factory System.
The Factory System, according information stored in its database (size,
relative position of the different sensors on the container) can determine the
exact 3D position to manage the container C's handling operations.
#### 5.3.5.4 Post-conditions
Thanks to the high-quality position and heading data provided by the 5G
System, the Factory System was able to handle the container from the wagon to
its storing location, on top of three other containers, with minimal shocks
and risk of hazards.
The information provided by the 5G System relating to the different sensors
placed on the container allows the Factory System to mane them and to
determine the exact 3D position of the container.
#### 5.3.5.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.3.5.6 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G Sytem shall be able to determine relative positioning of one UE versus
another UE, in order to determine the heading of an object carrying the UEs.
The 5G system can combine data from different technologies in order to enhance
the overall performances of the positioning service (accuracy, availability in
complex environments, reliability, etc.).
The 5G System shall be able to provide the relative positioning of UEs to an
application server.
The 5G system shall be able to provide this complementary information in case
of roaming.
## 5.4 Emergency and Mission Critical related use cases
### 5.4.1 Accurate positioning for emergency services
#### 5.4.1.1 Description
An emergency service enables a user to contact a Public Safety Answering Point
(PSAP) and requires the emergency services user/UE to have accurate
positioning such that they may be located and offered aid by first responders.
The level of positioning accuracy (and other KPIs) required is dependent upon
local and regional regulatory requirements.
This service offers the citizens within a jurisdiction to be located in the
time of need and requires high accuracy UE positioning in all service areas,
including those that could potentially be challenging for some positioning
technologies (e.g. urban canyons, indoors).
#### 5.4.1.2 Pre-conditions
Tom experiences or witnesses an emergency situation (e.g. fire, accident,
medical emergency).
Tom has a UE equipped with 5G communication module, as well as a 5G
positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not limited to,
GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems
(TBS), sensors, WLAN, and Bluetooth-based positioning.
The 5G communication system includes an interface to a PSAP to dispatch first
responder(s).
#### 5.4.1.3 Service Flows
1\. Tom detects an emergency situation and dials/contacts the emergency number
for his region. This may initiate a call, video or messaging service to a
local PSAP.
2\. The 5G system initiates a positioning function, without user intervention,
with 3-dimentional position accuracy according to local regulatory
requirements (including minimal e.g. latency and other KPIs).
3\. Tom communicates his emergency situation with the PSAP.
4\. The PSAP dispatches first responders to Tom's location, where the first
responders are given a 3-Dimensional position and confidence for his location.
5\. Tom completes his emergency communication with the PSAP.
#### 5.4.1.4 Post-conditions
The location information of the UE is available in the PSAP and the first
responder.
#### 5.4.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
N/A
#### 5.4.1.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with three-
dimensional position accuracy and associated KPI targets, determined by
regulatory agencies (e.g. FCC), as follows:
\- Accuracy [\ 95%]
\- Environment of use: indoor and outdoor
NOTE 1: The aforementioned requirements are based on FCC benchmarks to be met
around by 2020/2021. These may change in the future, as the ultimate goal of
the regulatory agencies is to get to sufficient accuracy to determine 'which
door to knock on' in an office or apartment building.
NOTE 2: The aforementioned requirements are meant throughout the 5G
positioning service area.
NOTE 3: The vertical positioning requirement should be sufficiently accurate
to determine the floor.
The 5G System shall support the UE to provide the positioning methods used in
calculating the position and the associated uncertainty/confidence of the
position.
The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide location information
(e.g. measurements, position) with some periodicity as necessary.
The 5G system shall be able to determine the reliability of the positioning
information.
### 5.4.2 Accurate Positioning for First Responders
#### 5.4.2.1 Description
Accurately locating a first responder who is injured or incapacitated during
mission critical operations has long been a goal of public safety. A mission
critical service such as MCPTT enables a first responder to stay in contact
with other first responders as well as dispatch and command/control. Mission
Critical Organizations require mission critical services to have accurate
positioning such that first responders may be located at all times during
normal and critical operations. The level of positioning accuracy (and other
KPIs) required is much more stringent than that required by local and regional
regulatory requirements for commercial users.
This location service offers first responders to be located in emergency
situations and requires high accuracy UE positioning in all service areas,
including those that could potentially be challenging for some positioning
technologies (e.g. indoors).
#### 5.4.2.2 Pre-conditions
The ESA One Fire Department is dispatched to a report of a building fire in an
apartment complex. Three engines arrive to find thick smoke has risen into the
building from a fire on a lower floor, requiring all floors of the apartment
complex to be evacuated. Several residents are suffering from smoke inhalation
and are in need of medical treatment
The ESA One battalion chief establishes an Incident Command System and assigns
incoming firefighters to separate operational groups, including "fire attack",
"evacuation" and "medical operations". Each operational team uses a separate
MCPTT group to coordinate their actions. There are also additional MCPTT
groups to support communications between the group leaders and the incident
commander.
Each fire-fighter has a UE equipped with a 5G communication module, as well as
a 5G positioning module. In addition, the UEs of the ESA One Fire Department
are configured to initiate an Emergency Alert when a connected man-down
accessory detects an abnormal condition.
#### 5.4.2.3 Service Flows
1\. Members of the fire attack and evacuation groups enter the building to
fight the fire and coordinate the evacuation.
2\. The Incident Command System displays the location of each fire-fighter
within the building.
3\. While searching for trapped residents, fire-fighter McJanky is overcome by
heat and smoke, and collapses.
4\. McJanky\'s man-down accessory attached to his MCPTT UE detects the
abnormal condition (i.e. lack of movement, a horizontal tilt, or both) and
notifies the MCPTT UE.
5\. The MCPTT UE, in conjunction with the 5G system initiates a positioning
function, without user intervention, with 3-dimensional position accuracy and
other KPIs (e.g. minimal latency).
6\. The MCPTT UE sends an Emergency Alert with man-down indication to the
Incident Command System. The Emergency Alert contains his precise location
within the building.
7\. The Emergency Alert with precise location is also distributed to other
members of his group.
8\. The ESA One battalion chief sees the Alert and coordinates the rescue.
Other fire-fighters are able to locate McJanky quickly and they take him out
of the building to the emergency medical team. McJanky is revived and lives to
tell the story.
#### 5.4.2.4 Post-conditions
The precise location information of each fire-fighter UE continues to be
available in the Incident Command System.
#### 5.4.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
Mission Critical Services such as MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData and MCX UEs
require access to the 5G positioning function.
#### 5.4.2.6 Potential Requirements
For outdoor location the 5G System shall provide a positioning service with
three-dimensional position accuracy and associated KPI targets required by
mission critical organizations as follows:
\- Accuracy \ [98%]
For indoor location the 5G System shall provide a positioning service with
three-dimensional position accuracy and associated KPI targets required by
mission critical organizations as follows:
\- Accuracy \ [95%]
NOTE: Both absolute position and relative position can be used to meet the
accuracy requirements based on operational needs.
The 5G System shall enable an MCX UE to use the positioning service to
calculate its position with the associated uncertainty/confidence of the
position.
The 5G System shall provide a mechanism to request an MCX UE to provide

periodicity.
The 5G System shall provide a mechanism to request that an MCX UE provides an
immediate location report.
The 5G System shall provide a mechanism to request an MCX UE to provide an
event-triggered location report. The 5G system shall be able to determine the
reliability of the positioning information
### 5.4.3 Alerting nearby emergency responders
#### 5.4.3.1 Description
In case of a medical emergency, all qualified individuals within close
vicinity of the victim get alerted via their phones with a request to provide
urgent care. The qualified individuals will often be layman volunteers (i.e.
not medical professionals) with a training in first aid, such as applying CPR
(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) and using an AED (Automatic External
Defibrillator) on a patient with SCA (Sudden Cardiac Arrest). For example, in
the Netherlands, a layman responder network of 170,000 volunteers (\~1% of the
general population) has been equipped with an App to provide emergency care to
provide timely response to SCA. In this case, every second counts and help
should be provided within 6 minutes.
> NOTE: The scenario intended to cover in this use case does not exclude UEs
> supporting V2X applications. For example, in suburb or rural areas, a UE
> carrying a passenger or driver under emergency situation can get connected
> to nearby UE(s) supporting V2X applications so that the nearby qualified
> individual in that vehicle can immediately take necessary actions as an
> emergency responder using the related location information.
The purpose of this use case is to improve the localization of the emergency
responders closest to the victim, in order to safeguard the quickest
availability of care. The main requirements are to have a robust solution that
works both indoors and outdoors, that is scalable to large numbers of
responders and that maximizes privacy of the (layman) responders (i.e. no
continuous tracking).
#### 5.4.3.2 Pre-conditions
Paul and Sonia are layman responders trained in CPR/AED. They are registered
to the layman responder network and have installed the layman responder App on
their respective phones. Their phones are equipped with a 5G positioning
module. This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies and
non-3GPP technologies such as GNSS (e.g. Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS),
terrestrial beacons (e.g. Bluetooth, RFID, TBS), dead-reckoning sensors, etc.
#### 5.4.3.3 Service Flows
1\. Joe, a 68 years old retired teacher is in reasonable health. One
particular day, Joe visits the mall. While walking through the mall, he
suddenly experiences chest pain and drops on the floor.
2\. Mary, sees Joe dropping, kneels by him and notices he's unconscious. She
immediately calls 911 and explains an elderly man grabbed his chest in pain,
suddenly dropped on the floor and remains unconscious.
3\. Andy, the 911 call center agent taking Mary's call, suspects SCA and
initiates the layman responder network.
4\. Mary's location -- as determined by her phone (see use case 5.4.1
"Accurate positioning for emergency services") -- is automatically forwarded
to the layman responder network, which notices two qualified layman first
responders in Mary's (Joe's) immediate vicinity, Paul and Sonia. Also, an
ambulance from the nearby hospital is directed to the scene.
5\. Paul, who's just one floor away from Joe gets an instant notification on
his phone from the layman responder App, indicating that a possible cardiac
arrest victim is in need of his help. He confirms his willingness to help, by
clicking "Accept Call" in the App and is guided towards Joe by his phone.
6\. Sonia, who's on the other side of the mall, but in close vicinity of an
AED, also gets and instant notification on her phone and also she confirms.
After this she is directed towards the nearest AED (see use case 5.4.3
"Emergency equipment location outside hospitals"). She then picks up the AED
and heads for Joe.
7\. Paul arrives first on the scene, notices that Joe has no pulse and starts
administering CPR.
8\. Sonia arrives a little bit later with the AED and together they apply the
AED.
9\. Joe's heart starts beating again and ten minutes later the ambulance
arrives to take Joe to the hospital.
#### 5.4.3.4 Post-conditions
Joe lives, because the nearest by layman responders get notified instantly.
#### 5.4.3.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
What's called for is a location-aware group messaging service, that is
scalable to very large groups of responders nationwide and that avoids
continuous tracking of individuals. This will require an interplay of various
network features and elements, specifically also because the service needs to
work across different operator networks. Also the division of functionality
between the network and the application remains to be determined.
#### 5.4.3.6 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G system (in conjunction with the layman responder network) shall be
enabled to alert the group of [\~ 10] potential responders with shortest
travel time to the victim, scanned from a radius of [5 km] from the victim.
This requires localization of each responder with a horizontal resolution of
less than [50 m] and, indoors, a vertical resolution sufficiently accurate to
determine the floor, so typically less than [3 m]. This localization accuracy
needs to be achieved throughout the 5G positioning service area.
The 5G system shall not perform continuous tracking of each layman responder
to respect his/her privacy.
The 5G system shall be scalable to address the positioning of at least [5%] of
all subscribers being registered to the layman responder service.
The 5G system shall work across boundaries of individual operator networks in
the region.
### 5.4.4 Emergency equipment location outside hospitals
#### 5.4.4.1 Description
Life-saving medical equipment, such as AED's, deployed throughout public and
private spaces can be localized instantly in case of need, to be able to take
the equipment within the minimum possible amount of time to an emergency
scene. This use case is about knowing for sure where the equipment actually
is, rather than where it is supposed to be, and making sure it does not get
lost, i.e. it is about maintaining an up-to-date location database of all
equipment deployed throughout a region or a nation.
This use case is related to use case 5.4.2 "Alerting nearby emergency
responders".
#### 5.4.4.2 Pre-conditions
The equipment (AED) is connected to the 5G network for maintenance purposes
(e.g. checking battery-level) and also provided with a 5G positioning module.
This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies and
non-3GPP technologies such as GNSS (e.g. Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS) and
terrestrial beacons (e.g. Bluetooth, RFID, TBS).
The equipment uses the 5G positioning module to provide regular updates of its
actual location to the AED positioning system (e.g. at least each time motion
is detected an update should be provided). The AED positioning system
maintains a location database of all AED's deployed throughout a region or a
nation. The layman responder app/system (as mentioned in Section 5.4.2) has
access to the AED positioning system.
The equipment can be located either indoor or outdoor.
#### 5.4.4.3 Service Flows
1\. Sonia, a lady who is subscribed to the layman responder network, has
received and accepted a call for help to resuscitate Joe, an elderly man
experiencing Sudden Cardiac Arrest.
2\. The layman responder network app (or system) interrogates the AED
positioning system which maintains an up-to-date location database of AED's,
and determines the closest AED on the way between Sonia's current location (as
determined by her 5G phone) and the location of the victim in need for help
and informs the layman responder App on Sonia's 5G phone of this location.
3\. Sonia's 5G phone computes the quickest way to the AED.
4\. Sonia follows the instructions on her 5G phone and picks up the AED.
5\. After picking up the AED, the AED wakes up from its sleep mode, connect to
the network. The AED positioning module is activated and position updates are
provided the AED positioning system.
6\. Sonia heads for Joe following instructions on here phone and applies the
AED on Joe.
7\. After usage, the AED positioning system receives several updates to the
AED's position before it is put back on its original place.
8\. Once put back, the AED enters sleep mode for an extended period of time,
and wakes up only once per week/month to connect to the network.
#### 5.4.4.4 Post-conditions
Joe lives, because an accurate record can be maintained with the location of
critical equipment (AED).
#### 5.4.4.5 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a horizontal
accuracy less than [10 m] and, indoors, with a vertical accuracy sufficiently
accurate to determine the floor, so typically less than [3 m]. This
localization accuracy needs to be achieved throughout the 5G positioning
service area.
The 5G System shall allow UEs to sleep for extended periods of time (e.g. one
week), without requiring the UE to update its position data.
The 5G system shall allow UEs to trigger a different update rate of the
position data based on whether the UE is moving or not.
## 5.5 Road-related use cases
### 5.5.1 Accurate positioning to support Traffic Monitoring, Management and
Control
#### 5.5.1.1 Description
This use case describes the traffic monitoring, management and control
services supervised by a regional/local authority that has the objective to
optimise traffic flow when needed and provide feedback to road users to make
traffic more fluent.
NOTE: This use case is not intended to utilize the 3GPP sidelink interface.
Possible ways of collecting location fixes of vehicles of interest and
notifying lane-management information/instruction are based on Uu-interface.
Decision relating to traffic monitoring and control, congestion and access to
some areas for some vehicle (parking, access to city centre) are becoming more
complex due to more intensive use of lane management techniques in the future
by highway operators. Currently the traffic monitoring relies primarily on
video surveillance, Priorities and rules applications to roads and lanes are
mostly static, or may be, in some cases, updated in real time with information
panels on gantries.
As traffic increase, lane choices and priorities become more complex (more
diversity in vehicles types and regulations, vehicle automation levels
increase, time-varying priorities for different type of vehicles, incentive to
use low energy vehicles or car-sharing), some level of decision support
assistance will be required. This use cases address a more dynamic
implementation, complementing video surveillance monitoring with positioning-
related data determined involving the 5G system.
The Traffic Management Server (TMS) will monitor the traffic in real time,
processing information reported messages transmitted by vehicles and video
surveillance installed at key points along roads. Depending on the traffic
situation, planned public work, need for emergency route, etc. the Traffic
Management Server (TMS) will send message to vehicles via the 5G network to
give them guidance and updates. For instance, some of the vehicles might be
requested to maintain the lane they are on others might be asked to change to
other lane due to various reasons (crowded lane, vehicle class not allowed on
the current lane etc.). Traffic management will monitor vehicles at the level
of lane, this and therefore need to reference any positioning information to
the map of the infrastructure (roads, lanes) and manage the vehicles'
positioning information over multiple road segments and long distance. It is
also necessary to be able to distinguish superposed road segments and lanes
(typically bridges, large highway crossings, etc.). This use case therefore
needs both horizontal and vertical absolute positioning. 3GPP TS 22.186
v15.2.0 defines relative positioning requirements, primarily for platooning.
In the case where relative positioning information is transposed into absolute
3D positioning information using LTE positioning technologies, the resulting
accuracy would not be sufficient for the proposed use case.
To satisfy the use cases, the vehicle position needs to be determined with an
accuracy able to identify the lane the vehicle is using.
The TMS collects data received (user location, crash alert, driving speed,
etc.) from the road traffic participants in the areas it is covering, provides
traffic guidance to road users and modifies rules and priorities applicable to
the different lanes. The TMS uses the position-related data to check that the
drivers are indeed applying the new rules and priorities. The positioning-
related data provided to the TMS by the UE and/or the System (e.g. vehicle
location, speed, heading, etc.) need to be trustworthy and/or allow the TMS to
investigate and check their trustworthiness. For instance, Users (and third
parties) should not be able to fraud the TMS' control by tampering the
positioning-related data, for example, to drive on a newly unauthorised lane.
#### 5.5.1.2 Pre-conditions
The vehicle is equipped with a 5G communication module and a 5G positioning
module. These modules can be integrated in the smartphone of the vehicle's
user. The positioning module provides vehicle position, velocity and time
information. This positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not limited to,
GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems
(TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and sensors, eventually complemented with data
to enhance these technologies.
A regional TMS exists and is connected to a 5G Network. The TMS is used by
relevant local authorities and overlooks only regional/local geographic areas
and has the role of ensuring proper lane management according to the changing
traffic conditions.
Environments: outdoors and indoors (tunnels), within 5G positioning service
area.
#### 5.5.1.3 Service Flows
The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine its current
location at a high rate. The frequency of the location reporting may change
according to the application requirements.
The 5G positioning module reports location information, velocity and heading
to other vehicles and infrastructure (Road Side Unit). At any time, the 5G
positioning module shall be able to report its location information. The TMS
has access to velocity information with a certain accuracy e.g. less than [1]
m/s.
The Server advises for changing lanes, checks if user is allowed to be in a
lane, recommends staying in the lane, etc.
#### 5.5.1.4 Post-conditions
The vehicle's users benefit from optimized flow management, up to date
information on the traffic, and will always drive on the correct lane.
TMS collects and aggregates traffic info at lane level and allows road
operator to optimise road management (lane) to avoid congestions and improve
the traffic flow. However, at no point the TMS would know from which vehicle
(or user) this information came from and will not disclose to 3rd parties any
position -- related data provided by road users.
#### 5.5.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
#### 5.5.1.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a horizontal
accuracy of [1] m across-track and [3] m along-track for UE speed up to the
maximum speed authorized on highways (e.g. [130-160] km/h).
NOTE: The use case is intended to support applications that performs tasks of
monitoring and reporting the effective traffic's density at lane level, but it
does not involve Safety-of-Life or critical operations (such as those in
autonomous vehicles). To identify the lane a vehicle (of variable width: car,
truck or motorbike) is using, the positioning service should have an accuracy
better than half the lane's width, accounting for some margin and the
uncertainty on the width of the vehicle and the place where the position
sensor is on the vehicle. The lane width is typically in the range of 3 -- 4 m
and the margin does not need to be tight (because it is not a critical
application), therefore, a target accuracy of 1m seems reasonable to detect
lane.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a vertical
accuracy of [2.5] m for speed up to the maximum speed authorized on highways
(e.g. [130-160] km/h).
NOTE: Vertical separation of superposed roads may be as low as 5 meters. The
position sensors may be distributed in various places of the vehicles,
including on the upper part of the vehicle or on the roof, hence more than one
meter above the road level. This may vary significantly from one type of
vehicle to the other. To allow the system to distinguish between two vehicles
moving on superposed road, each with position sensors in different places, a
vertical accuracy in the range 2.5m seems a reasonable target.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with an
availability of [95] %.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a TTFF less
than [10] s.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with an update rate
of [10] Hz.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a latency of
less than [30] ms.
The 5G System shall be able to ensure the positioning-related data are
secured.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related data
against tampering and spoofing.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering attempts on the
position-related data and spoofing.
The 5G System shall be able to support the protection of the UE's privacy.
### 5.5.2 Road-User Charging (RUC)
#### 5.5.2.1 Description
Road-User Charging (RUC) defines generic services monitoring a vehicles
position (and/or motion) with the aim of levying a charge or a tax on the
vehicle's user, based on the way the road infrastructure is used by the user.
It may apply to any kind of road (local and national network, motorways and
can be expanded to access control to urban areas or parking) and may target
all kinds of vehicle, primarily:
\- Personal vehicles, for applications such as Pay-as-you-drive (PyD) such as
insurance and car as a service, management of traffic congestion and incentive
for certain vehicle energy or car-sharing (dissuade use of low occupancy
vehicles on high occupancy lanes, etc.)
\- Professional vehicles, for applications such as road tolling (based on
distance, time, type of vehicle and freight, period of day or week,
availability of alternative multimodal transports schemes, etc.)
Originally, RUC services relied on static, rigid implementations, either
access control to road (tolling booth) or annual fees (insurances) and taxes
per vehicles. The development of LBS technologies allows the implementation of
dynamic and highly flexible RUC services: an On-board Unit (OBU) enables the
determination of the vehicle's position and motion (e.g. velocity or velocity
profile) and reports this information to the RUC system (for instance, a
regional or national processing facility). The latter applies RUC algorithms
to establish the fee to be charged. The RUC algorithms may be adapted to
evolving needs and applications, expand the coverage in terms of the charged
road and conditions without the need to deploy new infrastructure like
tollbooth, gantries, etc. The RUC algorithms may also apply different charging
strategies according to traffic condition (congestion, period of day), lane
occupancy or priorities (priority vehicle, incentive for car sharing,
management of specific freight or hazardous materials, etc.), velocity
profile. Consequently, the position-related data should be accurate enough to
determine the position of the vehicle at lane level and to determine the
vehicle's velocity with good accuracy.
The positioning-related data provided to the RUC Application Server need to be
fully trustworthy: reliability, integrity, high confidence level and
protection against tampering are key aspects for any RUC service. Users (and
third parties) should not be able to fraud the RUC Application Server by
tampering the positioning-related data in order to avoid application of the
charges.
#### 5.5.2.2 Pre-conditions
The user or the user's vehicle is equipped with a RUC OBU, comprising a 5G
communication module and a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can
use a combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This
includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS),
Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and sensors, to allow
the RUC system to determine vehicle position-related data.
The RUC Application Server is connected to a 5G Network, and it includes
algorithms to compute the charges, monitors the traffic and manage fraud
detection algorithms.
The environment of use is primarily outdoor, including urban areas and rural
areas (wide coverage area), but includes also road tunnels and parking areas,
which may obstruct positioning signals.
#### 5.5.2.3 Service Flows
The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine position,
velocity (or velocity profile). The frequency of the determination may vary
according to the RUC application requirements. Indeed, depending on the
application, determination of the position-related data needs to be achieved
in close-to-real-time or not. Insurance and PyD applications may handle
charging on a regular, for instance on a monthly or yearly basis.
This information is reported to the RUC Application Server in addition with
information relating to the user (including type of vehicle and transported
passenger or freight).
For what regards road user charging, one can distinguish two main types of
applications. The first one deals with levying a fixed tax depending on the
road that is taken by the vehicle. In this case, the position information
shall be available each time with a periodicity of 1s but the information can
be reported to the central application server by packets in non-real time. The
second type of application deals with a dynamic fees level in order to control
dynamically the traffic. In this case, real time reporting shall be insured.
For PyD insurance applications, the position data information shall be
available each second in order to compute distances. Report shall be sent
periodically to the central server.
In all cases, Integrity of the information shall be insured all along the
information chain
#### 5.5.2.4 Post-conditions
The user is charged according to its use of the road infrastructure or
according to the use of the vehicle and driving behaviour.
The operator of the road infrastructure has access to additional information
to plan his operations (evolution and capacity increase, maintenance, etc.).
The processing (determinist or statistical analysis) of the reported
information brings additional benefits to the road user community, enabling
by-products for the operators of road infrastructure, like for instance:
\- Traffic flow statistics and management (including real time traffic
management, establishment of priority lanes according to period of day, etc.)
\- Feedback of road usage, to plan for road evolution (increase of capacity,
bypass route) or maintenance (for instance, in case of more heavy traffic on
some roads or lane)
\- More secure traffic for all road users.
#### 5.5.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.5.2.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a horizontal
accuracy in the range [1 -- 3] m, an update rate of [1] Hz and an availability
of [99] % for speed up to [130 km/h].
The 5G System shall be able to provide velocity information with an accuracy
of [2] m/s, an update rate of [1] Hz and an availability of [99] % for speed
up to [130 km/h].
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a TTFF less
than [10] s.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a user density
up to at least [1000 per kmÂ²].
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related data
against tampering and spoofing.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing
attempts on the position-related data.
## 5.6 Rail and Maritime related use cases
### 5.6.1 Asset and freight tracking (wagon, container)
#### 5.6.1.1 Description
Asset tracking is becoming a key capability for worldwide logistics like in
the railway or maritime freight sector (containers, tanks and wagons):
\- For providers and customers: it provides means to optimise the overall
transportation efficiency, and improves end-to-end traceability. Freight
tracking enables more accurate scheduling of all involved operations
(departure and arrival time, delays, organisation of transhipment, etc.).
\- For freight operators, it eases lean asset management (maintenance and
retrofit of assets, reduced risks relating to lost or stolen cargos,
containers and wagons)
\- Freight tracking helps securing the transportation of hazardous materials
and goods, and supports efficient operations in relation with regulation, for
instance at customs (procedures may adapt to freight, transit route, countries
through which the container / wagon travelled, etc.).
The asset tracker should fulfil very long lifetime (up to 15 years), with very
low maintenance and power autonomy enabled by batteries sustaining the whole
lifetime or with energy harvesting (solar panel, mechanical energy harvesting
during transportation) or with both.
The position-related data need to be secured and protected against tampering
to dissuade from any unauthorized use, fraud or theft of the transported
goods.
The use case can be expanded to other verticals, as it is the case in clause
5.43 of 3GPP TR 22.891 v14.2.0 (Feasibility Study on New Services and Markets
Technology Enablers).
#### 5.6.1.2 Pre-conditions
The UE (asset tracker installed on a container, tank, and wagon) is equipped
with a 5G communication module and a 5G positioning module. It is self-powered
using energy harvesting or long-lifetime battery, and connects to sensors
reporting relevant information about the asset (temperature, pressure, shock
and motion detection, etc.). When installed on the asset, the UE is properly
initialised, with secure parameters and trusted initial conditions.
The service areas are categorized as follow:
\- Transportation areas: outdoor, covering very wide areas (regional and
continental level) including mountainous areas, canopy and tunnels. The
transportation areas can include areas with no terrestrial coverage (e.g. a
container on a ship at sea).
\- Storage areas: enhanced positioning areas (up to 10 kmÂ²), with storage both
indoor and outdoor (warehouse, railway stations, harbours, etc.) and a very
high density of users (above 100 000 per kmÂ²).
The Asset Management System (AMS), connected to a 5G Network, collects and
processes the information reported by all device trackers relating to a given
customer.
#### 5.6.1.3 Service Flows
Container C, equipped with an asset tracker (UE), is planned to deliver a
cargo from storage area A to C, using a train that will transit via B. If A, B
and C have different applicable regulations for the transported freight,
specific control will apply upon arrival in C. Before departure from A, the UE
is initialised securely (initial position, planned route, etc.)
From A to C (transportation service area), the UE enables the 3GPP system to
determine its current position (and velocity), and reports relevant parameters
related to the asset or freight container (collected parameters like freight
temperature, pressure, detection of shock). The determination of position (and
velocity) is performed on a regular basis, but not continuously, and does not
need to be reported in real-time to the AMS. Position-related data should
allow to coarsely identify where the freight is, whether it is moving and in
which direction.
Meanwhile, Container C's position-related data and parameters are collected
and used by the AMS at least to:
\- monitor the transfer and delivery by Container C, and update stakeholders
on schedule and delivery time, and eventually, raise alert in case of delivery
delays, rerouting (different route than the one initially planned), etc.
\- support End-to-End traceability, efficient procedure at customs (transit
via B) and facilitate the control of the compliancy to regulation.
Upon arrival in the storage area C, and until customer takes delivery of the
container's content, the UE's position is determined in 3D and used to
identify container C. High accuracy is needed to distinguish containers on
stacks. During handling, position-related data are determined continuously,
also with very high accuracy. After handling, during storage, the UE switches
to idle mode, monitors motion to detect unauthorised handling or move, and
wakes up regularly (e.g. daily basis) to enable position check.
The position of the asset tracker must be determined all along its travel into
the transportation area to ensure continuity of the traceability information.
This includes areas with no terrestrial coverage. Therefore, when the UE is
outside coverage of 3GPP RAT-dependent positioning technologies:
\- The UE enables non-3GPP positioning technologies to determine its position
(e.g. using a GNSS receiver). In the case that the UE determines its position
(e.g. using a GNSS receiver), it shall log the position-related data into its
memory.
\- The 5G system is able to access to the log of the position determined
outside the coverage of 3GPP RAT-dependent positioning technologies.
#### 5.6.1.4 Post-conditions
Container C was delivered in due time, with minimal latency and time
overheads. It followed a safe route, duly reported and traced in the AMS. The
customer had continuously access to the full traceability of the delivery and
is in turn able to provide evidence of traceability to subsequent customer.
Thanks to the logged information, the freight operator may demonstrate the
compliancy to regulation with minimum effort, and use the information
collected by the AMS to improve the efficiency of his deliveries.
#### 5.6.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated]
#### 5.6.1.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service for the static UE
in an enhanced positioning area, indoor or outdoor with the following
potential requirements:
\- Absolute position accuracy: [1] m (horizontal and vertical), [99] %
availability, an update rate up to [1] Hz and a latency less than [1] s.
\- TTFF less than [10] s.
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service for UE moving at
speed up to 180 km/h outdoor, over very wide coverage with the following
potential requirements:
\- Absolute position accuracy: [10-30] m horizontal position accuracy, [99] %
availability
\- Velocity accuracy: [5] m/s horizontal velocity accuracy, [99] %
availability
\- Position and velocity update rate: the time interval between 2 successive
position fix can vary between [300 s] and [24 hours].
The UE shall support mechanisms to determine its position using non-3GPP
positioning technologies when outside the coverage of 3GPP RAT-dependent
positioning technologies.
The 5G system shall support mechanisms to access the UE's position-related
data determined when the UE is outside the coverage of 3GPP RAT-dependent
positioning technologies.
The 5G System shall be able to provide a positioning service involving an
average of less than [20 mJ] of the UE's energy per position fix.
NOTE: the value of the energy per fix is an averaged figure, determined over a
time interval larger than the position update period (for example, 1 hour, 24
hours, 1 week, etc.). This requirement does not presume the positioning
method, which can be in the UE or in the core Network.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related data
against tampering and spoofing.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing
attempts on the position-related data.
## 5.7 Aerial-related use cases
### 5.7.1 Accurate positioning to support Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
missions and operations
#### 5.7.1.1 Description
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drones for professional or leisure
applications are used for several missions. During their mission, they might
be connected to a remote user or a Mission Application Server to report
regularly or by burst mission information that are processed to generated
added value products. The Mission information that is reported is often images
of the environment that is flown over. The images can be optical or another
type of sensor, such as an infrared sensor. The images are in general tagged
with Meta Data describing the mission.
In such a context, the images often need to be geo-localised with a high
accuracy in order to allow recombining the images as a sequence of image
representing a given scene compared or superimposed onto a ground digital map.
This allows generating benefit information from the recombined images mapped
on a given existing reference.
In other situations, several flights are performed over the same area, and the
mission of the drone's sensor is to provide information to evaluate particular
environmental evolutions at various dates. For automatic processing of the
flow of images, the images and therefore the UAV shall be accurately geo-
localised with absolute positions information.
In addition, during the landing phase, the UAV operations need also precise 3D
geo-localisation information in order to allow automatic landing
#### 5.7.1.2 Pre-conditions
The user's drone is equipped with a Navigation Unit, comprising a UE with a 5G
communication module and a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can
use a combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This
includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS),
Terrestrial Beacon Systems, Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and sensors, to allow the
Navigation Unit system to determine UAV position-related data.
The UAV Mission Application Centre is connected to a 5G Network. The Centre
includes algorithms to process the images and generate added value information
from a series of images in sequences or at various dates.
The environment of use is primarily outdoor, including urban areas and rural
areas (wide coverage area).
#### 5.7.1.3 Service Flows
The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine position,
velocity (or velocity profile) and date. The frequency of the determination
shall be regular typically every second.
The need for reporting the information can vary depending on the applications.
In some implementations, the UAV system may use the information directly, and
thereof, this information is not reported as such to the Mission Application
Centre.
In some cases, the information shall be reported in quasi real time in order
to allow a remote control of the mission.
In case where the position-related data is used in the processing and analysis
of the images collected by the UAV, the Mission Application Centre processes
the images reported by the UAV, either in real time or in post processing when
the UAV has landed and uploaded its images bank to the server. Very low
latency is not mandatory.
In the case where the Navigation Unit information is used for landing
operations, the position information are reported to the on-board flight
computer to control the flight in order to ensure a smooth landing. Latency
need to be commensurate to the velocity of the UAV in the landing phase to
maintain the relevancy of the accuracy requirements.
#### 5.7.1.4 Post-conditions
The images are georeferenced using the position-related data provided by the
UAV Navigation Unit, as part of Meta Data describing each image. Based on this
Meta Data, the Mission Application Centre can recombine precisely a sequence
of images to generate a scene precisely located in space. The Centre can also
compare the environment situations by processing various images taken at
various dates, with a common position reference, or by comparing the images
with any other sources of geo-localised information.
#### 5.7.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
#### 5.7.1.6 Potential Requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support drones
applications with [10] cm horizontal and vertical position accuracy, 99%
availability, for UE moving at [150] km/h outdoor.
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support
applications with under [50] cm/s horizontal and vertical velocity accuracy
and [2]Âº bearing accuracy, over 99% availability, for UE moving at speed up to
[150] km/h outdoor.
The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service to support
applications with a TTFF less than [10] s.
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service such that the UE\'s
power consumption will be less than [200] mW in the worst case.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related data
against tampering.
The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering attempts on the
position-related data.
The 5G System shall be able to ensure the positioning related data are
secured, and shall allow the protection of the user's privacy.
### 5.7.2 Transport and inspection by drones for medical purposes
#### 5.7.2.1 Description
Medication and cures need to be transported between two different buildings
(for instance, pharmacy to a dedicated unit) inside a hospital made up of
several buildings on several hectares with large green areas or between two
different hospitals (in the same city). Drones can be used for these
transportations.
Some hospitals may organise and pool their stock of medication and production
of cures.
Some hospitals, part of a same group or not, may exchange medication, for
instance, in case one face empty stock, or is not equipped to store some cures
(e.g. chemotherapy).
In all these cases and situations, medication and cures need to be transported
between two distinct locations, in a trusted, secure and time-controlled
process. The locations may be distant from several tens of kilometres. Drones
can be used to ensure such transportation.
In addition to transport between buildings, drones can be used to transport
life-saving equipment (e.g. AED) from a predetermined location to an arbitrary
outdoor (or even indoor) location in close vicinity of a patient (e.g.
suffering of Sudden Cardiac Arrest). Also a drone (could be the same drone
delivering the life-saving equipment) needs to hover over the scene and
provide a live video feed to an emergency call centre, enabling better life
saving support.
The drone flies at low altitude. The drone needs to maintain a continuous
connection with the mobile network, which requires the network supports
continuous wireless coverage in low altitude flight scenarios.
During the whole delivery process, the position and the status of the drone
needs to monitored and logged in order to ensure the full traceability of the
delivery, as well as the security of the delivery.
A drone and remote control are connected to the mobile network. A continuous
connection with the mobile network is needed, especially in the case of
transport between two hospitals requiring a way in the public domain.
The drone is piloted with remote mode, the data being transmitted via the
network
Position accuracy is defined to minimise risk of damage to property or life in
densely populated areas.
Extreme Real-Time Communications are addressed in the NGMN 5G white paper [5].
#### 5.7.2.2 Pre-conditions
The drone and its payload container are equipped with 5G communication
modules, smart lock as well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning
module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies.
A drone and remote control are connected to the mobile network.
The drone is piloted with remote mode, the data being transmitted via the
network.
#### 5.7.2.3 Service Flows
Tom needs to receive a cure in emergency in Hospital A, the one close to the
place he lives. The cure must be delivered within the next 24 hours, but is
not available in Hospital A. The doctors consider Tom's health does not allow
transporting him to another Hospital. Fortunately, Hospital A is organised
with other Hospitals in the region to manage such circumstances: it was agreed
in the past that the stock of this cure would be centralised in Hospital B and
the cure distributed when needed using drones.
Hospital A's Pharmacist requests the delivery of the cure using the Hospital
specific drone system. The trajectory and details of the delivery (including a
unique identifier linking the delivery operation, ID of the patient, ID of
Hospital A and B, ID of the cure, etc.) are defined in the delivery management
application and loaded in the drone and its payload container. The container
can only be opened upon arrival in duly identified and authorized locations
(Hospital A and Hospital B), and if handled by authorized personnel.
The drone leaves Hospital A and reaches Hospital B less than one hour later.
Meanwhile, Hospital B's Pharmacy prepared the cure, put it in an adequate and
secured container ready for transportation.
Upon arrival of the drone, after reporting its arrival, Hospital B's
Pharmacist unlocks the drone and its container using his ID, introduces the
cure into the drone's payload container and locks it again with his ID.
The drone flies back to Hospital A, where upon arrival, the Pharmacist of
Hospital A proceeds with similar actions as above to retrieve the cure from
the container.
The cure has reached the Pharmacy of Hospital A, and can now be handled as if
it came out of the stock of Hospital A.
During the whole operation, all relevant information about the drone's
trajectory, the status and content of the container are logged. In addition,
the drone's positioning module enabled the determination of its position in a
secure way, resilient to spoofing and tampering attempt, this to prevent
errors in the delivery, misuse and attempt to smuggle the cure.
#### 5.7.2.4 Post-conditions
Tom receives the cure in due time. The handling of the delivery is more
efficient than the former system used by Hospital A and B, which relied on
ambulances or taxi delivery, particularly expensive in case of emergency and
in night shifts.
All information about the operation are authenticated, exchanged and logged
with adequate security for traceability
#### 5.7.2.5 [Potential] Requirements
The 5G system shall support:

be able to provide positioning service with [50 cm] horizontal position
accuracy and a [30 cm] vertical accuracy, 99% availability, for the moving UE
at the speed of up to [50km/hour]. The accuracy needs to be met throughout the
5G positioning service area. The environment of use for en-route phase is
outdoor, mainly unobstructed.

between operator's policy and 3rd party
### 5.8.2 Support location method negotiation
#### 5.8.2.1 Description
One location module in a UE may support multiple methods to supply its
position information, for example, 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP
technologies. This includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo,
GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID,
and sensors. Different location methods support different level position
performance and capabilities. So, it is suggested to support negotiation of
location capabilities considering user, application, or network operator's
demands.
#### 5.8.2.2 Pre-conditions
Bob is user of operator A. Bob's UE supports multiple mode location methods,
for example, 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but
not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS), Terrestrial
Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and sensors.
The 3GPP system of Operator A supports multiple location methods, for example,
3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not limited
to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems
(TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID,, and sensors. Bob has registered the location
service from operator A.
#### 5.8.2.3 Service Flows
Bob is going to drive to his office. When he leaves his home, he switches on
the GNSS e.g. BeiDou location enable button in his UE and open the Map
application.
Bob's UE notifies the 3GPP system that it can support LTEand BeiDou location
methods now, and requests that which ones the system use to supply location
service.
The 3GPP system identifies that Bob's UE is in outdoor and the navigation
application is active, so responses that the LTE, 5G and BeiDou location
methods can be used.
Bob's UE receives the response and begins to supply position data to the 3GPP
system periodically. During Bob is driving to his office, the 3GPP system
provides navigation location service to him.
Bob arrives his office basement and plans to park his electric car to the
wireless charging port which requires higher accuracy positioning capability.
The parking application sends positioning requirement to 3GPP system to
request higher accuracy positioning requirement.
Then, the 3GPP system analyses that this higher accuracy positioning
requirement can be supported by 5G and asks Bob's UE that whether the 5G
location method can be used now. Bob's UE responses that WLAN, LTE, 5G
location methods can be used.
The 3GPP system decides to use 5G which can support higher accuracy location
performance to support parking application positioning requirement.
The 3GPP system notifies Bob's UE of the selected location method and parking
application that its positioning request can be supported.
The 3GPP system and Bob's UE switch location method to 5G location methods.
The location service continues and helps to park Bob's car.

# 6 Synthesis of the use cases performances targets
## 6.1 Foreword
Adaptability and flexibility are among the key features of the 5G system to
satisfy a diversity of services to many different verticals, representing
different classes of performances and environment of use. This applies also to
5G positioning services, which can be supported by either 3GPP positioning
technologies or a combination of 3GPP and non-3GPP positioning technologies to
optimise the performances provided to the different users.
The following table summarises the potential performances requirements of the
positioning use cases organised per vertical in Clause 5. Doing so, it also
features a comprehensive illustration of the diversity of positioning services

[PR-010] The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with 3m
vertical accuracy and an availability of 95% anywhere in 5G positioning
service area (for speed up to at least 160 km/h).
NOTE 1: the vertical positioning requirement should be sufficiently accurate
to determine the floor in indoor use cases and distinguish between superposed
roads in road-related use cases.
[PR-011] The 5G system shall be able to provide relative changes in the UE's
altitude (or height) from an initial reference point with a vertical accuracy
less than 0.2 m and an availability of 95% for some 5G positioning services.
[PR-012] The 5G System shall be able to provide a relative positioning service
with a relative accuracy better than 0.2 m and an availability of 99 % either
between two UEs within 10 m of each other or between one UE and 5G positioning
nodes within 10 m of each others.
NOTE 2: 5G positioning nodes are here infrastructure equipment deployed in the
service area to enhance positioning capabilities: for instance, some beacons
deployed on the perimeter of a rendezvous area or on the side of a warehouse.
NOTE 3: the relative positioning capability can be achieved in any relevant 2D
or 3D, Cartesian or Polar coordinate system for instance, using either very
high accuracy positioning technologies or 2-way ranging and direction of
arrival from one UE to the other.
[PR-013] The 5G system shall be able to provide the 5G positioning services
with a TTFF less than 30 s and, for some 5G positioning services, shall
support mechanisms to provide a TTFF less than 10s at the expense of a
relaxation of some other performances (e.g., horizontal accuracy relaxed from
3 m to 10 m for a high accuracy positioning service).
[PR-014] The 5G system shall be able to provide the 5G positioning services
with a latency lower than 1 s.
NOTE 4: the 5G system may support mechanism such as extrapolation of position
and combination of positioning technologies to provide some 5G positioning
services with latency less than 20 ms.
[PR-015] The 5G system shall support mechanism to determine the UE\'s velocity
outdoor with an accuracy better than 0.5 m/s and better than 5 degree bearing,

[PR-016] The 5G System shall be able to provide a positioning service
involving an average of less than 20 mJ of the UE's energy per position fix
and involving a peak power less than 200 mW.
NOTE 6: the 5G positioning services should be fulfilled without affecting the
UE's battery overall lifetime by more than 5 % or without reducing the UE's
battery lifetime by more than 10 months out of a total of 15 years' lifetime.
NOTE 7: the 5G System needs to consider UEs with limited form factor, limited
CPU power, and limited radio access technology support (e.g. eMTC type
communication only).
## 8.3 Operational Requirements
[PR-017] The 5G system shall be able to request the UE to provide its
position-related-data on request, triggered by an event or periodically and to
request the UE to stop providing its position-related data periodically.
NOTE 1: This requirement does not preclude whether the position is computed in
the UE or elsewhere in the 5G System (e.g. core network). Indeed, the
determination of the UE's position or location requires the UE to transmit
some information (e.g. position, OTDOA measurements made on PRS, some signal
allowing the UE's identification and UTDOA measurements in the nodes, etc.)
which refers to position-related data.
[PR-018] The 5G system shall allow the UE to trigger a different update rate
of the position-related data based on whether the UE is moving or not.
[PR-019] The 5G system shall support mechanism to configure dynamically the
update rate of the position-related data to fulfil different performances
(e.g. power consumption, latency, etc.) or different location modes.
NOTE 2: for example, the 5G System needs to be able to request the UE to
provide its location periodically with an update rate ranging from one
location every [1 s-10 s] in location normal mode to one location every [30
s-300 s, or more] in location power saving mode. The 5G System needs to allow
UEs to sleep for extended periods (e.g. one week), without requiring the UE to
update its position data.
[PR-020] The 5G system shall be able to determine the position-related data of
the 5G positioning services with any update rate ranging from one set of
position-related data every 0.1 s to one set of position-related data every
month.
[PR-021] The 5G System shall be able to make the position-related data
available to an application server.
NOTE 3: the latency to make the position-related data available can be
tailored to the use cases.
[PR-022] The 5G System shall be able to negotiate the positioning methods
according to the operator's policy or the application's requirements or the
user's preferences and support mechanism to allow the network or the UE to
trigger this negotiation.
[PR-023] The 5G System shall be able to access to the positioning methods used
for calculating the position-related data and to the associated
uncertainty/confidence indicators.
[PR-024] The 5G system shall supply a method for either the operator or a 3rd
party to configure and manage different positioning services for different
users according to agreement between operator and 3rd party.
[PR-025] The 5G system shall be able to supply a method to support the 3rd
party to request 5G system to trigger location methods negotiation.
[PR-026] The 5G System shall enable an MCX UE to use the 5G positioning
services to determine its position with the associated uncertainty/confidence
of the position, on request, triggered by an event or periodically.
## 8.4 Security-related Requirements
[PR-027] The 5G positioning services shall be able to protect, by some
mechanism, the UE's privacy and the privacy of the UE's user or owner,
including the respect of its consent to the positioning services.
NOTE 1: this includes the ability for the System to provide the positioning
services on demand without having to track continuously the position of the
involved UE.
NOTE 2: the respect of the user's consent to some positioning services could
abide by different rules in case of emergency (for example, rules that would
also receive consent from the user, but well before the emergency occurs).
[PR-028] The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related
data against tampering and spoofing.
[PR-029] The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and
spoofing attempts on the position-related data.
# 9 Conclusions and recommendations
The current TR provides a number of use cases for positioning services
relating to 5G verticals such as LBS, industry and e-health, regulatory use
cases (emergency call and first responder), road, rail, maritime and aerial.
The potential requirements reported for each use cases are compiled into a set
of potential consolidated positioning requirements, defining different classes
of positioning services, in 2D and 3D, for both outdoor and indoor environment
of use, in whole 5G positioning service area or limited to enhanced
positioning areas like, for instance, a shopping mall or a hospital campus.
The resulting potential requirements identified in this TR can be considered
for the development of normative requirements. It is therefore proposed to
consider the inclusion of these requirements in existing specifications for 5G
services (e.g. TS 22.261).
###### ### Annex A: Mapping matrices between use cases' potential requirements
and potential consolidated positioning requirements
The following two tables show how the potential consolidated positioning
requirements capture the potential requirements proposed for each use case in
clause 5, either directly, or by also taking into account the considerations
developed in clauses 6 and 7.
The 1st table (Table A-1) associates each requirement of clause 8 to its
parents requirements (potential requirements from use cases in clause 5) and
to the related considerations in clauses 6 and 7.
The 2nd table (Table A-2 shows how the potential requirements of each use case
are covered by the consolidated requirements.
