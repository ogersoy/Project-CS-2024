# Introduction
Network sharing is emerging as a mechanism for operators to substantially and
sustainably improve network costs and to efficiently utilize network capacity.
The traditional model of single ownership of all network layers and elements
is being challenged and more and more operators are adopting network sharing
as a means of cutting the heavy costs involved in initial roll-out, capital
expenditure (**CAPEX)** and operational expenditure (OPEX).
In general, an increasing number of operators are sharing their mobile
networks. Main arguments presented are:
\- Increased rollout speed.
\- Quickly expanding coverage to meet customer demand for wider coverage.
\- Sharing low traffic areas.
\- Sharing high license burdens.
\- Lower CAPEX and OPEX.
Network sharing has some major implications on the operations of the network.
Alignment on operational priorities, common network planning/evolution
strategy, sharing end user data/subscriber data, sharing performance data,
alarms etc. in the shared network need to be considered carefully. Privacy,
security and competitive information are also important for the operations of
a shared network.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes concepts and high-level requirements for the
Operations, Administration, Maintenance and Provisioning (OAM&P) of network
sharing.
Network sharing scenarios considered in the present document are Multiple
Operator Core Network (MOCN) and Gateway Core Network (GWCN) for GERAN, UTRAN
and E-UTRAN, as defined in TS 23.251 [7]).

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1], in that
order.
Organizational roles:
**Master Operator (MOP):** In Radio Access Network (RAN) and/or Core Network
(CN) sharing scenarios, deployment and daily operation of shared network
elements are entrusted to a single Actor, called the Master Operator. The
Master Operator provides network and OAM&P services to other Operators, called
Participating Operators (POPs). The Master Operator is the only one to have a
direct OAM&P connection from its Domain Manager (DM) to the shared network
elements.
**Participating Operator (POP):** Participating Operators are service
providers who share, alongside other Participating Operators, the network (RAN
and/or CN) facilities provided by the Master Operator. According to TS 36.300
[4] up to 6 operators can share a RAN.
Note: In a RAN/CN sharing scenario where Company A and Company B are POPs, MOP
represents a role which can be played by either:
\- Company A or Company B: in that case, Company A or Company B plays both
roles, i.e. is the MOP and one of the POPs simultaneously, or
\- A joint-venture between Company A and Company B, or
\- A third-party entity: in this context, third party is referring to a
wholesale mobile connectivity provider.
In the two latter cases, companies A and B rely on another company to play the
role of MOP. This company cannot play the role of POP.
Management systems:
**Master Operator Network Manager (MOP-NM):** Network Manager enabling the
Master Operator to manage the shared RAN and/or shared CN.
**Master Operator Shared CN dm (MOP--SC-DM):** Domain Manager enabling the
Master Operator to manage the Shared CN.
**Master Operator Shared RAN dm (MOP--SR-DM):** Domain Manager enabling the
MOP to manage the Shared RAN.
**Participating Operator CN DM (POP-CORE-DM):** Domain Manager enabling a
Participating Operator to manage its own (not shared) Core Network.
**Participating Operator Network Manager (POP-NM):** Network Manager enabling
a Participating Operator to manage its own (not shared) network and its
portion of the shared network.
**Participating Operator RAN DM (POP-RAN-DM):** Domain Manager enabling a
Participating Operator to manage its own (not shared) RAN.
Managed resources in a shared Radio Access Network (RAN) environment:
**Shared RAN (S-RAN):** A set of Radio Access Network elements shared among
Participating Operators.
Managed resources in a shared Core Network (CN) environment:
**Shared CN (S-CORE):** A set of Core Network elements shared among
Participating Operators. It may or may not include all core network elements.
For example, the Participating Operators may share only the MMEs while having
independent S/P GWs.

# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 RAN sharing scenarios
Various network sharing scenarios exist, amongst which one category is RAN
sharing which can be divided into the following (non exhaustive) list of sub-
categories:
\- Passive RAN sharing, also known as infrastructure sharing (including site
sharing).
\- Active RAN sharing, where active network elements of the RAN are shared:
\- RAN-only sharing (MOCN; see TS 23.251 [5]), i.e. BTSs / BSCs (respectively
NodeBs / RNCs and eNodeBs) in a 2G Radio Access Network (respectively a 3G
Radio Access Network and an E-UTRA network);
\- Gateway Core Network (GWCN; see TS 23.251 [5]), in which not only the Radio
Access Network elements are shared but also part or all of the Core Network
elements (there is no passive core network sharing).
In MOCN, POPs have a common S-RAN, have their individual Core Network and
their own PLMN code(s), and use the same frequency on the S-RAN.

In GWCN, besides sharing Radio Access Network nodes, the POPs also share Core
Network nodes (see TS 23.251 [5] -- clause 4.1).

Figure 5.4.1-1: Fully pooled radio resources between two POPs
### 5.4.2 Alarm raised on a shared cell (MOCN scenario)
In this use case, an alarm is raised on cell #1 of a shared (e)NodeB.
According to the RAN sharing agreement, the two POPs A and B are informed by
the MOP of the occurrence of this new alarm, as well as of the alarm clearance
by the MOP.

### 5.4.3 Single DM for managing S-RAN and POP own RAN
In this use case, Operator A is a POP and manages its own (non-shared) NEs
from its POP-RAN-DM while Operator B is both MOP and POP and manages **S-RAN**
and its own (non-shared) NEs from a single DM.
Operator B has several possibilities:
Example #1: configure, NE per NE, which POPs share the cells that it manages;
or
Example #2: define two separate groups of BTSs / (e)NodeBs:
\- one for the **S-RAN** NEs -- it shall then configure which POPs share the
cells of this group of BTSs / (e)NodeBs; and
\- one for its own (non-shared) RAN NEs.

Figure 5.4.3-1: Single DM for managing both S-RAN and own RAN
### 5.4.4 Management of measurements for cross-operator accounting based on
data volume and QoS
The operator has made an agreement to act as a Master Operator, MOP, for
another operator (Participating Operator, POP) for RAN sharing. The agreement
is regulated in an SLA, which states the following: The QoS profile criteria
ARP-1 -- 10 and GBR-5 for QCI-4 and QCI-8 is supported. The DL QCI-4, GBR-5,
and ARP-1 -- 10 is charged by x Euro per Mbit, while UL QCI-4, GBR-5, and
ARP-1 -- 10 is charged by y Euro per Mbit. QCI-8 is charged z Euro per Mbit
regardless of QoS. For cross operator accounting purpose, the network needs to
provide data volume measurements with high reliability for the used QoS
profile criteria to the MOP.
