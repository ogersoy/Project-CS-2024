# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of Technical Specifications (TSs)
that specify charging functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS
networks. The GSM/UMTS core network-charging architecture and principles are
specified in TS 32.240 [1], which provides an umbrella for other charging
management documents that specify.
\- The content of the CDRs\' per domain and subsystem (offline charging);
\- The content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem (online
charging);
\- The functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
subsystems;
\- The interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].
The present document specifies in detail the Diameter based offline and online
charging applications for 3GPP networks. It includes all charging parameters,
scenarios and message flows..
All terms, definitions and, abbreviations used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in TR 21.905 [100]. Those that are
common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains, services or subsystems
are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1] and are copied into clause
3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally, those items that are
specific to the present document are defined exclusively in the present
document.
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS
22.115 [101].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [100] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR
21.905 [100].
**middle tier TS:** term used for the 3GPP charging TSs that specify the
domain / subsystem / service specific, online and offline, charging
functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from TS 32.250 to
TS 32.27x, e.g. TS 32.250 [10] for the CS domain, or TS 32.270 [30] for the
MMS service. Currently, there is only one \"tier 1\" TS in 3GPP, which is the
TS 32.240 that specifies the charging architecture and principles. Finally,
there are a number of top tier TSs in the 32.29x numbering range ([50] ff)
that specify common charging aspects such as parameter definitions, encoding
rules, the common billing domain interface or common charging applications.
**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **does
not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the
charging mechanism with session/service control is required

# 4 Architecture considerations
## 4.1 High level architecture
### 4.1.0 General
The Rf and the Ro are reference points from the Charging Trigger Function
(CTF) to the Charging Data Function (CDF) and the Online Charging Function
(OCF) respectively, and are intended for the transport of charging events. Rf
is used for offline charging whereas Ro is used for online charging.\ Figure
4.1.0.1 and figure 4.1.0.2 depict the position of the Rf and Ro reference
points within the overall 3GPP online and offline charging architecture.

Figure 4.1.0.2: Logical ubiquitous online charging architecture
Different mappings of the ubiquitous offline charging functions, CTF, CDF and
CGF, onto physical implementations are possible. Further details of the
configuration refer toTS 32.240 [1]. Details of the implementation options per
domain / subsystem / service (usually a subset of the overall possible
variants described above) are specified in the respective middle tier TSs.
### 4.1.1 Charging related transfer requirements
Each CTF would have CDF and OCF address list to which it can send its charging
events and/or charging requests.\ The list is organized in address priority
order. If the primary charging function is not available (e.g. out of service)
then the CTF shall send the charging information to the secondary charging
function and so on.
Within the scope of this release, each Network Element that generates charging
information sends the information only to the charging entities of the same
PLMN, and not to charging entities in other PLMNs.\ To implement roaming
unbundling for EU roaming regulation III, an architectural solution known as
the Single IMSI architecture has been defined. In this architecture a specific
Service-NE (known as a Proxy Function) uses the Ro reference point for sending
charging information to an OCF in another network. The details of this
architecture are defined in Annex B of TS 32.240 [1].
To implement PS domain online charging for roaming context, PCEF in the VPLMN
uses the Gy reference point, and TDF in the VPLMN uses the Gyn reference
point, both based on Ro interface and specified in TS 32.251[11], for sending
charging information to an OCS in the HPLMN. A simplified profile is provided
in Annex E of TS 32.251[11] for deployment purposes.
Each CDF in the PLMN may know of other CDFs\' network addresses (e.g., for
redundancy reasons, to be able to recommend another CDF address with the
Redirection Request message). This is achieved by OAM&P configuration
facilities that enables each CDF to have a configurable list of peer CDF
addresses.
# 5 3GPP charging applications requirements
## 5.1 Offline charging scenarios
### 5.1.1 Basic principles
#### 5.1.1.0 Introduction
Offline charging for both events and sessions between CTF and the CDF is
performed using the Rf reference point as defined in TS 32.240 [1].
Two basic scenarios are used:
\- Event based charging;
\- Session based charging.
#### 5.1.1.1 Event based charging
In scenario figure 5.1.1.1.1, CTF asks the CDF to store event related charging
data.
Figure 5.1.1.1.1: Event based charging
**1) Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired resource from the
Network Element.
**2) Content/Service Delivery:** the Network Element delivers the
content/service.
**3) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
service delivery.
**4) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store event
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**5) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**6) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored.
#### 5.1.1.2 Session based charging
In scenario figure 5.1.1.2.1, CTF asks the CDF to store session related
charging data.
Figure 5.1.1.2.1: Session based charging
**1) Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired session from the
Network Element.
**2) Session ongoing:** the Network Element establish the session.
**3) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
session.
**4) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store session
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**5) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**6) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored.
**7) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
session due of e.g. intermediate timer expiry.
**8) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store session
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**9) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**10) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored.
**11) Session release:** the session is released.
**12) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
session due of session termination.
**13) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store
session related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**14) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**15) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored.
### 5.1.2 Basic operation
Event and session based Charging are performed by the use of the \"_Charging
Data Transfer_ \" operation:
\- \"_Charging Data Request_ \"; sent from CTF ïƒ  CDF\ After detecting a
chargeable event, the CTF sends a Charging Data Request to the CDF.
\- \"_Charging Data Response_ \"; sent from CDF ïƒ  CTF\ The CDF replies with a
Charging Data Response, which informs the CTF that charging data was received.
Table 5.1.2.1 and table 5.1.2.2 describe the content of these operations.

## 5.2 Online charging scenarios
### 5.2.0 Introduction
Online charging for both events and sessions between CTF and the OCF is
performed using the Ro reference point. The Ro reference point supports
integrity protection and authentication for the case that the CTF is outside
the operator domain.
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
There are two sub-functions for online charging that affect online charging
principles and require a more detailed description: rating and unit
determination. Both rating and unit determination can be implemented
centralized, i.e. on the OCF, or decentralized, that is, on the CTF.
Unit determination refers to the calculation of the number of non-monetary
units (service units, data volume, time and events) that shall be assigned
prior to starting service delivery.
\- With Centralized Unit Determination, the OCF determines the number of non-
monetary units that a certain service user can consume based on a service key
received from the CTF.
\- With the Decentralized Unit Determination approach, the CTF determines
itself how many units are required to start service delivery, and requests
these units from the OCF.
After checking the service user\'s account balance, the OCF returns the number
of granted units to the CTF. The CTF is then responsible for the supervision
of service delivery. Particularly, the CTF shall limit service delivery to the
corresponding number of granted units.
Rating refers to the calculation of a price out of the non-monetary units
calculated by the unit determination function.
\- With the Centralized Rating approach, the CTF and the OCF exchange
information about non-monetary units. The OCF translates these units into
monetary units.
\- With the Decentralized Rating approach, the corresponding rating control is
performed within the CTF. Consequently, CTF and OCF exchange information about
monetary units.
Three cases for online charging can be distinguished: Immediate Event Charging
(IEC), Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) and Session Charging with
Unit Reservation (SCUR). These cases are further described in TS 32.240 [1].
### 5.2.2 Charging scenarios
#### 5.2.2.0 Introduction
In order to perform event charging via Ro, the scenarios between the involved
entities UE-A, OCF and CTF need to be defined. The charging flows shown in
this subclause include scenarios with immediate event charging and event
charging with reservation. In particular, the following cases are shown:
1 Immediate Event Charging
a) Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
b) Centralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
c) Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
2 Event charging with Unit Reservation
a) Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
b) Centralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
c) Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
3 Session charging with Unit Reservation
a) Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
b) Centralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
c) Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
The combination of Centralized Unit Determination with Decentralized Rating is
not possible.
#### 5.2.2.1 Immediate Event Charging (IEC)
##### 5.2.2.1.1 Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
In scenario figure 5.2.2.1.1.1, CTF asks the OCF to assign a defined number of
units.
Figure 5.2.2.1.1.1: IEC - Centralized Rating and Decentralized Unit
Determination
**1) Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired resource from the
Network Element.
**2) Units Determination:** depending on the requested service the CTF
determines the number of units accordingly.
**3) Debit Units Request:** the CTF requests the OCF to assign the defined
number of units.
**4) Rating Control:** assisted by the rating entity the OCF calculates the
number of monetary units that represents the price for the number of units
determined in item 2.
**5) Account Control:** provided that the user\'s credit balance is
sufficient, the OCF triggers the deduction of the calculated amount from the
subscriber\'s account.
**6) Debit Units Response:** the OCF informs the CTF of the number of granted
units.
**7) Content/Service Delivery:** the CTF delivers the content/service at once,
in fractions or in individually chargeable items, corresponding to the number
of granted units.
**8) Credit Unit Control (cont.):** this function block is optional and a
replication of items 2 to 6.
**9) Content/Service Delivery (cont.):** the continuation of content delivery
occurs in correspondence with the occurrence of item 8.
**10) Session released:** Session is released.
##### 5.2.2.1.2 Centralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
In scenario figure 5.2.2.1.2.1, CTF asks the OCF to assign units based on the
service key specified by the CTF.
Figure 5.2.2.1.2.1: IEC - Centralized Rating and Centralized Unit
Determination
**1) Request for resource usage:** The UE-A requests the desired resource or
content from the Network Element.
**2) Debit Units Request:** depending on the service requested by the UE-A,
the CTF determines the service key and forwards the Debit Units Request with
service key to the OCF.
**3) Units Determination:** the OCF determines the number of non-monetary
units needed for the content/service delivery, based on the received service
key.
**4) Rating Control:** assisted by the rating entity the OCF calculates the
number of monetary units that represent the price for the number of units
determined in item 3.
**5) Account Control:** provided that the user\'s credit balance is
sufficient, the OCF triggers the deduction of the calculated amount from the
subscriber\'s account.
**6) Debit Units Response:** the OCF informs the CTF of the number of granted
units. This includes the case where the number of units granted indicates the
permission to render the service that was identified by the received service
key.
**7) Content/Service Delivery:** the CTF delivers the content/service at once,
in fractions or in individually chargeable items, corresponding to the number
of granted units.
**8) Credit Service Control (cont.):** this function block is optional and a
replication of items 2 to 6.
**9) Content/Service Delivery (cont.):** the continuation of content delivery
occurs in correspondence with the occurrence of item 8.
**10) Session released:** the session is released.
##### 5.2.2.1.3 Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
In scenario figure 5.2.2.1.3.1, the CTF asks the OCF to assure the deduction

### 5.2.3 Basic operations
Online Credit-Control uses two basic logical operations: Debit Units and
Reserve Units.
\- \"_Debit Units Request_ \"; sent from CTF ïƒ  OCF\ After receiving a service
request from the subscriber, the CTF sends a _Debit Units Request_ to the
OCF.\ The CTF may either specify a service key (centralised unit
determination) or the number of units requested (decentralised unit
determination).\ For refund purpose, the CTF sends a _Debit Units Request_ to
the OCF as well.
\- \"_Debit Units Response_ \"; sent from OCF ïƒ  CTF\ The OCF replies with a
_Debit Units Response_ , which informs the CTF of the number of units granted
as a result of the _Debit Units Request_. This includes the case where the
number of units granted indicates the permission to render the requested
service.\ For refund purpose, the OCF replies with a _Debit Units Response_.
\- \"_Reserve Units Request_ \"; sent from CTF ïƒ  OCF\ Request to reserve a
number of units for the service to be provided by an CTF. In case of
centralized unit determination, the CTF specifies a service key in the
_Reserve Unit Request_ , and the OCF determines the number of units requested.
In case of decentralised unit determination, the number of units requested is
specified by the CTF.
\- \"_Reserve Units Response_ \"; sent from OCF ïƒ  CTF\ Response from the OCF
which informs the CTF of the number of units that were reserved as a result of
the \"_Reserve Units Request_ \".
IEC uses the Direct Debiting One Time Event procedure specified in RFC 4006
[402] and therefore is performed by the use of the logical \"Debit Units\"
operation, as specified in clause 6.3.3.
SCUR and ECUR use both the \"Debit Units\" and \"Reserve Units\" operations.
SCUR uses the Session Based Credit-Control procedure specified in RFC 4006
[402]. In session charging with unit reservation, when the \"Debit Units\" and
\"Reserve Units\" operations are both needed, they shall be combined in one
message, as specified in clause 6.3.5.
For SCUR and ECUR the consumed units are deducted from the subscriber\'s
account after service delivery.\ Thus, the reserved and consumed units are not
necessarily the same. Using this operation, it is also possible for the CTF to
modify the current reservation, including the return of previously reserved
units.
Table 5.2.3.1 and table 5.2.3.2 describe the content of these operations.

which the client may use depending on operator policy.
# 6 3GPP charging applications -- Protocol aspects
## 6.1 Basic principles for Diameter offline charging
### 6.1.0 Introduction
In order to support the offline charging principles described in the present
document, the Diameter client and server shall implement at least the
following Diameter options listed in RFC 6733 [401], i.e. the basic
functionality of Diameter accounting, as defined by the Diameter Base Protocol
(RFC 6733 [401]) is re-used.
The charging architecture implementing Diameter adheres to the structure where
all communications for offline charging purposes between the CTF (Diameter
client) and the CDF (Diameter server) are carried out on the Diameter Rf
reference point, where the CTF reports charging information to the Charging
Data Function (CDF). The CDF uses this information to construct and format
CDRs. The above-mentioned reference points are defined in TS 32.240 [1].
A configurable timer is supported in the CDF to supervise the reception of the
ACR[Interim] and/or ACR[Stop]. An instance of the \"Timer\" is started at the
beginning of the accounting session, reset on the receipt of an ACR[Interim]
and stopped at the reception of the ACR[Stop]. Upon expiration of the timer,
the CDF stops the accounting session with the appropriate error indication.
For offline charging, the CTF implements the accounting state machine
described in RFC 6733 [401].\ The server (CDF) implements the accounting state
machine \"SERVER, STATELESS ACCOUNTING\" as specified in RFC 6733 [401], i.e.
there is no order in which the server expects to receive the accounting
information.
The offline charging functionality is based on the Network Elements reporting
accounting information upon reception of various messages which trigger
charging generation, as most of the accounting relevant information is
contained in these messages. This reporting is achieved by sending Diameter
_Accounting Requests_ (ACR) [start, interim, stop and event] from the Network
Elements to the CDF.
Following the Diameter base protocol specification, the following \"types\" of
accounting data may be sent with regard to offline charging:
  * START session accounting data.
  * INTERIM session accounting data.
  * STOP session accounting data.
  * EVENT accounting data.
Two cases are currently distinguished for offline charging purposes:
  * Event based charging; and
  * Session based charging.
ACR types START, INTERIM and STOP are used for accounting data related to
successful sessions. In contrast, EVENT accounting data is unrelated to
sessions, and is used e.g. for a simple registration or interrogation and
successful service event triggered by a Network Element. In addition, EVENT
accounting data is also used for unsuccessful session establishment attempts.
The flows and scenarios for the above two described cases are further detailed
below.
### 6.1.1 Event based charging
In the case of event based charging, the network reports the usage or the
service rendered where the service offering is rendered in a single operation.
It is reported using the ACR[Event].
Figure 6.1.1.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Diameter
offline interface in order to perform event based charging. The operation may
alternatively be carried out prior to, concurrently with or after
service/content delivery.
Figure 6.1.1.1: Event based offline charging
> Step 1: The Network Element receives indication that service has been
> used/delivered.
>
> Step 2: The Network Element (acting as client) sends Accounting-Request
> (ACR) with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to EVENT_RECORD to indicate
> service specific information to the CDF (acting as server).
>
> Step 3: The CDF receives the relevant service charging parameters and
> processes accounting request.
>
> Step 4: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer message with Accounting-Record-
> Type AVP set to EVENT_RECORD to the Network Element in order to inform that
> charging information was received.
### 6.1.2 Session based charging
Session based charging is the process of reporting usage reports for a session
and uses the START, INTERIM and STOP accounting data. During a session, a
Network Element may transmit multiple ACR Interims\' depending on the
proceeding of the session.
Figure 6.1.2.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Diameter
offline interface in order to perform session based charging.
Figure 6.1.2.1: Session based offline charging
> Step 1: The Network Element receives a service request. The service request
> may be initiated either by the user or the other Network Element.
>
> Step 2: In order to start accounting session, the Network Element sends a
> Accounting-Request (ACR) with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to START_RECORD
> to the CDF.
Step 3: The CDF opens a CDR for current session.
> Step 4: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer (ACA) message with Accounting-
> Record-Type set to START_RECORD to the Network Element and possibly Acct-
> Interim-Interval AVP (AII) set to non-zero value indicating the desired
> intermediate charging interval.
>
> Step 5: When either AII elapses or charging conditions changes are
> recognized at Network Element (NE), the NE sends an Accounting-Request (ACR)
> with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to INTERIM_RECORD to the CDF.
Step 6: The CDF updates the CDR in question.
> Step 7: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer (ACA) message with Accounting-
> Record-Type set to INTERIM_RECORD to the Network Element.
>
> Step 8: The service is terminated.
>
> Step 9: The Network Element sends a Accounting-Request (ACR) with
> Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to STOP_RECORD to the CDF.
>
> Step 10: The CDF updates the CDR accordingly and closes the CDR.
>
> Step 11: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer (ACA) message with Accounting-
> Record-Type set to STOP_RECORD to the Network Element.
### 6.1.3 Offline charging error cases - Diameter procedures
#### 6.1.3.1 CDF connection failure
When the connection towards the primary CDF is broken, the process of sending
accounting information should continue towards a secondary CDF (if such a CDF
is configured). For further CDF connection failure functionality, see clause
\"_Transport Failure Detection_ \" in the RFC 6733 [401].
If no CDF is reachable the Network Element may buffer the generated accounting
data in non-volatile memory. Once the CDF connection is working again, all
accounting messages stored in the buffer is sent to the CDF, in the order they
were stored in the buffer.
#### 6.1.3.2 No reply from CDF
In case a Network Element does not receive an ACA in response to an ACR, it
may retransmit the ACR message. The waiting time until a retransmission is
sent, and the maximum number of repetitions are both configurable by the
operator. When the maximum number of retransmissions is reached and still no
ACA reply has been received, the Network Element executes the CDF connection
failure procedure as specified above.
If retransmitted ACRs\' are sent, they are marked with the T-flag as described
in RFC 6733 [401], in order to allow duplicate detection in the CDF, as
specified in the next clause 6.1.3.3.
#### 6.1.3.3 Duplicate detection
A Diameter client marks possible duplicate request messages (e.g.
retransmission due to the link fail over process) with the T-flag as described
in RFC 6733 [401].
If the CDF receives a message that is marked as retransmitted and this message
was already received, then it discards the duplicate message. However, if the
original of the re-transmitted message was not yet received, it is the
information in the marked message that is taken into account when generating
the CDR. The CDRs are marked if information from duplicated message(s) is
used.
#### 6.1.3.4 CDF detected failure
The CDF closes a CDR when it detects that expected Diameter ACRs for a
particular session have not been received for a period of time. The exact
behaviour of the CDF is operator configurable.
## 6.2 Message contents for offline charging
### 6.2.1 Summary of offline charging message formats
#### 6.2.1.1 General
The corresponding Diameter accounting application messages for the Charging
Data Transfer operation is Accounting-Request (ACR) and Accounting-Answer
(ACA) as specified in the Diameter Base Protocol Accounting (DBPA) application
in RFC 6733 [401].
Table 6.2.1.1.1 describes the use of these messages which are adapted for 3GPP
offline charging.
Table 6.2.1.1.1: Offline charging messages reference table
* * *
Command-Name Source Destination Abbreviation Accounting-Request CTF CDF ACR
Accounting-Answer CDF CTF ACA Capabilities-Exchange-Request CTF CDF CER
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer CDF CTF CEA
* * *
Additional Diameter messages (i.e. DPR/DPA, DWR/DWA)are used according to the
Diameter Base Protocol Accounting (DBPA) specification in RFC 6733 [401].
#### 6.2.1.2 Structure for the Accounting message formats
The following is the basic structure shared by all offline charging messages.
This is based directly on the format of the messages defined in the Diameter
Base Protocol Application specification in RFC 6733 [401].
Those Diameter Accounting AVPs that are used for 3GPP offline charging are
marked in table 6.2.2.1 and table 6.2.3.1 with a category as specified in TS
32.240 [1].
An AVP in grey strikethrough in the message format (in grey in the tables) is
not used by 3GPP.
The following symbols are used in the message format definition:
\- \ indicates a mandatory AVP with a fixed position in the message.
\- {AVP} indicates a mandatory AVP in the message.
\- [AVP] indicates an optional AVP in the message.
\- *AVP indicates that multiple occurrences of an AVP is possible.
### 6.2.2 Accounting-Request message
The ACR messages, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 271 is sent by
the CTF to the CDF in order to send charging information for the requested

## 6.3 Basic principles for Diameter online charging
### 6.3.1 Online Specific Credit-Control application requirements
For online charging, the basic functionality as defined by the IETF Diameter
Credit-Control Application is used.\ The basic structure follows a mechanism
where the online client (CTF) requests resource allocation and reports Credit-
Control information to the Online Charging System (OCS).
The usage and values of _Validity-Time_ AVP and the timer \"Tcc\" are under
the sole control of the Credit-Control server (OCS) and determined by operator
configuration of the OCS.
The online client implements the state machine described in RFC 4006 [402] for
\"CLIENT, EVENT BASED\" and/or \"CLIENT, SESSION BASED\". I.e. when the client
applies IEC it uses the \"CLIENT, EVENT BASED\" state machine, and when the
client applies ECUR defined in 3GPP it uses the \"CLIENT, SESSION BASED\"
state machine for the first and final interrogations.
The OCS implements the state machine described in RFC 4006 [402] for the
\"SERVER, SESSION AND EVENT BASED\" in order to support Immediate Event
Charging and Event Charging with Unit Reservation.
### 6.3.2 Diameter description on the Ro reference point
#### 6.3.2.1 Basic principles
For online charging the Diameter Credit-Control Application (DCCA) defined in
RFC 4006 [402] is used with additional AVPs defined in the present document.
Three cases for control of user credit for online charging are distinguished:
\- Immediate Event Charging IEC; and
\- event charging with unit reservation (ECUR).
\- Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
In the case of Immediate Event Charging (IEC),the Credit-Control process for
events is controlled by the corresponding _CC-Requested-Type_ EVENT_REQUEST
that is sent with Credit _-Control-Request (_ CCR) for a given Credit-Control
event.
In the case of Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) the _CC-Request-
Type_ INITIAL / TERMINATION_REQUEST are used for charging for a given Credit-
Control event, however, where a reservation is made prior to service delivery
and committed on execution of a successful delivery.
Session Charging with Unit Reservation is used for Credit-Control of sessions
and uses the _CC-Request-Type_ INITIAL / UPDATE and TERMINATION_REQUEST.
The Network Element may apply IEC, where CCR event messages are generated, or
ECUR, using CCR Initial and Termination. The decision whether to apply IEC or
ECUR is based on the service and/or operator\'s policy.
### 6.3.3 Immediate Event Charging (IEC)
Figure 6.3.3.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro reference
point in order to perform event based Direct Debiting operation. The Direct
Debiting operation may alternatively be carried out prior to service/content
delivery.\ the Network Element shall ensure that the requested service
execution is successful, when this scenario is used.

NOTE: It is possible to perform also, CHECK_BALANCE and PRICE_ENQUIRY using
above described mechanism RFC 4006 [402].
Figure 6.3.3.2 shows the transactions for refund purpose.

### 6.3.4 Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR)
Figure 6.3.4.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro reference
point in order to perform the ECUR. ECUR is used when event charging needs
separate reserve and commit actions.

NOTE: This scenario is supervised by corresponding timers (e.g. validity time
timer) that are not shown in the figure 6.3.4.1.
### 6.3.5 Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
Figure 6.3.5.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro reference
point in order to perform the SCUR.

NOTE: This scenario is supervised by corresponding timers (e.g. validity time
timer) that are not shown in figure 6.3.5.1.
### 6.3.6 Error cases and scenarios
#### 6.3.6.0 Introduction
This clause describes various error cases and how these should be handled.
The failure handling behaviour is locally configurable in the Network Element.
If the _Direct-Debiting-Failure-Handling_ or _Credit-Control-Failure-Handling_
AVP is not used, the locally configured values are used instead.
#### 6.3.6.1 Duplicate detection
The detection of duplicate request is needed and shall be enabled. To speed up
and simplify as much as possible the duplicate detection, the all-against-all
record checking should be avoided and just those records marked as potential
duplicates need to be checked against other received requests (in real-time )
by the receiver entity.
The Network Element marks the request messages that are retransmitted after a
link fail over as possible duplicates with the T-flag as described in RFC 6733
[401]. For optimized performance, uniqueness checking against other received
requests is only necessary for those records marked with the T-flag received
within a reasonable time window. This focused check is based on the inspection
of the _Session-Id_ and _CC-Request-Number_ AVP pairs.
Note that for EBCC the duplicate detection is performed in the Correlation
Function that is part of the OCS.\ The OCS that receives the possible
duplicate request should mark as possible duplicate the corresponding request
that is sent over the \'Rc\' reference point. However, this assumption above
is for further study and needs to be clarified.
For Credit-Control duplicate detection, please refer to the Diameter Credit-
Control.
#### 6.3.6.2 Reserve Units / Debit Units operation failure
In the case of an OCS connection failure, and/or receiving error responses
from the OCS, please refer to RFC 6733 [401] and RFC 4006 [402] for failure
handling descriptions.
### 6.3.7 Support of tariff changes during an active user session
#### 6.3.7.1 Support of tariff changes using the tariff switch mechanism
After a tariff switch has been reached, all the active user sessions shall
report their session usage by the end of the validity period of the current
request and receive new quota for resource usage for the new tariff period.
In order to avoid the need for mass simultaneous quota refresh, the traffic
usage can be split into resource usage before a tariff switch and resources
used after a tariff switch.
The Tariff-Time-Change AVP is used to determine the tariff switch time as
described by RFC 4006 [402].\ In addition to the scenarios described in RFC
4006 [402], the Tariff-Time-Change AVP may also be used in the context of
continuously time-based charging.
The Tariff-Change-Usage AVP is used within the Used-Service-Units AVP to
distinguish reported usage before and after the tariff time change.
The Tariff-Change-Usage AVP is not used directly within the Multiple-Services-
Credit-Control AVP.
#### 6.3.7.2 Support of tariff changes using Validity-Time AVP
Changes to the tariffs pertaining to the service during active user sessions
may also be handled using the Validity Time AVP.
NOTE: RFC 4006 [402] does not directly describe how tariff changes are handled
with validity time.\ If validity time is used for tariff time changes it might
overload the client and the server.
### 6.3.8 Support of re-authorization
Mid Diameter CC session re-authorizations of multiple active resource quotas
within a DCC session can be achieved using a single Diameter _Credit-Control-
Request/ Credit-Control- Answer_ message sequence.
The OCS may also re-authorize multiple active resource quotas within a DCC
session by using a single Diameter _Re-Auth-Request/Answer_ message sequence.
New quota allocations received by the Network Element override any remaining
held quota resources after accounting for any resource usage while the re-
authorization was in progress.
### 6.3.9 Support of failure handling
The Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP as defined in RFC 4006 [402]
determines what to do if the sending of Diameter credit-control messages to
the OCS has been temporarily prevented. The usage of Credit-Control-Failure-
Handling AVP gives flexibility to have different failure handling for credit-
control session.
This AVP may be received from the OCS or may be locally configured. The value
received from the OCS in the Diameter CCA message always override any already
existing value.
As defined in RFC 4006 [402], the Tx timer is introduced to limit the waiting
time in the CTF for an answer to the CCR sent to the OCS. When the Tx timer
elapses the CTF takes an action to the end user according to the value of the
Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP.
It is possible that several concurrent CCR messages are triggered for the same
online charging session. In this case, each CCR message shall reset the Tx
timer as defined in RFC 4006 [402].
### 6.3.10 Support of failover
As defined in RFC 4006 [402] if a failure occurs during an ongoing credit-
control session, the CTF may move the Credit-Control message stream to an
alternative OCS if the primary OCS indicated FAILOVER_SUPPORTED in the CC-
Session-Failover AVP. In case CC-Session-Failover AVP is set to FAILOVER_NOT
SUPPORTED the Credit-Control message stream is not moved to a backup OCS.
For new Credit-Control sessions, failover to an alternative OCS should be
performed if possible. For instance, if an implementation of the CTF can
determine primary OCS unavailability it can establish the new Credit-Control
sessions with a possibly available secondary OCS.
Since the OCS has to maintain session states, moving the credit-control
message stream to a backup OCS requires a complex charging context transfer
solution. This charging context transfer mechanism by OCS is out of the scope
of the 3GPP standardization work.
### 6.3.11 Credit pooling
Credit pooling shall be supported as described in TS 32.240 [1].
NOTE: Credit pooling is not applicable to IEC since there is no quota
management between CTF and OCF.
## 6.4 Message formats for online charging
### 6.4.1 Summary of online charging message formats
#### 6.4.1.1 General
The corresponding Diameter Credit-Control application messages for the Debit /
Reserve Unit Request operation is Credit-Control-Request (CCR) and for the
Debit / Reserve Unit Response operation is Credit-Control-Answer (CCA) as
specified in RFC 4006 [402].
The Diameter Credit-Control Application (DCCA) specifies an approach based on
a series of \"interrogations\":
1\. Initial interrogation.
2\. Zero, one or more interim interrogations.
3\. Final interrogation.
In addition to a series of interrogations, also a one time event
(interrogation) can be used e.g. in the case when service execution is always
successful.
All of these interrogations use CCR and CCA messages. The CCR for the
\"interim interrogation\" and \"final interrogation\" reports the actual
number of \"units\" that were used, from what was previously reserved. This
determines the actual amount debited from the subscriber\'s account.
Table 6.4.1.1.1 describes the use of these Diameter messages which are adapted
for 3GPP online charging.
Table 6.4.1.1.1: Online charging messages reference table
* * *
Command-Name Source Destination Abbreviation Credit-Control-Request CTF OCS
CCR Credit-Control-Answer OCS CTF CCA Capabilities-Exchange-Request CTF OCS
CER Capabilities-Exchange-Answer OCS CTF CEA
* * *
Additional Diameter messages (i.e. ASR/ASA, DPR/DPA, DWR/DWA, RAR/RAA) are
used according to the Diameter Base Protocol Accounting (DBPA) specification
in RFC 6733 [401] and to the DCCA specification in RFC 4006 [402].
#### 6.4.1.2 Structure for the Credit-Control message formats
The following is the basic structure shared by all online charging messages.
This is based directly on the format of the messages defined in RFC 4006
[402].
Those Diameter accounting AVPs that are used for 3GPP online charging are
marked in the table of contents 6.4.2 and 6.4.3 with a category as specified
in TS 32.240 [1].
In the definition of the Diameter commands, the AVPs that are specified in the
referenced specifications but not used by the 3GPP charging specifications are
marked with strikethrough, e.g. ~~[ Acct-Multi-Session-Id ]~~.
The following symbols are used in the message format definitions:
\- \ indicates a mandatory AVP with a fixed position in the message.
\- {AVP} indicates a mandatory AVP in the message.
\- [AVP] indicates an optional AVP in the message.
\- *AVP indicates that multiple occurrences of an AVP is possible.
### 6.4.2 Credit-Control-Request message
The CCR messages, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 is sent by
the CTF to the OCF in order to request credits for the request bearer /
subsystem /service.
The CCR message format is defined according to RFC 4006 [402] as follows:
\ ::= \
**\ 
{ Origin-Host }
{ Origin-Realm }
{ Destination-Realm }
{ Auth-Application-Id }
{ Service-Context-Id }
{ CC-Request-Type }
{ CC-Request-Number }

## 6.5 Other procedural description of the 3GPP charging applications
### 6.5.1 Re-Authorization
#### 6.5.1.1 Idle timeout
The server may specify an idle timeout associated with a granted quota using
the Quota-Holding-Time AVP.\ If no traffic associated with the quota is
observed for this time, the client shall understand that the traffic has
stopped and the quota is returned to the server. The client shall start the
quota holding timer when quota consumption ceases. This is always when traffic
ceases, i.e. the timer is re-started at the end of each packet. It applies
equally to the granted time quota and to the granted volume quota. The timer
is stopped on sending a CCR and re-initialised on receiving a CCA with the
previous used value or a new value of Quota-Holding-Time AVP if received.
Alternatively, if this AVP is not present, a locally configurable default
value in the client shall be used.\ A Quota-Holding-Time AVP value of zero
indicates that this mechanism shall not be used.
#### 6.5.1.2 Change of charging conditions
There are a number of mid-session service events (re-authorization triggers),
which could affect the rating of the current service usage, e.g. end user QoS
changes or location updates. When allocating resources, the server may
instruct the Credit-Control client to re-authorize the quota upon a number of
different session related triggers that can affect the rating conditions. The
server instruct the Network Element to monitor for such events by using the
Trigger AVP containing one or more Trigger-Type AVPs in the CCA command. These
events are in addition to the static triggers defined in the service specific
document (middle tier TS).
Once the OCS has armed one or more triggers using the Trigger AVP at the
Network Element, these triggers shall remain in effect until another Trigger
AVP is received for the same Rating Group, where the Network Element shall arm
all triggers present in the Trigger AVP and reset all other triggers. The
presence of the Trigger AVP without any Trigger-Type AVPs in a CCA allows OCS
to disable all the triggers that were armed in a previous Trigger AVP.
NOTE: This removes the need for the OCS to send trigger information in every
CCA message when they have not changed.
When one of the armed triggers happen, a credit re-authorization shall be sent
to the server including information related to the service event even if all
the granted service units have not been used. The quota is also being
reported.
For example, if the Trigger AVP is used, then the client shall only re-
authorize the quota for the service usage associated with events which were
included in the last received Trigger AVP.
If the server does not control the events for re-authorization using the
Trigger AVP, the Network Element shall only monitor for default events defined
in the relevant service specific document (middle tier TS).
#### 6.5.1.3 Reporting quota usage
The Credit-Control client shall report the quota usage under a number of
circumstances. When this happens, the reason for the quota being reported is
notified to the server through the use of the Reporting-Reason AVP in the CCR.
The reason for reporting credit usage can occur directly in the Multiple-
Services-Credit-Control AVP, or in the Used-Service-Units AVP, depending on
whether it applies for all quota types or a particular quota type
respectively. It shall not be used at command level. It shall always and shall
only be sent when usage is being reported.
When the reason is RATING_CONDITION_CHANGE, the Trigger AVP shall also be
included to indicate the specific armed trigger events which caused the
reporting and re-authorization request.
#### 6.5.1.4 Quota consumption
The consumption of quota is captured using mechanisms described in clause
6.5.1.3.
Volume quota is considered used or consumed in the normal way, corresponding
to actual traffic.
The consumption of time quota may be controlled by Quota-Consumption-Time as
described in clause 6.5.4, or by extended mechanisms as described in clause
6.5.7.
### 6.5.2 Threshold based Re-Authorization triggers
The server may optionally include as part of the Multiple-Services-Credit-
Control AVP, when it is providing a quota, an indication to the client of the
remaining quota threshold that shall trigger a quota re-authorization.\ The
Time-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the threshold in seconds when the granted
quota is time, and the Volume-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the threshold in
octets when the granted quota is volume.\ The Unit-Quota-Threshold AVP
indicates the threshold in service specific units, that are defined in the
service specific documents, when the granted quota is service specific.
If the threshold triggers were included along with the quota granted, the
Credit-Control client, then, shall seek re-authorization from the server for
the quota when the quota contents fall below the supplied threshold. The
client shall allow service to continue whilst the re-authorization is
progress, until the original quota had been consumed.
### 6.5.3 Termination action
The termination action is sent over the Ro reference point. Two different
approaches are specified:
\- The Final-Unit-Indication AVP with Final-Unit-Action TERMINATE does not
include any other information. When the user has consumed the final granted
units or zero quota has been granted by the OCS, the Network Element shall
terminate the service. This is the default handling applicable whenever the
client receives an unsupported Final-Unit-Action value. The Network Element
shall send CCR message with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
UPDATE_REQUEST and report the Used-Service-Unit AVP for the service that has
terminated, as defined in RFC 4006 [402].
\- Another termination action consists in re-directing packets corresponding
to a terminated service (consumption of the final granted units or zero quota
has been granted by the OCS) to an application server. This allows the client
to redirect user originated requests to a top-up server so that network access
can be re-instated. This functionality is achieved with the server returning a
\"REDIRECT\" and redirect-to URL in the Final-Units-Action AVP of the
Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP. Upon receiving this result code, the
Network Element shall apply the redirection. The URL should be categorized so
that the End-User\'s ability to reach it is guaranteed.
When zero quota has been granted by the OCS, the termination action shall be
enforced at the reception of the CCA message.
### 6.5.4 Quota consumption time
The server may optionally indicate to the client that the quota consumption
shall be stopped after a period equal to the Quota Consumption Time in which
no packets are received or at session termination, whichever is sooner. This
is indicated by including the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP in the CCA. The idle
period equal to the Quota Consumption Time is included in the reported usage.
The quota is consumed normally during gaps in traffic of duration less than or
equal to the Quota-Consumption-Time. Quota consumption resumes on receipt of a
further packet belonging to the service data flow.
If packets are allowed to flow during a CCR/CCA[Update] exchange, and the
Quota-Consumption-Time AVP value in the provided quota is the same as in the
previously provided quota, then the Quota-Consumption-Time runs normally
through this procedure. For example, if 5 seconds of a 10 second QCT timer
have passed when a CCR[Update] is triggered, and the CCA[Update] returns 2
seconds later, then the QCT timer will expire 3 seconds after the receipt of
the CCA and the remaining unaccounted 5 seconds of usage will be recorded
against the new quota even though no packets were transmitted with the new
quota.
In the case of a new quota with the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP, or when
packets are blocked during the CCR/CCA [Update] procedure then the Quota-
Consumption-Time stops running (if it was running) and quota consumption
begins again when the next service data flow packet matching the Charging Rule
is received.
If a Quota-Consumption-Time AVP value of zero is provided, or if no Quota-
Consumption-Time AVP is present in the CCA, the quota is consumed continuously
from the point at which it is granted.
### 6.5.5 Service termination
The OCF may determine that a service requires termination. The OCF may perform
this termination synchronously if it has a CCR pending processing by returning
CCA with Result-Code AVP with value DIAMETER-AUTHORIZATION-REJECTED. If the
OCF does not have a pending request (asynchronous), the OCF may trigger an ASR
to terminate the Diameter session related to the service. On reception of an
ASR, the CTF shall close the associated Credit-Control session by sending a
CCR [Terminate]. The behaviour of the CTF, in relation to the user session, on
reception of an ASR is detailed in the middle-tier TS. As an alternative to
the ASR, the OCF may trigger a RAR to which the CTF behaves as described in
RFC 4006 [402] and the OCF shall return a CCA with Result-Code AVP with value
DIAMETER-AUTHORIZATION-REJECTED for the resulting CCR.
### 6.5.6 Envelope reporting
#### 6.5.6.1 Envelope reporting in Online Charging
The OCF may determine the need for additional detailed reports identifying
start time and end times of specific activity in addition to the standard
quota management provided in RFC 4006 [402]. The OCF controls this by sending
a CCA[INITIAL] with Envelope-Reporting AVP. The OCF may request reports for
just time, time and volume, time and number of events, or time and volume and
number of events, through appropriate values in Envelope-Reporting AVP.
The time envelope of the activity to be reported is determined by the
mechanism indicated by the OCF in this CCA[INITIAL], to control the time quota
consumption in the CTF.
The selected mechanism is used by the CTF to generate the envelopes, reporting
the start and end of each time envelope, and the data volume transferred and /
or the number of events that occurred for the duration of the envelope
NOTE: Envelope reporting is independent of quota management (i.e. there is no
interaction).
#### 6.5.6.2 Envelope reporting in Offline Charging
When a particular time quota consumption mechanism is selected by the OCF, the
need for reporting detailed time envelopes in offline charging, may be
statically configured in the CTF or dynamically controlled by the OCF using
Offline-Charging AVP.
The selected time quota consumption mechanism is used by the CTF to generate
the envelopes, reporting the start and end of each time envelope, and the data
volume transferred and / or the number of events that occurred for the
duration of the envelope.
#### 6.5.6.3 Envelope reporting - Quota consumption time
In case the time quota consumption mechanism selected by the OCF is per clause
6.5.4, and the OCF indicated the need for envelope reporting,.the CTF, on
receiving the command, monitors the traffic for a period of time controlled by
the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP and reports each period as a single envelope
for each Quota-Consumption-Time expiry where there was traffic, in Envelope
AVP.
#### 6.5.6.4 Envelope reporting - Combinational quota
In case the time quota consumption mechanism selected by the OCF is per clause
6.5.7, and the OCF indicated the need for envelope reporting, the CTF, on
receiving the command, monitors the traffic based on information included in
Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP, and reports each corresponding envelope in the
Envelope AVP in the CCR.
In case of Continuous Time Period (CTP):
\- the first envelope starts on the first traffic, and subsequent envelopes
start on the first traffic following the closure of the previous envelope.
\- each envelope ends at expiry of the first base time interval which contains
no traffic.
The envelope for CTP includes the last base time interval, i.e. the one which
contained no traffic. The end of an envelope can only be determined
\"retrospectively\".
In case of Discrete Time Period (DTP), an envelope corresponds to exactly one
base time interval.
### 6.5.7 Combinational quota
The Quota-Consumption-Time mechanism, described in clause 6.5.4, may be
extended (and replaced) when granting time based quota to provide potentially
more efficient use of the online charging interface, i.e. reduced traffic and
the algorithms in the OCF are potentially simpler. The alternative handling
mechanisms that are defined in this clause are:
1\. Continuous Time Period (CTP)
2\. Discrete Time Period (DTP)
The mechanisms selected by the OCF is indicated to the CTF with the Time-
Quota-Mechanism AVP in the CCA.
The base time interval, specified by the Base-Time-Interval AVP, is a basic
unit for consuming quota. Quota is deemed to be consumed at the start of each
base time interval. The CTF shall allow traffic to pass for the duration of
the base time interval.
For DTP, the base time interval defines the length of the discrete time
period. Quota consumption resumes only on the first traffic following the
expiry of the DTP.
For CTP, quota consumption continues during consecutive base time intervals in
which traffic has occurred up to and including the first base time interval
which contains no traffic. Quota consumption shall be stopped after this first
base time interval expiry which contained no traffic. Quota consumption
resumes only on the first subsequent traffic.
If the CTF receives a Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP with both the
Quota-Consumption-Time AVP and Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP, then the Time-Quota-
Mechanism AVP takes precedence and the CTF shall behave accordingly.
### 6.5.8 Online control of offline charging information
The Offline-Charging AVP is used on the Ro interface by the OCS to control the
CTF in relation to the mechanism by which the CTF generates offline charging
information, e.g. for flow based charging controls the formation of service
data containers. The information contained, within the Offline-Charging AVP,
takes precedence over the default configuration at the CTF. If the Offline-
Charging AVP is not sent in the CCA, the OCS does not control the offline
charging mechanisms and therefore the default configuration at the CTF is
employed.
Controls over time usage, defined in clause 6.5.6 and clause 6.5.7, are
included.
### 6.5.9 Support of multiple service
The support of multiple services within a single Diameter session in 3GPP is
limited to services that are grouped in one of the middle tier TSs specified
through the _Service-Context-Id_ AVP.
### 6.5.10 Supported Features mechanism
#### 6.5.10.1 Introduction
Supported Features mechanism is used for 3GPP Charging Applications as
specified in TS 29.229 [204] clause 7.2, based on the Supported-Features AVP.
#### 6.5.10.2 Defining a feature
The concept of feature used by the Supported Features mechanism, applies under
a specific domain / subsystem / service, and is defined as an extension of the
base offline and online charging functionality specified in the corresponding
middle tier.
For each middle tier, the base functionality is the one specified by the 3GPP
Rel-14 version, and for any extension introduced from Rel-15, the Supported
Features mechanism is required.
For any middle tier created from Rel-15, the Supported Features mechanism is
required to be introduced.
Applicability of a feature is defined separately between offline (Rf) and
online(Ro) charging.
Any feature specified for offline and online charging, when invoked by the
client, is defined as mandatory to be supported by the server.
As specified in TS 29.229 [204] clause 7.1.1, if new AVPs are added as part of
the feature definition, they shall have the \'M\' bit cleared and shall not be
defined mandatory in the command ABNF.
#### 6.5.10.3 Supported Feature handling
Any request initiated by the client which makes use of a feature to construct
the request, and requires the feature to be supported by the server, shall
include the feature associated to the service-context in the Supported-
Features AVP.
The client shall include in the request feature(s) and only feature(s) which
are needed to construct the request.
In case multiple features are needed to construct the request, they shall all
be included by the client.
As defined in TS 29.229 [204], the Supported-Features AVP is of type grouped
and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs.
The value 10415 (3GPP) is used as Vendor-Id, and the Feature-List-ID and
Feature-List are defined per middle tier TS.
Upon receiving any initial Ro or Rf request for a specific domain / subsystem
/ service, which does not include any Supported-Features AVP, the server shall
include in the answer, if supported, Supported-Features AVPs identifying the
complete set of features supported by the server for this domain / subsystem /
service. This applies regardless of the answer is successful or not.
Upon receiving any initial Ro or Rf request for a specific domain / subsystem
/ service, which includes the Supported-Features AVP, the server shall behave
as follows:
\- If all features indicated in the Supported-Features AVP are supported, and
the process for online or offline charging is successful, a successful answer
with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS is returned and includes, if
supported, Supported-Features AVPs identifying the complete set of features
supported by the server for this domain / subsystem / service.
\- If not all the features indicated in the Supported-Features AVP are
supported, the answer is returned with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED and includes the Supported-Features AVPs
containing lists of all features supported by the server.
\- If Supported-Features AVP is not supported by the server, the answer is
returned, as per \'M\' bit set rule, with the Result-Code AVP set to
DIAMETER_AVP_UNSUPPORTED and a Failed-AVP AVP containing at least one
Supported-Features AVP as received in the request.
During the lifetime of the Diameter session, the client shall use the set of
features which are common between its own set of supported features and the
set of supported features indicated by the server during the Diameter session
establishment, in session based charging.

# 7 Summary of used Attribute Value Pairs
## 7.1 Diameter AVPs
### 7.1.0 General
The use of the Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) that are defined in the Diameter
Protocol is specified in clause 6.2 for offline charging and in clause 6.4 for
online charging. The information is summarized in the table 7.1.0.1 in
alphabetical order. Detailed specification of some of these AVPs is available
after the table and for the others can be found from RFC 6733 [401], RFC 4006
[402] and RFC 4005 [407].
Those Diameter AVPs that are used are marked \"M\", \"O~M~\" or \"Oc\" in the
following table.\ This implies that their content can be used by the CDF for
offline and by the OCF for online charging purposes.\ Those Diameter AVPs that
are not used are marked \"-\" in table 7.1.0.1.

### 7.1.10 Rating-Group AVP
The _Rating-Group_ AVP (AVP code 432), is defined in RFC 4006 [402]. It
contains the charging key (defined in TS 23.203 [218]). Each quota allocated
to a Diameter CC session has a unique Rating Group value as specified in RFC
4006 [402].
### 7.1.11 Result-Code AVP
This subclause defines new _Result-Code_ AVP (AVP code 268) values that shall
be supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to the present
document. The Result-Code AVP operates as described in RFC 6733 [401] and RFC
4006 [402]. The following result code descriptions are examples of the
possible uses for the code:
**Transient Failures (4xxx):**
4010 DIAMETER_END_USER_SERVICE_DENIED
> The OCF denies the service request due to service restrictions (e.g.
> terminate rating group) or limitations related to the end-user, for example
> the end-user\'s account could not cover the requested service.
4011 DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE
> The OCF determines that the service can be granted to the end user but no
> further Credit-Control\ needed for the service (e.g. service is free of
> charge or is treated for offline charging).
4012 DIAMETER_CREDIT_LIMIT_REACHED
> The OCF denies the service request since the end- user\'s account could not
> cover the requested service. If the CCR contained used-service-units they
> are deducted, if possible.
**Permanent Failures (5xxx):**
5003 DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED
> The OCF denies the service request in order to terminate the service for
> which credit is requested. For example this error code is used to inform IP
> CAN bearer has to be terminated in the CCR message or to inform blacklist
> the rating group in the Multiple-Service-Credit-Control AVP.
5030 DIAMETER_USER_UNKNOWN
The specified end user could not be found in the OCF.
5031 DIAMETER_RATING_FAILED
> This error code is used to inform the CTF that the OCF cannot rate the
> service request due to insufficient rating input, incorrect AVP combination
> or due to an AVP or an AVP value that is not recognized or supported in the
> rating. For Flow Based Charging this error code is used if the Rating group
> is not recognized. The Failed-AVP AVP MUST be included and contain a copy of
> the entire AVP(s) that could not be processed successfully or an example of
> the missing AVP complete with the Vendor-Id if applicable. The value field
> of the missing AVP should be of correct minimum length and contain zeroes.
### 7.1.12 Service-Context-Id AVP
The _Service-Context-Id_ AVP is defined in RFC 4006 [402]. It is of type
UTF8String and contains a unique identifier of the Diameter Credit-Control
service specific document that applies to the request.\ This is an identifier
allocated by the service provider/operator, by the service element
manufacturer or by a standardization body and MUST uniquely identify a given
Diameter Credit-Control service specific document. For offline charging, this
identifies the service specific document (\'middle tier\' TS) on which
associated CDRs should based. The format of the Service-Context-Id is:
\"extensions\".MNC.MCC.\"Release\".\"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\"
The 3GPP specific values for \"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\" are:
32251\@3gpp.org for PS charging
32253\@3gpp.org for CPDT charging
32254@3gpp.org for Exposure function API charging
32260\@3gpp.org for IMS charging
32270\@3gpp.org for MMS service charging
32271\@3gpp.org for LCS service charging
32272\@3gpp.org for PoC service charging
32273\@3gpp.org for MBMS service charging
32274\@3gpp.org for SMS service charging
32275@3gpp.org for MMTel service charging
32276\@3gpp.org for VCS charging
32277@3gpp.org for ProSe charging
32278\@3gpp.org for Monitoring Event charging
32280\@3gpp.org for AoC Service Information
32296\@3gpp.org for ABMF Rc information
The \"Release\" indicates the 3GPP Release the service specific document is
based upon e.g. 12 for Release 12.
As a minimum, \"Release\".\"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\" shall be used.
If the minimum is used all operator provisionable parameters (Oc and Om) are
optional.
The MNC.MCC identifies the operator implementing the service specific
document, which is used to determine the specific requirements for the
operator configurable parameters.
The \"extensions\" is operator specific information to any extensions in a
service specific document.
### 7.1.13 Service-Identifier AVP
The _Service-Identifier_ AVP (AVP code 439), is defined in RFC 4006 [402]. For
further details, please refer the middle-tier specification.
### 7.1.14 Used-Service-Unit AVP
The _Used-Service-Unit_ AVP (AVP code 446) is of type grouped as specified in
RFC 4006 [402]. It contains additional 3GPP specific charging parameters.
It has the following ABNF grammar:
\ ::= \
> [ Reporting-Reason ]
>
> [ Tariff-Change-Usage ]
>
> [ CC-Time ]
>
> ~~[ CC-Money ]~~
>
> [ CC-Total-Octets ]
[ CC-Input-Octets ]
[ CC-Output-Octets ]
[ CC-Service-Specific-Units ]
*[ Event-Charging-TimeStamp ]
~~*[ AVP ]~~
### 7.1.15 User-Name AVP
The _User-Name_ AVP (AVP code 1) contains the user name in the format of a NAI
according to RFC 6733 [401].
### 7.1.16 Vendor-Id AVP
The _Vendor-Id_ AVP (AVP code 266), as part of the grouped _Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id_ AVP, shall contain the value of 10415, which is the IANA
registered value for \'3GPP\' in TS 29.230 [206].
### 7.1.17 User-Equipment-Info AVP
The _User-Equipment-Info_ AVP (AVP code 458) is of type grouped and contains
the identity and capability of the terminal the subscriber is using for the
connection to network according to IETF RFC 4006 [402] with the following ABNF
grammar:
User-Equipment-Info ::= \
{ User-Equipment-Info-Type }
{ User-Equipment-Info-Value }
For PS charging, when the User-Equipment-Info-Type AVP (AVP code 459) is set
to IMEISV (0), the value within the User-Equipment-Info-Value AVP (AVP code
460) is of type OctetString and shall be a UTF-8 encoded hexadecimal. The
composition of the IMEISV follows the definition in TS 23.003 [224] . If only
IMEI is received a filler 'F' is used to make it 16 digits.
For IMS charging, when the User-Equipment-Info-Type AVP (AVP code 459) is set
to IMEISV (0), the value within the User-Equipment-Info-Value AVP (AVP code
460) is of type OctetString and shall be a UTF-8 encoded decimal. The
composition of the IMEISV follows the definition in TS 23.003 [224]. If only
IMEI is received the number of digits are truncated to 15.
## 7.2 3GPP specific AVPs
### 7.2.0 General
For the purpose of offline charging additional AVPs are used in ACR / ACA and
for online charging additional AVPs are used in CCR / CCA. All 3GPP specific
AVPs mentioned are relevant for both offline and online charging unless
specifically excluded. The information is summarized in the following table
7.2.0.1 along with the AVP flag rules.
The 3GPP Charging Application uses the value 10415 (3GPP) as _Vendor-Id._
Detailed descriptions of AVPs that are used specifically for 3GPP charging are
provided in the subclauses below the table. However, for AVPs that are just
borrowed from other applications only the reference (e.g. TS 29.229 [204]), is
provided in the following table and the detailed description is not repeated.
Where 3GPP RADIUS VSAs are re-used, they shall be translated to Diameter AVPs
as described in RFC 4005 [407] with the exception that the \'M\' flag shall be
set.

###### ## Annex B (normative): 3GPP Charging Diameter Overload Control
# B.1 DOIC (Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance)
## B.1.0 General
The Diameter Base Protocol, IETF RFC 6733 [401], uses the Protocol Error
\"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY\", in the Result_Code AVP of the answer to a related
request, as a mean for overload control. This is further enhanced using
generic DOIC (Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance) mechanism specified in
IETF RFC 7683 [403], which makes it possible for a server to indicate overload
situations to the clients before the server starts rejecting requests due to
overload and thus prevents retransmission of the requests.
This clause specifies the DOIC (Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance)
mechanism for Diameter charging applications.
## B.1.1 Reporting node
When the OCS needs to request a reduction in the traffic it is handling due to
an overload condition, it shall include the OC-OLR AVP in answer messages, as
defined in clause B.3. The OCS should include the OC-OLR AVP in the answer
messages for as long as the overload condition applies. This shall be based on
the OC-Supported-Features AVP, defined in clause B3, exchanged earlier.
How OCS determines that it is in an overload situation and the severity of the
overload is implementation dependent and based on operator policy.
## B.1.2 Reacting node
A CTF acting as a reacting node reports its supported overload capabilities in
the OC-Supported-Features AVP and applies the requested traffic reduction
received in OC-OLR AVPs in answer messages to corresponding applicable
requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 [33].
How it achieves the requested traffic reduction is implementation dependent.
# B.2 Diameter overload AVPs
## B.2.0 General
When the OCS determines the need to request a reduction in the traffic it is
handling due to an overload condition, it shall include the OC-OLR AVP in
answer messages, as defined in IETF RFC 7683 [403].
## B.2.1 3GPP-OC-Rating-Group AVP
The _OC-Rating-Group_ AVP (AVP code 1321), is of type Unsigned32. It contains
the charging key (defined in TS 23.203 [218]) that the overload control is
applied to, i.e. which Rating Groups should be restricted.
## B.2.2 3GPP-OC-Request-Type AVP
The _OC-Request-Type_ AVP (AVP code 1322), is of type Enumerated. It contains
the CC-Request-Type (defined in IETF RFC 4006 [402]) that the overload control
be applied to, i.e. which types of request that should be restricted. It has
the following values:
1 INITIAL_REQUEST
2 UPDATE_REQUEST
3 TERMINATION_REQUEST
4 EVENT_REQUEST
## B.2.3 3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction AVP
The _3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction_ AVP (AVP code 1320) is of type Grouped. It
details the for which Rating Group, type of requests or both the reduction,
due to overload, should be applied.
It has the following ABNF grammar:
> 3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction :: = \
>
> * [ 3GPP-OC-Rating-Group ]
>
> * [ 3GPP-OC-Request-Type ]
>
> [ OC-Reduction-Percentage ]
>
> * [ AVP ]
## B.2.4 OC-OLR AVP
The _OC-OLR_ AVP (AVP code 623) is of type Grouped. It has been extended
compared to the IETF RFC 7683 [403].
It has the following ABNF grammar:
> OC-OLR :: = \
>
> \
>
> \
>
> [ OC-Reduction-Percentage ]
>
> [ OC-Validity-Duration ]
>
> * [ 3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction ]
>
> * [ AVP ]
