# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.441 \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Requirements\".
**32.442 \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information
Service (IS)\".**
32.443 \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\".
32.445 \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) file format definition\".
The present document is part of a TS-family which describes the information
service necessary for the Telecommunication Management (TM) of 3G systems. The
TM principles and TM architecture are specified in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] and 3GPP
TS 32.102 [2].
Trace provides very detailed information on call level for a specific
subscriber or MS. This data is an additional information source to Performance
Measurements and allows deeper investigations in problems solving or in case
of optimization.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the mechanism used for control and
configuration of the Trace, Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) and Radio Link
Failure (RLF) reporting functionality through Itf-N. This specification is
applicable to UMTS networks and EPS networks. GSM Trace is outside of the
scope of this specification.
The conditions for supporting Network Sharing are stated in 3GPP TS 32.441
[13].

### 5.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause introduces the set of Information Object Classes (IOCs) that
encapsulate information within the IRPAgent. The intent is to identify the
information required for the TraceIRP implementation of its operations and
notification emission. This clause provides the overview of all support object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these support object classes.

## 5.3 Information object class definitions
### 5.3.1 TraceJob
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
It represents a task that controls the Trace Sessions and collects the trace
data (i.e. collects the TraceRecord of multiple ManagedEntity instances). The
TraceReference is a unique ID, which identifies the Trace Session that has
been created by the TraceJob and activated to one or multiple ManagedEntity
instance(s).
It represents also the task that controls the UE based network performance
measurements.
When a TraceJob is created the following attributes cannot be modified via the
Itf-N:
\- TraceReference
\- ListOfInterfaces
\- ListofNeTypes
\- TraceDepth
\- TraceTarget
\- TriggeringEvent
\- JobType
\- areaScope
\- ListOfMeasurements
\- ReportingTrigger
\- ReportInterval
\- ReportAmount
\- EventThreshold
\- LoggingInterval
\- LoggingDuration
\- IPAddressOfTCE
\- AnonymizationofMDTData
\- MeasurementPeriodLTE
\- MeasurementPeriodUMTS
\- CollectionPeriodRrmUmts
\- CollectionPeriodRrmLte
\- PositioningMethod
\- MeasurementQuantity
\- PLMNTarget
\- MBSFNAreaList
If for any reason the TraceIRP determines that a Trace Session has been
activated in its ManagedEntity(ies) the TraceIRP shall emit the
\"noitfyTraceSessionLocalActivation\" notification to the subscribed
IRPManagers to inform the active Trace Sessions. The IRPManagers can decide
whether they deactivate the Trace Session or keep the Trace Session active.
(E.g. if the TraceReference is colliding with an existing TraceJob's
TraceReference, the IRPManager may decide to immediately deactivate the Trace
Session in that ManagedEntity.)
The TraceJob shall use its information to activate and configure Trace
Session(s) in the requested ManagedEntity instance(s). When the TraceIRP
determines that there are available TraceRecord files, it shall emit a
notification to all subscribed IRPManagers informing the availability of the
files. The method and the notification of the available files is described in
the File Transfer IRP (3GPP TS 32.342 [7]).
If a TraceJob receives an indication from one of its ManagedEntity that
starting a Trace Recording Session is failed for any reason, the
\"notifyTraceRecordingSessionFailure\" notification may be emitted to inform
all subscribed IRPManagers that there was a Trace Recording Session that was
not started in the ManagedEntity.

## 6.2 Generic rules
\- **Rule 1:** each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 2:** each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where
\"xxx\" is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition
indicates that the operation supports the named optional input parameter.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 3:** each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
NOTE: These rules are mapped at the solution set level. Pre-conditions and
exceptions, generated by these rules, need not appear explicitly in the
present document.
## 6.3 TraceIRPManagement (M)
### 6.3.1 Operation activateTraceJob (M)
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
This operation support IRPManager's request to create a TraceJob through
Itf-N.
Once the TraceJob has been created, the attributes of the TraceJob will not be
modified during the lifetime of the TraceJob.
One TraceJob can manage Trace Sessions in one or more ManagedEntity.
