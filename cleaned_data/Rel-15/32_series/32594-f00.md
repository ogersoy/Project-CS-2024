# 4 CM data format definition
This clause describes the format of Configuration Management data.
## 4.1 File content description
Table 4.1 lists all the file content items, provides and explanation of the
individual items, and maps the file content items to those used in the XML
schema based file format definitions. XML tag attributes are useful where data
values bind tightly to its parent element. They have been used where
appropriate.
Table 4.1 File Content Description and Mapping of File Content Items to XML
tags
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | File Content Item | XML schema based XML | Description | | | tag | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | configDataCollection | configDataFile | This is the | | | | top-level tag, which | | | | identifies the file | | | | as a collection of | | | | config data. The | | | | file content is made | | | | up of a header | | | | (\" | | | | configFileHeader\"), | | | | the collection of | | | | configuration items | | | | (\"configData\"), | | | | and a configfile | | | | footer | | | | (\" | | | | configFileFooter\"). | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | configFileHeader | fileHeader | This is the | | | | configuration data | | | | file header to be | | | | inserted in each | | | | file. It includes a | | | | version indicator, | | | | the sender name, and | | | | vendor name of the | | | | sending network | | | | node. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | configData | configData | The \"configData\" | | | | construct represents | | | | the sequence of zero | | | | or more | | | | configuration | | | | parameter items | | | | contained in the | | | | file. | | | | | | | | Each \"configData\" | | | | element contains the | | | | name of the NE | | | | (\"nEId\") and the | | | | list of parameters | | | | to be | | | | created,modified or | | | | deleted which | | | | pertaining to that | | | | NE | | | | | | | | The \"configData\" | | | | consists of | | | | DeviceData, | | | | DiagnosticsData, and | | | | FAPServiceData | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | configFileFooter | fileFooter | The configuration | | | | data file footer to | | | | be inserted in each | | | | file. It includes a | | | | time stamp, which | | | | refers to the time | | | | when the file is | | | | closed for sending | | | | to the NE. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | fileFormatVersion | fileHeader | This parameter | | | fileFormatVersion | identifies the file | | | | format version | | | | applied by the | | | | sender. The format | | | | version defined in | | | | the present document | | | | shall be the | | | | abridged number and | | | | version of this 3GPP | | | | document (see | | | | below). | | | | | | | | The abridged number | | | | and version of a | | | | 3GPP document is | | | | constructed from its | | | | version specific | | | | full reference | | | | \"3GPP [...] | | | | (yyyy-mm)\" by: | | | | | | | | - removing the | | | | leading \"3GPP TS\" | | | | | | | | - removing | | | | everything including | | | | and after the | | | | version third digit, | | | | representing | | | | editorial only | | | | changes, together | | | | with its preceding | | | | dot character | | | | | | | | - from the | | | | resulting string, | | | | removing leading and | | | | trailing white | | | | space, replacing | | | | every multi | | | | character white | | | | space by a single | | | | space character and | | | | changing the case of | | | | all characters to | | | | uppercase. | | | | | | | | e.g. \"32.594 V9.0\" | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | senderName | fileHeader | The senderName | | | senderName | uniquely identifies | | | | the NE or EM that | | | | assembled this alarm | | | | reporting file by | | | | its Distinguished | | | | Name (DN), according | | | | to the definitions | | | | in 3GPP TS 32.300 | | | | [4]. In the case | | | | of the NE-based | | | | approach, it is | | | | identical to the | | | | sender\'s | | | | \"nE | | | | DistinguishedName\". | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | vendorName | fileHeader | The \"vendorName\" | | | vendorName | identifies the | | | | vendor of the | | | | equipment that | | | | provided the | | | | measurement file. | | | | The string may be | | | | empty (i.e. string | | | | size =0) if the | | | | \"vendorName\" is | | | | not configured in | | | | the sender. | | | | | | | | For the XML schema | | | | based XML format, | | | | XML attribute | | | | specification | | | | \"vendorName\" may | | | | be absent in case | | | | the \"vendorName\" | | | | is not configured in | | | | the sender. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | neId | managedElement | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | neUserName | managedElement | \"userLabel\" may be | | | userLabel | absent in case the | | | | \"nEUserName\" is | | | | not configured in | | | | the CM applications. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | neDistinguishedName | managedElement | The DN is split into | | | localDn | the DN prefix and | | | | the Identifier of | | | | the Managed Object | | | | (see 3GPP TS 32.592 | | | | [9]). \"localDn\" | | | | may be absent in | | | | case the Identifier | | | | of the Managed | | | | Object is not | | | | configured in the CM | | | | applications | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | neSoftwareVersion | managedElement | \"swVersion\" may be | | | swVersion | absent in case the | | | | \ | | | | "nESoftwareVersion\" | | | | is not configured in | | | | the CM applications. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Modifier | configData modifier | This element is | | | | present if the HMS | | | | is required to | | | | inform the NE | | | | whether the | | | | parameter | | | | information should | | | | be used to create, | | | | update or delete an | | | | specific object | | | | instance on the | | | | HNB.. | | | | | | | | If not present the | | | | NE will assume the | | | | modification action | | | | is update | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | HNBDataParameters | configData | These elements are | | | DeviceInfo | present if the HMS | | | | requires to modify | | | configData | the specific | | | ManagementServer | configuration | | | | parameters | | | configData Time | | | | | The XML file format | | | FAPService DNPrefix | definitions | | | | implement the | | | FAPService | configuration | | | FAPControl | structure and | | | | parameter | | | FAPService | definitions defined | | | Access | in 3GPP TS 32.592 | | | ManagementParameters | [9] and broadband | | | | forum TR-098 | | | FAPService | Amendment 2 [16]. | | | CellConfig | | | | | | | | FAPService | | | | TransportParameters | | | | | | | | FAPService | | | | LTEREMParameters | | | | | | | | FAPService GPS | | | | | | | | FAPService | | | | SecurityParameters | | | | | | | | FAPService | | | | Location | | | | ManagementParameters | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | timestamp | fileFooter dataTime | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
A vendor MAY extend the standardized parameter list with vendor-specific
parameters and objects. Vendor-specific parameters and objects MAY be defined
either in a separate naming hierarchy or within the standardized naming
hierarchy of the XML File Format.
The name of a vendor-specific parameter or object not contained within another
vendor-specific object MUST have the following form to align with the Vendor
Specific Parameter Definition of TR-098 Amendment 2 [16].
  * X_\_VendorSpecificName

# 5 PM data format definition
## 5.1 Mapping table
Table 5.1 maps the PM file content items in the 3GPP TS 32.592 [9] document to
those used in the XML schema based file format definitions. XML tag attributes
are useful where data values bind tightly to its parent element. They have
been used where appropriate.

The representation of all timestamps in PM files shall follow the
representations allowed by the ISO 8601 [19].
The precise format for timestamp representation shall be determined by the
technology used for encoding the PM file (e.g. XML DTD, XML Schema). The
choice of technology should ensure that this representation is derived from
ISO 8601 [19]. Based on the representation used, the timestamp shall refer to
either UTC time or local time or local time with offset from UTC.
