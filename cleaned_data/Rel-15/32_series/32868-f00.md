# Introduction
With the ever-increasing demand on mobile broadband services, LTE and WLAN
integration, as one way of utilizing unlicensed spectrum, remains to be
important for 3GPP operators.
3GPP has defined the LWA (LTE-WLAN Aggregation) and LWIP (LTE/WLAN Radio Level
Integration Using IPsec Tunnel) as the key solutions for LTE and WLAN
integration, see 3GPP TS 36.300 [2].
The LWA and LWIP allow the UE in RRC_CONNECTED to be configured by the eNB to
utilize the radio resources of WLAN.
The LWA aggregates the user data at PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol)
level, and delivers the LWAAP (LTE-WLAN Aggregation Adaptation Protocol) PDUs
between eNB and WT (WLAN Termination). LWA supports both co-located and non-
co-located deployment scenarios.
LWIP integrates the LTE and WLAN at IP level, and connects the eNB and WLAN
over IP. The IP Packets (user data) transferred between the UE and LWIP-SeGW
are encapsulated using IPsec to provide security to the packets that traverse
WLAN. The IP packets are then transported between the LWIP-SeGW and eNB.
The present document studies the OAM aspects of LWA and LWIP.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies the following OAM aspects of LWA (for both co-
located and non-co-located deployment scenarios) and LWIP, based on the
solutions defined by 3GPP RAN WGs:
\- the WLAN related information needs to be configured to the eNB to support
LWA and LWIP.
\- how the 3GPP management system manages the WT function for the case that
the WT function is implemented in a non-3GPP NE (e.g., WLAN AC, WLAN AP).
\- the management model for WT for co-located and non-co-located LWA
deployment scenarios.
\- the performance measurements to monitor the LWA and LWIP.
\- the FM (Fault Management) of LWA and LWIP.
The study also makes conclusions on the potential solution(s), and provides
recommendations for the normative work based on the conclusions of the study.

# 4 Background and concepts
## 4.1 LWA concepts
### 4.1.1 LWA relation
In the non-collocated LWA scenario, the WLAN Termination (WT) terminates the
Xw interface for WLAN. In the collocated LWA scenario the interface between
LTE and WLAN is up to implementation.
The deployment of eNB and WLAN APs may have the following characteristics, as
shown in Figure 4.1.1-1:
\- one eNB may overlay a specific set of the WLAN APs;
\- one WLAN may be overlaid by multiple eNBs;
\- the WLAN AP overlaid by an eNB, may or may not support LWA feature;
\- one WT may support a specific set of WLAN APs, which may be overlaid by the
same or different eNB(s);
\- one WT may have Xw interface with multiple eNBs.
Figure 4.1.1-1: Deployment of eNB and WLAN APs
An LWA relation represents a pair of eNB and WLAN AP, between which the LWA
can be performed.
Examples of the LWA relation, based on Figure 4.1.1-1, are eNB #1 - WLAN AP
#8, eNB #1 - WLAN AP #17, and eNB #2 - WLAN AP #17.
# 5 Use cases
## 5.1 Use cases on management of LWA
### 5.1.1 Configuration Management use cases for LWA
#### 5.1.1.1 Provision of WLAN information to WT for non-collocated LWA
##### 5.1.1.1.1 Issues
In the non-collocated LWA, to enable the eNB to perform the LWA (LTE WLAN
Aggregation) for a UE, the WT needs to provide the WLAN information (see
clause 9.2.7 of TS 36.463 [3]) to the eNB by Xw-AP, during the Xw Setup
procedure and WT Configuration Update procedure.
The WLAN information needs to be provisioned to the WT, which then can provide
it to the eNB as above-mentioned.
##### 5.1.1.1.2 Pre-conditions
The WT is deployed for non-collocated LWA.
##### 5.1.1.1.3 Description
NM requests the EM to provision the WLAN information to the WT. Since one WT
may have Xw interface with multiple eNBs, the LWA relations (see clause 4.1.1)
also need to be provisioned.
EM configures the WLAN information and LWA relations to WT.
The WLAN information needs to contain at least one of the BSS Item, the SSID,
and/or the HESSID IEs (see clause 9.2.7 of TS 36.463 [3]).
When the Xw Setup procedure is initiated by the NB, the WT provides the WLAN
information to the eNB during Xw Setup procedure (see clause 9.1.2 of TS
36.463 [3]) based on the provisioned WLAN information and LWA relations.
If the WLAN information or LWA relation provisioned by OAM is changed and it
impacts an existing Xw interface, the WT updates the WLAN information to the
eNB by WT Configuration Update procedure (see clause 9.1.6 of TS 36.463 [3]).
The WT may not provide all of the WLAN information received from NM/EM to an
eNB, but only provide the information needed for LWA with the eNB.
##### 5.1.1.1.4 Post-conditions
The WLAN information and LWA relation are provisioned to the WT for non-
collocated LWA.
#### 5.1.1.2 Provision of WLAN information to eNB for collocated LWA
##### 5.1.1.2.1 Issues
In the collocated LWA, the interface between LTE and WLAN is up to
implementation. The WLAN information is needed by the eNB to perform the LWA
operation (e.g., WT Addition Preparation to allocate the WLAN resources for
specific E-RABs to the UE).
So, WLAN information needs to be provisioned to the eNB for the collocated
LWA.
##### 5.1.1.2.2 Pre-conditions
The collocated LWA is supported by the eNB.
##### 5.1.1.2.3 Description
NM requests EM to provision the WLAN information for collocated LWA to the
eNB.
EM configures the WLAN information to the eNB.
The WLAN information needs to contain at least one of the BSS (Basic Service
Set), the SSID, and/or the HESSID IEs (see clause 9.2.7 of TS 36.463 [3]).
##### 5.1.1.2.4 Post-conditions
The WLAN information is provisioned to the eNB for collocated LWA.5.2 Use
cases on management of LWIP.
#### 5.1.1.3 Configuration of WLAN mobility sets for LWA
##### 5.1.1.3.1 Issues
WLAN mobility set is the fundamental information to enable the mobility for
LWA (both collocated LWA and non-collocated LWA). The UE configured with LWA
bearer(s) may perform mobility between WLAN APs belonging to the mobility set
without informing the eNB.
A UE is connected to at most one mobility set at the same time.
All APs belonging to a mobility set share a common WT which terminates Xw-C
and Xw-U.
One eNB may have multiple WLAN mobility sets, because:
1) WLAN APs may be distributed in different locations thus have different
coverages;
2) the eNB may connect to multiple WTs.
The WLAN mobility sets need to be established and maintained correctly to
ensure the UE mobility works properly for LWA.
Operator needs to be able to configure the WLAN mobility sets, since operator
may have some information that eNB does not have, such as the location,
capability and capacity of the WLAN APs. The configuration of WLAN mobility
set may include creation of a WLAN mobility set, addition/modification/removal
of WLAN AP information to/in/from a WLAN mobility set, and deletion of a WLAN
mobility set.
##### 5.1.1.3.2 Pre-conditions
The LWA feature is deployed.
##### 5.1.1.3.3 Description
NM requests the EM to configure the WLAN mobility sets to an eNB for LWA (both
collocated LWA and non-collocated LWA). The configuration request may be one
or more of the following:
\- creation of a WLAN mobility set;
\- modification of a WLAN mobility set, including
\- addition of WLAN AP information to the WLAN mobility set;
\- modification of WLAN AP information in the WLAN mobility set;
\- removal of WLAN AP information from a WLAN mobility set;
\- deletion of a WLAN mobility set.
EM configures the eNB with the WLAN mobility set accordingly.
The eNB configures mobility set information, which may be the full set or
subset of a WLAN mobility set provided by NM/EM, to a UE. For example if some
WLAN AP is overloaded, it may not be included in the mobility set information
configured to the UE.
For non-collocated LWA, the eNB propagates the mobility set information that
is configured to the UE to WT.
##### 5.1.1.3.4 Post-conditions
The WLAN mobility sets are configured.
### 5.1.2 Performance Management use cases for LWA
#### 5.1.2.0 General
The value of the performance measurements related to the use cases described
in clause 5.1.2 depend on whether there are UEs supporting LWA during the
collection period. The measurement value is zero if the LWA is in operation on
the eNB but no UEs are supporting LWA during the collection period.
#### 5.1.2.1 Monitoring of user data transmission on Xw interface for non-
collocated LWA
##### 5.1.2.1.1 Issues
In the non-collocated LWA scenario, the Xw user plane interface (Xw-U) is
defined between eNB and WT. The Xw-U interface supports flow control based on
feedback from WT.
The Xw-U interface is used to deliver LWAAP PDUs between eNB and WT.
For LWA, the S1-U terminates in the eNB and, if Xw-U user data bearers are
associated with E-RABs for which the LWA bearer option is configured, the user
plane data is transferred from eNB to WT using the Xw-U interface.
Figure 5.1.2.1.1-1: U-Plane connectivity of eNB and WT for LWA
Operator needs to know the performance regarding user data transmission over
Xw interface for LWA.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 Pre-conditions
The non-collocated LWA is in operation.
##### 5.1.2.1.3 Description
The eNB and/or WT generates performance measurements related to user data
transmission over Xw interface for LWA, and reports to EM (how the eNB/WT
reports the PM data to EM is vendor specific). The performance measurements
are about:
\- User data volume transmitted over Xw interface for DL and UL. The data may
be split to subcounters per WLAN.
\- Successful rate of the user data transmission over Xw interface.
\- The number of UEs associated with WLAN in a WT.
\- The number of UEs who have transmitted data via a WT. The data may be split
to subcounters per WLAN.
The EM informs NM that the PM data file is ready with the information about
file name, file location, etc.
NM gets the PM data file according to the file information provided by EM.
##### 5.1.2.1.4 Post-conditions
The NM gets the performance measurements related to user data transmission
over Xw interface for LWA.
#### 5.1.2.2 Monitoring of XwAP procedures for non-collocated LWA
##### 5.1.2.2.1 Issues
The Xw Application Protocol (XwAP) procedures (see 3GPP TS 36.463 [3]) of the
control plane between an eNB and WT are essential for the non-collocated LWA.
The XwAP procedures may be UE-associated or non UE-associated.
The WT Configuration Update, WLAN Status Reporting and LTE-WLAN Aggregation
procedures are essential to the performance of LWA to be executed for the UE,
thus the performance of these XwAP procedures needs to be monitored.
##### 5.1.2.2.2 Pre-conditions
The non-collocated LWA is in operation.
##### 5.1.2.2.3 Description
The eNB and/or WT generate the performance measurements for the following XwAP
procedures and report to EM (how the eNB/WT reports the PM data to EM is
vendor specific):
\- WT Configuration Update (i.e. the number of attempts, successes/failures);
\- WLAN Status Reporting (i.e. the number of requests, successes/failures);
\- LTE-WLAN Aggregation procedures (i.e. the number of attemtps/requests,
successes/failures), including WT Addition, WT Association Confirmation, eNB
Initiated WT Modification, WT Initiated WT Modification, eNB Initiated WT
Release and WT Initiated WT Release).
The EM informs NM that the PM data file is ready with the information about
file name, file location, etc.
NM gets the PM data file according to the file information provided by EM.
##### 5.1.2.2.4 Post-conditions
The NM gets the performance measurements related to XwAP procedures for non-
collocated LWA.
#### 5.1.2.3 Monitoring of RRC procedures for LWA
##### 5.1.2.3.1 Issues
The following RRC procedures (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [6]) between eNB and UE are
essential to LWA (both collocated LWA and non-collocated LWA):
\- LWA WLAN mobility set configuration;
\- WLAN connection status reporting;
\- LWA specific DRB addition or reconfiguration.
The performance of these RRC procedures needs to be monitored for LWA (both
collocated LWA and non-collocated LWA).
##### 5.1.2.3.2 Pre-conditions
The LWA is in operation.
##### 5.1.2.3.3 Description
The eNB and/or WT generate the performance measurements for the following RRC
procedures and report to EM (how the eNB/WT reports the PM data to EM is
vendor specific):
\- LWA WLAN mobility set configuration (i.e. the number of attempts,
successes/failures);
\- WLAN connection status reporting (i.e. the number of successful
associations, connection failures);
\- LWA specific DRB addition or reconfiguration (i.e. the number of attempted
additions, successful/failed additions, attempted reconfigurations,
successful/failed reconfigurations).
The EM informs NM that the PM data file is ready with the information about
file name, file location, etc.
NM gets the PM data file according to the file information provided by EM.
##### 5.1.2.3.4 Post-conditions
The NM gets the performance measurements related to RRC procedures above-
mentioned for LWA.
### 5.1.3 Fault Management use cases for LWA
#### 5.1.3.1 Alarm monitoring for non-collocated LWA
##### 5.1.3.1.1 Issues
For the non-collocated LWA scenario, operator needs to know whether the non-
collocated LWA is running healthily. Therefore, operator needs to monitor the
alarms related to the non-collocated LWA, such as the fault on a WT, or the
malfunction of an Xw interface. When necessary, operator needs to take actions
to solve the problems.
##### 5.1.3.1.2 Pre-conditions
The non-collocated LWA is in operation.
##### 5.1.3.1.3 Description
EM monitors the alarms related to the non-collocated LWA, including the alarms
for a WT and the alarms for an Xw interface.
EM reports the alarms related to the non-collocated LWA to NM. The alarms
reported to NM need to include some detailed information such as probable
cause, location of the faulty part (e.g., WT, WLAN AP connected to a WT, or Xw
eNB or WT side of the Xw interface), to facilitate operator to solve the
problems.
NM takes appropriate actions to solve the problems when necessary.
##### 5.1.3.1.4 Post-conditions
The NM has received the alarms related to non-collocated LWA if any.
## 5.2 Use cases on management of LWIP
### 5.2.1 Configuration Management use cases for LWIP
#### 5.2.1.1 Configuration of eNB for LWIP
##### 5.2.1.1.1 Issues
The overall architecture for LWIP is illustrated in figure 5.2.1.1.1-1 below
as defined in TS 36.300 [2].
{width="3.2194444444444446in" height="3.0756944444444443in"}
Figure 5.2.1.1.1-1: LWIP Overall Architecture
The IP Packets transferred between the UE and LWIP-SeGW are encapsulated using
IPsec in order to provide security to the packets that traverse WLAN. The IP
packets are then transported between the LWIP-SeGW and eNB. The end to end
path between the UE and eNB via the WLAN network is referred to as the LWIP
tunnel.
For the DL of a data bearer, the packets received by the eNB from the IPsec
tunnel are forwarded directly to upper layers.
UL bearer packets sent over the LWIP tunnel are encapsulated using LWIPEP as
specified in _TS 36.361 [5]._
_Operator needs to configure the eNB with necessary information (e.g., IP
address, location) for LWIP, such as the IP address of_ LWIP-SeGW and
identifiers (BSSID, HESSID and SSID of WLAN APs for LWIP.
##### 5.2.1.1.2 Pre-conditions
The LWIP feature is deployed.
##### 5.2.1.1.3 Description
NM requests the EM to configure the eNB with LWIP related information, which
includes:
\- IP address of each LWIP-SeGW, which is to be used by UE to establish the
IPsec tunnel with LWIP-SeGW, and to be used by the eNB to setup connection
with LWIP-SeGW for the LWIP tunnel.
\- Identifiers (BSSID, HESSID and SSID) of WLAN APs for LWIP.
EM configures the eNB with the LWIP related information accordingly.
The eNB uses the configured information for LWIP.
##### 5.2.1.1.4 Post-conditions
The LWIP related information is configured to the eNB.
#### 5.2.1.2 Configuration of WLAN mobility sets for LWIP
The use case on configuration of WLAN mobility sets for LWA described in
subclause 5.1.1.3 is applicable to configuration of WLAN mobility sets for
LWIP, except the WT related procedures and collocated/non-collocated concept
do not apply to LWIP.
### 5.2.2 Performance Management use cases for LWIP
#### 5.2.2.0 General
The value of the performance measurements related to the use cases described
in clause 5.2.2 depend on whether there are UEs supporting LWIP during the

on the eNB but no UEs are supporting LWIP during the collection period.
#### 5.2.2.1 Monitoring of user data transmission via WLAN for LWIP
##### 5.2.2.1.1 Issues
As shown in the figure below, the IP Packets transferred between the UE and
LWIP-SeGW are encapsulated using IPsec in order to provide security to the
packets that traverse WLAN. The end to end path between the UE and eNB via the
WLAN network is referred to as the LWIP tunnel.
Figure 5.2.2.1.1-1: LWIP Protocol Architecture
A single IPSec tunnel is used per UE for all the data bearers that are
configured to send and/ or receive data over WLAN. Each data bearer may be
configured so that traffic for that bearer can be routed over the IPsec tunnel
in only downlink, only uplink, or both uplink and downlink over WLAN. SRBs are
carried over LTE only. eNB configures specific bearer(s) to use the IPsec
tunnel.
Operator needs to know the performance regarding user data transmission via
WLAN for LWIP.
##### 5.2.2.1.2 Pre-conditions
The LWIP is in operation.
##### 5.2.2.1.3 Description

via WLAN for LWIP, and reports to EM (how the eNB reports the PM data to EM is
vendor specific). The performance measurements may include:
\- User data volume transmitted or received via WLAN. The data may be split to
subcounters per WLAN AP.
\- The number of UEs associated with WLAN for LWIP.
\- The number of UEs who have transmitted or received data via a WLAN for
LWIP. The data may be split to subcounters per WLAN AP.
The EM informs NM that the PM data file is ready with the information about
file name, file location, etc.
NM gets the PM data file according to the file information provided by EM.

## 7.3 Potential solutions for Fault Management of LWA and LWIP
This subclause provides the potential solutions for the use case on \"Alarm
monitoring for non-collocated LWA\" as described in clause 5.1.3.1 and the
corresponding requirements **REQ-FM_NonCo_LWA_CON-1** as documented in clause
6.1.3, and the use case on \"Alarm monitoring for LWIP\" as described in
clause 5.2.3.1 and the corresponding requirements **REQ-FM_LWIP_CON-1** as
documented in clause 6.2.3.
The Alarm IRP is applicable to manage the alarms for LWA and LWIP with no
changes needed. The fault of LWA and LWIP may be caused by the fault of WLAN
AP, therefore the WLAN alarm notification as described in TS 28.680 [11] can
be used by NM for correlation with the LWA and LWIP related alarms as
described in clause 5.1.3.1 and clause 5.2.3.1.
No further alarm information needs to be defined.
# 8 Conclusions
The study has identified the use cases and requirements on CM, PM and FM of
LWA (including both collocated and non-collocated scenarios) and LWIP, and
provided the potential solutions.
It is concluded that:
> \- the CM of LWA and LWIP requires enhancements to the Generic NRM IRP and
> E-UTRAN NRM IRP;
>
> \- the PM of LWA and LWIP requires new performance measurements to be
> defined for E-UTRAN;
>
> \- the FM of LWA and LWIP can be supported by the existing Alarm IRP and
> WLAN management TS (see 28.680 [11]) without further enhancements, once the
> LWA/LWIP related NRMs are defined.
Normative work is needed to enhance the existing TSs for CM and PM of LWA and
LWIP as above-mentioned.
# 9 Recommendations
It is recommended to start normative work to address the CM and PM of LWA and
LWIP based on the use cases, requirements and potential solutions as outlined
in this TR.
