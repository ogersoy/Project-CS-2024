# 4 Use Cases
## 4.1 PM Measurements based on NRSRP, NRSRQ
### 4.1.1 Pre-condition
_The network operator is interested in receiving via network management the
information on cell level distribution of_ NRSRP, NRSRQ _values reported by
the UEs that are serviced by the NB-IoT cell_.
### 4.1.2 Description
_The eNodeB collects the measurement results for NRSRP, NRSRQ, performed by
the UEs e.g. by triggering the periodical UE measurement reports towards all
of the UEs in the measured E-UTRAN cell. The distribution information is
derived from the NRSRP, NRSRQ values similarly to existing RSRP and RSRQ based
measurements in TS 32.425 [2] clauses 6.1, 6.2; it is delivered to the
management system as PM measurement results._
### 4.1.3 Post-condition
_The network operator gets the NRSRP, NRSRQ performance measurements._
## 4.2 eMTC PM Measurements
### 4.2.1 Background
_There are reasons why cell level performance measurements applied separately
to eMTC devices may significantly differ from same measurements applied to
non-eMTC devices in same cell:_
\- Different L1 capabilities (e.g. HARQ)
\- Different traffic and activity patterns, combined with different number of
eMTC and non-eMTC devices in the cell
_In such case, non-differentiated total value of such counters as Successful
RRC connection establishments or Total Number of DL/UL TBs, will not be
representing any of the two groups._
### 4.2.2 Pre-condition
_The network operator may be interested in receiving, via PM measurements
mechanism, some of performance measurements separately for eMTC devices. The
targeted performance measurements belong to one or more of the categories
defined in [2]:_
\- RRC connection related measurements.
\- E-RAB related measurements.
\- Handover related measurements.
\- Cell level radio bearer QoS related measurements.
\- Radio resource utilization related measurements.
\- UE-associated logical S1-connection related measurements.
\- Paging related measurements.
\- RF Measurements.
\- TB related measurements.
\- Measurements related to Measurement Report.
### 4.2.3 Description
_The eNodeBs are configured by the network management system to collect the
targeted performance measurements. The collected information is processed and
the results are delivered to the management system as PM measurement results,
similarly to existing PM measurements in TS 32.425 [2]._
### 4.2.4 Post-condition
_The network operator gets the targeted performance measurements separately
for eMTC devices._
