# Introduction
The split of EPC nodes will cause the user plane and the control plane of S-GW
and P-GW to be separated. This will affect management of these nodes and may
cause the existing management specifications to be impacted.
The present document analyses the impacts for management of EPC nodes caused
by the impacts for management of EPC nodes caused by the split of user plane
and control plane. The scope of this study includes:
1) The affect of the CUPS on the performance measurements of the EPC network
[2].
2) The impact of the CUPS on the EPC NRM IRP [3].
3) The potential impact on E-UTRAN [4].

# 6 Potential solution
## 6.1 PGW and SGW related measurements
The PGW and SGW related measurements in CUPS are fulfilled by the control
plane function and user plane function, respectively. The potential solution
for NM, to receive the measurements, will be the PM IRP [6], an example of
execution steps is as follows.
1) The NM determines the measurements required.
2) The NM requests EM to collect the required measurements, providing the
granularity period and report period information.
3) The NM(s) subscribes to notification of the availability of the collected
measurements.
4) The NM(s) received notification when required measurements have been
collected and is available for retrival.
5) The NM retrieve the collected measurements.

# 8 Recommendations
Based on the outcome of the study, normative work for the management
enhancement of CUPS of EPC nodes for the next stage is recommended.
Potential areas for future normative work:
\- The EPC Performance measurement under CUPS situation
\- The EPC NRM IRP under CUPS situation
The EPC related specifications TS 32.426 [2], TS 28.708 [3] and TS 28.709 [6]
are recommended to reflect the outcomes in this study. The use cases and
requirements in this study are considered as detail analysis in CUPS situation
for EPC nodes. The normative work results from this study would consider
generic definitions of performance measurements and NRM IPR enhancements.
