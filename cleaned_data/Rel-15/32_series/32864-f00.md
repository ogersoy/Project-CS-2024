# 4 Potential use cases related to management of virtualized network functions
that are part of the NR
## 4.1 Configuration management use cases
### 4.1.1 Establishment of relation between virtualized part and non-
virtualized part of a gNB
#### 4.1.1.1 Issues
The granularity of the CU/DU functional split has the following options (see
clause 11.3.3 in [2]):
\- Per CU: each CU has a fixed split, and DUs are configured to match this.
\- Per DU: each DU can be configured with a different split. The choice of a
DU split may depend on specific topology or backhaul support in a given area.
The relation between CU and DU that form a gNB needs to be established through
configuration.
#### 4.1.1.2 Pre-conditions
\- Virtualized part of a gNB has been instantiated;
\- Non-virtualized part of a gNB has been deployed;
\- NM knows which virtualized part and non-virtualized part can form a gNB.
#### 4.1.1.3 Description
NM requests EM to establish the relation, which is the management view of the
RAN3 defined CU-DU reference point, between the virtualized part and the non-
virtualized part of a gNB through configuration.
EM configures the virtualized part and/or the non-virtualized part to
establish the relation, and responds to NM that the relation has been
established.
#### 4.1.1.4 Post-conditions
The relation between the virtualized part and non-virtualized part of a gNB
has been established.
### 4.1.2 Establishment of relation between the CN NF and the gNB
#### 4.1.2.1 Issues
The reference point between the CN NF and the gNB needs to be managed. So it
is necessary to allow operator to establish the relation, which is the
management view of the reference point, between the CN NF and the gNB.
#### 4.1.3.2 Pre-conditions
\- The VNF that is part of the CN has been instantiated.
\- The gNB that contains virtualized part and non-virtualized part has been
instantiated.
\- The relation between the CN NF and the gNB has not yet been established.
#### 4.1.2.3 Description
NM requests EM to establish the relation, which is the management view of the
reference point, between the CN NF, and the gNB through configuration.
EM configures the CN NF, and/or the gNB to establish the relation.
EM responds to NM to indicate that the relation has been established.
#### 4.1.2.4 Post-conditions
The relation between the CN NF, and the gNB has been established.
### 4.1.3 Deployment of non-virtualized part of gNB based on the available
dedicated hardware resource
#### 4.1.3.1 Issues
For operators, the deployment of physical network device usually brings higher
cost and longer time to the market. With the introduction of NFV, operator may
dynamically change RAN network architecture, topology or service delivery
chain. The operator needs to re-use the idle and available dedicated hardware
for the deployment of non-virtualized part of gNB. To support this, DM/EM
needs to report the performance measurements of the dedicated hardware
resource utilization to NM.
#### 4.1.3.2 Pre-conditions
\- Operator decides to change RAN network architecture, topology or service
delivery chain by re-using the available dedicated hardware (e.g. create one
or more DUs by utilizing the available dedicated hardware resource).
\- The VNF package for the virtualized part of a gNB has been on-boarded.
#### 4.1.3.3 Description
DM/EM reports the performance measurements of the available dedicated hardware
resource utilization to NM (e.g. the number of DUs can be deployed on the
available dedicated hardware).
NM determines whether the available dedicated hardware can support the
creation of DUs.
\- If the resource is enough for the creation, NM requests DM/EM to create one
or more DUs.
#### 4.1.3.4 Post-conditions
The non-virtualized part of the gNB has been created on the available
dedicated hardware resource.
## 4.2 Life Cycle Management use cases
### 4.2.1 Instantiation of virtualized part of a gNB with transport network
requirements
#### 4.2.1.1 Issues
A gNB in the New RAN may contain the following characteristics:
\- The gNB can be functionally split into Central Unit (CU) and Distributed
Unit (DU) (see clause 11.1 in [2]).
\- The functional split between CU and DU of the gNB includes 8 options (see
clause 11.1.1 in [2]). Each CU-DU split option has specific characteristic
that are listed in Table 11.1.2.9-1 in [2], in which transport network latency
and transport network peak bandwidth are key requirements. Table A-1 [2] lists
the bandwidth and latency of the underlying transport network that should be
considered for each CU-DU functional split option.
\- The CU that is part of a gNB can be virtualized (see clause 11.3.1 in [2]).
\- The DU that is part of a gNB cannot be virtualized.
To meet the interface requirements mentioned above, the following
considerations may apply:
\- A specific underlying transport networks (e.g. optical, etc.) between CU
and DU may be required.
\- The distance between the CU and DU may need to be within a limit.
#### 4.2.1.2 Pre-conditions
\- Operator decides to instantiate the virtualized part of a gNB.
\- The underlying transport network requirements for the selected CU-DU
functional split option is known.
\- The VNF package for the virtualized part of a gNB has been on-boarded.
\- The descriptor of the non-virtualized part of the gNB on boarded to NFVO.
#### 4.2.1.3 Description

7.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]), with the following information:
The underlying transport network requirements (e.g. bandwidth, latency,
transport network type (e.g. optical)) for the interface between the
virtualized part and non-virtualized part of a gNB:
\- The location constraints for the NFVI where the virtualized part of a gNB
needs to be instantiated, or the location of non-virtualized part of the gNB
that can be used to choose the NFVI location.
NFVO selects a NFVI where the virtualized part of a gNB will be instantiated,
and the transport network to be used to connect virtualized part and non-
virtualized part of a gNB in order to meet the requirements given by NM.
NFVO responds to NM to indicate the virtualized part of a gNB has been
instantiated successfully.
#### 4.2.1.4 Post-conditions
The virtualized part of a gNB is instantiated onto the appropriate NFVI.
### 4.2.2 Instantiation of NS containing VNF that is part of the CN and gNB
#### 4.2.2.1 Issues

since the RAN node cannot be virtualized at the time.
#### 4.2.2.2 Pre-conditions
\- The NSD for the NS containing VNF that is part of the CN and the gNB has
been on boarded and enabled.
\- The VNF package for VNF that is part of the CN has been on boarded and

virtualized part of a gNB need to be updated, e.g., to support the change of
CU/DU functional split option or to support the changes of network
requirements.
\- The descriptor of the non-virtualized part of the gNB has been on boarded
to NFVO.
#### 4.2.3.2 Description
NM needs to update the transport network requirements between virtualized part
and non-virtualized part of a gNB.
NM sends the updated transport network requirements between the virtualized
part and non-virtualized part of a gNB to NFVO, with the following
information:
The updated underlying transport network requirements (e.g. bandwidth,
latency, transport network type (e.g. optical)) for the interface between the
virtualized part and non-virtualized part of a gNB.
Optionally, the updated location constraints for the NFVI where the
virtualized part of a gNB needs to be deployed.
NFVO performs necessary actions (e.g., update the VL, or create a new VL to
replace the old one) to support the updated transport network requirements
between the virtualized part and non-virtualized part of a gNB.
NFVO responds to NM to indicate the updated transport network requirements
have been supported.
#### 4.2.3.3 Post-conditions
The updated transport network requirements between virtualized part and non-
virtualized part of a gNB have been supported.
### 4.2.4 Addition of non-virtualized part of gNB
#### 4.2.4.1 Issues

#### 4.2.4.4 Post-conditions
The non-virtualized parts of gNB have been added.
### 4.2.5 Removal of non-virtualized part of gNB
#### 4.2.5.1 Issues
Operator may need to remove one or more DUs from an existing CU if the DUs are
not needed as part of the gNB anymore. To support this, 3GPP management system
needs to be able to remove one or more PNFs of non-virtualized parts of gNB
via ETSI NFV MANO system.

and other VNF/PNF instances, have been added to the NS instance.
### 4.2.9 Add a VNFFGD to a NSD containing VLDs for virtualized and non-
virtualized parts of gNB
#### 4.2.9.1 Issues
A NSD should contain the VNFFGD to enable NS update operation to add a VNFFG
to a NS. The VNFFGD (see clause 6.4.2 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [5]) needs to
support attributes, required by the transport network requirements in clause
11.1.2.9 and Annex A of TR 38.801 [2].
#### 4.2.9.2 Pre-conditions
VNFFGD is missing in the NSD, since it was not included in the NSD on-boarded,
or has been removed.
#### 4.2.9.3 Description

### 4.2.10 Instantiation of virtualized part of a gNB with the NFVI-POP
geolocation identifier
#### 4.2.10.1 Issues
Operator needs to instantiate the virtualized part of a gNB. According to the
requirements of service, operator has chosen an appropriate NFVI_PoP for the
virtualized part of gNB based on measurement information or historical data.
#### 4.2.10.2 Pre-conditions
\- Operator decides to instantiate the virtualized part of a gNB.
\- The VNF package for the virtualized part of a gNB has been on-boarded.
\- The descriptor of the non-virtualized part of the gNB has been on boarded
to NFVO.
\- The non-virtualized part has been deployed according to operator\'s
requirement.
\- The virtualized resource meets the requirements of CU VNF package.
\- The underlying network meets the transport requirements between CU and DU.
\- The transport performance of underlying network between CU and CN meets the
end-to-end latency requirement.
#### 4.2.10.3 Description
NM requests NFVO to instantiate or migrate the virtualized part of a gNB (see
clause 7.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]), with the NFVI-POP geolocation
identifier.
NFVO follows the identifier and instantiates the virtualized part of a gNB
onto the indicated NFVI-PoP.
NFVO responds to NM the virtualized part of a gNB has been instantiated
successfully.
#### 4.2.10.4 Post-conditions
The virtualized part of a gNB is instantiated on the specific NFVI-PoP.
### 4.2.11 Providing location of the non-virtualized part of the gNB to NFVO
#### 4.2.11.1 Issues
The CU and DU split of the gNB requires specific transport network
requirements between them (see TR 38.801 [2]). To satisfy the low latency
requirement between gNB CU and gNB DU, deploying gNB CU closely to gNB DU
would be a better choice.
Non-virtualized part of gNB is able to service users in a specific area, which
is near PNFs deployment location. Providing PNF location information will
enable NFVO to orchestrate the NS in area closer to the PNF location.
To support some specific services, the RAN PNFs serving a specific area may
need to be modified to connect with the RAN VNFs serving the area.
NM should be able to provide the geographical location, when it can be
specified, of the non-virtualized part of the gNB (in the PNFD) to NFVO.
#### 4.2.11.2 Pre-conditions
The geographical location of non-virtualized part of the gNB can be specified.
#### 4.2.11.3 Description
NM provides the geographical location information (e.g. geographic coordinates
or address of the building, etc.) of the non-virtualized part of gNB in the
PNFD, and sends to NFVO via on-boarding or updating PNFD.
NFVO responds to NM to acknowledge of the receipt of the PNFD.
#### 4.2.11.4 Post-conditions
The geographical location of non-virtualized part of gNB, when it is
specified, is known to NFVO.
### 4.2.12 Add VNFFGs to a NS to connect virtualized parts of gNB to 5GC nodes
#### 4.2.12.1 Issues
5G system architecture, as specified in TS 23.501 [7], shows that a RAN node
is connected to AMF (Core Access and Mobility Management Function). When a
gNB-CU, AMF are implemented as VNF instances in a NS, it should allow NM to
add VNFFGs to connect the VNF instance of virtualized part of gNB to the VNF
instances of AMF.
#### 4.2.12.2 Pre-conditions
\- A NS containing the VNF instances realizing the virtualized part of gNB,
AMF has been instantiated.
\- The VNFFGDs containing to the attributes needed for connecting the VNF
instance of virtualized part of gNB to the VNF instances of AMF are included
in the updated NSD.
#### 4.2.12.3 Description
NM requests NFVO to use the NS update operation (see clause 7.3.5 in ETSI GS
NFV-IFA 013 [3]) to add VNFFG(s), which are characterized by the VNFFGD, to a
NS to connect the VNF instance of virtualized part of gNB to the VNF instances
of AMF.
NFVO adds the VNFFG(s) to the NS, and responds to NM to indicate that the
VNFFG(s) have been added successfully.
#### 4.2.12.4 Post-conditions
The VNFFGs that are used for connecting the VNF instance of virtualized part
of gNB to the VNF instances of AMF have been added to the NS instance.

\- The scale aspect of CU has been defined in CU VNFD (see clause 7.1.2.8 in
[5]).
\- The 3GPP management system has detected the CU utility rate (e.g. CPU
usage, memory usage etc.) or the number of accessed users has exceed the pre-
defined threshold.
\- The 3GPP management system decide to scale the impacted gNB.
#### 4.2.13.2 Description
NM requests NFVO to scale the specific CU VNF of the gNB (see clause 7.3.4.2
in [3]), with the following information:
\- The scaling type that indicates the NFVO scale in or scale out the CU VNF
(see clause 8.3.4.9.2 in [3]).
\- The CU VNF instance ID that identifies the unique VNF among gNBs (see
clause 8.3.4.9.2 in [3]).
\- The information of a specific level or specific steps to scale to (see
clause 8.3.4.9.2 in [3] and clause 7.1.8.2 in [6]).
NFVO perform a scaling-out/scaling-in action on the specific VNF indicated by
the VNF instance ID.
NFVO responds to NM to indicate the virtualized part of a gNB has been scaled
successfully.
#### 4.2.13.3 Post-conditions

# 6 Gap analysis
## 6.1 Gaps on adding and removing non-virtualized part of gNB as PNF
NM needs to be able to add the non-virtualized part of gNB as PNF to a NS
instance (see clause 4.2.4), remove the non-virtualized part of gNB as PNF
from a NS instance (see clause 4.2.5) and replace the non-virtualized part of
gNB as PNF in a NS instance (see clause 4.2.5) by using Update NS operation
(see clause 7.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]) towards NFVO.
However, the current Update NS operation does not support adding or removing
PNF(s). So this is a gap between the 3GPP and ETSI ISG NFV.
To support the 3GPP requirements above-mentioned and as described in clause
7.3.1, the Update NS operation needs to be extended to support adding PNF or
removing PNF with parameters shown below:
\- Add PNF\ The pnfdId (see clause 6.6.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [5]) to
identify the PNFD of the PNF (non-virtualized part of gNB) to be added.
\- Remove PNF\ The pnfdId to identify the PNFD of the PNF (non-virtualized
part of gNB) to be removed.
## 6.2 Gaps on indicating VNF instance for adding VNFFGs
One VNFD may be used to create multiple VNF instances, which may belong to the
same or different VNFFG instance(s). Therefore, when NM requests to add VNFFG,
it is necessary to provide the VNF instance ID(s), along with the VNFFGD ID to
indicate which VNF instance(s) the added VNFFG instance is to connect.
Currently, the Update NS operation (see clause 7.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013
[1]) does not include VNF instance ID(s) when adding the VNFFG.

requirements on providing geographical location of non-virtualized part of gNB
to NFVO, as described in clause 4.2.11 and 5.2.
The solution can be realized by reusing the existing On-board PNFD operation
or existing Update PNFD operation:

successful NSD update, with parameter nsdInfoId indicating the updated NSD.
### 7.1.6 Potential solution for adding VNFFGs for connecting virtualized part
and non-virtualized part of gNB
This clause provides the potential solution to support the Use Case and
requirements on adding VNFFGs for the gNB as described in clauses 4.2.8 and

and nsDf, which contain information relevant to latency and bandwidth of the
virtual link respectively for the interface between virtualized part and non-
virtualized part of gNB.

result of NS update (see clause 7.3.5.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]).
### 7.1.7 Potential solution for adding VNFFGs for connecting virtualized part
of gNB to AMF
This clause provides the potential solution to support the Use Case and
requirements on adding VNFFGs for connecting the virtualized part of gNB to
AMFF, as described in clause 4.2.8 and 5.2.
It is assumed that the NS has been instantiated and the VNFFGs connecting the
virtualized part of gNB and 5GC nodes (AMF) are missing. The NSD (see clause
6.2.2.2 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [5]) has been updated with the vnffgd and nsDf
for the interface between virtualized part of gNB and AMF.
NM invokes Update NS operation (see clause 7.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3])
to request NFVO to add VNFFGs for connecting the virtualized part of gNB and
AMF, with the following parameters:
\- updateType = \"AddVnffg\";
\- addVnffg(s) include the following attributes for each VNFFG to be added:
> vnffgdId;
> vnfInstanceId of the virtualized part of gNB;
> vnfInstanceId of the VNF instance of AMF.
NFVO **sends the NS lifecycle change notification to NM indicating the start
of NS update procedure** (see clause 7.3.5.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]).
NFVO updates the NS, based on the information provide by NM and the
information provided in the updated NSD.
NFVO sends **the NS Lifecycle Change** notification to NM indicating the
result of NS update (see clause 7.3.5.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]).
## 7.2 NRM for gNB that includes virtualized part
### 7.2.1 NRMs for gNB
The gNB is modelled to IOC GNBFunction, and contained by the IOC
ManagedElement.
The IOC GNBFunction is inherited from the IOC ManagedFunction.

## 7.3 Potential solutions on adding, removing and replacing non-virtualized
part of gNB
### 7.3.1 Adding, removing and replacing the non-virtualized part of gNB by
updating NS
NM requests NFVO to update the NS instance (by Update NS operation, see clause
7.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]) to:
\- add non-virtualized part of gNB as PNF\ The pnfdId (see clause 6.6.2.2 of
ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [5]) of the non-virtualized part of gNB is needed.
\- remove PNF of the non-virtualized part of gNB\ The pnfdId (see clause
6.6.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [5]), indicating the PNFD information related
to the non-virtualized part of gNB is needed.
\- replace PNF of the non-virtualized part of gNB\ The pnfdId(see clause
6.6.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [3]) of the new non-virtualized part of gNB and
the PnfdId (see clause 6.6.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 [5]) of the old non-
virtualized part of gNB are needed.
NFVO **sends the NS lifecycle change notification to NM indicating the start
of NS update procedure** (see clause 7.3.5.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]).
NFVO updates the NS to add, remove or replace the PNF of the non-virtualized
part of gNB according to the information provide by NM.
NFVO sends **the NS Lifecycle Change** notification to NM indicating the
result of NS update (see clause 7.3.5.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3]).
# 8 Conclusions
The study has addressed the following management aspects of the NG-RAN that
includes virtualized network functions:
\- Use case, requirements and potential solutions on:
\- Establishment of relation between virtualized part and non-virtualized part
of gNB (see clause 4.1.1)
\- Establishment of relation between the CN NF and the gNB, which is partially
virtualized (see clause 4.1.2)
\- Instantiation of virtualized part of gNB (see clause 4.2.1)
\- Instantiation of NS containing VNF that is part of the CN, and virtualized
and non-virtualized parts of gNB (see clause 4.2.2)
\- Update of transport network requirements (see clause 4.2.3)
\- Addition of non-virtualized part of gNB (see clause 4.2.4)
\- Removal of non-virtualized part of gNB (see clause 4.2.5)
\- On-board NSD for the virtualized and non-virtualized parts of gNB (see
clause 4.2.7)
\- Add VNFFGs to a NS containing VLs for virtualized and non-virtualized parts
of gNB (see clause 4.2.8)
\- Add a VNFFGD to a NSD containing VLDs for virtualized and non-virtualized
parts of gNB (see clause 4.2.9)
\- Instantiation of virtualized part of a gNB with the NFVI-POP geolocation
identifier (see clause 4.2.10)
\- Deployment of non-virtualized part of gNB based on the available dedicated
hardware resource (see clause 4.1.3)
\- Connect the virtualized part of gNB to 5GC nodes (see clause 4.2.12)
\- Provide location of non-virtualized part of gNB to NFVO (see clause 4.2.11)
\- Scaling the virtualized part of gNB for adapting to the network capacity
(see clause 4.2.13)
\- Gap analysis with ETSI ISG NFV GSs.
It is concluded that:
1) The following use cases can be supported by existing solution:
\- Establishment of relation between virtualized part and non-virtualized part
of gNB.
\- Establishment of relation between the CN NF and the gNB, which is partially
virtualized.
\- Instantiation of virtualized part of gNB.
\- Instantiation of NS containing VNF that is part of the CN, and virtualized
and non-virtualized parts of gNB.
\- Update of transport network requirements.
\- Provide location of non-virtualized part of gNB to NFVO.
\- Scaling the virtualized part of gNB for adapting to the network capacity.
\- On-board NSD for the virtualized and non-virtualized parts of gNB.
\- Add VNFFGs to a NS containing VLs for virtualized and non-virtualized parts
of gNB.
\- Instantiation of virtualized part of a gNB with the NFVI-POP geolocation
identifier.
\- Deployment of non-virtualized part of gNB based on the available dedicated
hardware resource.
\- Connect the virtualized part of gNB to 5GC nodes.
\- Provide location of non-virtualized part of gNB to NFVO.
\- Scaling the virtualized part of gNB for adapting to the network capacity.
2) The following use cases can be supported by existing solution by updating
the NSD and then update the NS, but cannot be supported by Update NS operation
without updating the NSD. Given the number of the PNFs of non-virtualized part
of gNB, updating NSD very frequently is not optimal. So the solution by using
Update NS operation without updating the NSD should be pursued:
\- Addition of non-virtualized part of gNB
\- Removal of non-virtualized part of gNB
The solution by using Update NS operation without updating the NSD requires
extension of the Update NS operation to support adding a PNF to a NS instance,
or removing a PNF from a NS instance.
3) The following use cases cannot be supported by existing solutions:
\- Add VNFFGs to a NS containing VLs for virtualized and non-virtualized parts
of gNB.
\- Add VNFFGs for connecting 1) virtualized part and non-virtualized part of
gNB, 2) virtualized part of gNB and 5GC nodes.
4) The following gap in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [3] has been identified:
\- When using Update NS operation (see clause 7.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013
[3]) to add VNFFGs to the NS instance, it should provide the VNF instance
ID(s) to indicate which VNF instance(s) are to be connected by the VNFFG
instance.
