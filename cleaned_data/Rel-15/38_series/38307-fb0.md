# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies requirements for Rel-15 UEs supporting release
independent features like:
\- additional NR operating bands and power classes on top of Rel-15 of TS
38.101 [2-5] and TS 38.133 [6];
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**release independent** : applicable to some frozen releases, starting from a
certain release Rel-M
NOTE 1: Normally, a feature is introduced only in the latest open release
Rel-N and future releases are based on the previous one so that future
releases inherit the requirements of this feature. Introducing a feature \"in
a release independent way from Rel-M onwards\" (M\ PMI Precoding Matrix Indicator

# 4 General
TSG-RAN has agreed for certain features (see the following clauses) to
introduce them in a \"release independent way\".
This means for each feature:
\- it is \"introduced\" in a release N, i.e. TS 38.101 [2-5] and TS 38.133 [6]
of release N define certain UE requirements for this feature; the feature is
indicated in the tables of the following clauses;
\- it is \"release independent\" starting from a release M (M\<N); M for the
given feature is provided in the tables of the following clauses;
\- UEs supporting this feature have to fulfil additional requirements in
release M or higher which are specified in one or more Annexes of TS 38.307 of
release N; the applicable Annexes for a given feature are provided in the
tables of the following clauses.
The applicable UE Categories are specified in TS 38.306 [7] according to the
release to which the UE conforms.
In the table of release independent features in subsequent clauses, \"FDD,
TDD\" refers to CA or EN-DC configuration composed by only FDD bands or only
TDD bands, respectively. \"FDD and TDD\" refers to CA or EN-DC configuration
including both FDD and TDD bands. \"SDL and FDD, SDL and TDD\" refers to CA
configuration including both SDL and FDD bands or both SDL and TDD bands,
respectively. \"TDD and SUL\" refers to SUL configuration including both TDD
and SUL bands. \"FDD and TDD and SUL\" refers to EN-DC configuration including
both FDD, TDD and SUL bands. Unless stated otherwise, the release independent
for the band combinations are from Rel-15.
When a new feature is introduced only the latest release of release
independent spec needs to be updated. The latest release of release
independent spec refers to the release which the new feature is introduced in.
If an RF feature introduced in the same release as the release which the
feature is independent from, (i.e. M=N), the common UE RF requirements table
in annex B.4 is specified from release N+1, otherwise the common UE RF
requirements table is specified from release N.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Frequency arrangement for overlapping
operating bands
The following information is provided in order to assist a UE derive the DL
NR-ARFCN and UL NR-ARFCN in a multi-band environment, in which multiple
overlapping operating bands may be indicated in the fields
_freqBandIndicatorNR_ and _MultiFrequencyBandListNR-SIB_.
The overlapping bands, independent of release, which may be indicated in a
cell are shown in Table A-1 for applicable NR operating bands. The DL NR-ARFCN
and UL NR-ARFCN are derived according to TS 38.101-1 Rel-15.
