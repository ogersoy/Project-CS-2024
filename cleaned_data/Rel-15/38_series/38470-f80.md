# 4 General aspects
This clause captures the F1 interface principles and characteristics.
## 4.1 F1 interface general principles
The general principles for the specification of the F1 interface are as
follows:
\- the F1 interface is open;
\- the F1 interface supports the exchange of signalling information between
the endpoints, in addition the interface supports data transmission to the
respective endpoints;
\- from a logical standpoint, the F1 is a point-to-point interface between the
endpoints.
NOTE: A point-to-point logical interface should be feasible even in the
absence of a physical direct connection between the endpoints.
\- the F1 interface supports control plane and user plane separation;
\- the F1 interface separates Radio Network Layer and Transport Network Layer;
\- the F1 interface enables exchange of UE associated information and non-UE
associated information;
\- the F1 interface is designed in a future proof way to fulfil different new
requirements, support new services and new functions;
\- one gNB-CU and a set of gNB-DUs are visible to other logical nodes as a gNB
or an en-gNB where the gNB terminates the Xn and the NG interfaces, and the
en-gNB terminates the X2 and the S1-U interfaces;
\- the gNB-CU may be separated in control plane (CP) and user plane (UP).
## 4.2 F1 interface specification objectives
The F1 interface specifications facilitate the following:
\- inter-connection of a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU supplied by different
manufacturers.
## 4.3 F1 interface capabilities
The F1 interface supports:
\- procedures to establish, maintain and release radio bearers for the NG-RAN
part of PDU sessions and for E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearers;
\- the separation of each UE on the protocol level for user specific
signalling management;- the transfer of RRC signalling messages between the UE
and the gNB-CU.

# 5 Functions of the F1 interface
## 5.1 General
The following clauses describe the functions supported over F1-C and F1-U.
## 5.2 F1-C functions
### 5.2.1 F1 interface management function
The error indication function is used by the gNB-DU or gNB-CU to indicate to
the gNB-CU or gNB-DU that an error has occurred.
The reset function is used to initialize the peer entity after node setup and
after a failure event occurred. This procedure can be used by both the gNB-DU
and the gNB-CU.
The F1 setup function allows to exchange application level data needed for the
gNB-DU and gNB-CU to interoperate correctly on the F1 interface. The F1 setup
is initiated by the gNB-DU.
The gNB-CU Configuration Update and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions
allow to update application level configuration data needed between gNB-CU and
gNB-DU to interoperate correctly over the F1 interface, and may activate or
deactivate cells. With the gNB-CU Configuration Update function, energy saving
with cell activation/deactivation can be supported as defined in TS 38.300
[8].
The F1 setup and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions allow to inform the
S-NSSAI(s) supported by the gNB-DU.
The F1 resource coordination function is used to transfer information about
frequency resource sharing between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. In case of split gNB
architecture, the gNB-CU may consolidate the outgoing messages from multiple
gNB-DUs and distribute the incoming messages to the involved gNB-DUs, to
perform resource coordination.
The gNB-DU status indication function allows the gNB-DU to indicate overload
status to gNB-CU.
### 5.2.2 System Information management function
Scheduling of system broadcast information is carried out in the gNB-DU. The
gNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the system information according to the
scheduling parameters available.
The gNB-DU is responsible for the encoding of the NR-MIB message. In case
broadcast of SIB1 and other SIBs is needed, the gNB-DU is responsible for the
encoding of the SIB1 message and the gNB-CU is responsible for the encoding of
other SIBs. The gNB-DU may re-encode SIB9. The gNB-DU is responsible for the
generation of the SystemInformation message.
To support Msg3 based on-demand SI as described in TS 38.331 [11], the gNB-CU
can confirm the received SI request from the UE by including the UE identity,
and command the gNB-DU to broadcast the requested other SIs.
### 5.2.3 F1 UE context management function
The F1 UE context management function supports the establishment and
modification of the necessary overall UE context.
The establishment of the F1 UE context is initiated by the gNB-CU and accepted
or rejected by the gNB-DU based on admission control criteria (e.g., resource
not available).
The modification of the F1 UE context can be initiated by either gNB-CU or
gNB-DU. The receiving node can accept or reject the modification. The F1 UE
context management function also supports the release of the context
previously established in the gNB-DU. The release of the context is triggered
by the gNB-CU either directly or following a request received from the gNB-DU.
The gNB-CU request the gNB-DU to release the UE Context when the UE enters
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
This function can be also used to manage DRBs and SRBs, i.e., establishing,
modifying and releasing DRB and SRB resources. The establishment and
modification of DRB resources are triggered by the gNB-CU and
accepted/rejected by the gNB-DU based on resource reservation information and
QoS information to be provided to the gNB-DU. For each DRB to be setup or
modified, the S-NSSAI may be provided by gNB-CU to the gNB-DU in the UE
Context Setup procedure and the UE Context Modification procedure.
The mapping between QoS flows and radio bearers is performed by gNB-CU and the
granularity of bearer related management over F1 is radio bearer level. For
NG-RAN, the gNB-CU decides an aggregated DRB QoS profile for each radio bearer
based on received QoS flow profile, and provides both aggregated DRB QoS
profile and QoS flow profile to the gNB-DU, and the gNB-DU either accepts the
request or rejects it with appropriate cause value. With this function, gNB-DU
could also notify gNB-CU whether the QoS for already established DRBs is not
fulfilled any longer or it is fulfilled again. To support packet duplication
for intra-gNB-DU CA as described in TS 38.300 [8], one data radio bearer
should be configured with two GTP-U tunnels between gNB-CU and a gNB-DU.
With this function, gNB-CU requests the gNB-DU to setup or change of the
SpCell (as defined in TS 38.321 [10]) for the UE, and the gNB-DU either
accepts or rejects the request with appropriate cause value.
With this function, the gNB-CU requests the setup of the SCell(s) at the gNB-
DU side, and the gNB-DU accepts all, some or none of the SCell(s) and replies
to the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU requests the removal of the SCell(s) for the UE.
With this function, the gNB-CU indicates the UL UE AMBR limit to the gNB-DU,
and the gNB-DU enforces the indicated limit.
With this function, the gNB-DU indicates that a bearer, or a UE is inactive or
active. The gNB-CU consolidates all the serving gNB-DUs for the UE and takes
further action.
### 5.2.4 RRC message transfer function
This function allows to transfer RRC messages between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. RRC
messages are transferred over F1-C. The gNB-CU is responsible for the encoding
of the dedicated RRC message with assistance information provided by gNB-DU.
This function also allows gNB-DU to report to gNB- CU if the downlink RRC
message has been successfully delivered to UE or not.
### 5.2.5 Paging function
The gNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the paging information according to
the scheduling parameters provided.
The gNB-CU provides paging information to enable the gNB-DU to calculate the
exact PO and PF. The gNB-CU determines the PA. The gNB-DU consolidates all the
paging records for a particular PO, PF and PA, and encodes the final RRC
message and broadcasts the paging message on the respective PO, PF in the PA.
### 5.2.6 Warning messages information transfer function
This function allows to cooperate with the warning message transmission
procedures over NG interface. The gNB-CU is responsible for encoding the
warning related SI message and sending it together with other warning related
information for the gNB-DU to broadcast over the radio interface.
## 5.3 F1-U functions
### 5.3.1 Transfer of user data
This function allows to transfer of user data between gNB-CU and gNB-DU.
### 5.3.2 Flow control function
This function allows to control the downlink user data flow to the gNB-DU. The
detailed protocol is specified in TS 38.425 [7].
## 5.4 TEIDs allocation
The gNB-DU is responsible for the allocation of the F1-U DL GTP TEID for each
data radio bearer.
