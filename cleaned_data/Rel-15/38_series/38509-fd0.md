# 1 Scope
The present document defines for User Equipment (UE) those special functions
and their activation/deactivation methods that are required in the UE for
conformance testing purposes when the UE is connected to the 5G System (5GS)
via its radio interface(s).
The document also describes the operation of these special functions when the
5GS capable UEs are connected via a non-5GS system e.g. E-UTRA FDD or TDD
system.
Depending on the 5GS system\'s architecture some relevant for the UE for
conformance testing special functions may be defined in TS 36.509 [6].

# 4 UE special conformance test functions overview
## 4.1 Requirements for UE support of test functions
The UE special conformance test functions are required for the support of 5GS
conformance testing. They form a part of the core requirements and thus have a
direct impact on the design of the UE. The use of the word \"mandatory\" in
the present specification shall be understood as a particular requirement
being mandatory for performing UE conformance testing.
NOTE: While the importance of conformance testing should not be
underestimated, and hence is highly recommended, the implementation of
facilitation of it is left to the Device implementation.
## 4.2 UE special conformance test functions concept
The present specification defines the UE special conformance test functions
including any relevant procedure and the Test Mode Control (TMC) message
contents used for information exchange.
The conformance test methods applied in RF/RRM Conformance Test Specification
TS 38.521-1 [12], TS 38.521-2 [13], TS 38.521-3 [14], TS 38.521-4 [15] and TS
38.533 [16], and, the conformance test models used in Protocol Conformance
Test Specifications TS 38.523-1 [3] and TS 38.523-3 [4], as well as, common
test environment definition and Generic procedures specified in TS 38.508-1
[2] utilise the UE special conformance test functions. Default TMC messages
and information element contents utilised in all before mentioned test
specifications are specified in TS 38.508-1 [2].
The UE special conformance test functions vary depending on the conformance
testing functionality they are designed to support. The following broader
groups of UE special conformance test functions can be identified:
\- **Test Loop Functions** : Functions which require a loop to be established
between the UE and the System Simulator (SS) to allow e.g. DL data packets
sent by the SS to be looped back UL by the UE
\- **General Test Functions** : Commands send by the SS e.g. to trigger a
certain UE behaviour which may be a behaviour determined by 3GPP core spec
requirements or such needed to facilitate conformance testing and not being
part of any 3GPP core spec requirements, or, to provide to the UE information
needed for the conformance testing.
NOTE 1: An example for behaviour needed to facilitate conformance testing and
not representing behaviour determined by 3GPP core spec requirements is
counting and reporting the number of received data packets thereby providing
means to the SS to verify 3GPP core spec requirements.
The utilisation of any UE special conformance test functions shall be
considered as putting the UE in a test mode. The duration of the test mode
depends on the UE special conformance test function and in most of the cases
will be delimited by an activation and a deactivation command. However, in the
case of general test functions used e.g. only to provide information relevant
for the conformance testing the test mode can be considered as entered as soon
as the information is received and exited as soon as the information has been
acted upon.
As a common rule the UE special conformance test functions provide access to
isolated functions of the UE via the radio interface without introducing new
physical interfaces just for the reason of conformance testing. However, in
certain cases the usage of AT Commands may be required which will require an
external interface e.g. EMMI.
NOTE 2: It should be emphasised that the UE test functions only describe the
functional behaviour of the UE with respect to its external interfaces;
physical implementation of the UE test function is completely left open to the
manufacturer.
Depending on the conformance testing functionality they are designed to
support, the UE special conformance test functions may comprise:
\- A single DL message (e.g. a test function intended to provide to the UE
information needed for the conformance testing)
\- A Request/Acknowledgement type of 2 messages exchange, an DL message
followed by a UL message, (e.g. a test function intended to request the UE to
execute an action which requires acknowledgment that request was received and
acted upon)
Furthermore, depending on the conformance test scenarios
\- An UE special conformance test function can be used in isolation.
NOTE 3: An example for this is the provision to the UE of location information
which can then be used by the UE throughout its \"normal\" i.e. not test mode
functions dependant behaviour.
\- Two, or more, UE special conformance test functions may need to be executed
in a particular sequence before the target UE behaviour can be assumed.
NOTE 4: An example for this are the Activate UE test mode and Close UE test
loop functions. The former needs to be executed first, at a particular moment
of time, in order a specific type of test bearer terminated in a particular UE
protocol layer to be established. Followed by the latter, executed at
different point of time, which will instruct the UE to start looping back the
received packets.
\- Two, or more, UE special conformance test functions may be executed
simultaneously with no particular relation one to another allowing for
different test mode functionality to take place at the same time.
NOTE 5: An example for this are the UE Beamlock test function and the test
functions needed for test loop mode operation (see NOTE 4). The former may
need to be active throughout the entire tests with the latter being active in
parts of the test as appropriate. Both being active independently.
For the specification of UE special conformance test functions the present
specification may refer to other specifications. In the case when text on the
same matter exists in the present specification and in the referred
specification, the text in the present specification takes precedence.
# 5 UE special conformance test functions operation
## 5.1 General
For consistency with legacy terminology, the present specification uses the
terms \'Activate UE test mode\' and \'Deactivate UE test mode\' for denoting
the activation and the deactivation of 5GS test mode bearers procedures
respectively. Consequently, \'Activate UE test mode\' should not be understood
as setting the UE in test mode in general rather, as setting the UE in a mode
(i.e. establishing a special type of test bearers) which other special UE
conformance testing functions require for proper operation. As this has been
mentioned elsewhere in the present specification, not all special UE
conformance testing functions require such a setting.
Similarly, the present specification may use the term \'UE test loop mode X
operation\", where X is a chose letter, for denoting operation which does not
represent true looping back of data being received rather, it represents what
can be called as a \"pseudo loop\" i.e. providing back information about the
received data e.g. the number of the received packets.
## 5.2 Activation and deactivation of 5GS test mode bearers (UE test mode
procedures)
### 5.2.1 General
The SS performs, where applicable, activation and deactivation of the
conformance test functions in the UE by sending Security Protected NAS Layer 3
messages.
The UE test mode procedures are intended for setting the UE into a test mode
where the SS can set up test bearers terminated at a particular point in the
5GS protocol stack as specified in the functional block diagram of each UE
test loop mode of operation. The following test bearers are defined in the
present specification:
\- data radio bearers (UE test loop mode A),
\- EPS bearers or 5GS QoS flows (UE test loop mode B).
### 5.2.2 Activate UE test mode
Same as TS 36.509 [6], subclause 5.3.2 with the following exceptions:
\- where E-UTRA is mentioned the same applies for NR;
the NB-IoT mode is out of the scope of the present specification;
where different UE test loop modes are mentioned only those applicable to 5GS
should be taken into account (see subclause 5.3.4 for the applicable 5GS UE
test loop modes).
### 5.2.3 Deactivate UE test mode
Same as TS 36.509 [6], subclause 5.3.3 with the following exceptions
\- where E-UTRA is mentioned the same applies for NR;
\- the NB-IoT mode is out of the scope of the present specification;
\- where different UE test loop modes are mentioned only those applicable to
5GS should be taken into account (see subclause 5.3.4 for the applicable 5GS
UE test loop modes).
Apart from sending the appropriate deactivation command to the UE the
functions shall be deactivated by:
switching off the UE; or
by removing the USIM.
## 5.3 Test loop functions
### 5.3.1 General
Before a loop functionality can be exercised, the test loop needs to be
closed; this is to be understood as the UE being instructed to start looping
back received data packets. When looping back received data packets is not any
longer required the loop should be re-opened; opening of a loop does not
change the type of bearer being established by the UE test mode activation
function (subclause 5.2.2).
To limit the number of special test functions, the concept of closing and
opening a loop is also used as instruction to the UE to initiate/terminate
other actions. An example of this is counting the received packets and
reporting the number of received packets back to the SS; in the context of
this utilisation closing a loop is to be understood as the UE being instructed
to start counting the packets, whereas opening a loop should be understood as
stop counting the packets. Other utilisation of the closing/opening a \"test
loop\" test functionality can be specified if appropriate.
The UE test loop functions for 5GS are intended for:
\- NR receiver and transmitter testing to disable application data transfer in
downlink and uplink during SS UE measurements.
\- NR layer 2 (MAC, RLC, PDCP, SDAP) and data radio bearer testing to generate
data transfer in downlink and uplink.
\- 5GC and NR layer 3 testing to verify data transfer continuation over RRC
and 5GC procedures.
\- 5GC NAS user-plane testing to verify uplink QoS flow descriptions handling.
### 5.3.2 Close UE test loop
Same as TS 36.509 [6], subclause 5.4.2 with the following exceptions:
\- where E-UTRA is mentioned the same applies for NR;
\- the NB-IoT mode is out of the scope of the present specification
\- where different UE test loop modes are mentioned only those applicable to
5GS should be taken into account (see subclause 5.3.4 for the applicable 5GS
UE test loop modes).
\- where EPS bearers are mentioned the same applies for 5GS QoS flows; and
\- UE supported minimum buffer size for MR-DC and NR shall match the required
total layer 2 buffer size as specified in TS 38.306 [20], clause 4.1.4.
### 5.3.3 Open UE test loop
Same as TS 36.509 [6], subclause 5.4.5 with the exceptions:
\- where E-UTRA is mentioned the same applies for NR;
\- the NB-IoT mode is out of the scope of the present specification;
\- where different UE test loop modes are mentioned only those applicable to
5GS should be taken into account (see subclause 5.3.4 for the applicable 5GS
UE test loop modes).
### 5.3.4 UE functionality when test loop is closed
#### 5.3.4.1 UE test loop mode A operation
UE test loop mode A provides loopback of PDCP SDUs for bi-directional data
radio bearers while UE is operating in NR. The downlink PDCP SDUs received by
the UE on each bi-directional data radio bearer are returned on the same radio
bearer regardless of the PDCP SDU contents and of the QoS flow descriptions of
the associated QoS Flow as specified in TS 24.501 [21].
Figures 5.3.4.1-1 and 5.3.4.1-2 show functional block diagrams of UE test loop
function for the TMC entity and UE test loop mode A for the case when EN-DC or
NGEN-DC with a MCG bearer and a SCG bearer is configured and for the case EN-
DC or NGEN-DC with a MCG and a split bearer is configured.
Figures 5.3.4.1-3 shows functional block diagrams of UE test loop function for
the TMC entity and UE test loop mode A for the case when standalone NR is
configured.
Figures 5.3.4.1-4 and 5.3.4.1-5 show functional block diagrams of UE test loop
function for the TMC entity and UE test loop mode A for the case when NE-DC
with a MCG bearer and a SCG bearer is configured and for the case NE-DC with a
MCG and a split bearer is configured.
NOTE 1: The number and the order of RB LB Entities in the functional block
diagrams are provided for illustration only. No specific order or numbering is
precluded.

Figure 5.3.4.1-5: Model for Test Mode Control and UE Test Loop Mode A on UE
side when NE-DC with MCG and split bearers configured
UE test loop mode A is mandatory to all 5GS UEs.
Prior to closing the UE test loop mode A, thereby requesting the UE to start
looping back the received data packets, at least one 5GS test mode bi-
directional data radio bearer shall have been established between SS and UE.
This implies that before the procedure for establishing the bi-directional
data radio bearer takes place the SS needs to activate the UE test mode as
specified in subclause 5.2.2.
The 5GS UE test loop mode A operation is the same as the one described in TS
36.509 [6], subclause 5.4.3 with the exception where E-UTRA is mentioned the
same applies for NR, and, the understanding that the NB-IoT mode is out of the
scope of the present specification.
#### 5.3.4.2 UE test loop mode B operation
##### 5.3.4.2.1 General
UE test loop mode B is mandatory to all 5GS UEs supporting one or more PDU
session establishments.
##### 5.3.4.2.2 UE test loop mode B operation for EN-DC and NGEN-DC
UE test loop mode B provides loopback of PDCP SDUs for bi-directional EPS
bearers while UE is operated in NR or E-UTRA modes. When operating in NR or
E-UTRA, the downlink PDCP SDUs or SNDCP PDUs received by the UE on all bi-
directional data radio bearers are returned by the UE on the data radio bearer
associated with an QoS Flow with a QoS flow descriptions matching the
TCP/UDP/IP protocol information within the PDCP SDU or SNDCP SDU as specified
in TS 24.501 [21].
NOTE 1: When multiple PDN connections are established (or multiple Primary PDP
Contexts are active), it is assumed that different IP addresses are allocated
to the UE by the SS on each PDN.
Figures 5.3.4.2.2-1 and 5.3.4.2.2-2 show functional block diagrams of UE test
loop function for the TMC entity and UE test loop mode B for the case when EN-
DC or NGEN-DC with a MCG bearer and a SCG bearer is configured and for the
case EN-DC or NGEN-DC with a MCG and a split bearer is configured.

Function in the functional block diagrams are provided for illustration only.
No specific order or numbering is precluded.

side when EN-DC or NGEN-DC with MCG and split bearer configured
##### 5.3.4.2.3 UE test loop mode B operation for Standalone NR
UE test loop mode B provides loopback of SDAP SDUs for bi-directional QoS
Flows while UE is operated in standalone NR mode. Prior to closing the UE test
loop mode B, thereby requesting the UE to start looping back the received data
packets, at least one 5GS test mode bi-directional QoS Flow shall have been
established between SS and UE. This implies that before the procedure for
establishing the bi-directional QoS Flows takes place the SS needs to activate
the UE test mode as specified in subclause 5.2.2
The downlink SDAP SDUs or IP PDU\'s received by the UE on all bi-directional
QoS Flows are returned by the UE without any modification of the IP header to
the UL QoS flow descriptions handling SAP for transmission in uplink.
NOTE 1: When multiple PDU sessions are established, it is assumed that
different IP addresses are allocated to the UE by the SS on each PDU session.
Figure 5.3.4.2.3-1 shows functional block diagrams of UE test loop function
for the TMC entity and UE test loop mode B for the case when standalone NR is
configured.
NOTE 2: The number and the order of QoS Flow LB Entities in the UE Test Loop
Function in the functional block diagrams are provided for illustration only.
No specific order or numbering is precluded.
The 5GS UE test loop mode B operation is the same as the one described in TS
36.509 [6], subclause 5.4.4 with the exception where E-UTRA is mentioned the
same applies for NR, and, where PDCP SDU is mentioned the same applies for
SDAP SDU.

side when standalone NR is configured
##### 5.3.4.2.4 UE test loop mode B operation for NE-DC
UE test loop mode B provides loopback of SDAP SDUs for bi-directional QoS
Flows while UE is operated in NR or E-UTRA modes. Prior to closing the UE test
loop mode B, thereby requesting the UE to start looping back the received data
packets, at least one 5GS test mode bi-directional QoS Flow shall have been
established between SS and UE. This implies that before the procedure for
establishing the bi-directional QoS Flows takes place the SS needs to activate
the UE test mode as specified in subclause 5.2.2
The downlink SDAP SDUs or IP PDU\'s received by the UE on all bi-directional
QoS Flows are returned by the UE without any modification of the IP header to
the UL QoS flow descriptions handling SAP for transmission in uplink.
NOTE 1: When multiple PDU sessions are established, it is assumed that
different IP addresses are allocated to the UE by the SS on each PDU session.

## 5.4 UE Beamlock test Function (UBF)
### 5.4.1 General
The UE Beamlock test function is intended for making the UE to lock the UE
antenna pattern once it has formed a beam towards the base station (SS)
direction following the cell identification procedure in preparation for
subsequent test procedures. Activating the UBF shall lock the antenna pattern
of all active intra-band component carriers and all MIMO layers affected by
the test function.
The Beamlock test function is mandatory for applicable UEs operating in
Frequency Range 2 (FR2).
The SS uses the UE Beamlock test mode activation procedure to command the UE
to lock the UE antenna pattern. The Beamlock activation procedure can apply to
UE transmitter and UE receiver beams either simultaneously or independently.
Figure 5.4.1-1: UE Beamlock test mode activation procedure
The SS uses the UE Beamlock test mode deactivation procedure to command the UE
to re-tracking the beam towards the base station direction. The Beamlock
deactivation procedure can apply to UE transmitter and UE receiver beams
either simultaneously or independently.
Figure 5.4.1-2: UE Beamlock test mode deactivation procedure
### 5.4.2 Activate Beamlock procedure
#### 5.4.2.1 Initiation
The SS requests the UE to activate beamlock by transmitting an ACTIVATE
BEAMLOCK message.
#### 5.4.2.2 Reception of ACTIVATE BEAMLOCK message by UE
When UE receives ACTIVATE BEAMLOCK message then the UE shall:
1> if the UE is operating in FR2 AND is in RRC_CONNECTED state:
2> if UE Beamlock test Function = 01
3> Lock the UE antenna pattern with Tx only
> 2> else if UE Beamlock test Function = 10
>
> 3> Lock the UE antenna pattern with Rx only
>
> 2> else if UE Beamlock test Function = 11
3> Lock the UE antenna pattern with both TxRx
2> Transmit ACTIVATE BEAMLOCK COMPLETE message
1> else:
2> the UE behaviour is unspecified.
### 5.4.3 Deactivate Beamlock procedure
#### 5.4.3.1 Initiation
The SS requests the UE to deactivate beamlock by transmitting a DEACTIVATE
BEAMLOCK message. The SS should do this when the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state.
#### 5.4.3.2 Reception of DEACTIVATE BEAMLOCK message by UE
When UE receives DEACTIVATE BEAMLOCK message then the UE shall:
1> if the UE is operating in FR2 AND is in RRC_CONNECTED state AND the UE
Beamlock test function is active:
2> unlock the UE antenna pattern and transmit DEACTIVATE BEAMLOCK COMPLETE
message;
1> else:
2> the UE behaviour is unspecified.
#### 5.4.3.3 Release of antenna beamlock by UE
When the UE leaves the RRC_CONNECTED state, the UE shall:
1> if the UE is operating in FR2 AND the UE Beamlock test Function is active
2> unlock the UE antenna pattern;
## 5.5 UE SS-RSRPB per receiver branch reporting
### 5.5.1 General
In 38.215 [22], section 5.1.18 defines SS-RSRPB as below, with its
applicability only to FR2 and in RRC_CONNECTED Mode.
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | SS reference signal received power per branch | | | (SS-RSRPB) is defined as the linear average | | | over the power contributions (in [W]) of the | | | resource elements that carry secondary | | | synchronization signals (SS). The measurement | | | time resource(s) for SS-RSRPB are confined | | | within SS/PBCH Block Measurement Time | | | Configuration (SMTC) window duration. | | | | | | For SS-RSRPB determination demodulation | | | reference signals for physical broadcast | | | channel (PBCH) and, if indicated by higher | | | layers, CSI reference signals in addition to | | | secondary synchronization signals may be used. | | | SS-RSRPB using demodulation reference signal | | | for PBCH or CSI reference signal shall be | | | measured by linear averaging over the power | | | contributions of the resource elements that | | | carry corresponding reference signals taking | | | into account power scaling for the reference | | | signals as defined in 3GPP TS 38.213 [5]. | | | | | | SS-RSRPB shall be measured only among the | | | reference signals corresponding to SS/PBCH | | | blocks with the same SS/PBCH block index and | | | the same physical-layer cell identity. | | | | | | If higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH | | | blocks for performing SS-RSRPB measurements, | | | then SS-RSRPB is measured only from the | | | indicated set of SS/PBCH block(s). | | | | | | For frequency range 1, SS-RSRPB is not | | | defined.

The SS uses the SS-RSRPB reporting procedure to command the UE to report SS-
RSRP per UE receiver branch. The report from the UE shall be a vector of
values, where the number of the reported values equals the number of receiver
branches on the UE.
Figure 5.5.1-1: UE SS-RSRPB reporting procedure
### 5.5.2 Initiation
The SS requests the UE to start reporting SS-RSRP per receiver branch by
transmitting a SS-RSRPB REPORT REQUEST message. And the UE responds back
reporting SS-RSRP per receiver branch via SS-RSRPB REPORT RESPONSE.
### 5.5.3 Reception of SS-RSRPB REPORT REQUEST message by UE
When the UE receives SS-RSRPB REPORT REQUEST message then the UE shall:
1> if the UE is operating in FR2 AND in RRC_CONNECTED state:
2> if quantityConfigRS-Index is configured to UE by RRC Signalling
3> use the L3 filter coefficient given by quantityConfigRS-Index.
2> else
3> use default L3 filter coefficient of fc4.
2> if the MeasObjectId signalled by the IE SS-RSRPB Measurement Config and
ReportConfigNR with reportType set to periodical which is associated to this
MeasObjectNR are configured to the UE by RRC Signalling
3> Reply with the SS-RSRPB REPORT RESPONSE using the Measurement configuration
as in the Measurement Object identified in the SS-RSRPB Measurement Config and
reportInterval, reportAmount as in the associated ReportConfigNR
3> Report the SS-RSRPB measurement for the best SSB-ID of the serving PCI
configured in the MeasObject
3> FFS to have multiple cells and/or SSB-ID
2> else if the MeasObjectId signalled by the IE SS-RSRPB Measurement Config is
configured to the UE by RRC signalling but no ReportConfigNR with reportType
set to periodical is associated to this MeasObjectNR:
3> Reply with the SS-RSRPB REPORT RESPONSE using the Measurement configuration
as in the Measurement Object identified in the SS-RSRPB Measurement Config and
default reportInterval of 640ms, and default reportAmount of r16
3> Report the SS-RSRPB measurement for the serving PCI and best SSB-ID
configured in the MeasObject
3> FFS to have multiple cells and/or SSB-ID
2> else the UE behaviour is unspecified.

## 5.7 NSSAI delete test function
### 5.7.1 General
The SS use the NSSAI delete test procedure to delete different type of NSSAI
information in the UE, see Figure 5.7.1-1. The different types of NSSAI
information that can be deleted in a NSSAI DELETE REQUEST message are Default
configured NSSAI, Configured NSSAI or Allowed NSSAI information, see clause
6.7. The NSSAI delete test procedure is limited to delete one type of NSSAI
information. To delete more than one type of NSSAI information the SS needs to
repeat the procedure for each type of NSSAI information.
Figure 5.7.1-1: NSSAI delete test procedure

# 6 Test Mode Control message definitions
## 6.1 General
Clause 6 describes only TMC protocol messages.
When UE under test is operated in EN-DC or NGEN-DC the TMC messages are sent
using the E-UTRA RRC _DLInformationTransfer_ and _ULInformationTransfer_
procedures, see TS 36.331 [10], subclauses 5.6.1 and 5.6.2.
When UE under test is operated in NR or NE-DC the TMC messages are sent using
the NR RRC _DLInformationTransfer_ and _ULInformationTransfer_ procedures, see
TS 38.331 [11], subclauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2.
NOTE 1: A message received with skip indicator different from 0 will be
ignored.
NOTE 2: For general definition of Layer 3 message format see TS 24.007 [7],
clause 11.
NOTE 3: 5GS use the same protocol discriminator value (\"1111\") as E-UTRA,
UTRA and GSM/GPRS as specified in TS 24.007 [7], subclause 11.2.3.1.1. 5GS
test control messages the message type value series 1010xxxx is reserved,
where x represents 0 or 1. The message type values 0000xxxx to 1001xxxx are
reserved to E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/GPRS as specified in TS 36.509 [6], TS 34.109
[8] and TS 44.014 [9]. For 5GS test control messages that are common with
E-UTRA control messages in TS 36.509 [6] the 5GS test control messages use the
same message type values as used for the E-UTRA test control messages in TS
36.509 [6].
All the TMC messages are integrity protected and ciphered according to TS
24.301 [17] subclause 4.4 or TS 24.501 [21] subclause 4.4 depending on whether
the TMC message is sent via EPS or 5GC.

# 8 Electrical Man Machine Interface (EMMI)
The EMMI is used for automation of conformance testing. The commands used on
the EMMI by the System Simulator, shall be limited to those specified in TS
38.523-3 [3]. An illustration is given in figure 8-1 as an example.
At the System Simulator side, the logical EMMI using mandatory AT commands
shall interface with the Main Test Component (MTC) of TTCN test cases which
hosts the Upper Tester. The physical EMMI interface towards the UE may be for
example a standard USB interface. Other interfaces of proprietary or
standardized type shall not be precluded.
At the UE side an adapter needs to be provided by the UE manufacturer for
converting the commands into the UE manufacturer specific interface and
format.
The use of EMMI is optional for the UE.
