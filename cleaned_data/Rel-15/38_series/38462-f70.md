used across the E1 interface. The E1 interface provides means for the
interconnection of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP within the NG-RAN architecture (TS
38.401 [2]).

# 4 E1 signalling bearer
## 4.1 Function and protocol stack
E1 signalling bearer provides the following functions:
\- Provision of reliable transfer of E1AP message over E1 interface.
\- Provision of networking and routeing function
\- Provision of redundancy in the signalling network
\- Support for flow control and congestion control
The protocol stack for E1 Signalling Bearer is shown in figure 4.1-1 and
details on each protocol are described in the following sections.
Figure 4.1-1: E1 signalling bearer protocol stack
The Transport Network Layer is based on IP transport, comprising SCTP on top
of IP.
# 5 Data link layer
The support of any suitable Data Link Layer protocol, e.g. PPP, Ethernet,
etc., shall not be prevented.
# 6 IP layer
The gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 [3]) and/or IPv4
(IETF RFC 791 [4]).
The IP layer of E1 only supports point-to-point transmission for delivering
E1AP message.
The gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP shall support the Diffserv Code Point marking as
described in IETF RFC 2474 [5].
# 7 Transport layer
SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 [6]) shall be supported as the transport layer of E1
signalling bearer. The Payload Protocol Identifier assigned by IANA to be used
by SCTP for the application layer protocol E1AP is 64 and 67 for DTLS over
SCTP (IETF RFC 6083 [11]). The byte order of the ppid shall be big-endian.
SCTP refers to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol developed by the
Sigtran working group of the IETF for the purpose of transporting various
signalling protocols over IP network.
The gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP shall support a configuration with a single SCTP
association per gNB-CU-CP/gNB-CU-UP pair. Configurations with multiple SCTP
endpoints per gNB-CU-CP/gNB-CU-UP pair should be supported. When
configurations with multiple SCTP associations are supported, the gNB-CU-CP or
the gNB-CU-UP may request to dynamically add/remove SCTP associations between
the gNB-CU-CP/gNB-CU-UP pair. Within the set of SCTP associations established
between one gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP pair, a single SCTP association shall be
employed for E1AP elementary procedures that utilize non-UE-associated
signalling with the possibility of fail-over to a new association to enable
robustness.
When the configuration with multiple SCTP endpoints per gNB-CU-UP is supported
and gNB-CU-UP wants to add additional SCTP endpoints, the gNB-CU-UP
Configuration Update procedure shall be the first E1AP procedure triggered on
an additional TNLA of an already setup E1 interface instance after the TNL
association has become operational, and the gNB-CU-CP shall associate the TNLA
to the E1 interface instance using the included gNB-CU-UP ID.
Either the gNB-CU-CP or gNB-CU-UP shall establish the first SCTP association.
The additional SCTP associations are established by the gNB-CU-UP. The SCTP
Destination Port number value to be used for E1AP is 38462 which is assigned
by IANA. When the gNB-CU-CP requests to dynamically add additional SCTP
associations between the gNB-CU-CP/gNB-CU-UP pair, the gNB-CU-CP port is
selected and signalled by the gNB-CU-CP to the gNB-CU-UP, and it can be port
number value 38462 or any dynamic port value as defined by IETF RFC 6335 [12].
Between one gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP pair:
\- A single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved over an SCTP
association for the sole use of E1AP elementary procedures that utilize non
UE-associated signalling.
\- At least one pair of stream identifiers over one or several SCTP
associations shall be reserved for the sole use of E1AP elementary procedures
that utilize UE-associated signalling. However, a few pairs (i.e. more than
one) should be reserved.
\- For a single UE-associated signalling the gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP shall
use one SCTP association and one SCTP stream, and the SCTP association/stream
should not be changed during the communication of the UE-associated signalling
until after current SCTP association is failed, or TNL binding update is
performed.
Transport network redundancy may be achieved by SCTP multi-homing between two
end-points, of which one or both is assigned with multiple IP addresses. SCTP
end-points shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP end-point. **For SCTP
endpoint redundancy an INIT may be sent from a gNB-CU-CP or a gNB-CU-UP, at
any time for an already established SCTP association, which shall be handled
as defined in IETF RFC 4960 [6] in sub clause 5.2.**
The SCTP congestion control may, using an implementation specific mechanism,
initiate higher layer protocols to reduce the signalling traffic at the source
and prioritise certain messages.
