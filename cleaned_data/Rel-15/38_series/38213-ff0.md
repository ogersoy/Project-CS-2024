# 4 Synchronization procedures
## 4.1 Cell search
Cell search is the procedure for a UE to acquire time and frequency
synchronization with a cell and to detect the physical layer Cell ID of the
cell.
A UE receives the following synchronization signals (SS) in order to perform
cell search: the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary
synchronization signal (SSS) as defined in [4, TS 38.211].
A UE assumes that reception occasions of a physical broadcast channel (PBCH),
PSS, and SSS are in consecutive symbols, as defined in [4, TS 38.211], and
form a SS/PBCH block. The UE assumes that SSS, PBCH DM-RS, and PBCH data have
same EPRE. The UE may assume that the ratio of PSS EPRE to SSS EPRE in a
SS/PBCH block is either 0 dB or 3 dB. If the UE has not been provided
dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE may assume that the ratio of PDCCH
DMRS EPRE to SSS EPRE is within -8 dB and 8 dB when the UE monitors PDCCHs for
a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI.
For a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks, the first symbol indexes for candidate
SS/PBCH blocks are determined according to the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks as
follows, where index 0 corresponds to the first symbol of the first slot in a
half-frame.
\- Case A - 15 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have
indexes of . For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For
carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .
\- Case B - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have
indexes . For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For
carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .
\- Case C - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have
indexes .
\- For paired spectrum operation
\- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For carrier
frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .
\- For unpaired spectrum operation
\- For carrier frequencies smaller than 1.88 GHz, . For carrier frequencies
within FR1 equal to or larger than 1.88 GHz, .
\- Case D - 120 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks
have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2, .
\- Case E - 240 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks
have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2, .
From the above cases, if the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks is not provided by
_ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ , the applicable cases for a cell depend on a
respective frequency band, as provided in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] and [8-2, TS
38.101-2]. A same case applies for all SS/PBCH blocks on the cell. If a 30 kHz
SS/PBCH block SCS is indicated by _ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ , Case B applies for
frequency bands with only 15 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS
38.101-1], and the case specified for 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS in [8-1, TS
38.101-1] applies for frequency bands with 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS or both 15
kHz and 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]. For a UE
configured to operate with carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a
frequency band of FR2 or with frequency-contiguous carrier aggregation over a
set of cells in a frequency band of FR1, if the UE is provided SCS values by
_ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on any cells from the
set of cells, the UE expects the SCS values to be same.
The candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame are indexed in an ascending order
in time from 0 to . A UE determines the 2 LSB bits, for _,_ or the 3 LSB bits,
for _,_ of a SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with
an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH. For , the UE
determines the 3 MSB bits of the SS/PBCH block index per half frame from PBCH
payload bits as described in [5, TS 38.212].
A UE can be provided per serving cell by _ssb-periodicityServingCell_ a
periodicity of the half frames for reception of the SS/PBCH blocks for the
serving cell. If the UE is not configured a periodicity of the half frames for
receptions of the SS/PBCH blocks, the UE assumes a periodicity of a half
frame. A UE assumes that the periodicity is same for all SS/PBCH blocks in the
serving cell.
For initial cell selection, a UE may assume that half frames with SS/PBCH
blocks occur with a periodicity of 2 frames.
Upon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from _MIB_ that a CORESET
for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in Clause 13, is present if [4, TS
38.211] for FR1 or if for FR2. The UE determines from _MIB_ that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if for FR1 or if for FR2; the CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by _PDCCH-ConfigCommon_.
For a serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires time
and frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on receptions of
SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell, or on the PSCell, of the cell group for the
serving cell.
## 4.2 Transmission timing adjustments
A UE can be provided a value of a timing advance offset for a serving cell by
_n-TimingAdvanceOffset_ for the serving cell. If the UE is not provided _n-
TimingAdvanceOffset_ for a serving cell, the UE determines a default value of
the timing advance offset for the serving cell as described in [10, TS
38.133].
If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, a same timing
advance offset value applies to both carriers.
Upon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG, the UE adjusts uplink
timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all the serving cells in the TAG
based on a value that the UE expects to be same for all the serving cells in
the TAG and based on the received timing advance command where the uplink
timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmissions is the same for all the serving cells
in the TAG.
For a band with synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC in a band combination
with non-applicable maximum transmit timing difference requirements as
described in Note 1 of Table 7.5.3-1 of [10, TS 38.133], if the UE indicates
_ul-TimingAlignmentEUTRA-NR_ as \'required\' and uplink transmission timing
based on timing adjustment indication for a TAG from MCG and a TAG from SCG
are determined to be different by the UE, the UE adjusts the transmission
timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all serving cells part of the band
with the synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC based on timing adjustment
indication for a TAG from a serving cell in MCG in the band. The UE is not
expected to transmit a PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH in one CG when the PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH is
overlapping in time, even partially, with random access preamble transmitted
in another CG.
For a SCS of kHz, the timing advance command for a TAG indicates the change of
the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing for the TAG in
multiples of . The start timing of the random access preamble is described in
[4, TS 38.211].
In case of random access response, a timing advance command [11, TS 38.321], ,
for a TAG indicates values by index values of = 0, 1, 2, ..., 3846, where an
amount of the time alignment for the TAG with SCS of kHz is . is defined in
[4, TS 38.211] and is relative to the SCS of the first uplink transmission
from the UE after the reception of the random access response.
In other cases, a timing advance command [11, TS 38.321], , for a TAG
indicates adjustment of a current value, , to the new value, , by index values
of = 0, 1, 2,..., 63, where for a SCS of kHz, .
If a UE has multiple active UL BWPs, as described in Clause 12, in a same TAG,
including UL BWPs in two UL carriers of a serving cell, the timing advance
command value is relative to the largest SCS of the multiple active UL BWPs.
The applicable value for an UL BWP with lower SCS may be rounded to align with
the timing advance granularity for the UL BWP with the lower SCS while
satisfying the timing advance accuracy requirements in [10, TS38.133].
Adjustment of an value by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing
or delaying the uplink transmission timing for the TAG by a corresponding
amount, respectively.
For a timing advance command received on uplink slot and for a transmission
other than a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant as described in Clause 8.3, the
corresponding adjustment of the uplink transmission timing applies from the
beginning of uplink slot where , is a time duration in msec of symbols
corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when
additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, is a time duration in msec of symbols
corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6,
TS 38.214], is the maximum timing advance value in msec that can be provided
by a TA command field of 12 bits, is the number of slots per subframe, and is
the subframe duration of 1 msec. and are determined with respect to the
minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers
in the TAG and of all configured DL BWPs for the corresponding downlink
carriers. For , the UE assumes [6, TS 38.214]. Slot and are determined with
respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all
uplink carriers in the TAG. is determined with respect to the minimum SCS
among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG
and for all configured initial UL BWPs provided by _initialUplinkBWP_. The
uplink slot is the last slot among uplink slot(s) overlapping with the slot(s)
of PDSCH reception assuming $T_{\text{TA}} = 0$, where the PDSCH provides the
timing advance command and $T_{\text{TA}}$ is defined in [4, TS 38.211].
If a UE changes an active UL BWP between a time of a timing advance command
reception and a time of applying a corresponding adjustment for the uplink
transmission timing, the UE determines the timing advance command value based
on the SCS of the new active UL BWP. If the UE changes an active UL BWP after
applying an adjustment for the uplink transmission timing, the UE assumes a
same absolute timing advance command value before and after the active UL BWP
change.
If the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is only
partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing advance
command as described in [10, TS 38.133], the UE changes accordingly.
If two adjacent slots overlap due to a TA command, the latter slot is reduced
in duration relative to the former slot.
## 4.3 Timing for secondary cell activation / deactivation
With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, when a UE receives in a PDSCH
an activation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot _n_
, the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than
the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133] and no earlier than slot ,
except for the following:
\- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell that is active in
slot
\- the actions related to the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the
secondary cell [11, TS 38.321] that the UE applies in slot
\- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell which is not active
in slot that the UE applies in the earliest slot after in which the serving
cell is active.
The value of is where is a number of slots for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-
ACK information for the PDSCH reception and is indicated by the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format scheduling the PDSCH
reception as described in Clause 9.2.3 and is a number of slots per subframe
for the SCS configuration of the PUCCH transmission.
With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, if a UE receives a
deactivation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot , the
UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the
minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133]_, except_ for the actions
related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE applies in
slot _._
If _the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell expires_ in
slot , the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later
than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133]_, except_ for the
actions related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE
applies in the first slot that is after slot where is the SCS configuration
for PDSCH reception on the secondary cell.
# 5 Radio link monitoring
The downlink radio link quality of the primary cell is monitored by a UE for
the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. The UE
is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other
than the active DL BWP, as described in Clause 12, on the primary cell. If the
active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET
multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in Clause 13, the UE is expected to
perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH
block index is provided by _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_.
If the UE is configured with a SCG, as described in [12, TS 38.331], and the
parameter _rlf-TimersAndConstants_ is provided by higher layers and is not set
to release, the downlink radio link quality of the PSCell of the SCG is
monitored by the UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status
to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link
quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP on the PSCell.
A UE can be configured for each DL BWP of a SpCell [11, TS 38.321] with a set
of resource indexes, through a corresponding set of _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ ,
for radio link monitoring by _failureDetectionResources_. The UE is provided
either a CSI-RS resource configuration index, by _csi-RS-Index_ , or a SS/PBCH
block index, by _ssb-Index_. The UE can be configured with up to
_RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ for link recovery procedures, as decribed in Clause 6,
and for radio link monitoring. From the _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ , up to
_RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ can be used for radio link monitoring depending on a
maximum number of candidate SS/PBCH blocks per half frame as described in
Clause 4.1, and up to two _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ can be used for link
recovery procedures.
If the UE is not provided _RadioLinkMonitoringRS and the UE is provided for
PDCCH receptions TCI states that include one or more of a CSI-RS_
\- the UE uses for radio link monitoring the RS provided for the active TCI
state for PDCCH _reception_ if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception
includes only one RS
\- if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes two RS, the UE expects
that one RS has QCL-TypeD [6, TS 38.214] and the UE uses the RS with QCL-TypeD
for radio link monitoring; the UE does not expect both RS to have QCL-TypeD
\- the UE is not required to use for radio link monitoring an aperiodic or
semi-persistent RS
\- For , the UE selects the RS provided for active TCI states for PDCCH
receptions in CORESETs associated with the search space sets in an order from
the shortest monitoring periodicity. If more than one CORESETs are associated
with search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines
the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in Clause
10.1.
A UE does not expect to use more than _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ for radio link
monitoring when the UE is not provided _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_.
Values of and for different values of are given in Table 5-1.
Table 5-1: and as a function of _maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half
frame_
* * *
4 2 2 8 6 4 64 8 8
* * *
For a CSI-RS resource configuration, _powerControlOffsetSS_ is not applicable
and a UE expects to be provided only \'noCDM\' from _cdm-Type,_ only \'one\'
and \'three\' from _density_ , and only \'1 port\' from _nrofPorts_ [6, TS
38.214].
If a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE
performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided by
_RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ for the active DL BWP or, if _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_
is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the RS(s) provided _for the
active TCI state for PDCCH receptions_ in CORESETs on the active DL BWP.
In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per
indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time
period defined in [10, TS 38.133] against thresholds (Q~out~ and Q~in~)
configured by _rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold_. The UE determines the indication
period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link
monitoring resources _and 10 msec._
In DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per
indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time
period defined in [10, TS 38.133], against thresholds (Q~out~ and Q~in~)
provided by _rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold_. The UE determines the indication
period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link
monitoring resources _and the DRX period._
The physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality
is assessed, out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse
than the threshold Q~out~ for all resources in the set of resources for radio
link monitoring. When the radio link quality is better than the threshold
Q~in~ for any resource in the set of resources for radio link monitoring, the
physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality is
assessed, in-sync to higher layers.
# 6 Link recovery procedures
A UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set _of periodic CSI-
RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionResources and_ a set of
periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by
_candidateBeamRSList_ for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the
serving cell. If the UE is not provided _failureDetectionResources, the UE
determines the set to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes
with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by_ _TCI-State_
for respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH and, if there
are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set includes RS indexes with QCL-TypeD
configuration for the corresponding TCI states. The UE expects the set to
include up to two RS indexes. The UE expects single port RS in the _set ._
The thresholds Q~out,LR~ and Q~in,LR~ correspond to the default value of
_rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold_ , as described in [10, TS 38.133] for Q~out~,
and to the value provided by _rsrp-ThresholdSSB_ , respectively.
The physical layer in the UE assesses the radio link quality according to the
set of resource configurations against the threshold Q~out,LR~. For the set _,
the UE_ assesses the radio link quality only according to periodic _CSI-RS
resource configurations or SS/PBCH blocks that_ are quasi co-located, as
described in [6, TS 38.214], with the DM-RS of PDCCH receptions monitored by
the UE. The UE applies the Q~in,LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement
obtained from a SS/PBCH block. The UE applies the Q~in,LR~ threshold to the
L1-RSRP measurement obtained for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective
CSI-RS reception power with a value provided by _powerControlOffsetSS_.
In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE provides an indication
to higher layers when the radio link quality for all corresponding resource
configurations in the set _that the UE uses to assess the radio link quality_
is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~. The physical layer informs the higher
layers when the _radio link quality_ is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~
with a periodicity determined by the maximum between the shortest periodicity
among the periodic CSI-RS configurations and/or SS/PBCH blocks in the set
_that the UE uses to assess the radio link quality and 2 msec. In DRX mode
operation, the physical layer_ provides an indication to higher layers _when
the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~ with a
periodicity determined as described in [10, TS 38.133]._
Upon request from higher layers, the UE provides to higher layers the periodic
CSI-RS configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes from the set _and
the corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that are larger than or equal to the_
Q~in,LR~ _threshold._
A UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to a search space set provided
by _recoverySearchSpaceId,_ as described in Clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH
in the CORESET. If the UE is provided _recoverySearchSpaceId_ , the UE does
not expect to be provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the
CORESET associated with the search space set provided by
_recoverySearchSpaceId_.
The UE may receive by _PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR_ , a configuration for PRACH
transmission as described in Clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot and
according to antenna port quasi co-location parameters associated with
periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated with
index _provided by higher layers_ [11, TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a
search space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ for detection of a DCI
format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot within a
window configured by _BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring_ in a
search space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ _and for corresponding
PDSCH reception, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation
parameters as the ones associated with_ index _until the UE receives by higher
layers an activation for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-
ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList._ After the UE detects a DCI
format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set
provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ , the UE continues to monitor PDCCH
candidates in the search space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ until
the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or _tci-
StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList._
_After 28 symbols from a last symbol of_ a first PDCCH reception in a search
space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ for which the UE detects a DCI
format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI _and_ until the UE receives
an activation command for _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ [11, TS 38.321] or is
provided _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ for PUCCH resource(s), t _he UE transmits
a PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH transmission using_
\- _a_ same spatial filter as for the last PRACH transmission
\- _a_ power determined as described in Clause 7.2.1 with , , and
_After 28 symbols from a last symbol of a first PDCCH reception in a search
space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceId where a UE detects a DCI format
with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, the UE assumes same antenna port
quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index for PDCCH
monitoring in a CORESET with index 0._
# 7 Uplink Power control
Uplink power control determines a power for PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, and PRACH
transmissions.
_A UE does not expect to simultaneously maintain more than four pathloss
estimates per serving cell for all PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions as described
in Clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1._
_A PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS/PRACH transmission occasion is defined by a_ slot index
within a frame with system frame number , a first symbol within the slot, and
a number of consecutive symbols .
## 7.1 Physical uplink shared channel
For a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP _, as described in Clause 12, of_
carrier _of_ serving cell _,_ a UE first calculates a linear value _of the_
transmit power _, with parameters as defined in Clause 7.1.1. For a_ PUSCH
transmission scheduled by a DCI format 0_1 or configured by
_ConfiguredGrantConfig_ or _semiPersistentOnPUSCH_ , if _txConfig_ in _PUSCH-
Config_ is set to \'codebook\' and each SRS resource in the _SRS-ResourceSet_
with _usage_ set to \'codebook\' has more than one SRS port _, the UE scales

## 7.4 Physical random access channel
A UE determines a transmission power for a physical random access channel
(PRACH), , on active UL BWP of carrier of serving cell based on DL RS for
serving cell in transmission occasion as
[dBm],
where is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1],
[8-2, TS38.101-2] and [38.101-3] for carrier of serving cell within
transmission occasion , is the PRACH target reception power
_PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER_ provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for
the active UL BWP of carrier of serving cell , and is a pathloss for the
active UL BWP of carrier _based on_ the DL RS associated with the PRACH
transmission on the active DL BWP _of_ serving cell and calculated by the UE
in dB as _referenceSignalPower_ \-- higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm, where
RSRP is defined in [7, TS 38.215] and the higher layer filter configuration is
defined in [12, TS 38.331]. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for
SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in Clause
13, the UE determines based on the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH
transmission.
If a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH
order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE
that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated
with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index _is associated with
a SS/PBCH block, as described in Clause 6,_ _referenceSignalPower_ is provided
by _ss-PBCH-BlockPower_.
If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH
order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and
depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasi-collocated
with as described in Clause 10.1, _referenceSignalPower_ is provided by _ss-
PBCH-BlockPower_ or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS
reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery
procedure where a corresponding index _is associated with a periodic CSI-RS
configuration_ _as described in Clause 6_ , _referenceSignalPower_ is obtained
by _ss-PBCH-BlockPower_ and _powerControlOffsetSS_ where
_powerControlOffsetSS_ provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power
relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If
_powerControlOffsetSS_ is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of
0 dB. If the active TCI state for the PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order
includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS has QCL-TypeD properties and the
UE uses the one RS when applying a value provided by _powerControlOffsetSS_.
If within a random access response window, as described in Clause 8.2, the UE
does not receive a random access response that contains a preamble identifier
corresponding to the preamble sequence transmitted by the UE, the UE
determines a transmission power for a subsequent PRACH transmission, if any,
as described in [11, TS 38.321].
If prior to a PRACH retransmission, a UE changes the spatial domain
transmission filter, Layer 1 notifies higher layers to suspend the power
ramping counter as described in [11, TS 38.321].
If due to power allocation _to_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS transmissions as
described in Clause 7.5, or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC
operation as described in Clause 7.6.1 or Clause 7.6.1A, respectively,_ the UE
does not transmit a PRACH _in a transmission occasion_ , Layer 1 notifies
higher layers to suspend the corresponding power ramping counter. If due to
power allocation _to_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS transmissions as described in
Clause 7.5, or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC operation as
described in Clause 7.6.1 or Clause 7.6.1A, respectively,_ the UE transmits a
PRACH with reduced power _in a transmission occasion_ , Layer 1 may notify
higher layers to suspend the corresponding power ramping counter.
## 7.5 Prioritizations for transmission power reductions
For single cell operation with two uplink carriers or for operation with
carrier aggregation, if a _total UE transmit power for PUSCH or PUCCH or PRACH
or SRS transmissions on serving cells in a frequency range in a respective
transmission occasion would exceed , where is the linear value of in
transmission occasion as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] for FR1_ and [8-2,
TS38.101-2] _for FR2, the UE allocates power to_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS
transmissions according to the following priority order (in descending order)
so that the total UE transmit power for transmissions on serving cells in the
frequency range is smaller than or equal to for that frequency range in every
symbol of transmission occasion . When determining a total transmit power for
serving cells in a frequency range in a symbol of transmission occasion , the
UE does not include power for transmissions starting after the symbol of
transmission occasion . The total UE transmit power in a symbol of a slot is
defined as the sum of the linear values of UE transmit powers for PUSCH,
PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS in the symbol of the slot._
\- PRACH transmission on the PCell
\- PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information and/or SR or PUSCH
transmission with HARQ-ACK information
\- PUCCH transmission with CSI or PUSCH transmission with CSI
\- PUSCH transmission without HARQ-ACK information or CSI
\- SRS transmission, with aperiodic SRS having higher priority than semi-
persistent and/or periodic SRS, or PRACH transmission on a serving cell other
than the PCell
In case of same priority order and for operation with carrier aggregation, the
UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the primary cell of the
MCG or the SCG over transmissions on a secondary cell. In case of same
priority order and for operation with two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes
power allocation for transmissions on the carrier where the UE is configured
to transmit PUCCH. If _PUCCH_ is not configured for any of the _two UL
carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on_ the non-
supplementary UL carrier.
## 7.6 Dual connectivity
### 7.6.1 EN-DC
If a UE is configured with a MCG using E-UTRA radio access and with a SCG
using NR radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power for transmissions
on the MCG by _p-MaxEUTRA_ and a maximum power for transmissions in FR1 on the
SCG by _p-NR-FR1_.
The UE determines a transmission power for the MCG as described in [13, TS
36.213] using as the maximum transmission power. The UE determines
transmission power for the SCG in FR1 as described Clauses 7.1 through 7.5
using as the maximum transmission power. The UE determines transmission power
for the SCG in FR2 as described Clauses 7.1 through 7.5.

any portion of slot , where and are the linear values of the total UE
transmission powers in subframe of the MCG and in slot of the SCG in FR1,
respectively. The UE is not required to transmit in any portion of slot of the
SCG if would need to be reduced by more than the value provided by _X~SCALE~_
in order for in any portion of slot of the SCG. The UE is required to transmit
in slot of the SCG if would not need to be reduced by more than the value
provided by _X~SCALE~_ in order for in all portions of slot .
\- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing between
E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, the UE expects to be configured with reference TDD
configuration for E-UTRA (by _tdm-PatternConfig-r15_ in [13, TS 36.213]).
### 7.6.1A NE-DC
If a UE is configured with a MCG using NR radio access and with a SCG using
E-UTRA radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power for transmissions in
FR1 on the MCG by _p-NR-FR1_ and a maximum power for transmissions on the SCG
by _p-MaxEUTRA_.
The UE determines transmission power for the MCG in FR1 as described Clauses
7.1 through 7.5 using as the maximum transmission power for . The UE
determines transmission power for the MCG in FR2 as described Clauses 7.1
through 7.5.
If the UE is not provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for the MCG, t_ he UE
determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in [13, TS 36.213]
using as the maximum transmission power.
If at least one symbol of slot of the MCG that is indicated as uplink or
flexible by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd_ -_UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ overlaps with subframe of the SCG
\- for subframe , the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as
described in [13, TS 36.213] using as the maximum transmission power
otherwise
\- the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in [13, TS
36.213] without considering as the maximum transmission power
If a UE is configured with , where is the linear value of , is the linear
value of , and is the linear value of a configured maximum transmission power
for NE-DC operation as _defined in_ [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for FR1, the UE
determines a transmission power for the MCG as follows
\- If the UE is configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA (by
_tdm-PatternConfigNE-DC-r15_ in [13, TS 36.213])
\- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing between
E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC, the UE does not expect to transmit in a slot on the
MCG in FR1 when a corresponding subframe on the SCG is an UL subframe in the
reference TDD configuration.
\- If the UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA
and NR for NE-DC and
\- if the UE transmission(s) in slot of the MCG in FR1 overlap in time with UE
transmission(s) in subframe of the SCG, and
\- if in any portion of slot of the MCG,
the UE reduces transmission power in any portion of slot of the MCG so that in

configuration for E-UTRA (by _tdm-PatternConfigNE-DC-r15_ in [13, TS 36.213]).
### 7.6.2 NR-DC
If a UE is configured with a MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or in FR2 and
with a SCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1, respectively, the UE
performs transmission power control independently per cell group as described
in Clauses 7.1 through 7.5.
## 7.7 Power headroom report
The types of UE power headroom reports are the following. A Type 1 UE power
headroom that is valid for PUSCH transmission occasion on active UL BWP of
carrier _of_ serving cell . A Type 3 UE power headroom that is valid for SRS
transmission occasion on active UL BWP of carrier _of_ serving cell .
A UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving cell
[11, TS 38.321] is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based
on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-
persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control
information the UE received until and including the PDCCH monitoring occasion
where the UE detects the first DCI format 0_0 or DCI format 0_1 scheduling an
initial transmission of a transport block since a power headroom report was
triggered if the power headroom report is reported on a PUSCH triggered by the
first DCI. Otherwise, a UE determines whether a power headroom report is based
on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer
signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference
signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until
the first uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus _T\'~proc,2~_
=_T~proc,2~_ where _T~proc,2\ ~_ is determined according to [6, TS 38.214]
assuming _d~2,1\ ~_ = 1, _d~2,2~_ =0, and with _µ~DL~_ corresponding to the
subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a
configured grant if the power headroom report is reported on the PUSCH using
the configured grant.
If a UE
\- is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, and
\- determines a Type 1 power headroom report and a Type 3 power headroom
report for the serving cell
the UE
\- provides the Type 1 power headroom report if both the Type 1 and Type 3
power headroom reports are based on respective actual transmissions or on
respective reference transmissions
\- provides the power headroom report that is based on a respective actual
transmission if either the Type 1 report or the Type 3 report is based on a
respective reference transmission
If a UE is configured with a SCG and if _phr-ModeOtherCG_ for a CG indicates
\'virtual\' then, for power headroom reports transmitted on the CG, the UE
computes _PH_ assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any
serving cell of the other CG.
If the UE is configured with a SCG,
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to MCG, the term \'serving
cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the MCG.
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to SCG, the term \'serving
cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the SCG. The term
\'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell,
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to primary PUCCH group,
the term \'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to
the primary PUCCH group.
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to secondary PUCCH group,
the term \'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to
the secondary PUCCH group. The term \'primary cell\' in this clause refers to
the PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group.
For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power sharing, if
E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR [14, TS 36.321] is triggered and,
\- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is different from that of
E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR, the UE provides power
headroom of the first NR slot that fully overlaps with the E-UTRA subframe;
\- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is the same as that of E-UTRA
subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR for asynchronous EN-DC/NE-DC [10,
TS 38.133], the UE provides power headroom of the first NR slot that overlaps
with the E-UTRA subframe.
### 7.7.1 Type 1 PH report
If a UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on an actual PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH
transmission occasion on active UL BWP _of_ carrier _of_ serving cell , the UE
computes the Type 1 power headroom report as
[dB]
where , , , , , and are defined in Clause 7.1.1.
If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, where a SCS
configuration on active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _is smaller than
a_ SCS configuration on active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _, and if
the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission in a
slot on active_ UL BWP _that overlaps with multiple slots on active_ UL BWP _,
the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for the first PUSCH, if any, on
the first slot of the multiple slots on active_ UL BWP that fully overlaps
with the slot on active UL BWP . If a UE is configured with multiple cells for
PUSCH transmissions, where a same SCS configuration on active UL BWP _of_
carrier of serving cell _and_ active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _,
and if the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission
in a slot on active_ UL BWP _, the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report
for the first PUSCH, if any, on the slot on active_ UL BWP that overlaps with
the slot on active UL BWP .
For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power sharing, if
E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR [14, TS 36.321] is triggered, the UE provides
power headroom of the first PUSCH, if any, on the determined NR slot as
described in clause 7.7.
If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, the UE does
not consider for computation of a Type 1 power headroom report in a first
PUSCH transmission that includes an initial transmission of transport block on
active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _, a second_ PUSCH transmission on
active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _that overlaps with the first PUSCH
transmission if_
\- the second PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 or a DCI
format 0_1 in a PDCCH received in a second PDCCH monitoring occasion, and
\- the second PDCCH monitoring occasion is after a first PDCCH monitoring
occasion where the UE detects the earliest DCI format 0_0 or DCI format 0_1
scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block after a power headroom
report was triggered
or
\- the second PUSCH transmission is after the first uplink symbol of the first
PUSCH transmission minus _T\'~proc,2~_ =_T~proc,2~_ where _T~proc,2~_ is
determined according to [6, TS 38.214] assuming _d~2,1\ ~_ =1, _d~2,2~_ =0,
and with _µ~DL~_ corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active
downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the first PUSCH
transmission is on a configured grant after a power headroom report was
triggered.
If the UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on a reference PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH
transmission occasion on active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell , the UE
computes the Type 1 power headroom report as
[dB]
where is computed assuming MPR=0 dB, A-MPR=0 dB, P-MPR=0 dB. ∆T~C~ = 0 dB.
MPR, A-MPR, P-MPR and ∆T~C~ are defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2,
TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3]. The remaining parameters are defined in
Clause 7.1.1 where and are obtained using and _p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId_ _=_ 0 _,_
is obtained using _pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id =_ 0, and .
If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a
reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report
for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier
provided by _pusch-Config_. If the UE is provided _pusch-Config_ for both UL
carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell
assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by _pucch-
Config_. If _pucch-Config_ is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL
carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell
assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.
### 7.7.2 Type 2 PH report
This clause is reserved.
### 7.7.3 Type 3 PH report
If a UE determines that a Type 3 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on an actual SRS transmission then, for SRS transmission
occasion on active UL BWP _of_ carrier _of_ serving cell and if the UE is not
configured for PUSCH transmissions on carrier _of_ serving cell , the UE
computes a Type 3 power headroom report as
[dB]
where , , , , and are defined in Clause 7.3.1.
If the UE determines that a Type 3 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on a reference SRS transmission then, for SRS
transmission occasion on UL BWP _of_ carrier _of_ serving cell , and if the UE
is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on UL BWP _of_ carrier _of_ serving
cell , the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report as

BWP and , , and are defined in Clause 7.3.1 with corresponding values obtained
from _SRS-ResourceSetId = 0_ for UL BWP . is computed assuming MPR=0 dB,
A-MPR=0 dB, P-MPR=0 dB and ∆T~C~ =0 dB. MPR, A-MPR, P-MPR and ∆T~C~ are
defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3].
If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
determines a Type 3 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a
reference SRS transmission, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report for
the serving cell assuming a reference SRS transmission on the UL carrier
provided by _pucch-Config_. If _pucch-Config_ is not provided to the UE for
any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report for
the serving cell assuming a reference SRS transmission on the non-
supplementary UL carrier.
# 8 Random access procedure
Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 receives
from higher layers a set of SS/PBCH block indexes and provides to higher
layers a corresponding set of RSRP measurements.
Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 receives
the following information from the higher layers:
\- Configuration of physical random access channel (PRACH) transmission
parameters (PRACH preamble format, time resources, and frequency resources for
PRACH transmission).
\- Parameters for determining the root sequences and their cyclic shifts in
the PRACH preamble sequence set (index to logical root sequence table, cyclic
shift (), and set type (unrestricted, restricted set A, or restricted set B)).
From the physical layer perspective, the L1 random access procedure includes
the transmission of random access preamble (Msg1) in a PRACH, random access
response (RAR) message with a PDCCH/PDSCH (Msg2), and when applicable, the
transmission of a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant, and PDSCH for contention
resolution.
If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order to the UE, a PRACH
transmission is with a same SCS as a PRACH transmission initiated by higher
layers.
If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
detects a PDCCH order, the UE uses the UL/SUL indicator field value from the
detected PDCCH order to determine the UL carrier for the corresponding PRACH
transmission.
## 8.1 Random access preamble
Physical random access procedure is triggered upon request of a PRACH
transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order. A configuration by higher
layers for a PRACH transmission includes the following:
\- A configuration for PRACH transmission [4, TS 38.211].
\- A preamble index, a preamble SCS, , a corresponding RA-RNTI, and a PRACH
resource.
A PRACH is transmitted using the selected PRACH format with transmission power
, as described in Clause 7.4, on the indicated PRACH resource.
A UE is provided a number of SS/PBCH blocks associated with one PRACH occasion
and a number of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block per valid PRACH
occasion by _ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB_. If , one SS/PBCH
block is mapped to consecutive valid PRACH occasions and contention based
preambles with consecutive indexes associated with the SS/PBCH block per valid
PRACH occasion start from preamble index 0. If , contention based preambles
with consecutive indexes associated with SS/PBCH block , , per valid PRACH
occasion start from preamble index where is provided by _totalNumberOfRA-
Preambles_ and is an integer multiple of .
For link recovery, a UE is provided SS/PBCH blocks associated with one PRACH
occasion by _ssb-perRACH-Occasion_ in _BeamFailureRecoveryConfig_. For a
dedicated RACH configuration provided by _RACH-ConfigDedicated_ , if _cfra_ is
provided, a UE is provided SS/PBCH blocks associated with one PRACH occasion
by _ssb-perRACH-Occasion_ in _occasions_. If , one SS/PBCH block is mapped to
consecutive valid PRACH occasions. If , all consecutive SS/PBCH blocks are
associated with one PRACH occasion.
SS/PBCH block indexes provided by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ or in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ are mapped to valid PRACH occasions in the following
order where the parameters are described in [4, TS 38.211].
\- First, in increasing order of preamble indexes within a single PRACH
occasion
\- Second, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency
multiplexed PRACH occasions
\- Third, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed
PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot
\- Fourth, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots
An association period, starting from frame 0, for mapping SS/PBCH blocks to
PRACH occasions is the smallest value in the set determined by the PRACH
configuration period according Table 8.1-1 such that SS/PBCH blocks are mapped
at least once to the PRACH occasions within the association period, where a UE
obtains from the value of _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ or in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH blocks to
PRACH occasions mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of
PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles that are not mapped to SS/PBCH blocks, no
SS/PBCH blocks are mapped to the set of PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles. An
association pattern period includes one or more association periods and is
determined so that a pattern between PRACH occasions and SS/PBCH blocks
repeats at most every 160 msec. PRACH occasions not associated with SS/PBCH
blocks after an integer number of association periods, if any, are not used
for PRACH transmissions.
For a PRACH transmission triggered by a PDCCH order, the PRACH mask index
field [5, TS 38.212], if the value of the random access preamble index field
is not zero, indicates the PRACH occasion for the PRACH transmission where the
PRACH occasions are associated with the SS/PBCH block index indicated by the
SS/PBCH block index field of the PDCCH order.
For a PRACH transmission triggered by higher layers, if _ssb-ResourceList_ is
provided, the PRACH mask index is indicated by _ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex_
which indicates the PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH
occasions are associated with the selected SS/PBCH block index.
The PRACH occasions are mapped consecutively per corresponding SS/PBCH block
index. The indexing of the PRACH occasion indicated by the mask index value is
reset per mapping cycle of consecutive PRACH occasions per SS/PBCH block
index. The UE selects for a PRACH transmission the PRACH occasion indicated by
PRACH mask index value for the indicated SS/PBCH block index in the first
available mapping cycle.
For the indicated preamble index, the ordering of the PRACH occasions is
\- First, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency
multiplexed PRACH occasions
\- Second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed
PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot
\- Third, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots
For a PRACH transmission triggered upon request by higher layers, a value of
_ra-OccasionList_ [12, TS 38.331], if _csirs-ResourceList_ is provided,
indicates a list of PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH
occasions are associated with the selected CSI-RS index indicated by _csi-RS_.
The indexing of the PRACH occasions indicated by _ra-OccasionList_ is reset
per association pattern period.

For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band all PRACH occasions are
valid. For unpaired spectrum, if a UE is not provided _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , a PRACH occasion in a PRACH slot is valid if it does
not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PRACH slot and starts at least symbols
after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where is provided in Table 8.1-2.
If a UE is provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , a PRACH occasion in a
PRACH slot is valid if
\- it is within UL symbols, or
\- it does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PRACH slot and starts at least
symbols after a last downlink symbol and at least symbols after a last SS/PBCH
block symbol, where is provided in Table 8.1-2.

If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order, the UE, if
requested by higher layers, transmits a PRACH in the selected PRACH occasion,
as described in [11, TS 38.321], for which a time between the last symbol of
the PDCCH order reception and the first symbol of the PRACH transmission is
larger than or equal to msec, where is a time duration of symbols
corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6,
TS 38.214] assuming corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the
SCS configuration of the PDCCH order and the SCS configuration of the
corresponding PRACH transmission, if the active UL BWP does not change and is
defined in [10, TS 38.133] otherwise, and msec for FR1 and msec for FR2. For a
PRACH transmission using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines assuming SCS
configuration .
For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same
frequency band, a UE does not transmit PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in a same
slot or when a gap between the first or last symbol of a PRACH transmission in
a first slot is separated by less than symbols from the last or first symbol,
respectively, of a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission in a second slot where for or
, for or , and is the SCS configuration for the active UL BWP.
## 8.2 Random access response
In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1_0
with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a window controlled by
higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the
earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS
set, as defined in Clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last
symbol of the PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where
the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined
in Clause 10.1. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS
for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by _ra-ResponseWindow_.
If the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding
RA-RNTI and a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the
UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher layers parse the
transport block for a random access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with
the PRACH transmission. If the higher layers identify the RAPID in RAR
message(s) of the transport block, the higher layers indicate an uplink grant
to the physical layer. This is referred to as random access response (RAR) UL
grant in the physical layer.
If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE does not correctly
receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or
if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH
transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer
to transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher layers, the UE shall be ready to
transmit a PRACH no later than msec after the last symbol of the window, or
the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where is a time duration of symbols
corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1
assuming corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS
configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format 1_0, the corresponding
PDSCH when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, and the corresponding PRACH.
For , the UE assumes [6, TS 38.214]. For a PRACH transmission using 1.25 kHz
or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines assuming SCS configuration .
If the UE detects a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-
RNTI and receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH, the UE may
assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in
[6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block or a CSI-RS resource the UE used for
PRACH association, as described in Clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not
the UE is provided _TCI-State_ for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH
with the DCI format 1_0. If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format 1_0 with
CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH transmission
initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access
procedure for the SpCell [11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the PDCCH
that includes the DCI format 1_0 and the PDCCH order have same DM-RS antenna
port quasi co-location properties. If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format
1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH
transmission initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random
access procedure for a secondary cell, the UE may assume the DM-RS antenna
port quasi co-location properties of the CORESET associated with the
Type1-PDCCH CSS set for receiving the PDCCH that includes the DCI format 1_0.
A RAR UL grant schedules a PUSCH transmission from the UE. The contents of the
RAR UL grant, starting with the MSB and ending with the LSB, are given in
Table 8.2-1.
If the value of the frequency hopping flag is 0, the UE transmits the PUSCH
without frequency hopping; otherwise, the UE transmits the PUSCH with
frequency hopping.
The UE determines the MCS of the PUSCH transmission from the first sixteen
indexes of the applicable MCS index table for PUSCH as described in [6, TS
38.214].
The TPC command value is used for setting the power of the PUSCH transmission,
as described in Clause 7.1.1, and is interpreted according to Table 8.2-2.
The CSI request field is reserved.

Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH using same
SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.
If the UE does not detect the DCI format with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI or the UE does not correctly receive a corresponding
transport block within the window, the UE procedure is as described in [11, TS
38.321].
## 8.3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant
An active UL BWP, as described in Clause 12 and in [4, TS 38.211], for a PUSCH
transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant is indicated by higher layers. For
determining the frequency domain resource allocation for the PUSCH
transmission within the active UL BWP
\- if the active UL BWP and the initial UL BWP have same SCS and same CP
length and the active UL BWP includes all RBs of the initial UL BWP, or the
active UL BWP is the initial UL BWP, the initial UL BWP is used
\- else, the RB numbering starts from the first RB of the active UL BWP and
the maximum number of RBs for frequency domain resource allocation equals the
number of RBs in the initial UL BWP
The frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink resource allocation type
1 [6, TS 38.214]. For an initial UL BWP size of RBs, a UE processes the
frequency domain resource assignment field as follows
\- if
\- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to its least
significant bits and interpret the truncated frequency resource assignment
field as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format 0_0 as
described in [5, TS 38.212]
\- else
\- insert most significant bits with value set to \'0\' after the bits to the
frequency domain resource assignment field, where if the frequency hopping
flag is set to \'0\' and is provided in Table 8.3-1 if the hopping flag bit is
set to \'1\', and interpret the expanded frequency resource assignment field
as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format 0_0 as described
in [5, TS 38.212]
\- end if
A UE determines whether or not to apply transform precoding as described in
[6, TS 38.214].
For a PUSCH transmission with frequency hopping scheduled by RAR UL grant or
for a Msg3 PUSCH retransmission, the frequency offset for the second hop [6,
TS 38.214] is given in Table 8.3-1.

A SCS for the PUSCH transmission is provided by _subcarrierSpacing_ in _BWP-
UplinkCommon_. A UE transmits PRACH and the PUSCH on a same uplink carrier of
a same serving cell.
A UE transmits a transport block in a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant in a
corresponding RAR message using redundancy version number 0. If a TC-RNTI is
provided by higher layers, the scrambling initialization of the PUSCH
corresponding to the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by TC-RNTI. Otherwise, the
scrambling initialization of the PUSCH corresponding to the RAR UL grant in
clause 8.2 is by C-RNTI. Msg3 PUSCH retransmissions, if any, of the transport
block, are scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI
provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321]. The UE always
transmits the PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant without
repetitions[.]{.underline}
With reference to slots for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant,
if a UE receives a PDSCH with a RAR message ending in slot for a corresponding
PRACH transmission from the UE, the UE transmits the PUSCH in slot , where and
are provided in [6, TS 38.214].
The UE may assume a minimum time between the last symbol of a PDSCH reception
conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant and the first symbol of a
corresponding PUSCH transmission scheduled by the RAR UL grant is equal to
msec, where is a time duration of symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing
time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured,
is a time duration of symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE
processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214] and, for determining the minimum time,
the UE considers that and correspond to the smaller of the SCS configurations
for the PDSCH and the PUSCH. For , the UE assumes [6, TS 38.214].
## 8.4 PDSCH with UE contention resolution identity
In response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant when a UE has
not been provided a C-RNTI, the UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1_0 with
CRC scrambled by a corresponding TC-RNTI scheduling a PDSCH that includes a UE
contention resolution identity [11, TS 38.321]. In response to the PDSCH
reception with the UE contention resolution identity, the UE transmits HARQ-
ACK information in a PUCCH. The PUCCH transmission is within a same active UL
BWP as the PUSCH transmission. A minimum time between the last symbol of the
PDSCH reception and the first symbol of the corresponding PUCCH transmission
with the HARQ-ACK information is equal to msec. is a time duration of symbols
corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when
additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For , the UE assumes [6, TS 38.214].
When detecting a DCI format in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a
RAR UL grant, as described in [11, TS 38.321], or corresponding PUSCH
retransmission scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI
provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume
the PDCCH carrying the DCI format has the same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-
location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block
the UE used for PRACH association, as described in Clause 8.1, regardless of
whether or not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE
receives the PDCCH with the DCI format.
# 9 UE procedure for reporting control information
If a UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures described
in this clause for both MCG and SCG.
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both primary PUCCH group and secondary PUCCH
group
\- When the procedures are applied for the primary PUCCH group, the terms
\'secondary cell\', \'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\'
in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving
cells belonging to the primary PUCCH group respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for secondary PUCCH group, the terms
\'secondary cell\', \'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\'
in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including the
PUCCH-SCell), serving cell, serving cells belonging to the secondary PUCCH
group respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the
PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group.
If a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to be
configured with a PUCCH-SCell.
If a UE would transmit on a serving cell a PUSCH without UL-SCH that overlaps
with a PUCCH transmission on a serving cell that includes positive SR
information, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH.
If a UE would transmit CSI reports on overlapping physical channels, the UE
applies the priority rules described in [6, TS 38.214] for the multiplexing of
CSI reports.
If a UE has overlapping resources for PUCCH transmissions in a slot and at
least one of the PUCCH transmissions is with repetitions over multiple slots,
the UE first follows the procedures described in Clause 9.2.6 for resolving
the overlapping among the resources for the PUCCH transmissions.
If a UE
\- would multiplex UCI in a PUCCH transmission that overlaps with a PUSCH
transmission, and
\- the PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions fulfill the conditions in Clause 9.2.5
for UCI multiplexing,
the UE
\- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information, if any, from the UCI in the PUSCH
transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE multiplexes aperiodic
or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH;
\- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information and CSI reports, if any, from the UCI
in the PUSCH transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE does not
multiplex aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH.
A UE does not expect to multiplex in a PUSCH transmission in one slot with SCS
configuration UCI of same type that the UE would transmit in PUCCHs in
different slots with SCS configuration if .
**A UE does not expect a PUCCH resource that results from multiplexing
overlapped PUCCH resources, if applicable, to overlap with more than one
PUSCHs if each of the more than one PUSCHs includes** aperiodic CSI reports.
A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or a
SPS PDSCH release and indicating a resource for a PUCCH transmission with
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a slot if the UE previously detects a
DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission in the slot and if the UE
multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission.
If a UE multiplexes aperiodic CSI in a PUSCH and the UE would multiplex UCI
that includes HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH that overlaps with the PUSCH and
the timing conditions for overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in Clause 9.2.5 are
fulfilled, the UE multiplexes only the HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH and
does not transmit the PUCCH.
If a UE transmits multiple PUSCHs in a slot on respective serving cells that
include first PUSCHs that are scheduled by DCI format(s) 0_0 or DCI format(s)
0_1 and second PUSCHs configured by respective _ConfiguredGrantConfig_ or
_semiPersistentOnPUSCH_ , and the UE would multiplex UCI in one of the
multiple PUSCHs, and the multiple PUSCHs fulfil the conditions in Clause 9.2.5
for UCI multiplexing, the UE multiplexes the UCI in a PUSCH from the first
PUSCHs.
If a UE transmits multiple PUSCHs in a slot on respective serving cells and
the UE would multiplex UCI in one of the multiple PUSCHs and the UE does not
multiplex aperiodic CSI in any of the multiple PUSCHs, the UE multiplexes the
UCI in a PUSCH of the serving cell with the smallest _ServCellIndex_ subject
to the conditions in Clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing being fulfilled. If the
UE transmits more than one PUSCHs in the slot on the serving cell with the
smallest _ServCellIndex_ that fulfil the conditions in Clause 9.2.5 for UCI
multiplexing, the UE multiplexes the UCI in the earliest PUSCH that the UE
transmits in the slot.
If a UE transmits a PUSCH over multiple slots and the UE would transmit a
PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information over a single slot and in a slot
that overlaps with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots of the multiple
slots, and the PUSCH transmission in the one or more slots fulfills the
conditions in Clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI
information, the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the
PUSCH transmission in the one or more slots. The UE does not multiplex HARQ-
ACK and/or CSI information in the PUSCH transmission in a slot from the
multiple slots if the UE would not transmit a single-slot PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
and/or CSI information in the slot in case the PUSCH transmission was absent.
If the PUSCH transmission over the multiple slots is scheduled by a DCI format
0_1, the same value of a DAI field is applicable for multiplexing HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH transmission in any slot from the multiple slots
where the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information.
A HARQ-ACK information bit value of 0 represents a negative acknowledgement
(NACK) while a HARQ-ACK information bit value of 1 represents a positive
acknowledgement (ACK).
## 9.1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
If a UE receives a PDSCH without receiving a corresponding PDCCH, or if the UE
receives a PDCCH indicating a SPS PDSCH release, the UE generates one
corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit.
If a UE is not provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ , the UE generates
one HARQ-ACK information bit per transport block.
For a HARQ-ACK information bit, a UE generates an ACK if the UE detects a DCI
format 1_0 that provides a SPS PDSCH release or correctly decodes a transport
block, and generates a NACK if the UE does not correctly decode the transport
block.
A UE does not expect to be indicated to transmit HARQ-ACK information for more
than one SPS PDSCH receptions in a same PUCCH.
In the following, the CRC for DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1 is scrambled
with a C-RNTI, an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI.
### 9.1.1 CBG-based HARQ-ACK codebook determination
If a UE is provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ for a serving cell, the
UE receives a PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1_1, that includes code block
groups (CBGs) of a transport block. The UE is also provided
_maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock_ indicating a maximum number
{width="0.6375in" height="0.25277777777777777in"} of CBGs for generating
respective HARQ-ACK information bits for a transport block reception for the
serving cell.
For a number of code blocks (CBs) in a transport block, the UE determines a
number of CBGs according to Clause 5.1.7.1 of [6, TS 38.214] and determines a
number of HARQ-ACK bits for the transport block as .
The UE generates an ACK for the HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE
correctly received all code blocks of the CBG and generates a NACK for the
HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE incorrectly received at least one
code block of the CBG. If the UE receives two transport blocks, the UE
concatenates the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of the second transport
block after the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of the first transport
block.
The HARQ-ACK codebook includes the HARQ-ACK information bits and, if for a
transport block, the UE generates a NACK value for the last HARQ-ACK
information bits for the transport block in the HARQ-ACK codebook.
If the UE generates a HARQ-ACK codebook in response to a retransmission of a
transport block, corresponding to a same HARQ process as a previous
transmission of the transport block, the UE generates an ACK for each CBG that
the UE correctly decoded in a previous transmission of the transport block.
If a UE correctly detects each of the CBGs and does not correctly detect the
transport block for the CBGs, the UE generates a NACK value for each of the
CBGs.
### 9.1.2 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
This clause applies if the UE is configured with _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook =
semi-static_.
A UE reports HARQ-ACK information for a corresponding PDSCH reception or SPS
PDSCH release only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits in a slot
indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a
corresponding DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1. The UE reports NACK value(s)
for HARQ-ACK information bit(s) in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits
in a slot not indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing
indicator field in a corresponding DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1.
If the UE is provided _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ , is a value of _pdsch-
AggregationFactor_ ; otherwise, . The UE reports HARQ-ACK information for a
PDSCH reception from slot to slot only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE
includes in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission in slot , where is a number of slots
indicated by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a
corresponding DCI format or provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ if the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field is not present in the DCI format. If the
UE reports HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH reception in a slot other than
slot , the UE sets a value for each corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit to
NACK.
If a UE reports HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH only for
\- a SPS PDSCH release indicated by DCI format 1_0 with counter DAI field
value of 1 on the PCell, or
\- a PDSCH reception scheduled by DCI format 1_0 with counter DAI field value
of 1 on the PCell, or
\- SPS PDSCH reception
within the occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions as determined in Clause
9.1.2.1, the UE determines a HARQ-ACK codebook only for the SPS PDSCH release
or only for the PDSCH reception or only for the SPS PDSCH reception according
to corresponding occasion(s) on respective serving cell(s), where the value of
counter DAI in DCI format 1_0 is according to Table 9.1.3-1; otherwise, the
procedures in Clause 9.1.2.1 and Clause 9.1.2.2 for a HARQ-ACK codebook
determination apply.
#### 9.1.2.1 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel
For a serving cell , an active DL BWP, and an active UL BWP, as described in
Clause 12, the UE determines a set of occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions
for which the UE can transmit corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in
slot . If serving cell is deactivated, the UE uses as the active DL BWP for
determining the set of occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions a DL BWP
provided by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_. The determination is based:
a) on a set of slot timing values associated with the active UL BWP
a) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_0 and is not
configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_1 on serving cell , is provided
by the slot timing values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} for DCI format 1_0
b) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_1 for serving
cell , is provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ for DCI format 1_1
b) on a set of row indexes of a table that is provided either by a first set
of row indexes of a table that is provided by _pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList_
in _pdsch-ConfigCommon_ or by Default PDSCH time domain resource allocation A
[6, TS 38.214], or by the union of the first set of row indexes and a second
set of row indexes, if provided by _pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList_ in _pdsch-
Config_ , associated with the active DL BWP and defining respective sets of
slot offsets , start and length indicators _SLIV_ , and PDSCH mapping types
for PDSCH reception as described in [6, TS 38.214]
c) on the ratio between the downlink SCS configuration and the uplink SCS
configuration provided by _subcarrierSpacing_ in _BWP-Downlink_ and _BWP-
Uplink_ for the active DL BWP and the active UL BWP, respectively
d) if provided, on _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ as described in Clause 11.1.
For the set of slot timing values , the UE determines a set of occasions for
candidate PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH releases according to the following
pseudo-code. A location in the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook for HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH release is same as for a

the UE has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH
with DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1 for scheduling PDSCH receptions or SPS
PDSCH release on any serving cell and the UE does not have HARQ-ACK
information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception to multiplex in the PUSCH, as
described in Clause 9.1.3.1, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in
the PUSCH transmission.
If a UE is provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ and the UE is scheduled
for a PUSCH transmission by DCI format 0_1 with first DAI field value or with
second DAI field value and the UE has not received any PDCCH within the
monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format 1_0 or with DCI format 1_1,

serving cell and the UE does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to a
SPS PDSCH reception to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in Clause 9.1.3.1,

## 9.2 UCI reporting in physical uplink control channel
UCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, and CSI. UCI
bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information bits, if any,
and CSI bits, if any. The HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK
codebook as described in Clause 9.1.
A UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different symbols
within a slot of symbols as defined in [4, TS 38.211]. When the UE transmits
two PUCCHs in a slot, at least one of the two PUCCHs uses PUCCH format 0 or
PUCCH format 2.
In Clauses 9.2.3, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, a UE assumes 11 CRC bits if a number of
respective UCI bits is larger than or equal to 360; otherwise, the UE
determines a number of CRC bits based on the number of respective UCI bits as
described in [5, TS 38.212].
### 9.2.1 PUCCH Resource Sets
If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided by
_PUCCH-ResourceSet_ in _PUCCH-Config_ , a PUCCH resource set is provided by
_pucch-ResourceCommon_ through an index to a row of Table 9.2.1-1 for
transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial UL BWP of PRBs.
The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to a
PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset , and a cyclic shift
index set for a PUCCH transmission. The UE transmits a PUCCH using frequency
hopping. An orthogonal cover code with index 0 is used for a PUCCH resource
with PUCCH format 1 in Table 9.2.1-1. The UE transmits the PUCCH using the
same spatial domain transmission filter as for a PUSCH transmission scheduled
by a RAR UL grant as described in Clause 8.3.
If a UE is not provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook_ , the UE generates at most
one HARQ-ACK information bit.
If the UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to
detecting a DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1, the UE determines a PUCCH
resource with index , , as , where is a number of CCEs in a CORESET of a PDCCH
reception with DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1, as described in Clause 10.1,
is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and is a value of the
PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1.
If
\- the UE determines the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the first hop
as and the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the second hop as , where is
the total number of initial cyclic shift indexes in the set of initial cyclic
shift indexes
\- the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial
cyclic shift indexes as
If
\- the UE determines the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the first hop
as and the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the second hop as
\- the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial
cyclic shift indexes as

If a UE has dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE is provided by
higher layers with one or more PUCCH resources.
A PUCCH resource includes the following parameters:
\- a PUCCH resource index provided by _pucch-ResourceId_

format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3,
respectively, where the PUCCH resource also includes a number of PRBs provided
by _nrofPRBs_ , a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by
_nrofSymbols_ , and a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by
_startingSymbolIndex_.
If the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format4_ , the PUCCH format configured for a
PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 4, where the PUCCH resource also includes a
number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by _nrofSymbols_ , a
length for an orthogonal cover code by _occ-Length_ , an index for an
orthogonal cover code by _occ-Index_ , and a first symbol for the PUCCH
transmission provided by _startingSymbolIndex_.
A UE can be configured up to four sets of PUCCH resources. A PUCCH resource
set is provided by _PUCCH-ResourceSet_ and is associated with a PUCCH resource
set index provided by _pucch-ResourceSetId_ , with a set of PUCCH resource
indexes provided by _resourceList_ that provides a set of _pucch-ResourceId_
used in the PUCCH resource set, and with a maximum number of UCI information
bits the UE can transmit using a PUCCH resource in the PUCCH resource set
provided by _maxPayloadSize_. For the first PUCCH resource set, the maximum
number of UCI information bits is 2\. A maximum number of PUCCH resource
indexes for a set of PUCCH resources is provided by _maxNrofPUCCH-
ResourcesPerSet_. The maximum number of PUCCH resources in the first PUCCH
resource set is 32 and the maximum number of PUCCH resources in the other
PUCCH resource sets is 8.
If the UE transmits UCI information bits, that include HARQ-ACK information
bits, the UE determines a PUCCH resource set to be
\- a first set of PUCCH resources with _pucch-ResourceSetId_ = 0 if including
1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR on one SR
transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs
simultaneously, or

is equal to 1706, or
\- a fourth set of PUCCH resources with _pucch-ResourceSetId_ = 3, if provided
by higher layers, if .
### 9.2.2 PUCCH Formats for UCI transmission
If a UE is not transmitting PUSCH, and the UE is transmitting UCI, the UE
transmits UCI in a PUCCH using
\- PUCCH format 0 if
\- the transmission is over 1 symbol or 2 symbols,
\- the number of HARQ-ACK information bits with positive or negative SR (HARQ-
ACK/SR bits) is 1 or 2
\- PUCCH format 1 if
\- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,
\- the number of HARQ-ACK/SR bits is 1 or 2

\- PUCCH format 4 if
\- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,
\- the number of UCI bits is more than 2,
\- the PUCCH resource includes an orthogonal cover code
A spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission is provided by _PUCCH-
SpatialRelationInfo_ if the UE is configured with a single value for _pucch-
SpatialRelationInfoId_ ; otherwise, if the UE is provided multiple values for
_PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ , the UE determines a spatial setting for the
PUCCH transmission as described in [11, TS 38.321]. **The UE applies
corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] and a corresponding setting for a
spatial domain filter to transmit PUCCH** in the first slot that is after slot
where is the slot **where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information with ACK value corresponding to a PDSCH reception providing the
_PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_** and is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH
\- If _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ provides _ssb-Index_ , the UE transmits the
PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a SS/PBCH block
with index provided by _ssb-Index_ for a same serving cell or, if
_servingCellId_ is provided, for a serving cell indicated by _servingCellId_
\- else if _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ provides _csi-RS-Index_ , the UE
transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a
CSI-RS with resource index provided by _csi-RS-Index_ for a same serving cell
or, if _servingCellId_ is provided, for a serving cell indicated by
_servingCellId_
\- else _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ provides _srs_ , the UE transmits the
PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a transmission of a SRS with
resource index provided by _resource_ for a same serving cell _and/or active
UL BWP_ or, if _servingCellId_ and/or _uplinkBWP_ are provided, for a serving
cell indicated by _servingCellId and/or for an UL BWP indicated by uplinkBWP_
A number of DMRS symbols for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3 or 4 is
provided by _additionalDMRS_.
Use of π/2-BPSK, instead of QPSK, for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format
3 or 4 is indicated by _pi2BPSK_.
### 9.2.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK
A UE does not expect to transmit more than one PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information
in a slot.
For DCI format 1_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values
map to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. For DCI format 1_1, if present, the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values map to values for a set of number
of slots provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ as defined in Table 9.2.3-1.
For a SPS PDSCH reception ending in slot , the UE transmits the PUCCH in slot
where is provided by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in DCI
format 1_0 or, if present, in DCI format 1_1 activating the SPS PDSCH
reception.
If the UE detects a DCI format 1_1 that does not include a PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field and schedules a PDSCH reception or
activates a SPS PDSCH reception ending in slot , the UE provides corresponding
HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within slot where is provided by
_dl-DataToUL-ACK_.
With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, if the UE detects a DCI
format 1_0 or a DCI format 1_1 scheduling a PDSCH reception ending in slot or
if the UE detects a DCI format 1_0 indicating a SPS PDSCH release through a
PDCCH reception ending in slot , the UE provides corresponding HARQ-ACK
information in a PUCCH transmission within slot , where is a number of slots
and is indicated by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the
DCI format, if present, or provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_. corresponds to the
last slot of the PUCCH transmission that overlaps with the PDSCH reception or
with the PDCCH reception in case of SPS PDSCH release.
A PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information is subject to the limitations
for UE transmissions described in Clause 11.1 and Clause 11.1.1.

* * *
For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH
resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources for HARQ-ACK information
bits, as described in Clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based
on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212] in a last DCI format 1_0 or
DCI format 1_1, among the DCI formats 1_0 or DCI formats 1_1 that have a value
of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field indicating a same slot for
the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource
determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an ascending order
across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then
indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes.
The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH
resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2, provided by _resourceList_ for
PUCCH resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by _PUCCH-ResourceSet_
with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources.
For the first set of PUCCH resources and when the size of _resourceList_ is
larger than eight, when a UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH
transmission in response to detecting a last DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1
in a PDCCH reception, among DCI formats 1_0 or DCI formats 1_1 with a value of
the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field indicating a same slot for
the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index , , as
where is a number of CCEs in CORESET of the PDCCH reception for the DCI format
1_0 or DCI format 1_1 as described in Clause 10.1, is the index of a first CCE
for the PDCCH reception, and is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field
in the DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1.

* * *
If a UE detects a first DCI format 1_0 or DCI format 1_1 indicating a first
resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a
slot and also detects at a later time a second DCI format 1_0 or DCI format
1_1 indicating a second resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding
HARQ-ACK information in the slot, the UE does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to the second DCI format in a PUCCH resource in the
slot if the PDCCH reception that includes the second DCI format is not earlier
than from the beginning of a first symbol of the first resource for PUCCH
transmission in the slot where, $\kappa$ and $T_{c}$ are defined in clause 4.1
of [4, TS 38.211] and corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the
SCS configurations of the PDCCHs providing the DCI formats and the SCS
configuration of the PUCCH. If _processingType2Enabled_ of _PDSCH-
ServingCellConfig_ is set to _enable_ for the serving cell with the second DCI
format and for all serving cells with corresponding HARQ-ACK information
multiplexed in the PUCCH transmission in the slot, for , for , for ; otherwise
, for , for , for , for .
If a UE transmits HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a PDSCH reception
without a corresponding PDCCH, a PUCCH resource for corresponding PUCCH
transmission with HARQ-ACK information is provided by _n1PUCCH-AN_.
If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 0, the
UE determines values and for computing a value of cyclic shift [4, TS 38.211]
where is provided by _initialCyclicShift_ of _PUCCH-format0_ or, if
_initialCyclicShift_ is not provided, by the initial cyclic shift index as
described in Clause 9.2.1 and is determined from the value of one HARQ-ACK
information bit or from the values of two HARQ-ACK information bits as in
Table 9.2.3-3 and Table 9.2.3-4, respectively.

If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 1, the
UE is provided a value for by _initialCyclicShift_ of _PUCCH-format1_ or, if
_initialCyclicShift_ is not provided, by the initial cyclic shift index as
described in Clause 9.2.1.
If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits and bits using PUCCH
format 2 or PUCCH format 3 in a PUCCH resource that includes PRBs, the UE
determines a number of PRBs for the PUCCH transmission to be the minimum
number of PRBs, that is smaller than or equal to a number of PRBs provided
respectively by _nrofPRBs_ of _PUCCH-format2_ or _nrofPRBs_ of _PUCCH-format3_
and start from the first PRB from the number of PRBs, that results to and, if
, , where , , , and are defined in Clause 9.2.5.2. For PUCCH format 3, if is
not equal according to [4, TS 38.211], is increased to the nearest allowed
value of _nrofPRBs_ for _PUCCH-format3_ [12, TS 38.331]. If , the UE transmits
the PUCCH over PRBs.
### 9.2.4 UE procedure for reporting SR
A UE is configured by higher layer paremater _SchedulingRequestResourceConfig_
a set of configurations for SR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH
format 0 or PUCCH format 1.
The UE is configured a PUCCH resource by _SchedulingRequestResourceId_
providing a PUCCH format 0 resource or a PUCCH format 1 resource as described
in Clause 9.2.1. The UE is also configured a periodicity in symbols or slots
and an offset in slots by _periodicityAndOffset_ for a PUCCH transmission
conveying SR. If is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission
occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number [4, TS 38.211] in a frame with
number if .
If is one slot, the UE expects that and every slot is a SR transmission
occasion in a PUCCH.
If is smaller than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a
PUCCH to start in a symbol with index [4, TS 38.211] if where is the value of
_startingSymbolIndex_.
If the UE determines that, for a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH, the
number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission in a slot is smaller
than the value provided by _nrofSymbols_ , the UE does not transmit the PUCCH
in the slot.
SR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE
transmissions described in Clause 11.1 and Clause 11.1.1.
The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR
configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR
transmission using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in
[4, TS 38.211] by obtaining as described for HARQ-ACK information in Clause
9.2.3 and by setting . For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1,
the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting .
### 9.2.5 UE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types
This Clause is applicable to the case that a UE has overlapping resources for
PUCCH transmissions or for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions and each PUCCH
transmission is over a single slot without repetition. Any case that a PUCCH
transmission is with repetitions over multiple slots is described in Clause
9.2.6. If a UE is configured with multiple PUCCH resources in a slot to
transmit CSI reports
\- if the UE is not provided _multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ or if PUCCH
resources for transmissions of CSI reports do not overlap in the slot, the UE
determines a first resource corresponding to a CSI report with the highest
priority [6, TS 38.214]
\- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 2, and if there are remaining
resources in the slot that do not overlap with the first resource, the UE
determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with
corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding
second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting
\- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4, and if
there are remaining resources in the slot that include PUCCH format 2 and do
not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the
highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the
remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional
resource for CSI reporting
\- if the UE is provided _multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ and if any of the
multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a
resource from the resources provided by _multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ , as
described in Clause 9.2.5.2.
A UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI resport(s)
in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided _simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI_ ; otherwise,
the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only HARQ-ACK information, with or
without SR, in the PUCCH. If the UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot
that include HARQ-ACK information and CSI report(s), the UE expects to be
provided a same configuration for _simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI_ each of PUCCH
formats 2, 3, and 4.
If a UE would multiplex CSI reports that include Part 2 CSI reports in a PUCCH
resource, the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the
PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each of the CSI
reports indicates rank 1.
If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping
PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot and, when applicable as described in Clauses
9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, the UE is configured to multiplex different UCI types in
one PUCCH, and at least one of the multiple overlapping PUCCHs or PUSCHs is in
response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE multiplexes all
corresponding UCI types if the following conditions are met. If one of the
PUCCH transmissions or PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format
detection by the UE, the UE expects that the first symbol of the earliest
PUCCH or PUSCH, among a group overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in the slot,
satisfies the following timeline conditions
\- is not before a symbol with CP starting after $T_{proc,1}^{\text{mux}}$
after a last symbol of any corresponding PDSCH, $T_{proc,1}^{\text{mux}}$ is
given by maximum of $\left{
T_{proc,1}^{mux,1},\cdots,T_{proc,1}^{mux,i},\cdots \right}$ where for the
i-th PDSCH with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a PUCCH which is in the
group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, $T_{proc,1}^{mux,i} = \left( N_{1} +
d_{1,1} + 1 \right) \cdot \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-
\mu} \cdot T_{C}$, $d_{1,1}$ is selected for the i-th PDSCH following [6, TS
38.214], $N_{1}$ is selected based on the UE PDSCH processing capability of
the i-th PDSCH and SCS configuration $\mu$, where $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH
scheduling the i-th PDSCH, the i-th PDSCH, the PUCCH with corresponding HARQ-
ACK transmission for the i-th PDSCH, and all PUSCHs in the group of
overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.

If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping
PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot, one of the PUCCHs includes HARQ-ACK
information in response to an SPS PDSCH reception, and any PUSCH is not in
response to a DCI format detection, the UE expects that the first symbol of
the earliest PUCCH or PUSCH satisfies the first of the previous timeline
conditions with the exception that components associated to a SCS
configuration for a PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH or a PUSCH are absent from the
timeline conditions.

detection to overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH that does not satisfy the
above timing conditions.

information, SR, and CSI reports and any PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in
the slot satisfies the above timing conditions and does not overlap with any
other PUCCH or PUSCH in the slot that does not satisfy the above timing
conditions, the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information, SR, and CSI reports and
determines corresponding PUCCH(s) for transmission in the slot according to
the following pseudo-code. If the multiple PUCCHs do not include HARQ-ACK
information and do not overlap with any PUSCH transmission by the UE in
response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the timing conditions do not
apply.
If

to SPS PDSCH reception and/or a resource for a PUCCH associated with a SR
occasion overlap in time with two resources for respective PUCCH transmissions

response to a DCI format detection that overlaps in time with any of the
previous resources, and

Clause 9.3, and does not transmit SR. In case the PUCCH resource overlaps in
time with multiple PUSCH transmissions, the PUSCH for multiplexing HARQ-ACK
information and/or CSI is selected as described in Clause 9. If the PUSCH
transmission by the UE is not in response to a DCI format detection and the UE
multiplexes only CSI reports, the timing conditions are not applicable

\- resources for transmissions of UCI types, prior to multiplexing or
dropping, overlap in a slot
\- multiplexing conditions of corresponding UCI types in a single PUCCH are
satisfied, and
\- the UE does not transmit any PUSCH time-overlapping with PUCCH in the slot.
#### 9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH
In the following, a UE is configured to transmit PUCCHs for respective SRs in
a slot, as determined by a set of _schedulingRequestResourceId_ , with SR
transmission occasions that would overlap with a transmission of a PUCCH with
HARQ-ACK information from the UE in the slot or with a transmission of a PUCCH
with CSI report(s) from the UE in the slot.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the
PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK information
as described in Clause 9.2.3. The UE determines a value of and for computing a
value of cyclic shift [4, TS 38.211] where is provided by _initialcyclicshift_
of _PUCCH-format0_ , and is determined from the value of one HARQ-ACK
information bit or from the values of two HARQ-ACK information bits as in
Table 9.2.5-1 and Table 9.2.5-2, respectively.
If the UE would transmit negative SR and a PUCCH with at most two HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the
PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 for HARQ-ACK information as
described in Clause 9.2.3.

SR to sequences for PUCCH format 0

HARQ-ACK Value 0 1 **Sequence cyclic shift**
* * *

positive SR to sequences for PUCCH format 0
* * *
HARQ-ACK Value {0, 0} {0, 1} {1, 1} {1, 0} **Sequence cyclic shift**
* * *
If a UE would transmit positive or negative SR in a resource using PUCCH
format 0 and HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 1 in a
slot, the UE transmits only a PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information bits in the
resource using PUCCH format 1.
If the UE would transmit positive SR in a first resource using PUCCH format 1
and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a second resource using PUCCH
format 1 in a slot, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits in
the first resource using PUCCH format 1 as described in Clause 9.2.3. If a UE
would transmit negative SR in a resource using PUCCH format 1 and at most two
HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 1 in a slot, the UE
transmits a PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 1 for HARQ-ACK
information as described in Clause 9.2.3.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource
using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 in a slot, as
described in Clause 9.2.3, bits representing a negative or positive SR, in
ascending order of the values of _schedulingRequestResourceId_ , are appended
to the HARQ-ACK information bits and the UE transmits the combined UCI bits in
a PUCCH using a resource with PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format
4 that the UE determines as described in Clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.3. An all-zero
value for the bits represents a negative SR value across all SRs.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with CSI report bits in a resource using PUCCH
format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 in a slot, bits representing
corresponding negative or positive SR, in ascending order of the values of
_schedulingRequestResourceId_ , are prepended to the CSI information bits as
described in Clause 9.2.5.2 and the UE transmits a PUCCH with the combined UCI
bits in a resource using the PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format
4 for CSI reporting. An all-zero value for the bits represents a negative SR
value across all SRs.
If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits, SR bits, and CRC
bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 in a PUCCH resource that includes
PRBs, the UE determines a number of PRBs for the PUCCH transmission to be the
minimum number of PRBs, that is smaller than or equal to a number of PRBs
provided respectively by _nrofPRBs_ in _PUCCH-format2_ or _nrofPRBs_ in
_PUCCH-format3_ and starts from the first PRB from the number of PRBs, that
results to and, if , , where , , , and are defined in Clause 9.2.5.2. For
PUCCH format 3, if is not equal according to [4, TS 38.211], is increased to
the nearest allowed value of _nrofPRBs_ for _PUCCH-format3_ [12, TS 38.331].
If , the UE transmits the PUCCH over the PRBs.
#### 9.2.5.2 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK/SR/CSI in a PUCCH
For a transmission occasion of a single CSI report, a PUCCH resource is
provided by _pucch-CSI-ResourceList_. For a transmission occasion of multiple
CSI reports, corresponding PUCCH resources can be provided by _multi-CSI-
PUCCH-ResourceList_.
If a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of HARQ-ACK
information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI format or in
response to a SPS PDSCH release, the UE does not expect to be provided
_simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI_.
A UE is configured by _maxCodeRate_ a code rate for multiplexing HARQ-ACK, SR,
and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 2, PUCCH format
3, or PUCCH format 4.
If a UE transmits CSI reports using PUCCH format 2, the UE transmits only
wideband CSI for each CSI report [6, TS 38.214]. In the following, a Part 1
CSI report refers either to a CSI report with only wideband CSI or to a Part 1
CSI report with wideband CSI and sub-band CSI.

product of a number of corresponding REs, modulation order , and configured
code rate ;

### 9.2.6 PUCCH repetition procedure
For PUCCH formats 1, 3, or 4, a UE can be configured a number of slots, , for
repetitions of a PUCCH transmission by respective _nrofSlots_.
For ,
\- the UE repeats the PUCCH transmission with the UCI over slots
\- a PUCCH transmission in each of the slots has a same number of consecutive
symbols, as provided by _nrofSymbols_ in _PUCCH-format1_ , _nrofSymbols_ in
_PUCCH-format3_ , or _nrofSymbols_ in _PUCCH-format4_
\- a PUCCH transmission in each of the slots has a same first symbol, as
provided by _startingSymbolIndex_ in _PUCCH-format1_ , _startingSymbolIndex_
in _PUCCH-format3_ , or _startingSymbolIndex_ in _PUCCH-format4_
\- the UE is configured by _interslotFrequencyHopping_ whether or not to
perform frequency hopping for PUCCH transmissions in different slots
\- if the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for PUCCH
transmissions across different slots
\- the UE performs frequency hopping per slot
\- the UE transmits the PUCCH starting from a first PRB, provided by
_startingPRB_ , in slots with even number and starting from the second PRB,
provided by _secondHopPRB_ , in slots with odd number. The slot indicated to
the UE for the first PUCCH transmission has number 0 and each subsequent slot
until the UE transmits the PUCCH in slots is counted regardless of whether or
not the UE transmits the PUCCH in the slot
\- the UE does not expect to be configured to perform frequency hopping for a
PUCCH transmission within a slot
\- If the UE is not configured to perform frequency hopping for PUCCH
transmissions across different slots and if the UE is configured to perform
frequency hopping for PUCCH transmissions within a slot, the frequency hopping
pattern between the first PRB and the second PRB is same within each slot
If the UE determines that, for a PUCCH transmission in a slot, the number of
symbols available for the PUCCH transmission is smaller than the value
provided by _nrofSymbols_ for the corresponding PUCCH format, the UE does not
transmit the PUCCH in the slot.
A SS/PBCH block symbol is a symbol indicated to a UE by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_
in _SIB1_ or _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_.
For unpaired spectrum, the UE determines the slots for a PUCCH transmission
starting from a slot indicated to the UE as described in Clause 9.2.3 and
having
\- an UL symbol, as described in Clause 11.1, or flexible symbol that is not
SS/PBCH block symbol provided by _startingSymbolIndex_ in _PUCCH-format1_ , or
in _PUCCH-format3_ , or in _PUCCH-format4_ as a first symbol, and
\- consecutive UL symbols, as described in Clause 11.1, or flexible symbols
that are not SS/PBCH block symbols, starting from the first symbol, equal to
or larger than a number of symbols provided by _nrofsymbols_ in _PUCCH-
format1_ , or in _PUCCH-format3_ , or in _PUCCH-format4_
For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band, the UE determines the slots
for a PUCCH transmission as the consecutive slots starting from a slot
indicated to the UE as described in Clause 9.2.3.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number of slots and the UE would
transmit a PUSCH over a second number of slots, and the PUCCH transmission
would overlap with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots, and the
conditions in Clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the UCI in the PUSCH are satisfied
in the overlapping slots, the UE transmits the PUCCH and does not transmit the
PUSCH in the overlapping slots.
A UE does not multiplex different UCI types in a PUCCH transmission with
repetitions over slots. If a UE would transmit a first PUCCH over more than
one slot and at least a second PUCCH over one or more slots, and the
transmissions of the first PUCCH and the second PUCCH would overlap in a
number of slots then, for each slot of the number of slots and with UCI type
priority of HARQ-ACK > SR > CSI with higher priority > CSI with lower priority
\- the UE does not expect the first PUCCH and any of the second PUCCHs to
start at a same slot and include a UCI type with same priority
\- if the first PUCCH and any of the second PUCCHs include a UCI type with
same priority, the UE transmits the PUCCH starting at an earlier slot and does
not transmit the PUCCH starting at a later slot
\- if the first PUCCH and any of the second PUCCHs do not include a UCI type
with same priority, the UE transmits the PUCCH that includes the UCI type with
higher priority and does not transmit the PUCCH that include the UCI type with
lower priority
A UE does not expect a PUCCH that is in response to a DCI format detection to
overlap with any other PUCCH that does not satisfy the corresponding timing
conditions in Clause 9.2.5.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over slots and the UE does not transmit the
PUCCH in a slot from the slots due to overlapping with another PUCCH
transmission in the slot, the UE counts the slot in the number of slots.
## 9.3 UCI reporting in physical uplink shared channel
Offset values are defined for a UE to determine a number of resources for
multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and for multiplexing CSI reports in a PUSCH.
The offset values are signalled to a UE either by a DCI format scheduling the
PUSCH transmission or by higher layers.
If DCI format 0_0, or DCI format 0_1 that does not include a beta_offset
indicator field, schedules the PUSCH transmission from the UE and the UE is
provided _betaOffsets = \'semiStatic\'_ , the UE applies the , , and values
that are provided by _betaOffsets = \'semiStatic\'_ for the corresponding
HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports.
If the PUSCH transmission is with a configured grant and the UE is provided
_CG-UCI-OnPUSCH= \'semiStatic\'_ , the UE applies the , , and values that are
provided by _CG-UCI-OnPUSCH = \'semiStatic\'_ for the corresponding HARQ-ACK
information, Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports.
If the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0_0 and the UE is provided
_betaOffsets = \'dynamic\'_ , the UE applies the , , and values that are
determined from the first value of _betaOffsets = \'dynamic\'_.
If the PUSCH is a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH activated by DCI format 0_0
and the UE is provided _CG-UCI-OnPUSCH_ =_\'dynamic\'_ , the UE applies the ,
, and values that are determined from the first value of _CG-UCI-OnPUSCH =
\'dynamic\'_.
HARQ-ACK information offsets are configured to values according to Table
9.3-1. The _betaOffsetACK-Index1_ , _betaOffsetACK-Index2_ , and
_betaOffsetACK-Index3_ respectively provide indexes , , and for the UE to use
if the UE multiplexes up to 2 HARQ-ACK information bits, more than 2 and up to
11 HARQ-ACK information bits, and more than 11 bits in the PUSCH,
respectively.
Part 1 CSI report and Part 2 CSI report offsets and , respectively, are
configured to values according to Table 9.3-2. The _betaOffsetCSI-
Part1-Index1_ and _betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index1_ respectively provide indexes
and for the UE to use if the UE multiplexes up to 11 bits for Part 1 CSI
reports or Part 2 CSI reports in the PUSCH. The _betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index2_
and _betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index2_ respectively provide indexes or for the UE to
use if the UE multiplexes more than 11 bits for Part 1 CSI reports or Part 2
CSI reports in the PUSCH.
If a DCI format 0_1 schedules the PUSCH transmission from the UE and if DCI
format 0_1 includes a beta_offset indicator field, as configured by _uci-
OnPUSCH_ , the UE is provided by each of {_betaOffsetACK-Index1_ ,
_betaOffsetACK-Index2_ , _betaOffsetACK-Index3_} a set of four indexes, by
each of {_betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index1_ , _betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index2_} a set of
four indexes and by each of {_betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index1_ , _betaOffsetCSI-
Part2-Index2_} a set of four indexes from Table 9.3-1 and 9.3-2, respectively,
for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports, and Part 2 CSI
reports, respectively, in the PUSCH transmission. The beta_offset indicator
field indicates a value, a value and a value from the respective sets of
values, with the mapping defined in Table 9.3-3.

# 10 UE procedure for receiving control information
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG except for PDCCH monitoring in
Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS sets where the UE is not required to apply the procedures
in this clause for the SCG
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in one or more CORESETs on the active
DL BWP on each activated serving cell configured with PDCCH monitoring
according to corresponding search space sets where monitoring implies decoding
each PDCCH candidate according to the monitored DCI formats.
For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate in a slot
\- If the UE has received _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ and has not
received _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ for a serving
cell and if the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a Type0-PDCCH CSS set
and at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE
corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in
_SIB1_ , the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
\- If a UE has received _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_
for a serving cell and if the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a
Type0-PDCCH CSS set and at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at
least one RE corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by _ssb-
PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ , the UE is not required to
monitor the PDCCH candidate.
\- If the UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the
serving cell according to the procedure described in Clause 13, the UE may
assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the
PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.
\- If _at least one RE of a PDCCH candidate on the serving cell overlaps with
at least one RE of lte-CRS-ToMatchAround_ , _the UE is not required to monitor
the PDCCH candidate_.
If a UE indicates in _UE-NR-Capability_ a carrier aggregation capability
larger than 4 serving cells, the UE includes in _UE-NR-Capability_ an
indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates the UE can monitor per
slot when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more
than 4 cells. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation, the UE
determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates per
slot that corresponds to downlink cells, where
\- is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide
_pdcch-BlindDetectionCA_
\- otherwise, is the value of _pdcch-BlindDetectionCA_
When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to
monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates per slot that corresponds to
downlink cells for the MCG where is provided by _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the
MCG and determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH
candidates per slot that corresponds to downlink cells for the SCG where is
provided by _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the SCG. When the UE is configured for
carrier aggregation operation over more than 4 cells, or for a cell group when
the UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to monitor
per slot a number of PDCCH candidates that is larger than the maximum number
as derived from the corresponding value of .
When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of downlink cells on
both the MCG and the SCG, the UE expects to be provided _pdcch-BlindDetection_
for the MCG and _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the SCG with values that satisfy
\- _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the MCG + _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the SCG \= pdcch-
BlindDetectionCA._
_Otherwise,_ if is a maximum total number of downlink cells that the UE can be
configured on both the MCG and the SCG for NR-DC as indicated in _UE-NR-
Capability_ ,
\- the value range of _pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE_ or of _pdcch-
BlindDetectionSCG-UE_ is [1, 2, 3], and
_\- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE_ \+ _pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE >=_ .
## 10.1 UE procedure for determining physical downlink control channel
assignment
A set of PDCCH candidates for a UE to monitor is defined in terms of PDCCH
search space sets. A search space set can be a CSS set or a USS set. A UE
monitors PDCCH candidates in one or more of the following search spaces sets
\- a Type0-PDCCH CSS set configured by _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in _MIB_ or by
_searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ or by _searchSpaceZero_ _in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on the primary
cell of the MCG
\- a Type0A-PDCCH CSS set configured by _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_
_in PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on
the primary cell of the MCG
\- a Type1-PDCCH CSS set configured by _ra-SearchSpace_ _in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a RA-RNTI or a TC-RNTI on
the primary cell
\- a Type2-PDCCH CSS set configured by _pagingSearchSpace_ _in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a P-RNTI on the primary
cell of the MCG
\- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by _SearchSpace_ in _PDCCH-Config_ with
_searchSpaceType_ = _common_ for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by INT-RNTI,
SFI-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, or TPC-SRS-RNTI and, only for the
primary cell, C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI(s), and
\- a USS set configured by _SearchSpace_ in _PDCCH-Config_ with
_searchSpaceType_ = _ue-Specific_ for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by
C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, or CS-RNTI(s).
For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided _searchSpaceSIB1_ for Type0-PDCCH CSS
set by _PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ , the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a
Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the
CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation
level given in Table 10.1-1. If the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP have
same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the
CORESET with index 0, or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, the CORESET
configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set has search space set index 0.
For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ for
Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set
on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates
per CCE aggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.
For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided _ra-SearchSpace_ for Type1-PDCCH CSS
set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP _._
If the UE has not been provided a Type3-PDCCH CSS set or a USS set and the UE
has received a C-RNTI and has been provided a Type1-PDCCH CSS set, the UE
monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0_0 and DCI format 1_0 with CRC
scrambled by the C-RNTI in the Type1-PDCCH CSS set.
If a UE is not provided _pagingSearchSpace_ for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE
does not monitor PDCCH for Type2-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE
aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation
level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.
If a UE is provided a zero value for _searchSpaceID in PDCCH-ConfigCommon_
_for_ a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for
PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set as described in Clause 13,
and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates only at
monitoring occasions associated with a SS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block
is determined by the most recent of
\- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that
includes a CORESET with index 0, as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the
TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block,
or
\- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that
triggers a contention-free random access procedure
If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a
C-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for _searchSpaceID in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ _for_ a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring
occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set based on the
search space set associated with the value of _searchSpaceID_.
The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions
in the CORESET configured by _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in _MIB, the DM-RS antenna
port associated with_ corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding
SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, QCL-TypeA,
and QCL-TypeD properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not
provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS
antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS
scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. A SCS is provided by
_subCarrierSpacingCommon_ in _MIB_.
For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same
frequency band, a UE does not expect to monitor a PDCCH in a
Type0/0A/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in a USS set if a DM-RS for monitoring a PDCCH
in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set does not have same QCL-TypeD properties [6, TS
38.214] with a DM-RS for monitoring the PDCCH in the Type0/0A/2/3-PDCCH CSS
set or in the USS set, and if the PDCCH or an associated PDSCH overlaps in at
least one symbol with a PDCCH the UE monitors in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set or with
an associated PDSCH.
If a UE is provided
\- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of
_searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ ,
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _ra-SearchSpace_ , and
\- a C-RNTI, an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI,
the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0_0 and DCI format 1_0 with
CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI, the MCS-C-RNTI, or the CS-RNTI in the one or more
search space sets in a slot where the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for at
least a DCI format 0_0 or a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, RA-
RNTI or P-RNTI.
If a UE is provided
\- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of
_searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ ,
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _ra-SearchSpace_ , or a CSS set by _PDCCH-Config_ , and
\- a SI-RNTI, a P-RNTI, a RA-RNTI, a SFI-RNTI, an INT-RNTI, a TPC-PUSCH-RNTI,
a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, or a TPC-SRS-RNTI
then, for a RNTI from any of these RNTIs, the UE does not expect to process
information from more than one DCI format with CRC scrambled with the RNTI per
slot.

* * *
For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, a UE can be provided by
higher layer signalling with CORESETs. For each CORESET, the UE is provided
the following by _ControlResourceSet_ :
\- a CORESET index , , by _controlResourceSetId_ ;
\- a DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization value by _pdcch-DMRS-
ScramblingID_ ;
\- a precoder granularity for a number of REGs in the frequency domain where
the UE can assume use of a same DM-RS precoder by _precoderGranularity_ ;
\- a number of consecutive symbols provided by _duration_ ;
\- a set of resource blocks provided by _frequencyDomainResources_ ;
\- CCE-to-REG mapping parameters provided by _cce-REG-MappingType_ ;
\- an antenna port quasi co-location, from a set of antenna port quasi co-
locations provided by _TCI-State_ , indicating quasi co-location information
of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in a respective CORESET;
\- an indication for a presence or absence of a transmission configuration
indication (TCI) field for DCI format 1_1 transmitted by a PDCCH in CORESET ,
by _tci-PresentInDCI_.
When _precoderGranularity_ = _allContiguousRBs_ , a UE does not expect
\- to be configured a set of resource blocks of a CORESET that includes more
than four sub-sets of resource blocks that are not contiguous in frequency
\- any RE of a CORESET to overlap with any RE determined from _lte-CRS-
ToMatchAround_ or with any RE of a SS/PBCH block.
For each CORESET in a DL BWP of a serving cell, a respective
_frequencyDomainResources_ provides a bitmap. The bits of the bitmap have a
one-to-one mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in
ascending order of the PRB index in the DL BWP bandwidth of PRBs with starting
common RB position where the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has
common RB index .
For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0,
\- if a UE has not been provided a configuration of TCI state(s) by _tci-
StatesPDCCH-ToAddList_ and _tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList_ for the CORESET, or
has been provided initial configuration of more than one TCI states for the
CORESET by _tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList_ and _tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList_ but
has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as
described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port
associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block
the UE identified during the initial access procedure;
\- if a UE has been provided a configuration of more than one TCI states by
_tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList_ and _tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList_ for the
CORESET as part of Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS
38.331] but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI
states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna
port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH
block or the CSI-RS resource the UE identified during the random access
procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in
[12, TS 38.331].
For a CORESET with index 0, the UE assumes that a DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH
receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with
\- the one or more DL RS configured by a TCI state, where the TCI state is
indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET, if any, or
\- a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent random access
procedure not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free
random access procedure, if no MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI
state for the CORESET is received after the most recent random access
procedure.
For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0, if a UE is provided a single
TCI state for a CORESET, or if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for
one of the provided TCI states for a CORESET, the UE assumes that the DM-RS
antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-
located with the one or more DL RS configured by the TCI state. For a CORESET
with index 0, the UE expects that QCL-TypeD of a CSI-RS in a TCI state
indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET is provided by a
SS/PBCH block
\- if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states,
the UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot
where is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH. The active BWP is defined as the active BWP in
the slot when the activation command is applied.
For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE is provided by
higher layers with search space sets where, for each search space set from the
search space sets, the UE is provided the following by _SearchSpace_ :
\- a search space set index , , by _searchSpaceId_
\- an association between the search space set and a CORESET by
_controlResourceSetId_
\- a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of slots and a PDCCH monitoring offset of
slots, by _monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset_
\- a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s) of the
CORESET within a slot for PDCCH monitoring, by _monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot_
\- a duration of slots indicating a number of slots that the search space set
exists by _duration_
\- a number of PDCCH candidates _per CCE aggregation level_ by
_aggregationLevel1_ , _aggregationLevel2_ , _aggregationLevel4_ ,
_aggregationLevel8_ , and _aggregationLevel16_ , for CCE aggregation level 1,
CCE aggregation level 2, CCE aggregation level 4, CCE aggregation level 8, and
CCE aggregation level 16, respectively
\- an indication that search space set is either a CSS set or a USS set by
_searchSpaceType_
\- if search space set is a CSS set
\- an indication by _dci-Format0-0-AndFormat1-0_ to monitor PDCCH candidates
for DCI format 0_0 and DCI format 1_0
\- an indication by _dci-Format2-0_ to monitor one or two PDCCH candidates for
DCI format 2_0 and a corresponding CCE aggregation level
\- an indication by _dci-Format2-1_ to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format
2_1
\- an indication by _dci-Format2-2_ to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format
2_2
\- an indication by _dci-Format2-3_ to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format
2_3
> \- if search space set is a USS set, an indication by _dci-Formats_ to
> monitor PDCCH candidates either for DCI format 0_0 and DCI format 1_0, or
> for DCI format 0_1 and DCI format 1_1
If the _monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot_ indicates to a UE to monitor PDCCH in a
subset of up to three consecutive symbols that are same in every slot where
the UE monitors PDCCH for all search space sets, the UE does not expect to be
configured with a PDCCH SCS other than 15 kHz if the subset includes at least
one symbol after the third symbol.
A UE does not expect to be provided a first symbol and a number of consecutive
symbols for a CORESET that results to a PDCCH candidate mapping to symbols of
different slots.
A UE does not expect any two PDCCH monitoring occasions on an active DL BWP,
for a same search space set or for different search space sets, in a same
CORESET to be separated by a non-zero number of symbols that is smaller than
the CORESET duration.
A UE determines a PDCCH monitoring occasion on an active DL BWP from the PDCCH
monitoring periodicity, the PDCCH monitoring offset, and the PDCCH monitoring
pattern within a slot. For search space set , the UE determines that a PDCCH
monitoring occasion(s) exists in a slot with number [4, TS 38.211] in a frame
with number if $\left( n_{f}N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\mu} + n_{s,f}^{\mu} -
o_{p,s} \right)\text{mod\ }k_{p,s} = 0$[.]{.underline} The UE monitors PDCCH
candidates for search space set for consecutive slots, starting from slot ,
and does not monitor PDCCH candidates for search space set for the next
consecutive slots.
A USS at CCE aggregation level is defined by a set of PDCCH candidates for CCE
aggregation level .
If a UE is configured with _CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig_ for a serving cell
the carrier indicator field value corresponds to the value indicated by
_CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig._
For an active DL BWP of a serving cell on which a UE monitors PDCCH candidates
in a USS, if the UE is not configured with a carrier indicator field, the UE
monitors the PDCCH candidates without carrier indicator field. For an active
DL BWP of a serving cell on which a UE monitors PDCCH candidates in a USS, if
a UE is configured with a carrier indicator field, the UE monitors the PDCCH
candidates with carrier indicator field.
A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH candidates on an active DL BWP of a
secondary cell if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH candidates with
carrier indicator field corresponding to that secondary cell in another
serving cell. For the active DL BWP of a serving cell on which the UE monitors
PDCCH candidates, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates at least for the same
serving cell.
For a search space set associated with CORESET , the CCE indexes for
aggregation level corresponding to PDCCH candidate of the search space set in
slot for an active DL BWP of a serving cell corresponding to carrier indicator
field value are given by
where
for any CSS, ;
for a USS, , , for , for , for , and ;
;
is the number of CCEs, numbered from 0 to , in CORESET ;
is the carrier indicator field value if the UE is configured with a carrier
indicator field by _CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig_ for the serving cell on
which PDCCH is monitored; otherwise, including for any CSS, ;
, where is the number of PDCCH candidates the UE is configured to monitor for
aggregation level of a search space set for a serving cell corresponding to ;
for any CSS, ;
for a USS, is the maximum of over all configured values for a CCE aggregation
level of search space set ;
the RNTI value used for is the C-RNTI.
A UE that
\- is configured for operation with carrier aggregation, and
\- indicates support of search space sharing through _searchSpaceSharingCA-UL_
or through _searchSpaceSharingCA-DL_ , and
\- has a PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level in CORESET for a DCI
format 0_1 or a DCI format 1_1 having a first size and associated with serving
cell ,
can receive a corresponding PDCCH through a PDCCH candidate with CCE
aggregation level in CORESET for a DCI format 0_1 or a DCI format 1_1,
respectively, having a second size and associated with serving cell if the
first size and the second size are same.
A UE expects to monitor PDCCH candidates for up to 4 sizes of DCI formats that
include up to 3 sizes of DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI per serving
cell. The UE counts a number of sizes for DCI formats per serving cell based
on a number of configured PDCCH candidates in respective search space sets for
the corresponding active DL BWP.
A PDCCH candidate with index for a search space set using a set of CCEs in a
CORESET on the active DL BWP for serving cell is not counted for monitoring if
there is a PDCCH candidate with index for a search space set , or if there is
a PDCCH candidate with index and , in the CORESET on the active DL BWP for
serving cell using a same set of CCEs, the PDCCH candidates have identical
scrambling, and the corresponding DCI formats for the PDCCH candidates have a
same size; otherwise, the PDCCH candidate with index is counted for
monitoring.
Table 10.1-2 provides the maximum number of monitored PDCCH candidates, , for
a DL BWP with SCS configuration for a UE per slot for operation with a single
serving cell.

Table 10.1-3 provides the maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs, , for a DL
BWP with SCS configuration that a UE is expected to monitor corresponding
PDCCH candidates per slot for operation with a single serving cell.
CCEs for PDCCH candidates are non-overlapped if they correspond to
\- different CORESET indexes, or
\- different first symbols for the reception of the respective PDCCH
candidates.

If a UE is configured with downlink cells with DL BWPs having SCS
configuration where , the UE is not required to monitor, on the active DL BWP
of the scheduling cell, more than PDCCH candidates or more than non-overlapped
CCEs per slot for each scheduled cell.
If a UE is configured with downlink cells with DL BWPs having SCS
configuration , where , a DL BWP of an activated cell is the active DL BWP of
the activated cell, and a DL BWP of a deactivated cell is the DL BWP with
index provided by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ for the deactivated cell, the UE
is not required to monitor more than PDCCH candidates or more than non-
overlapped CCEs per slot on the active DL BWP(s) of scheduling cell(s) from
the downlink cells.
For each scheduled cell, the UE is not required to monitor on the active DL
BWP with SCS configuration of the scheduling cell more than PDCCH candidates
or more than non-overlapped CCEs per slot.
A UE does not expect to be configured CSS sets that result to corresponding
total, or per scheduled cell, numbers of monitored PDCCH candidates and non-
overlapped CCEs per slot that exceed the corresponding maximum numbers per
slot.
For same cell scheduling or for cross-carrier scheduling where a scheduling
cell and scheduled cell(s) have DL BWPs with same SCS configuration , a UE
does not expect a number of PDCCH candidates, and a number of corresponding
non-overlapped CCEs per slot on a secondary cell to be larger than the
corresponding numbers that the UE is capable of monitoring on the secondary
cell per slot.
For cross-carrier scheduling, the number of PDCCH candidates for monitoring
and the number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot are separately counted for each
scheduled cell.
For all search space sets within a slot , denote by a set of CSS sets with
cardinality of and by a set of USS sets with cardinality of . The location of
USS sets , , in is according to an ascending order of the search space set

For the CSS sets, a UE monitors PDCCH candidates requiring a total of non-
overlapping CCEs in a slot.
The UE allocates PDCCH candidates for monitoring to USS sets for the primary
cell having an active DL BWP with SCS configuration in slot according to the
following pseudocode. A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH in a USS set

If a UE

\- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in
multiple CORESETs that have same or different QCL-TypeD properties on active
DL BWP(s) of one or more cells
the UE monitors PDCCHs only in a CORESET, and in any other CORESET from the
multiple CORESETs having same QCL-TypeD properties as the CORESET, on the
active DL BWP of a cell from the one or more cells
\- the CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell

\- the lowest USS set index is determined over all USS sets with at least one
PDCCH candidate in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions
\- for the purpose of determining the CORESET, a SS/PBCH block is considered
to have different QCL-TypeD properties than a CSI-RS
\- for the purpose of determining the CORESET, a first CSI-RS associated with
a SS/PBCH block in a first cell and a second CSI-RS in a second cell that is
also associated with the SS/PBCH block are assumed to have same QCL-TypeD
properties

monitoring is according to all search space sets associated with the multiple
CORESETs on the active DL BWP(s) of the one or more cells

If a UE
\- is configured for single cell operation or for operation with carrier
aggregation in a same frequency band, and
\- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in
multiple CORESETs where none of the CORESETs has TCI-states with \'QCL-
TypeD\',
the UE is required to monitor PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring
occasions for search space sets associated with different CORESETs.
For a scheduled cell and at any time, a UE expects to have received at most 16
PDCCHs for DCI formats 1_0 or 1_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or
MCS-C-RNTI scheduling 16 PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received
any corresponding PDSCH symbol and at most 16 PDCCHs for DCI formats 0_0 or
0_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling 16 PUSCH
transmissions for which the UE has not transmitted any corresponding PUSCH
symbol.
If a UE
\- is not configured for NR-DC operation and indicates through _pdcch-
BlindDetectionCA_ a capability to monitor PDCCH candidates for downlink cells
and the UE is configured with downlink cells or uplink cells, or
\- is configured with NR-DC operation and for a cell group with downlink cells
or uplink cells
the UE expects to have respectively received at most PDCCHs for
\- DCI formats 1_0 or 1_1 with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a
MCS-C-RNTI scheduling PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received any
corresponding PDSCH symbol over all downlink cells
\- DCI formats 0_0 or 0_1 with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a
MCS-C-RNTI scheduling PUSCH transmissions for which the UE has not transmitted
any corresponding PUSCH symbol over all uplink cells
If a UE
\- is configured to monitor a first PDCCH candidate for a DCI format 0_0 and a
DCI format 1_0 from a CSS set and a second PDCCH candidate for a DCI format
0_0 and a DCI format 1_0 from a USS set in a CORESET with index zero on an
active DL BWP, and

DCI formats 0_0/1_0 associated with the second PDCCH candidate have same size,
and
\- the UE receives the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate
over a same set of CCEs, and
\- the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate have identical
scrambling, and
\- the DCI formats 0_0/1_0 for the first PDCCH candidate and the DCI formats
0_0/1_0 for the second PDCCH candidate have CRC scrambled by either C-RNTI, or
MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI
the UE decodes only the DCI formats 0_0/1_0 associated with the first PDCCH
candidate.
If a UE detects a DCI format with inconsistent information, the UE discards
**all** the information in the DCI format.
A UE configured with a bandwidth part indicator in DCI formats 0_1 or 1_1
determines, in case of an active DL BWP or of an active UL BWP change, the DCI
information applicable to the new active DL BWP or UL BWP, respectively, as
described in Clause 12.
For unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH
transmission on serving cell , the UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH on
serving cell if the PDCCH overlaps in time with SRS transmission (including
any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [10, TS 38.133])
on serving cell and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and
transmission on serving cell and serving cell .
If a UE is provided _resourceBlocks_ and s _ymbolsInResourceBlock_ in
_RateMatchPattern_ , or if the UE is additionally provided
_periodicityAndPattern_ in _RateMatchPattern_ , the UE can determine a set of
RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH reception as
described in [6, TS 38.214]. If a PDCCH candidate in a slot is mapped to one
or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the set of RBs in symbols of
the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
## 10.2 PDCCH validation for DL SPS and UL grant Type 2
A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a DL SPS
assignment PDCCH or configured UL grant Type 2 PDCCH if
\- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format is scrambled with a CS-RNTI provided
by _cs-RNTI_ , and
\- the new data indicator field for the enabled transport block is set to
\'0\'.
Validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields for the DCI format are
set according to Table 10.2-1 or Table 10.2-2.
If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI format
as a valid activation or valid release of DL SPS or configured UL grant Type
2. If validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the information in the
DCI format.

# 11 UE-group common signalling
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
## 11.1 Slot configuration
A slot format includes downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible symbols.
The following are applicable for each serving cell.
If a UE is provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , the UE sets the slot
format per slot over a number of slots as indicated by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_.
The _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ provides
\- a reference SCS configuration by _referenceSubcarrierSpacing_
> \- a _pattern1_.
The _pattern1_ provides
\- a slot configuration period of msec by _dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity_
\- a number of slots with only downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSlots_
\- a number of downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSymbols_
\- a number of slots with only uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSlots_
\- a number of uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSymbols_
A value msec is valid only for . A value msec is valid only for or . A value
msec is valid only for , or , or .
A slot configuration period of msec includes slots with SCS configuration .
From the slots, a first slots include only downlink symbols and a last slots
include only uplink symbols. The symbols after the first slots are downlink
symbols. The symbols before the last slots are uplink symbols. The remaining
are flexible symbols.
The first symbol every periods is a first symbol in an even frame.
If _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ provides both _pattern1_ and _pattern2_ ,
the UE sets the slot format per slot over a first number of slots as indicated
by _pattern1_ and the UE sets the slot format per slot over a second number of
slots as indicated by _pattern2_.
The _pattern2_ provides
\- a slot configuration period of msec by _dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity_
\- a number of slots with only downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSlots_
\- a number of downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSymbols_
\- a number of slots with only uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSlots_
\- a number of uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSymbols_
The applicable values of are same as the applicable values for .
A slot configuration period of msec includes first slots and second slots.
From the slots, a first slots include only downlink symbols and a last include
only uplink symbols. The symbols after the first slots are downlink symbols.
The symbols before the last slots are uplink symbols. The remaining are
flexible symbols.
A UE expects that divides 20 msec.
The first symbol every periods is a first symbol in an even frame.
A UE expects that the reference SCS configuration is smaller than or equal to
a SCS configuration for any configured DL BWP or UL BWP. Each slot provided by
_pattern1_ or _pattern2_ is applicable to consecutive slots in the active DL
BWP or the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first
slot for the reference SCS configuration and each downlink or flexible or
uplink symbol for the reference SCS configuration corresponds to consecutive
downlink or flexible or uplink symbols for the SCS configuration .
If the UE is additionally provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the
parameter _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ overrides only flexible symbols
per slot over the number of slots as provided by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_.
The _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ provides
\- a set of slot configurations by _slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList_
\- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations
\- a slot index for a slot provided by _slotIndex_
\- a set of symbols for a slot by _symbols_ where
\- if _symbols_ = _allDownlink_ , all symbols in the slot are downlink
\- if _symbols_ = _allUplink_ , all symbols in the slot are uplink
\- if _symbols_ = _explicit_ , _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ provides a number of
downlink first symbols in the slot and _nrofUplinkSymbols_ provides a number
of uplink last symbols in the slot. If _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ is not provided,
there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if _nrofUplinkSymbols_ is
not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in the slot. The remaining
symbols in the slot are flexible
For each slot having a corresponding index provided by _slotIndex_ , the UE
applies a format provided by a corresponding _symbols_. The UE does not expect
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to indicate as uplink or as downlink a
symbol that _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ indicates as a downlink or as an
uplink symbol, respectively.
For each slot configuration provided by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , a
reference SCS configuration is the reference SCS configuration
{width="0.25277777777777777in" height="0.21944444444444444in"} provided by
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_.
A slot configuration period and a number of downlink symbols, uplink symbols,
and flexible symbols in each slot of the slot configuration period are
determined from _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ and are common to each configured BWP.
A UE considers symbols in a slot indicated as downlink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to be available
for receptions and considers symbols in a slot indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-
DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or by _tdd_ -_UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to be
available for transmissions.
If a UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0, for a set of
symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd_ -_UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ if provided, or
when _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd_ -_UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_
are not provided to the UE
\- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE
receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format 1_0, DCI format 1_1, or
DCI format 0_1
\- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the
slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format 0_0, DCI
format 0_1, DCI format 1_0, DCI format 1_1, DCI format 2_3, or a RAR UL grant
For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured
by higher layers to receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS in a set of
symbols of a slot, the UE receives the PDCCH, the PDSCH, or the CSI-RS if the
UE does not detect a DCI format 0_0, DCI format 0_1, DCI format 1_0, DCI
format 1_1, or DCI format 2_3 that indicates to the UE to transmit a PUSCH, a
PUCCH, a PRACH, or a SRS in at least one symbol of the set of symbols of the
slot; otherwise, the UE does not receive the PDCCH, or the PDSCH, or the CSI-
RS in the set of symbols of the slot.
For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured
by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in a set of
symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format 1_0, DCI format 1_1, or DCI
format 0_1 indicating to the UE to receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of
symbols from the set of symbols, then
\- the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or
PRACH in the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within
$T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the
DCI format;
\- otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH transmission in the
set of symbols.
\- the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from
the subset of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last symbol
of CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the SRS
transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols.
$T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing
capability [6, TS38.214] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying
the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or
$\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$ corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH
if it is 15kHz or higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0.$
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the UE
does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS when the PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS
overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as downlink by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the UE
does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS when the PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or
SRS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as flexible by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , and _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ if
provided, the UE does not expect to receive both dedicated higher layer
parameters configuring transmission from the UE in the set of symbols of the
slot and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring reception by the UE in
the set of symbols of the slot.
For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, for a set of symbols
of a slot that are indicated to a UE by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ or
_ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ , for reception of SS/PBCH
blocks, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH in the slot if a
transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols and the UE
does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot. The UE does not
expect the set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , when provided
to the UE.
For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to a valid PRACH occasion and
symbols before the valid PRACH occasion, as described in Sublcause 8.1, the UE
does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS in the slot if a reception would
overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols. The UE does not expect the
set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as downlink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_.
For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in
_MIB_ for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not expect the set of
symbols to be indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_.
If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format 1_1 to receive PDSCH over multiple slots,
and if _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_
, indicate that, for a slot from the multiple slots, at least one symbol from
a set of symbols where the UE is scheduled PDSCH reception in the slot is an
uplink symbol, the UE does not receive the PDSCH in the slot.
If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format 0_1 to transmit PUSCH over multiple
slots, and if _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ , indicates that, for a slot from the multiple slots,
at least one symbol from a set of symbols where the UE is scheduled PUSCH
transmission in the slot is a downlink symbol, the UE does not transmit the
PUSCH in the slot.
### 11.1.1 UE procedure for determining slot format
This clause applies for a serving cell that is included in a set of serving
cells configured to a UE by _slotFormatCombToAddModList_ and
_slotFormatCombToReleaseList_.
If a UE is configured by higher layers with parameter _SlotFormatIndicator_ ,
the UE is provided a SFI-RNTI by _sfi-RNTI_ and with a payload size of DCI
format 2_0 by _dci-PayloadSize_.
The UE is also provided in one or more serving cells with a configuration for
a search space set and a corresponding CORESET for monitoring PDCCH candidates
for DCI format 2_0 with a CCE aggregation level of CCEs as described in Clause
10.1. The PDCCH candidates are the first PDCCH candidates _for CCE aggregation
level_ for search space set in CORESET .
For each serving cell in the set of serving cells, the UE can be provided:
\- an identity of the serving cell by _servingCellId_
\- a location of a SFI-index field in DCI format 2_0 by _positionInDCI_
\- a set of slot format combinations by _slotFormatCombinations_ , where each
slot format combination in the set of slot format combinations includes
\- one or more slot formats indicated by a respective _slotFormats_ for the
slot format combination, and
\- a mapping for the slot format combination provided by _slotFormats_ to a
corresponding SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 provided by
_slotFormatCombinationId_
\- for unpaired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration by
_subcarrierSpacing_ and, when a supplementary UL carrier is configured for the
serving cell, a reference SCS configuration by _subcarrierSpacing2_ for the
supplementary UL carrier
\- for paired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration for a DL BWP
by _subcarrierSpacing_ and a reference SCS configuration for an UL BWP by
_subcarrierSpacing2_
A SFI-index field value in a DCI format 2_0 indicates to a UE a slot format
for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting
from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2_0. The number of slots is
equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The
SFI-index field includes bits where maxSFIindex is the maximum value of the
values provided by corresponding _slotFormatCombinationId_. A slot format is
identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where
\'D\' denotes a downlink symbol, \'U\' denotes an uplink symbol, and \'F\'
denotes a flexible symbol.
If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0, provided to a UE for the
search space set by _monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset_ , is smaller than a
duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring
occasion for DCI format 2_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the
UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot,
the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same
format for the slot.
A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0 on a
second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.

symbols, each of the last symbol groups includes symbols, a bit value of 0
indicates transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and a bit
value of 1 indicates no transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol
group.

field in the DCI format 2_1 have a one-to-one mapping with 7 groups of
consecutive symbols where each of the first symbol groups includes symbols,
each of the last symbol groups includes symbols, a first bit in a pair of bits
for a symbol group is applicable to the subset of first PRBs from the set of
PRBs, a second bit in the pair of bits for the symbol group is applicable to
the subset of last PRBs from the set of PRBs, a bit value of 0 indicates
transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and subset of PRBs,

described in this clause for both MCG and SCG
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
A UE configured for operation in bandwidth parts (BWPs) of a serving cell, is
configured by higher layers for the serving cell a set of at most four
bandwidth parts (BWPs) for receptions by the UE (DL BWP set) in a DL bandwidth
by parameter _BWP-Downlink_ or by parameter _initialDownlinkBWP_ with a set of
parameters configured by _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ ,
and a set of at most four BWPs for transmissions by the UE (UL BWP set) in an
UL bandwidth by parameter _BWP-Uplink_ or by parameter _initialUplinkBWP_ with
a set of parameters configured by _BWP-UplinkCommon_ and _BWP-
UplinkDedicated_.
If a UE is not provided _initialDownlinkBWP_ , an initial DL BWP is defined by
a location and number of contiguous PRBs, starting from a PRB with the lowest
index and ending at a PRB with the highest index among PRBs of a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and a SCS and a cyclic prefix for PDCCH reception in the
CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set; otherwise, the initial DL BWP is provided by
_initialDownlinkBWP_. For operation on the primary cell or on a secondary
cell, a UE is provided an initial UL BWP by _initialUplinkBWP_. If the UE is
configured with a supplementary UL carrier, the UE can be provided an initial
UL BWP on the supplementary UL carrier by _initialUplinkBWP_.
If a UE has dedicated BWP configuration, the UE can be provided by
_firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ a first active DL BWP for receptions and by
_firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ a first active UL BWP for transmissions on a carrier
of the primary cell.
For each DL BWP or UL BWP in a set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs, respectively, the UE
is provided the following parameters for the serving cell as defined in [4, TS
38.211] or [6, TS 38.214]:
\- a SCS by _subcarrierSpacing_
\- a cyclic prefix by _cyclicPrefix_
\- a common RB and a number of contiguous RBs provided by
_locationAndBandwidth_ that indicates an offset and a length as RIV according
to [6, TS 38.214], setting , and a value provided by _offsetToCarrier_ for the
_subcarrierSpacing_
\- an index in the set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs by respective _BWP-Id_
\- a set of BWP-common and a set of BWP-dedicated parameters by _BWP-
DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ for the DL BWP, or _BWP-
UplinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkDedicated_ for the UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]
For unpaired spectrum operation, a DL BWP from the set of configured DL BWPs
with index provided by _BWP-Id_ is linked with an UL BWP from the set of
configured UL BWPs with index provided by _BWP-Id_ when the DL BWP index and
the UL BWP index are same. For unpaired spectrum operation, a UE does not
expect to receive a configuration where the center frequency for a DL BWP is
different than the center frequency for an UL BWP when the _BWP-Id_ of the DL
BWP is same as the _BWP-Id_ of the UL BWP.
For each DL BWP in a set of DL BWPs of the PCell, a UE can be configured
CORESETs for every type of CSS sets and for USS as described in Clause 10.1.
The UE does not expect to be configured without a CSS set on the PCell in the
active DL BWP.
If a UE is provided _controlResourceSetZero_ and _searchSpaceZero_ in _PDCCH-
ConfigSIB1 or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a_ search
space set from _controlResourcesetZero_ as described in Clause 13 and for
Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring
occasions as described in Clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the
active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, t _he UE_ determines PDCCH monitoring
occasions _for the_ search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth _is within
the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same
cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP_.
For each UL BWP in a set of UL BWPs of the PCell or of the PUCCH-SCell, the UE
is configured resource sets for PUCCH transmissions as described in Clause
9.2.1.
A UE receives PDCCH and PDSCH in a DL BWP according to a configured SCS and CP
length for the DL BWP. A UE transmits PUCCH and PUSCH in an UL BWP according
to a configured SCS and CP length for the UL BWP.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in DCI format 1_1, the
bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active DL BWP, from the
configured DL BWP set, for DL receptions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a
bandwidth part indicator field is configured in DCI format 0_1, the bandwidth
part indicator field value indicates the active UL BWP, from the configured UL
BWP set, for UL transmissions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a bandwidth
part indicator field is configured in DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1 and
indicates an UL BWP or a DL BWP different from the active UL BWP or DL BWP,
respectively, the UE shall
\- for each information field in the received DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1
\- if the size of the information field is smaller than the one required for
the DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1 interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP
that is indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, respectively, the UE
prepends zeros to the information field until its size is the one required for
the interpretation of the information field for the UL BWP or DL BWP prior to
interpreting the DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1 information fields,
respectively
\- if the size of the information field is larger than the one required for
the DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1 interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP
that is indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, respectively, the UE uses a
number of least significant bits of DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1 equal to
the one required for the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by bandwidth part
indicator prior to interpreting the DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1
information fields, respectively
\- set the active UL BWP or DL BWP to the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by the
bandwidth part indicator in the DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1, respectively
A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 1_1 or a DCI format 0_1 indicating
respectively an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP change with the
corresponding time domain resource assignment field providing a slot offset
value for a PDSCH reception or PUSCH transmission that is smaller than a delay
required by the UE for an active DL BWP change or UL BWP change [10, TS
38.133].
If a UE detects a DCI format 1_1 indicating an active DL BWP change for a
cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time
duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the
PDCCH that includes the DCI format 1_1 in a scheduling cell until the
beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain
resource assignment field in the DCI format 1_1.
If a UE detects a DCI format 0_1 indicating an active UL BWP change for a
cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time
duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the
PDCCH that includes the DCI format 0_1 in the scheduling cell until the
beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain
resource assignment field in the DCI format 0_1.
A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 1_1 indicating an active DL BWP
change or a DCI format 0_1 indicating an active UL BWP change for a scheduled
cell within FR1 (or FR2) in a slot other than the first slot of a set of slots
for the DL SCS of the scheduling cell that overlaps with a time duration where
the UE is not required to receive or transmit for an active BWP change in a
different cell from the scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2).
A UE expects to detect a DCI format 0_1 indicating active UL BWP change, or a
DCI format 1_1 indicating active DL BWP change, only if a corresponding PDCCH
is received within the first 3 symbols of a slot.
For a serving cell, a UE can be provided by _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id_ a default
DL BWP among the configured DL BWPs. If a UE is not provided a default DL BWP
by _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id_ , the default DL BWP is the initial DL BWP.
If a UE is provided by _bwp-InactivityTimer_ a timer value for the serving
cell [11, TS 38.321] and the timer is running, the UE decrements the timer at
the end of a subframe for FR1 or at the end of a half subframe for FR2 if the
restarting conditions in [11, TS 38.321] are not met during the interval of
the subframe for FR1 or of the half subframe for FR2.
For a cell where a UE changes an active DL BWP due to a BWP inactivity timer
expiration and for accommodating a delay in the active DL BWP change or the
active UL BWP change required by the UE [10, TS 38.133], the UE is not
required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the
beginning of a subframe for FR1, or of half of a subframe for FR2, that is
immediately after the BWP inactivity timer expires until the beginning of a
slot where the UE can receive or transmit.
When a UE\'s BWP inactivity timer for a cell within FR1 (or FR2) expires
within a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit for
an active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in a different cell within FR1 (or
FR2), the UE delays the active UL/DL BWP change triggered by the BWP
inactivity timer expiration until a subframe for FR1 or half a subframe for
FR2 that is immediately after the UE completes the active UL/DL BWP change in
the cell or in the different cell within FR1 (or FR2).
If a UE is provided by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ a first active DL BWP and
by _firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a secondary
cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL BWP as the
respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and first active UL BWP
on the carrier of the secondary cell.
A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH when the UE performs RRM measurements
[10, TS 38.133] over a bandwidth that is not within the active DL BWP for the
UE.
# 13 UE procedure for monitoring Type0-PDCCH CSS sets
If during cell search a UE determines from _MIB_ that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in Clause 4.1, the UE determines
a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of consecutive symbols
for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from _controlResourceSetZero in_
_pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ , as described in Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines
PDCCH monitoring occasions from _searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ ,
included in _MIB_ , as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15. and are the
SFN and slot index within a frame of the CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET
and and are the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the CORESET, respectively,
where the SS/PBCH block with index overlaps in time with system frame and slot
. The symbols of the CORESET associated with _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in _MIB_ or
with _searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix._
The offset in Tables 13-1 through 13-10 is defined with respect to the SCS of
the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, provided by _subCarrierSpacingCommon,_
from the smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to the
smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the
corresponding SS/PBCH block. In Tables 13-7, 13-8, and 13-10 is defined in [4,
TS 38.211].
For the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH
in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over two consecutive slots starting from slot . For
SS/PBCH block with index , the UE determines an index of slot as located in a
frame with system frame number (SFN) satisfying if or in a frame with SFN
satisfying if . and are provided by Tables 13-11 and 13-12, and based on the
SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211]. The index for the
first symbol of the CORESET in slots and is the first symbol index provided by
Tables 13-11 and 13-12.
For the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, a UE monitors
PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over one slot with Type0-PDCCH CSS set
periodicity equal to the periodicity of SS/PBCH block. For the SS/PBCH block
and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, if the active DL BWP is the initial
DL BWP, the UE is expected to be able to perform radio link monitoring, as
described in Clause 5, and measurements for radio resource management [10, TS
38.133] using a SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set.
For a SS/PBCH block with index , the UE determines the slot index and based on
parameters provided by Tables 13-13 through 13-15.

If a UE detects a first SS/PBCH block and determines that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present, and for for FR1 or for for FR2, the UE may
determine the nearest (in the corresponding frequency direction) global
synchronization channel number (GSCN) of a second SS/PBCH block having a
CORESET for an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set as . is the GSCN of the first
SS/PBCH block and is a GSCN offset provided by Table 13-16 for FR1 and Table
13-17 for FR2. If the UE detects the second SS/PBCH block and the second
SS/PBCH block does not provide a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described
in Clause 4.1, the UE may ignore the information related to GSCN of SS/PBCH
block locations for performing cell search.
If a UE detects a SS/PBCH block and determines that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH
CSS set is not present, and for for FR1 or for for FR2, the UE determines that
there is no SS/PBCH block having an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set within a
GSCN range . and are respectively determined by _controlResourceSetZero_ and
_searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1._ If the GSCN range is , the UE
determines that there is no information for a second SS/PBCH block with a
CORESET for an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the detected SS/PBCH block
_._
If a UE does not detect any SS/PBCH block providing a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH
CSS set, as described in Clause 4.1, within a time period determined by the
UE, the UE may ignore the information related to GSCN of SS/PBCH locations in
performing cell search.
