# Introduction
**The basic multiple access scheme for NR is orthogonal for both downlink and
uplink data transmissions, e.g., time and frequency physical resources of
different users are not overlapped. On the other hand, non-orthogonal
multiple-access schemes recently gained wide interest.**
**Non-orthogonal transmission can be applied to both grant-based and grant-
free transmission. The benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access,
particularly when enabling grant-free transmission, may encompass a variety of
use cases or deployment scenarios, including eMBB, URLLC, mMTC etc. In
RRC_CONNECTED state, it saves the scheduling request procedure assuming UE is
already uplink synchronized. In RRC_INACTIVE state, data can be transmitted
even without RACH procedure or with 2-step RACH. The saving of the signalling
naturally also saves UE\'s power consumption, reduces latency and increases
system capacity.**
# 1 Scope
This document is intended to gather all technical outcome of the study item
\"Study on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for NR\" [1], and draw a
conclusion on a way forward.
This activity involves the Radio Access work area of the 3GPP studies and has
impacts both on the Mobile Equipment and Access Network of the 3GPP systems.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.
