# 4 Background
In 3GPP RAN4 #AH2 meeting, it is proposed that new bands for NR are assigned
band numbers on a "first come first served" basis in reserved ranges
regardless of duplex mode or RAT. Then, in RAN4 #84 meeting, band 3.3-3.8 GHz
and band 3.3-4.2GHz are assigned band number n78 and n77 respectively.
# 5 NR Frequency band definition
In 3GPP, RAN 4 specified two NR operating bands n77 and n78 in 3.3GHz-4.2GHz.
A UE supporting n78 band is not required to support n77 band [2].

## 6.2 Channel bandwidth
### 6.2.1 Channel bandwidth Set [NR_newRAT]
The superset of channel bandwidth for UE was agreed in Table 6.2.1-1:
Table 6.2.1-1 UE channel bandwidth set
NR Band | Data SCS = 15kHz | Data SCS = 30kHz | Data SCS = 60kHz (for more than 1GHz bands) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

### 7.1.1 Transmitter characteristics
#### 7.1.1.1 UE maximum output power
The MOP requirements for Band 42 and 43 single-carrier were specified as 23
dBm +2/-3 dB for power class 3 based on simulation results shown in Table
7.1.1.1-1 in August 2011.

When specifying MOP requirements of Band n77 and n78, the delta to be checked
is IL impact of BPF due to the extension of pass-bandwidth. It is shown in
Table 7.1.1.1-2.

With comparison between Table 7.1.1.1-1 and Table 7.1.1.1-2, it was concluded
that there is no degradation of IL at ETC even with the extension and agreed
to specify the same MOP as that of Band 42 and 43 (i.e., 23 dBm +2/-3 dB) for
Band n77 and n78 of power class 3.
Agreement: MOP is to be specified as 23 dBm +2/-3 dB for Band n77 and n78 of
power class 3
The following NR UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for non-CA configuration
and UL-MIMO unless otherwise stated.

No changes to Table 7.1.1.6-1 are needed as a result of Band n78 power class 2
operation.
#### 7.1.1.7 Tx requirements for UL MIMO with PC2
##### 7.1.1.7.1 UE maximum output power
For PC2 UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power for any transmission bandwidth
within the channel bandwidth is specified in Table 7.1.1.7.1-1. For UE
supporting UL-MIMO, the maximum output power is measured as the sum of the
maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement
shall be at least one sub frame (1ms).
The requirements shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations of using 2-layer
UL-MIMO transmission with codebook of{width="0.6666666666666666in"
height="0.4270833333333333in"}. Whether other code book will be introduced in
Rel-15 is FFS. DCI Format for UE configured in PUSCH transmission mode for
uplink single-user MIMO shall be used.

#### 7.1.2.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to
receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency
of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on
the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the
adjacent channel(s).
It is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper
range of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.1.2.2-2 and Table 7.1.2.2-3
where the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 of TS
38.101-1 [8] (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-
signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 of TS 38.101-1 [8]).

#### 7.1.2.3 Blocking
##### 7.1.2.3.1 Out-of-band blocking
Based on filter performance shown in Table 7.1.1.1-2, out-of-band blocking
requirement needs to be optimized as with LTE band 42 and 43 as shown in Table
7.1.2.3-1. Wanted signal level is the same as that of LTE refarming bands.
Agreement: Out-of-band blocking for n78 should be specified as below.

The operating band Band n78 is 3300MHz\~3800MHz, belonging to FR1, therefore
only 3 distinct types of NR BS each has a different architecture and
requirements set are applied, which are _BS type 1-C_ , _BS type 1-H_ and _BS
type 1-O._
For Band n78 power class 2 HPUE, it can be foreseen that there are no
additional BS receive blocking such as in-band blocking and out-of-band
blocking requirements introduced.
### 7.2.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
The operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits are defined from Î”f~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band up to
Î”f~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink operating
band. According to the WF in R4-1706223, Î”f~OBUE~=40 MHz for NR bands wider
than 100 MHz as baseline for the boundary between UEM and spurious emission(
for both Cat A and Cat B ). Therefore for Band n78, Î”f~OBUE~ should be40 MHz.
#### 7.2.1.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The _basic limits_ of the operating band unwanted emission for Band n78 is the
based on the same principles as for LTE, where the unwanted emission limits
for >=5MHz channel bandwidth of each BS classes( Wide Area BS(band >1GHz),
Medium Range BS and Local Area BS) can be applied to Cat A and Cat B for the
unwanted emission basic limits for Band n78.
\- For BS type 1-C, the operating band unwanted emissions requirement for each
_antenna connector_ shall be defined based on _basic limits_ with no scaling
and no antenna considered.
\- For BS type 1-H, the operating band unwanted emissions requirements are for
each _TAB connector TX_ shall be defined based on _base limits_. _The power
summation emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell
shall not_ exceed the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
#### 7.2.1.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirements are applied at RIB and
based on the emission scaling, where the emission limits are defined as basic
limit+9dB, where the basic limits are specified in subclause 7.2.1.1.
### 7.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
#### 7.2.2.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The additional spurious emission requirement may be applied for the protection
of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating
band. It is proposed that the same limits as TDD E-UTRA bands (i.e. -52
dBm/MHz) can be applied for the _basic limits_ for NR band n78.
In addition, since the Band n77 and n78 are overlapping operating bands, and
these two bands may be deployed in the same geographical area, thus this
requirement does not apply to BS operating in Band n77 and n78.
_For BS type 1-C_ , the emissions requirements for each _antenna connector_
shall be defined based on _basic limits_ with no scaling and no antenna
considered.
_For BS type 1-H_ , the emissions requirements are for each _TAB connector
shall be defined based on the basics limits, The power summation emission at
the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell shall not_ exceed the
_basic limit_ \+ X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
#### 7.2.2.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The OTA minimum requirements are applied at RIB and based on the emission
scaling, where the emission limits are defined as basic limits+9dB, where the
basic limits are specified in subclause 7.2.2.1.
### 7.2.3 Co-location with other base stations
#### 7.2.3.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA for different BS classes
can be applied for the _basic limits_ of co-location requirements for each BS
classes for NR Bands n78.
For BS type 1-C, the emissions requirements for each antenna connector shall
be defined based on basic limits with no scaling and no antenna considered.
For BS type 1-H, the emissions requirements are for each _TAB connector shall
be defined based on the basics limits, The power summation emission at the TAB
connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell shall not_ exceed the _basic
limit_ \+ X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
7.2.3.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The OTA co-location with other base stations requirements are specified as co-
location requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as described in
TR 37.843 [9].
The output of the _co-location reference antenna_ of any spurious emission
shall not exceed the _basic limits_ in subclause 7.2.3.1 + X dB, where X = -21
dB.
### 7.2.4 General blocking requirement
#### 7.2.4.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range, which
is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating band up to
60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating band for NR Band
n78, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.
The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 1MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink
operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink
operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n78, but includes the
downlink frequency range of the operating band.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _antenna connector_ for _BS
type 1-C_ and at the _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H_.
#### 7.2.4.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range, which
is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating band up to
60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating band for NR Band
n78, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.
The _BS type 1-O_ in-band blocking requirements apply at the RIB when the AoA
of the incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are from
the same direction and are within OTA REFSEN _RoAOA_ and _minSENS RoAoA._
The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 30MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink
operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink
operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n78, but includes the
downlink frequency range of the operating band.
The _BS type 1-O_ out-of -band blocking requirements apply at the RIB when the
AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are
from the same direction and are within _minSENS RoAoA._
### 7.2.5 Blocking requirement for co-location with other base stations
7.2.5.1 Minimum requirement for _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_
The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between interfering
transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of
the same class. Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA for
different BS classes can be applied for the _base limits_ of co-location
requirements for each BS classes for NR Bands n78.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _antenna connector_ for _BS
type 1-C_ and at the _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H_.
7.2.5.2 Minimum requirement for _BS type 1-O_
The OTA co-location blocking requirements are specified as co-location
requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as described in TR
37.843 [9].
The interferer power level is specified per polarization and defined as a
power into the conducted input of the co-location reference antenna.

## 8.1 UE specific
For Power Class 2 UE in Band n77 supporting UL MIMO, the requirements in
Clause 7.1.1.7 and 7.1.2.4 apply.
For UE in Band n77 supporting 4Rx, the requirements in Clause 7.1.2.5 apply.
### 8.1.1 Transmitter characteristics
#### 8.1.1.1 UE maximum output power
Based on the same discussion as UE maximum output power of Band n78 described
in clause 7.1.1.1, the following was agreed.
Agreement: MOP is to be specified as 23 dBm +2/-3 dB for Band n77 and n78 of
power class 3
The following NR UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for non-CA configuration
and UL-MIMO unless otherwise stated.

power class 2 operation.
#### 8.1.2.1 Reference sensitivity
Based on the same discussion as reference sensitivity of Band n78 described in
clause 7.1.2.1, the following was agreed.
> **_Agreement: REFSENS for Band n77 at 3.3-3.8 GHz and n78 should be 1 dB

#### 8.1.2.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to
receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency
of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on
the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the
adjacent channel(s).
It is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper
range of test parameters are chosen in Table 8.1.2.2-2 and Table 8.1.2.2-3
where the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 of TS
38.101-1 [8] (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-
signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 of TS 38.101-1 [8]).

Agreement: Out-of-band blocking for Band n77 and n78 should be specified as
below.

unwanted emission basic limits for Band n77.
For _BS type 1-C_ , the operating band unwanted emissions requirement for each
_antenna connector_ shall be defined based on _basic limits_ with no scaling
and no antenna considered.
For _BS type 1-H_ , the operating band unwanted emissions requirements are for
each _TAB connector TX_ shall be defined based on _base limits_. _The power
summation emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell
shall not_ exceed the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirements are applied at RIB and
based on the emission scaling, where the emission limits are defined as basic
limit+9dB, where the basic limits are specified in subclause 8.2.1.1.
### 8.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
#### 8.2.2.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The additional spurious emission requirement may be applied for the protection
of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating
band. It is proposed that the same limits as TDD E-UTRA bands (i.e. -52
dBm/MHz) can be applied for the _basic limits_ for NR band n77.
In addition, since the Band n77 and n78 are overlapping operating bands, and
these two bands may be deployed in the same geographical area, thus this
requirement does not apply to BS operating in Band n77 and n78.
For _BS type 1-C_ , the emissions requirements for each _antenna connector_
shall be defined based on _basic limits_ with no scaling and no antenna
considered.
For _BS type 1-H_ , the emissions requirements are for each _TAB connector TX
shall be defined based on the basics limits, The power summation emission at
the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell shall not_ exceed the
_basic limit_ \+ X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The OTA minimum requirements are applied at RIB and based on the emission
scaling, where the emission limits are defined as basic limit+9dB, where the
basic limits are specified in subclause 8.2.2.1.
### 8.2.3 Co-location with other base stations
#### 8.2.3.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA for different BS classes
can be applied for the _basic limits_ of co-location requirements for each BS
classes for NR Bands n77.
For BS type 1-C, the emissions requirements for each _antenna connector_ shall
be defined based on _basic limits_ with no scaling and no antenna considered.
For BS type 1-H, the emissions requirements are for each _TAB connector shall
be defined based on the basics limits, The power summation emission at the TAB
connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell shall not_ exceed the _basic
limit_ \+ X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The OTA co-location with other base stations requirements are specified as co-
location requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as described in
TR 37.843 [9].
The output of the _co-location reference antenna_ of any spurious emission
shall not exceed the _basic limits_ in subclause 7.2.3.1 + X dB, where X = -21
dB.
### 8.2.4 General blocking requirement
#### 8.2.4.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H
The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range, which
is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating band up to
60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating band for NR Band
n77, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.
The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 1MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink
operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink
operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n77, but includes the
downlink frequency range of the operating band.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _antenna connector_ for _BS
type 1-C_ and at the _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H_.
#### 8.2.4.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O
The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range, which
is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating band up to
60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating band for NR Band
n77, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.
The _BS type 1-O_ in-band blocking requirements apply at the RIB when the AoA
of the incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are from
the same direction and are within OTA REFSEN _RoAOA_ and _minSENS RoAoA._
The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 30MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink
operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink
operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n77, but includes the
downlink frequency range of the operating band.
The _BS type 1-O_ out-of -band blocking requirements apply at the RIB when the

The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between interfering
transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of
the same class. Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA for
different BS classes can be applied for the _base limits_ of co-location
requirements for each BS classes for NR Bands n77.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _antenna connector_ for _BS
type 1-C_ and at the _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H_.
8.2.5.2 Minimum requirement for _BS type 1-O_
The OTA co-location blocking requirements are specified as co-location
requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as described in TR
37.843 [9].
The interferer power level is specified per polarization and defined as a
power into the conducted input of the co-location reference antenna.
