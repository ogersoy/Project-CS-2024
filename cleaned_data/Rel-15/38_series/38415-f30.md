# 4 General
## 4.1 General aspects
The PDU Session User Plane protocol is located in the User Plane of the Radio
Network Layer above the Transport Network Layer of the interface.
Each PDU session User Plane protocol instance is associated to one PDU
Session.
In this version of the present document, the PDU session user plane protocol
data is conveyed by GTP-U protocol means, more specifically, by means of the
\"GTP-U Container\" GTP-U Extension Header as defined in TS 29.281 [3].
# 5 PDU Session user plane protocol
## 5.1 General
The PDU session UP layer uses services of the Transport Network Layer in order
to send its packets over the interface.
## 5.2 PDU Session user plane protocol layer services
The following functions are provided by the PDU Session User Plane protocol:
\- Provision of control information elements (e.g. QFI, RQI) associated with a
PDU session.
## 5.3 Services expected from the Transport Network Layer
The PDU session UP layer expects the following services from the Transport
Network Layer:
\- Transfer of PDU session User Plane PDUs.
## 5.4 Elementary procedures
### 5.4.1 Transfer of DL PDU Session Information
#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of DL PDU Session Information procedure is to send
control information elements related to the PDU Session from UPF to NG-RAN.
In the case of uplink and downlink data forwarding the DL PDU Session
Information procedure shall be used to send control information elements
related to the PDU Session from UPF/NG-RAN to NG-RAN/UPF.
A PDU Session user plane instance making use of the Transfer of DL PDU Session
Information procedure is associated to a single PDU Session. The Transfer of
DL PDU Session Information procedure may be invoked whenever packets for that
particular PDU Session need to be transferred across the related interface
instance.
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier (QFI)
field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall use the
received QFI to determine the QoS flow and QoS profile which are associated
with the received packet.
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame shall include the Reflective QoS
Indicator (RQI) field to indicate that user plane Reflective QoS shall be
activated or not. The NG-RAN shall, if RQA has been configured for the
involved QoS flow, take the RQI into account as specified in TS 37.324 [4].
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a Paging Policy
Indicator (PPI) field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall
use the received PPI to determine the paging policy differentiation which is
associated with the received packet as described in [5].
When needed, the NG-RAN shall propagate the DL PDU Session Information to a
peer NG-RAN.

### 5.4.2 Transfer of UL PDU Session Information
#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of UL PDU Session Information procedure is to send
control information elements related to the PDU Session from NG-RAN to UPF.
An UL PDU Session user plane instance making use of the Transfer of UL PDU
Session Information procedure is associated to a single PDU Session. The
Transfer of UL PDU Session Information procedure may be invoked whenever
packets for that particular PDU Session need to be transferred across the
related interface instance.
The UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier (QFI)
field associated with the transferred packet.

## 5.5 Elements for the PDU Session user plane protocol
### 5.5.1 General
In the present document the structure of frames are specified by using figures
similar to figure 5.5.1-1.
Bits | 
> Number of Octets
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |  |   
Field 1 | Field 2 | 1 | Octet 1 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 3 | Field 4 | 2 | Octet 2 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 4 continue | Spare |  | Octet 3 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 6 | 2 | Octet 4 Octet 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 6 continue | Padding bits |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Future Extension | 0-m |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Padding | 0-3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Figure 5.5.1-1: Example frame format
Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within an
octet have the most significant bit located at the higher bit position
(indicated above frame in figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a field spans
several octets, most significant bits are located in lower numbered octets
(right of frame in figure 5.5.1-1).
On the NG interface, the frame is transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according to decreasing
bit position (bit position 7 first).
Spare bits should be set to \"0\" by the sender and should not be checked by
the receiver.
The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet aligned (by adding \'Padding Bits\' when needed).
The receiver should be able to remove an additional Future Extension field
that may be present.\ See description of Future Extension field in A.1.
Padding octets may be added at the end of the frame, see Padding in 5.5.3.5.
### 5.5.2 Frame format for the PDU Session user plane protocol
#### 5.5.2.1 DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION (PDU Type 0)
This frame format is defined to allow the NG-RAN to receive some control
information elements which are associated with the transfer of a packet over
the interface.
The following shows the respective DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame.
+---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Bits | > Number of Octets | | | | | | | | +---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | | +---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | PDU Type (=0) | Spare | 1 | | | | | | | +---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | PPP | RQI | QoS Flow Identifier | 1 | | | | | | +---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | PPI | Spare | 0 or 1 | | | | | | | +---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Padding | 0-3 | | | | | | | | +---------------+--------------------+---------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+

### 5.5.3 Coding of information elements in frames
#### 5.5.3.1 PDU Type
**Description:** The PDU Type indicates the structure of the PDU session UP
frame. The field takes the value of the PDU Type it identifies; i.e. \"0\" for
PDU Type 0. The PDU type is in bit 4 to bit 7 in the first octet of the frame.
**Value range:** {0= DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION, 1=UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION,
2-15=reserved for future PDU type extensions}.
**Field length:** 4 bits.
#### 5.5.3.2 Spare
**Description:** The spare field is set to \"0\" by the sender and should not
be interpreted by the receiver. This field is reserved for later versions.
**Value range:** (0--2^n^-1).
**Field Length:** n bits.
#### 5.5.3.3 QoS Flow Identifier (QFI)
**Description:** When present this parameter indicates the QoS Flow Identifier
of the QoS flow to which the transferred packet belongs.
**Value range:** {0..2^6^-1}.
**Field length:** 6 bits.
#### 5.5.3.4 Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI)
**Description:** This parameter indicates activation of the reflective QoS
towards the UE for the transferred packet as described in clause 5.4.1.1. It
is used only in the downlink direction. If RQA (Reflective QoS Activation) has
not been configured for the involved QoS flow, the RQI shall be ignored by the
NG-RAN node.
**Value range:** {0= Reflective QoS activation not triggered, 1= Reflective
QoS activation triggered}.
**Field length:** 1 bit.
#### 5.5.3.5 Padding
**Description:** The padding is included at the end of the frame to ensure
that the PDU Session user plane protocol PDU length (including padding and the
future extension) is (n*4-- 2) octets, where n is a positive integer. If there
is any future extension, the padding should be added after the future
extensions.
**Field Length:** 0--3 octets.
#### 5.5.3.6 Paging Policy Presence (PPP)
**Description:** This parameter indicates the presence of the Paging Policy
Indicator (PPI).
**Value range:** {0= Paging Policy Indicator not present, 1= Paging Policy
Indicator present}.
**Field length:** 1 bit.
#### 5.5.3.7 Paging Policy Indicator (PPI)
**Description:** When present, the Paging Policy Indicator is used for paging
policy differentiation (see details in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5]). This field applies
to PDU sessions of IP type.
**Value range:** {0..2^3^-1}.
**Field length:** 3 bits.

Figure A.1-1: Example of future Extension Field
In the Example of the future Extension Field, New IE flag 0 indicates if the
New IE 1 is present or not. New IE flag 1 indicates if the new IE 2 is present
or not.
## A.1.1 New IE Flags
**Description:** The _New IE Flags_ IE is only present if at least one new IE
is present. The _New IE Flags_ IE contains flags indicating which new IEs that
are present following the _New IE Flags_ IE. The last bit position of the _New
IE Flags_ IE is used as the Extension Flag to allow the extension of the _New
IE Flags_ IE in the future. Extension octets of the _New IE Flags_ IE shall
follow directly after the first octet of the _New IE Flags_ IE. When an
extension octet of the _New IE Flags_ IE is present, then all previous
extension octets of the _New IE Flags_ IE and the _New IE Flags_ IE shall also
be present, even if they have all their flag bits indicating no presence of
their respective new IEs.
