## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Fallback band combination:** A band combination that would result from
another band combination (parent band combination) by releasing at least one
SCell or uplink configuration of SCell, or SCG, or SUL. An intra-band non-
contiguous band combination is not considered to be a fallback band
combination of an intra-band contiguous band combination. A fallback band
combination supports the same channel bandwidth(s) for each carrier as its
parent band combination(s).
**Fallback per band feature set:** A feature set per band that has same or
lower capabilities than the reported capabilities from the reported feature
set per band for a given band.
**Fallback per CC feature set:** A feature set per CC that has same or lower
capabilities than the capabilities of UE (e.g. supported MIMO layers, BW,
modulation order) while keeping the numerology the same from the reported
feature set per CC for a given carrier per band.

# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
## 4.1 Supported max data rate
### 4.1.1 General
The DL and UL max data rate supported by the UE is calculated by band or band
combinations supported by the UE. A UE supporting NR (NR SA, MR-DC) shall
support the calculated DL and UL max data rate defined in 4.1.2.
### 4.1.2 Supported max data rate
For NR, the approximate data rate for a given number of aggregated carriers in
a band or band combination is computed as follows.
wherein
J is the number of aggregated component carriers in a band or band combination
R~max~ = 948/1024
For the j-th CC,
{width="0.3333333333333333in" height="0.28125in"} is the maximum number of
supported layers given by _maxNumberMIMO-LayersPDSCH_ for downlink and maximum
of _maxNumberMIMO-LayersCB-PUSCH_ and _maxNumberMIMO-LayersNonCB-PUSCH_ for
uplink.
is the maximum supported modulation order given by
_supportedModulationOrderDL_ for downlink and _supportedModulationOrderUL_ for
uplink.
is the scaling factor given by _scalingFactor_ and can take the values 1, 0.8,
0.75, and 0.4.
is the numerology (as defined in TS 38.211 [6])
is the average OFDM symbol duration in a subframe for numerology , i.e. . Note
that normal cyclic prefix is assumed.
is the maximum RB allocation in bandwidth with numerology , as defined in 5.3
TS 38.101-1 [2] and 5.3 TS 38.101-2 [3], where is the UE supported maximum
bandwidth in the given band or band combination.
is the overhead and takes the following values
> 0.14, for frequency range FR1 for DL
>
> 0.18, for frequency range FR2 for DL
>
> 0.08, for frequency range FR1 for UL
>
> 0.10, for frequency range FR2 for UL
NOTE: Only one of the UL or SUL carriers (the one with the higher data rate)
is counted for a cell operating SUL.
The approximate maximum data rate can be computed as the maximum of the
approximate data rates computed using the above formula for each of the
supported band or band combinations.
For single carrier NR SA operation, the UE shall support a data rate for the
carrier that is no smaller than the data rate computed using the above
formula, with $J = 1\ CC$ and component $v_{\text{Layers}}^{(j)} \cdot
Q_{m}^{\left( j \right)} \cdot f_{}^{\left( j \right)}$ is no smaller than 4.
NOTE: As an example, the value 4 in the component above can correspond to
$v_{\text{Layers}}^{(j)} = 1$, $Q_{m}^{\left( j \right)} = \ 4$ and
$f_{}^{\left( j \right)} = 1$.
For EUTRA in case of MR-DC, the approximate data rate for a given number of
aggregated carriers in a band or band combination is computed as follows.
> Data rate (in Mbps) = $10^{- 3}*\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\text{TB}S_{\text{j~\ }}}$
wherein
J is the number of aggregated EUTRA component carriers in MR-DC band
combination
> $\text{TB}S_{\text{j\ }}$is the total maximum number of DL-SCH transport
> block bits received or the total maximum number of UL-SCH transport block
> bits transmitted, within a 1ms TTI for j-th CC, as derived from TS36.213
> [19] based on the UE supported maximum MIMO layers for the j-th CC, and
> based on the maximum modulation order for the j-th CC and number of PRBs
> based on the bandwidth of the j-th CC according to indicated UE
> capabilities.
The approximate maximum data rate can be computed as the maximum of the
approximate data rates computed using the above formula for each of the
supported band or band combinations.
For MR-DC, the approximate maximum data rate is computed as the sum of the
approximate maximum data rates from NR and EUTRA.
### 4.1.3 Void
### 4.1.4 Total layer 2 buffer size
The total layer 2 buffer size is defined as the sum of the number of bytes
that the UE is capable of storing in the RLC transmission windows and RLC
reception and reassembly windows and also in PDCP reordering windows for all
radio bearers.
The required total layer 2 buffer size in MR-DC is the maximum value of the
calculated values based on the following equations:
\- _MaxULDataRate_MN_ * _RLCRTT_MN_ \+ _MaxULDataRate_SN_ * _RLCRTT_SN_ \+
_MaxDLDataRate_SN_ * _RLCRTT_SN_ \+ _MaxDLDataRate_MN_ _*_ (_RLCRTT_SN_ \+
_X2/Xn delay_ \+ _Queuing in SN_)
\- _MaxULDataRate_MN_ * _RLCRTT_MN_ \+ _MaxULDataRate_SN_ * _RLCRTT_SN_ \+
_MaxDLDataRate_MN_ * _RLCRTT_MN_ \+ _MaxDLDataRate_SN_ _*_ (_RLCRTT_MN_ \+
_X2/Xn delay_ \+ _Queuing in MN_)
Otherwise it is calculated by _MaxDLDataRate * RLC RTT + MaxULDataRate * RLC
RTT_.
NOTE: Additional L2 buffer required for preprocessing of data is not taken
into account in above formula.
The required total layer 2 buffer size is determined as the maximum total
layer 2 buffer size of all the calculated ones for each band combination and
the applicable Feature Set combination in the supported MR-DC or NR band
combinations. The RLC RTT for NR cell group corresponds to the smallest SCS
numerology supported in the band combination and the applicable Feature Set
combination.
wherein
> X2/Xn delay + Queuing in SN = 25ms if SCG is NR, and 55ms if SCG is EUTRA
>
> X2/Xn delay + Queuing in MN = 25ms if MCG is NR, and 55ms if MCG is EUTRA
>
> RLC RTT for EUTRA cell group = 75ms
>
> RLC RTT for NR cell group is defined in Table 4.1.4-1

## 4.2 UE Capability Parameters
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The following clauses define the UE radio access capability parameters. Only
parameters for which there is the possibility for UEs to signal different
values are considered as UE radio access capability parameters. Therefore,
mandatory features without capability parameters that are the same for all UEs
are not listed here.
The network needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability
parameters when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.
The UE may support different functionalities between FDD and TDD, and/or
between FR1 and FR2. The UE shall indicate the UE capabilities as follows. In
the table of UE capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Yes\" in the
column by \"FDD-TDD DIFF\" and \"FR1-FR2 DIFF\" indicates the UE capability
field can have a different value for between FDD and TDD or between FR1 and
FR2 and \"No\" indicates if it cannot. Regarding to the per UE capabilities
that are FDD/TDD differentiated (i.e. capabilities indicated as \"Yes\" in the
column by \"FDD-TDD DIFF\"), the corresponding capabilities indicated by the
FDD capability is applied to SUL if SUL band is supported by the UE. \"FD\" in
the column indicates to refer the associated field description. \"FR1 only\"
or \"FR2 only\" in the column indicates the associated feature is only
supported in FR1 or FR2 and \"TDD only\" indicates the associated feature is
only supported in TDD and not applicable to SUL carriers. \"N/A\" in the
column indicates it is not applicable to the feature (e,g. the signalling
supports the UE to have different values between FDD and TDD or between FR1
and FR2).
1> set all fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability except fdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-
Capabilities, tdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities, fr1-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities
and fr2-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities, to include the values applicable for all
duplex mode(s) and frequency range(s) that the UE supports;
1> if UE supports both FDD (or SUL) and TDD and if (some of) the UE capability
fields have a different value for FDD (or SUL) and TDD
2> if for FDD (and, if the UE supports SUL, for SUL), the UE supports
additional functionality compared to what is indicated by the previous fields
of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:
3> include field fdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include fields
reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FDD;
2> if for TDD, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is
indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:
3> include field tdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include fields
reflecting the additional functionality applicable for TDD;
1> if UE supports both FR1 and FR2 and if (some of) the UE capability fields
have a different value for FR1 and FR2:
2> if for FR1, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is
indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:
3> include field fr1-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include fields
reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FR1;
2> if for FR2, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is
indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:
3> include field fr2-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include fields
reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FR2;
NOTE 1: The fields which indicate \"shall be set to 1\" or \"shall be set to
_supported_ \" in the following tables means these features are purely
mandatory and are assumed they are the same as mandatory without capability
signalling.
NOTE 2: For the case where the UE is allowed to support different
functionality between FDD and TDD and between FR1 and FR2 according to the
specification, the UE capability indication is clarified in Annex B.
For optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter indicates
whether the feature has been implemented and successfully tested. For
mandatory features with the UE radio access capability parameter, the
parameter indicates whether the feature has been successfully tested. In the
table of UE capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Yes\" in the column
by \"M\" indicates the associated feature is mandatory and \"No\" indicates
the associated feature is optional. \"CY\" in the column indicates the
associated feature is conditional mandatory and the condition is described in
the field description and the associated feature is considered mandatory with
capability parameter, when the described condition is satisfied. \"FD\" in the
column indicates to refer the associated field description. Some parameters in
subsequent clauses are not related to UE features and in the case, \"N/A\" is
indicated in the column.
UE capability parameters have hierarchical structure. In the table of UE
capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Per\" indicates the level the
associated parameter is included. \"UE\" in the column indicates the
associated parameter is signalled per UE, \"Band\" indicates it is signalled
per band, \"BC\" indicates it is signalled per band combination, \"FS\"
indicates it is signalled per feature set (per band per band combination),
\"FSPC\" indicates it is signalled per feature set per component carrier (per
CC per band per band combination), and \"FD\" in the column indicates to refer
the associated field description.
