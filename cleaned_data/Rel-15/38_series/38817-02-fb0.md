incident on an AAS BS _antenna array_
**basic limit:** emissions limit from a single transceiver unit of the non-AAS
BS type, used for the formulation of the unwanted emissions and output power

# 4 General and common aspects
The general and common aspects for BS RF and UE RF for NR are in clause 4 of
3GPP TS 38.817-01 [20].
# 5 General BS RF aspects
## 5.1 Relationship with other core specifications
The following relations among the single RAT NR BS core specification and the
MSR BS, AAS BS and EMC specifications are identified:
**RAT NR BS:** 3GPP TS 38.104 [3] is a Single RAT NR BS specification. It is
expected to capture BS requirements for the following aspects:
\- Tx, Rx and BS demodulation core requirements for NR BS,
\- Conducted and radiated sets of core requirements for the above listed
categories (i.e. Tx, Rx and BS demodulation),
\- Requirements for NSA NR and SA NR deployments (with the consideration of
the NSA/SA prioritization in Rel-15),
\- Requirements for FR1 and FR2 frequency ranges, based on the classification
defined in 3GPP TR 38.803 [24]:
\- FR1: Both conducted and OTA requirements will be required for FR1. The
applicability may depend on the requirements.
\- Requirement set 1-C: Conducted requirements for FR1 Non-AAS BS (which
doesn't include antenna functionality).
\- Requirement set 1-H: Conducted requirements and OTA requirements for FR1
hybrid AAS BS (which includes antenna functionality).
\- Requirement set 1-O: OTA requirements for FR1 OTA AAS BS (which includes
antenna functionality).
\- FR2: Only OTA requirements will be required for FR2.
\- Requirement set 2-O: OTA requirements for FR2 OTA AAS BS.
**MSR BS:** The MSR BS specification in 3GPP TS 37.104 [19] will be updated in
Rel-15 for capability sets of Single RAT NR BS and LTE+NR MSR BS.
\- It shall be noted that the MSR BS specification is considered as non-AAS
specification, defining conducted requirements.
**AAS BS:** The AAS BS specification in 3GPP TS 37.105 [7] will be updated in
Rel-15 for capability sets of Single RAT NR BS and LTE+NR MSR BS. In Rel-15,
the AAS BS specification is expected to be extended with the full set of OTA
requirements.
**EMC:** New EMC specification for the NR BS will be defined in 3GPP TS
38.113.
\- The NR BS EMC specification will reuse the eAAS WI work on the EMC
requirements for the OTA AAS BS, i.e. EMC testing of DUT's with radiating
antenna elements.
\- It shall be noted, that each of the EMC specifications for Single RAT
refers to the MSR EMC specification in 3GPP TS 37.113 [23] for the additional
optional applicability of the MSR EMC requirements.
\- NR BS EMC specification shall also consider additional optional conformance
requirements in the extended Relâ€‘15 version of the MSR EMC specification in
3GPP TS 37.113 [23].
Furthermore, relations among conformance BS specifications are identified as
follows:
**Single RAT NR BS:** New conformance specifications in 3GPP TS 38.141-1 and
in 3GPP TS 38.141-2 for the NR BS conformance for conducted and radiated
testing will be defined, respectively,
**MSR BS:** 3GPP TS 37.141 [32] MSR BS conformance testing specification will
be updated with the NR RAT.
**AAS BS:** AAS BS conformance testing specifications in 3GPP TS 37.145-1 [33]
and 3GPP TS 37.145-2 [34] will be updated based on the AAS BS core
specification modifications.
## 5.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
While 3GPP TS 38.104 [3] describes conducted and OTA core requirements, the
conformance to the requirements is demonstrated by fulfilling the test
requirements specified in the conformance specification 3GPP TS 38.141-1 [17]
for conducted testing and 3GPP TS 38.141-2 [18] for radiated testing. An
allowance for measurement uncertainty through application of test tolerances
is used to create the conformance test requirements using the shared risk
principle.
This is explained through clause 4.2 in 3GPP TS 38.104 [3], in a way aligned
with the specifications for E-UTRA in 3GPP TS 36.104 [6] and for AAS BS in
3GPP TS 37.105 [7]. The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation
ITUâ€‘R M.1545 [12].
For selected requirements, conducted FR1 requirements and FR1 OTA requirements
are derived from the same limit, leading to the same core requirement values
in 3GPP TS 38.104 [3]. Test tolerances associated with conducted and OTA
testing may differ. In practice, this means that the test requirement value
for a conducted requirement and an analogous OTA requirement may differ, even
if both requirements have been derived from the same limit.
## 5.3 General BS architectures
### 5.3.1 Background
For E-UTRA all BS specifications are in frequency range 1, historically
requirements applied to the antenna connector of a single transceiver and were
all conducted.
Evolution of the AAS initially led to the AAS specification which had both a
conducted interface and an OTA interface, this was then enhanced to provide an
OTA only set of requirements, this has led to 2 types of AAS and corresponding
requirement sets. The hybrid AAS BS which has both a conducted and a radiated
interface and the OTA AAS BS which has only a radiated interface.
The work on the AAS BS lead for the need to refer to the original BS
specifications with a unique term, the term non-AAS was adopted and whilst it
is not ideal to refer to something by what it is not, there has been no more
appropriate alternative has been found so the term non-AAS has stuck.
There are 2 major differences between the non-AAS and the AAS architectures
and requirement sets
1\. The AAS BS refers to a system of many transceiver units and the
requirements are related to the sum of all the transceiver units. Non-AAS
specifications refer to only a single Transceiver
2\. The AAS BS has the antenna included as part of the architecture and has a
radiated interface.
The intention of the AAS BS specification was to maintain the same levels of
protection and performance as an equivalent non-AAS system with the same
number of transceiver units. As it is possible for an AAS to have a very large
number of transceiver units whereas practical non-AAS installations are likely
to have only as many transceivers as there are MIMO channels available (8 for
E-UTRA), hence AAS emission (wanted and unwanted) are capped at the equivalent
of 8 transceivers no matter how many transceiver units they have.
An E-UTRA AAS does not have to have mandatory beam forming, hence all OTA
requirements which involve assumptions on antenna gain are designed so they
can be met with a passive antenna gain with the same coverage area.
NR range 1 has the same 3 BS types as E-UTRA, in addition there is NR range 2
which is OTA only due to the high frequency. In addition, a certain level of
beam forming is required for range 2 BS so the relationship between coverage
range and antenna gain is not the same as in range 1.
### 5.3.2 General
There are 4 distinct types of NR BS each has a different architecture and
requirements set corresponding to Table 5.3.2â€‘1
Table 5.3.2-1: Supported requirement sets
BS type / Requirement set BS Description Additional information
* * *
1-C A BS operating at FR1 with all requirements defined at individual antenna
connectors. Following the approach used in 3GPP TS 36.104 and 3GPP TS 37.104
[19] 1-H A BS operating at FR1 with a requirement set holding requirements
defined at the TAB and OTA requirements defined at RIB. The requirement set is
like the one defined for Hybrid AAS BS. Following the approach used in 3GPP TS
37.105 [7] 1-O A BS operating at FR1 with a requirement set consisting only
OTA requirements defined at the RIB. Following the approach developed in eAAS
and documented in 3GPP TR 37.843 [9]. 2-O A BS operating at FR2 with a
requirement set consisting only of OTA requirements defined at the RIB. This
requirement set is relevant for AAS BS and does not require access to RF
connectors.
### 5.3.3 BS type 1-C
BS type 1-C requirements are applied at the BS antenna connector (port A) for
a single transmitter or receiver with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as an amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
Figure 5.3.3-1: 1-C BS Transmitter interface
Figure 5.3.3-2: 1-C BS Receiver interface
### 5.3.4 BS type 1-H
The BS type 1-H the radio architecture is represented by three main functional
blocks, the _transceiver unit array_ (TRXUA), the _radio distribution network_
(RDN), and the _antenna array_ (AA). The _transceiver units_ (TRXU) interface
with the base band processing within the AAS BS.
The TRXUA consists of multiple transmitter units (TXU) and receiver units
(RXUs). The TXU takes the baseband input from the AAS BS and provides the RF
TX outputs. The RF TX outputs are distributed to the AA via a RDN. The RXU
performs the reverse of the TXU operations. The RDN performs the distribution
of the TX outputs into the corresponding antenna paths and antenna elements,
and a distribution of RX inputs from antenna paths in the reverse direction.
The TXU and RXU can be separated and can have different mapping through the
RDN towards the AA.
The transceiver array boundary (TAB) is the point or points at which the TRXUA
is connected to the RDN. The point where a TXU or RXU connects with the RDN is
called \"Transceiver Array Boundary connector\" (_TAB connector_). The _TAB
connector_ is defined as conducted requirement reference point. The
transmitted signal per carrier from one Transmitter Unit appear at one or more
_TAB connector(s)_ and the received signals per carrier from one or more _TAB
connector(s)_ appear at a single RXU.
Figure 5.3.4-1 shows a general architecture of a _BS type 1-H_ radio
architecture, where M is the total number of _transceiver units_ and K is the
total number of _TAB connectors_ at the transceiver array boundary.
NOTE 1: The RDN may consist of a simple one to one mapping between the
TXU(s)/RXU(s) and the passive _antenna array_. In this case, the RDN would be
a logical entity but not necessarily a physical entity.
NOTE 2: The _antenna array_ includes various implementations and
configurations e.g. polarization, array geometry (including element factor and
element separation), etc.
**NOTE 3:** The physical location of the TRXUA, the RDN, and the AA may differ
from this logical representation and is implementation dependent.
NOTE 4: No specific mapping in the RDN between _TAB connectors_ and antenna
elements is assumed. Further the number of separate receiver and transmitter
units as well as the mapping in the RDN between _TAB connectors_ and radiating
elements can differ between the transmit and receive directions. The _BS type
1-H_ reference architecture allows for full asymmetry between receiver path
and transmit path.
NOTE 5: For BS type 1-H capable of supporting applications employing
beamforming, all or subgroups of _TAB connectors_ can be configured with
designated amplitude and phase weights such that one or more beams are
radiated from the _antenna array_.
NOTE 6: If the TR text and figure 5.3.4-1 contradict each other, then the TR
text applies.
NOTE 7: The fixed scaling factor of 8 is based on the maximum number of
layers/streams specified in release 12 of 3GPP E-UTRA specifications. The
scaling function may be further reconsidered for future releases if the
maximum number of layers/streams supported in NR is changed.

### 5.3.5 BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O
BS type 1-O and 2-O BS requirement are applied in the far field at the
radiated interface boundary.
The _OTA BS_ types have no transceiver array boundary or _TAB connectors_
defined as they have no conducted requirements.
Figure 5.3.5-1 shows a general architecture of _OTA BS_ , where P is the total
number of _transceiver units_ and P â‰¥ 8.
NOTE 1: If a BS type 1-O is declared to support more than 1 cell (_N~cells~_
>1) the total number of transceiver units must be greater than 8* _N~cells~_.
NOTE 2: The fixed scaling factor of 8 is based on the maximum number of
layers/streams specified in release 12 of 3GPP E-UTRA specifications. The
scaling function may be further reconsidered for future releases if the
maximum number of layers/streams supported in NR is changed.

## 5.4 Base station classes
The requirements for NR BS apply to Wide Area Base Stations, Medium Range Base
Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise stated. The associated
deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for BS with and
without antenna connectors or _TAB connectors_.
NR BS classes for BS type 1-C and 1-H are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
NR BS classes for BS type 1-O and 2-O are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 5 m.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to
2 m.
## 5.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements for NR in 3GPP TS 38.104 [3] may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by
local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP
specifications under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply,
since this is defined by local or regional regulation.
A list of such requirements is provided in clause 4.5 of 3GPP TS 38.104 [3].

## 5.7 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum are well defined in
existing single-RAT and MSR specifications. Both contiguous and non-contiguous
operation has been requested in various NR-LTE CA/DC combinations and is
considered to be completed within Rel-15 timeframe.
The text to Technical Specification for requirements for contiguous and non-
contiguous spectrum Clause is as follows:
A spectrum allocation where an BS operates can either be contiguous or non-
contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum operation
and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply both at
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block gaps. For each
such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges respectively.
## 5.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
Multi-band band operation concept is well defined in existing single-RAT and
MSR specifications. The most important feature of multi-band BS is to support
dynamic power sharing between different bands and hence allow operators more
flexibility in the network deployment. From the site engineering point of
view, multi-band BS can reduce installation complexity for different bands at
the same site. Furthermore, multi-band BS can reduce insertion loss for the
antenna sharing multi-band scenario since no combiner is needed.
Multi-band operation for _BS type 1-C_ , _BS type 1-H_ and _BS type 1-O_ is
included in Rel-15 NR specifications.
## 5.9 Basic limits and scaling of emissions
For conducted Tx unwanted emissions requirements on ACLR, spectrum emission
mask, operating band unwanted emissions and transmitter spurious emissions in
clause 6 (and for conducted Rx spurious emissions requirement in clause 7), as
well as for the BS output power requirement, the following sub-clauses apply:
_6.x.y Conducted requirement A_
_6.x.y.1 Basic limits_
Table with basic limits for NR BS in FR1.
_6.x.y.2 non-AAS requirement A_
Minimum conducted requirement for 1-C type NR BS in FR1 is defined as basic
limit, i.e. no scaling and no antenna considered.
Minimum 1-C requirement [dBm] = basic limit
Where:
\- basic limit is defined in 6.x.y.1
_6.x.y.3 AAS requirement A_
Minimum conducted requirement for 1-H type NR BS in FR1 is defined based on
basic limit with the emissions scaling applied, i.e. basic limit is scaled up
to an AAS BS requirement according to the number of _active transceiver
units_.
Minimum 1-H requirement [dBm] = basic limit + 10*log~10~(N)
Where:
\- basic limit is defined in 6.x.y.1
\- Scaling factor N â‰¤ 8
For operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in [FCC
publication number 662911] is applicable, N shall be equal to 1 for the
purposes of calculating the spurious emissions limits. For all other unwanted
emissions requirements, N value shall be according to the number of active
transmitters per cell. Note, that such limitation of the applicability of the
emissions scaling will be reflected in 3GPP TS 38.104 [3].
_9.x.y Radiated requirement A_
_9.x.y.1 AAS requirement A_
Minimum radiated requirement for 1-O NR BS in FR1 is defined based on basic
limit with the emissions scaling applied, i.e. basic limit is scaled up to an
AAS BS requirement according to the number of _active transceiver units_.
Minimum 1-O requirement [dBm] = basic limit + 10*log~10~(N)
Where:
\- basic limit is defined in 6.x.y.1
\- Scaling factor N is fixed to 8
Therefore the resulting OTA limit can be derived as:
Minimum 1-O requirement [dBm] = basic limit + 9 dB
For operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in [FCC
publication number 662911] is applicable, N shall be equal to 1 for the
purposes of calculating the spurious emissions limits. For all other unwanted
emissions requirements, N value shall be according to the number of active
transmitters per cell. Note, that such limitation of the applicability of the
emissions scaling will be reflected in 3GPP TS 38.104 [3].
## 5.10 In-band and out-of-band boundaries for FR1
Agreements of the boundary between OBUE and spurious emissions are summarized
in tables 5.10-1 and 5.10-2. The boundary is valid regardless of whether it is
single-RAT case or MSR case, and NR new band or refarming band (except Band
46). If wider band(s) than current maximum bandwidth is specified (i.e. wider
than 900MHz for NR), the values of the boundary should be discussed.
Table 5.10-1: Î”f~OBUE~ (NR single-RAT case)
+------------------+------------------+------------------+--------+ | Applicable | 3GPP TS 38.104 | 3GPP TS 38.104 | | | specification | | | | | | 3GPP TS 38.141-1 | 3GPP TS 38.141-1 | | | | | | | | | | 3GPP TS 38.141-2 | | +==================+==================+==================+========+ | Applicable BS | BS type 1-C | BS type 1-H | | | type | | | | | | | BS type 1-O | | +------------------+------------------+------------------+--------+ | Î”f~OBUE~ | F~DL_high~ -- | 10 MHz | 10 MHz | | | F~DL_low~ \24GHz high
BW system would likely be implemented as separate receiver paths without any
strict dependencies since very different receiver characteristics.
Similar for the transmitter, the UE can be implemented with independent paths
or dependent paths as also shown in [21].
It is also important that CA now is a mature implemented technology in LTE and
much knowledge have been gain over the years, potential UE implementation
restrictions in the early days when introducing CA might not be applicable
anymore and therefore not necessarily inherited as restrictions also in NR.
Implementation assumptions about the UE must be made to understand its MRTD
requirements and UEs can be implemented without any strict dependencies (i.e.
no strict requirement for MRTD) which would give better service availability.
##### 6.5.3.2.3 Deployment scenarios
As stated in the beginning the TAE at the UE depends of the differences in
signal arrival time at the UE due to difference in distance between the
transmission point and the UE (Î”T~prop~) which depends of the deployment
scenarios as shown in Figure 6.5.3.2.3-1.
{width="5.215277777777778in" height="2.2708333333333335in"}
Figure 6.5.3.2.3-1 Deployment scenarios
To the left in Figure 6.5.3.2.3-1 an intra base station deployment is shown
and this is normally where the strict base station synchronization
requirements can be met since close to a common timing source.
300m corresponds to approximately 1us RF propagation delay, as shown in the
right part of Figure 6.5.3.2.3-1 a separation of the base station transmission
points (different Radio Units connected to a common Digital Unit) will give a
difference in signal arrival time at the UE.
In addition, dependent radio channel condition (depends on frequency bands and
environment) there will also be a Î”T~channel~ component that adds to the total
TAE at the UE.
This means that potential UE architecture requirements specified as a fraction
of the CP e.g. based on a common FFT and will be intra site with co-located
antenna transmission points. It is also worth noting, separating the
transmission points will put strict requirements on the interfaces towards a
common aggregation node at the MAC layer.
To allow for distributed and separated transmission points in CA (e.g.
heterogenous deployments with (different Radio Units connected to a common
Digital Unit) the UE cannot be designed to have strict TAE requirement since
Î”T~prop~ quickly will be the dominating part of the complete TAE budget. It is
either not desirable to only allow for short Î”T~prop~ since it will seriously
limit the availability of the service and where it can be provided.
##### 6.5.3.2.4 Intra band contiguous CA
To understand requirements for NR it is beneficial to first understand
existing requirements in LTE since there will be dependencies in various
forms.
If we then consider the intra band contiguous CA in LTE with a TAE requirement
of 130ns at the UE, it is then clear that this can only be met as an intra
base station requirement with the transmission points close to each other.
This since a propagation difference of 39m would correspond to a Î”T~prop~
=130ns (leaving unrealistically Î”T~sync~ = Î”T~channel~ =0ns) or making the
service unpractical since limit it to certain small areas where symmetric
propagation delays are fulfilled.
The 130 ns LTE intra band contiguous CA requirement is strict and only \~ 2.5%
of the LTE CP. Compared to CoMP and MBSFN the CA requirement is much stricter,
hence it should not be used unconditionally as a base for scaling NR without
new simulations, as an example keeping 130ns would still only correspond to
\~10% of the CP for 60kHz numerology and 20% for the 120kHz numerology.
The main technical motivation for strict TAE requirements in NR would be the
possibility to use a single FFT in the UE, that is Option A in Figure
6.5.3.2.2-2. However, as we will see in subsequent clauses, 2.4 and 2.5, CA
non-contiguous intra band and CA inter band has allowed non-colocated Radio
Units with a Î”T~prop~ requirement of 30 Âµs for the relative time of arrival
difference for LTE. It is fair to assume that NR CA non-contiguous intra band
and NR CA inter band will have similar requirements, to allow non-colocated
Radio Units connected to a common gNB Base Band Unit. This will drive UE
architecture B with multiple FFT to be implemented for NR CA non-contiguous
intra band and NR CA inter band. The same thing can be said about Dual
Connectivity (DC) feature. DC is non-colocated for most cases and has to
handle different SCS between carriers. The non-colocated nature of DC feature
as well as the need to support different SCS for different carriers drives the
need to have separate FFT in UE implemented. One may conclude that multiple
FFT will be implemented for other CA variants (non-contiguous intra band and
interband) and other features (DC). A UE architecture B with multiple FFT also
for contiguous NR CA would also be more flexible when it comes to different
SCS for NR contiguously aggregated carriers, in case of different latency
needs or different BWP TAE requirements can be relaxed for the case of
separate FFT in UE.
Existing LTE intra band contiguous CA TAE requirement of 130 ns is an intra
base station requirement.
The LTE 130 ns intra band contiguous CA requirement is very strict since only
\~ 2.5% of the CP. It should not just be used unconditionally as a base for
scaling NR without new simulations proving actual need, as an example keeping
130ns would still only correspond to \~10% of the CP for 60kHz numerology and
20% for the 120kHz numerology
Main motivation for strict TAE is the possibility to use common FFT, but that
multiple FFT will be implemented for other CA variants (non-contiguous intra
band and interband) and other features (DC). TAE requirements can be relaxed
for the case of separate FFT in UE.
##### 6.5.3.2.5 Intra band non-contiguous CA
From [21] existing relative base station synchronization requirement is 260 ns
however in [22] the TAE requirements at the UE receiver is 30.260 us. The
chosen 30 us is dedicated for the Î”T~prop~ and corresponds to a relative
difference of 9km from the transmission points, and then it does not relate to
the CP. The requirements require an ideal interface towards common aggregation
node.
The 260 ns of the total 30.26 us corresponds to only 0.85% and cannot be
considered as a well-balanced requirement.
Marginally increasing the TAE error at the UE e.g. to 33 us (i.e. same as for
DC) would allow for a less strict synchronization requirement (T~sync~ = 3 us)
and hence allow for more flexible deployments. Alternative keeping the UE
30.26 us TAE requirement and decreasing the relative propagation difference to
8.2 km instead of 9 km would also allow for T~sync~ = 3 us.
Worth noting, intra band between two > 24 GHz systems with its smaller cell
sizes, a need for 9 km propagation difference would not be reasonable.
The condition with a max propagation difference â‰¤ 9 km will not be needed for
e.g. intra band CA > 24 GHz.
From TS 38.133 [31], in Release 15 only co-located deployment is applied for
intra-band CA. And RAN4 made the further agreement that intra-band non-
contiguous CA TAE requirements in FR1 and FR2 are aligned with intra-band non-
contiguous CA MRTD requirements for FR1 and FR2 in TS 38.133 [31].
##### 6.5.3.2.6 Inter band CA
From 3GPP TS 38.104 [3] the existing relative base station synchronization
requirement is 260ns however in [22] the TAE requirements at the UE receiver
is 30.260 us and hence same as for intra band non-contiguous CA and everything
valid in previous clause are also valid here.
3GPP 36.300 Annex J contains CA deployment scenarios.
For both intra non-contiguous and inter band CA the base station LTE
requirement of 260 ns is not a well-balanced requirement since only \~0.85% of
total budget.
For both intra and inter band non-contiguous CA, marginally increasing the LTE
MRTD error at the UE would allow for a less strict synchronization requirement
or allocating slightly reduced max propagation difference would reduce the
synchronization requirement and allow for more flexible deployments.
##### 6.5.3.2.7 Other dependencies
There could be other intra/inter RAT dependencies and e.g. for CA sometimes
minimizing overhead for UE measurement gaps is mentioned. However, for that
specific scenario it can be show that e.g. using 33us instead of specified
30.26us would have a very small impact.
Even if an early NR design principle has been to avoid strict timing
relations, potential cross dependencies must be analyzed to get the complete
picture of potential timing dependencies.
For a full analysis, potential new NR inter/intra RAT CC cross dependencies
must be analyzed to get the complete picture of potential timing dependencies.
##### 6.5.3.2.8 Conclusion
Requirements for TAE cannot be set isolated at the base stations since will
lead to wrong or unbalanced requirements as sometimes seen in the past. The
TAE at the base station is just one part of a total budget while in the end,
it is the MRTD at the UE that matters. Different UE architectures options will
impose different requirements.
If requirements at the UE are set too strict it will reduce deployment
flexibility, limit area where the UE can be served (small Î”T~prop~) and drive
cost for synchronization**.**
Main motivation for strict TAE is the possibility to use common FFT, but that
multiple FFT will be implemented for other CA variants (non-contiguous intra
band and inter band) and other features (DC). TAE requirements can be relaxed
for the case of separate FFT in UE.
### 6.5.4 Modulation Quality
#### 6.5.4.1 General
The modulation quality requirement is defined by the difference between the
measured carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can be
expressed Error Vector Magnitude (EVM).
The core requirement for the conducted modulation quality for FR1 requirement
will be reused from conducted modulation quality requirement from 3GPP TS
37.104 [7] specification. Although some aspects, such as the requirement level
is reused other aspects such as EVM window and equalization algorithms will
need to differ to suit NR aspects such as spectrum utilization, reference
signal structure, and numerologies. The requirements apply per _TAB
connector_.
A DM-RS pattern will be transmitted, and a standardized receiver will be used
to mitigate some linear aspects of the EVM. With the removal of Common
Reference Signals (CRS) present in LTE and the new design of demodulation
reference signals (DM-RS) the specifics of pattern configurations are needed
to be considered as part of the overall requirement conditions. The overall
link performance was studied in a fading channel and also in an AWGN channel
for different DM-RS pattern designs. In fading channels during operation (as
opposed to just test operation), the simulations showed that a minimum DM-RS
density configuration of comb 2 (every other subcarrier) in symbols 3 and 11
would be required to achieve similar performance with CRS in LTE.

In the following clauses, background on the EVM measurement is introduced in
detail.
#### 6.5.4.2 Example N~RB~ values
For NR specification, it is agreed to use 100 MHz channel bandwidth with 30
kHz SCS for FR1 as example case.
#### 6.5.4.3 RSTP and OSTP
The RS TX power (RSTP) is mainly used for testing the DL RS power accuracy
requirement as specified for UTRA and E-UTRA system, however for NR
specification, DL RS power accuracy requirement is not specified.
The OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) is required for testing total power dynamic
range. In the TS 36.141 [27] specification, the RETP and OSTP is defined as
following with considerations on the supported SCS.
$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\Delta f$$
where $\Delta f$ is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.
In the TS 36.141 [27] specification, from RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP)
is derived as follows:
For NR system, the 4^th^ symbol is used to explicitly indicate which OFDM
symbols should be used for single RB power measurement and whole RB power
measurement.
From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:
$$\text{OSTP} = \sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$
Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$ RETP
values of the 4^th^ OFDM symbol. The 4^th^ (out of 14 OFDM symbols within a
slot in case of normal CP length) contains exclusively PDSCH.
$N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}} = 12$
#### 6.6.7.4 TDD EVM measurements
Moving average length 19 from E-UTRA specification is to be used for FR1 in
NR.
#### 6.6.7.5 EVM window
For the configurations, the example case for FR1 is 100 MHz channel bandwidth
with 30 kHz SCS, then sampling rate should be 122.88 Msps, therefore is 1 and
is 64 for Tc (1/480kHz * 4096).
is on T~f~=144 () within the CP of length 288 () (in OFDM symbol or ).
is on T~f~=208 () within the CP of length 352 () (in OFDM symbol or ).
## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
### 6.6.1 General
An overview of unwanted emissions and the relation and frequency boundary
between the OBUE and spurious emissions is given in clause 6.6.1 of 3GPP TS
38.104 [3].
### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth (FR1)
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage Î²/2 (=0.5%) of the total mean transmitted
power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328.
It was agreed that the same principle with existing E-UTRA (99% power should
be within BS channel bandwidth can be reused, and the minimum requirement for
FR1 occupied bandwidth shall be less than the BS channel bandwidth supported
by NR.
Furthermore, the minimum requirement may be applied regionally.
### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)
The following have been agreed for conducted ACLR requirement in FR1:
\- Adopt the E-UTRA BS (45dB) ACLR1 and ACLR2 to all NR BS classes.
\- Adopt each E-UTRA BS absolute limit to the corresponding NR BS class,
whichever is less stringent compared to the ACLR.
\- The same channel bandwidth with wanted signal can be assumed as the
adjacent channel bandwidth.
\- Transmission bandwidth configuration of wanted channel (it would differ
depend on subcarrier spacing and/or BS channel bandwidth) should be used as a
measurement bandwidth for wanted signal power measurement.
\- Maximum transmission bandwidth configuration of the BS channel bandwidth
(between subcarrier spacing) specified in Release 15 should be used as a
measurement bandwidth for adjacent channel power measurement, i.e. the
measurement bandwidth should also apply to future releases regardless of
whether new SU is introduced or not.
\- For bands defined also for E-UTRA or UTRA:
\- Specify BS 45 dB ACLR conducted requirement for 5MHz adjacent channel
bandwidth.
\- The same measurement bandwidth is used for adjacent channel power
measurement with existing E-UTRA specification.
\- Not to specify against other E-UTRA channel bandwidth than 5MHz.
\- No need to specify ACLR against UTRA in core specification since it is
already covered by ACLR against E-UTRA case.
Based on above agreements, the ACLR requirement is specified in Table
6.6.3.2-1of 3GPP TS 38.104 [3].
The following have been agreed for conducted CACLR requirement in FR1:
\- Adopt the E-UTRA BS relative (45dBc) and absolute (for each BS class) CACLR
limits for NR BS.
\- Only specify CACLR against NR in core specification.
\- Apply the 5 MHz adjacent channel carrier to NR channel bandwidth â‰¤20 MHz
and the 20 MHz adjacent channel carrier to NR channel bandwidth >20 MHz.
> \- Apply different gap sizes for different combinations of NR channel
> bandwidth (â‰¤20 or >20 MHz) at the edges of the gap, as shown in figures
> 6.6.3-1 to 6.6.3-8.

multiple bands is specified in Table 6.6.3.2-2a of 3GPP TS 38.104 [3].
### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions
A set of band-centric masks are defined for NR in Frequency Range 1, based on
the same principles as for LTE. Details of the masks are as follows:
\- The UEM should be defined up to an offset Î”f~OBUE~ from the band edge,
where Î”f~OBUE~ = 40 MHz for NR bands equal to and wider than 100 MHz. This
serves as a baseline for the boundary between UEM and spurious emission for
both Category A and Category B spurious emission limits.
\- The emission levels for the UEM will be the same as for LTE (5 MHz and
larger channel BW) in the full frequency range (F~DL~_low-- Î”f~OBUE~) \~
(F~DL~_high+Î”f~OBUE~).
\- The same UEM tables will be used for the different Î”f~UEM~. For Category B
spurious emissions, the limits will be taken from LTE Category B Option 1.
\- The following variations for the Unwanted Emissions Mask (UEM) tables
should be used for sub-6 GHz:
\-- BS classes
\-- Category of emission (A/B)
\-- Frequency range (above/below 1 GHz)
\-- Power levels (for some BS classes)
The value of Î”f~OBUE~ determines the extent of the mask outside the operating
band, but it also defines the spurious emissions requirements. It is a
parameter that will vary between bands and is therefore best documented in a
table, listing its value for different bands. Since it is common to spurious
emissions and UEM requirements, the table should be placed in the general
clause of Unwanted emissions (6.6.1).
Specification of UEM relies on a few common parameters defining the frequency
offset. These can largely be re-used from LTE:
\- Since the limits will be the same as for LTE, we also need to consider re-
using the concept of two definitions of offset from the channel edge: Î”f
defining offset to the edge of the measurement filter and f_offset defining
the offset to the centre of the filter. Both should be kept, since the
difference (half the measurement bandwidth) is not negligible.
\- Keeping both Î”f and f_offset, we also need to define two maximum values
setting the maximum offset to which the UEM extends: âˆ†f~max~ and
f_offset~max~.
\- For LTE, the UEM is in general extended to Î”f~OBUE~ = 10 MHz beyond the
operating band edges. This will now be out to Î”f~OBUE~ = 40 MHz for some
bands.
For Wide Area BS, the UEM level in the spurious domain is aligned with ITU-R
recommendation SM.329. Consequently, there is a need to distinguish between
Category A and B emission limits and also between frequencies below and above
1 GHz, since they have different limits and/or measurement bandwidths. For
this reason, Category A and B should be in separate clauses:
**Wide Area BS, Category A (clause)**
Table: Category A (\ \- One mask for 24.25 -- 33.4 GHz, based on ACLR = 28 dBc.
>
> \- One mask for 37 -- 52.6 GHz, based on ACLR = 26 dBc.
\- Masks are limited to an absolute lowest emission limit of -20 dBm as in the
WP5D LS response [10]
The masks cover the frequency ranges within the present scope of the work
item. It is specified in Table 9.7.4.3.2-1 to Table 9.7.4.3.2-2 of 3GPP TS
38.104 [3].
The BS power level used to distinguish and derive the FR2 OTA OBUE mask is
agreed as **rated total TRP output power (** P~rated,t,TRP~)**, which is**
mean power level that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the RIB
during the _transmitter ON period. Furthermore, it is consensus that the
"rated total TRP output power" means both polarizations and includes all sub-
blocks in case of non-contiguous operation._
_For Category B OBUE requirement is based on the same principle of category A
OBUE as much as possible with necessary modification to align with regulation
in [35] as below:_
\- A single Î”f~OBUE~ of 1.5GHz applies for FR2 BS type 2-O as well for
Category B OBUE
\- Wide bandwidth and narrow bandwidth is considered with the breakout point
at BW~contiguous~ of 500MHz according to SM.1539
### 9.7.5 OTA Transmitter spurious emissions
#### 9.7.5.1 General
The metric used to capture OTA transmitter spurious emissions is total
radiated power (TRP).
OTA transmitter spurious emissions co-location requirements shall not be
specified for BS type 2-O co-located with BS type 2-O. Regional requirements
are FFS.
Measurement bandwidths and frequency limits of the spurious emissions range
are defined according to SM.329 [4].
#### 9.7.5.2 AAS radiated Tx spurious emissions requirement for FR1
The OTA Tx spurious emission requirement for 1-O type NR BS is defined at RIB
interface for the spurious range from 30 MHz (as opposed to the 9 kHz limit
for the conducted requirement) up to the 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency
range from Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink
operating band, up to Î”f~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported
downlink operating band, where the Î”f~OBUE~ is defined in sub-clause 6.6.4.
For _operating bands_ for which the 5^th^ harmonics reaches beyond the 12.75
GHz, the upper limit of the spurious range is extended up to the 5^th^
harmonic of the fundamental range, but not higher than 26 GHz.
Spurious emissions limits for 1-O are based on the _basic limits_ defined for
Cat. A and for Cat. B in Table 6.6.5-1 and Table 6.6.5-2, with the fixed
emissions scaling applied based on the basic limit as described in sub-clause
5.9.
Minimum radiated requirement for _BS type 1-O_ is defined based on basic limit
with the emissions scaling applied. The basic limits are in clause 6.6.5.2 of
3GPP TS 38.104 [3].
#### 9.7.5.3 AAS radiated Tx spurious emissions requirement for FR2
The Tx spurious emission requirement for _BS type 2-O_ is defined at RIB for
the spurious range from 30 MHz up to the 2^nd^ harmonics of the upper
frequency edge of the _operating band._
Category A limits are defined for FR2 and are the same as limits defined for
_basic limits_ in subclause 6.6.5.2. The limits are specified in table
9.7.5.3.2-1 of TS 38.104 [3].
Category B limits are defined for FR2 with regional regulation defined in [35]
as baseline. The limits are specified in table 9.7.5.3.2.3-1 with step
frequencies defined in table 9.7.5.3.2.3-2. Currently, step frequencies are
only defined for one band, i.e. n258, for Category B spurious emissions. If
the applicability of Category B limit is confirmed for other FR2 operating
band in future, corresponding step frequencies for that band will be defined
accordingly. The step frequencies are calculated as shown in table 9.7.5.3-0.

emission limits for FR2

For conformance testing of the Tx spurious emissions requirement for _BS type
2-O_ , the upper frequency limit of the spurious range might be limited to 60
GHz value, considering practical OTA measurement capabilities of the OTA test
ranges in the spurious range.
Table 9.7.5.3-1: (Void)
## 9.8 OTA Transmitter intermodulation
### 9.8.1 General
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array.
The requirement applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and the
_transmitter transient period_. The interfering signal level is derived based
on the co-location assumption that the co-located BS is of the same class and
output power level as the BS under test. The OTA TX IMD interferer level can
hence be regarded as a co-location requirement.
Due to high isolation between co-located base stations at FR2 frequencies
there is no relevance for a transmitter intermodulation requirement for base
stations operating at FR2 bands specified by requirement set 2-O.
### 9.8.2 Core requirement
The minimum requirement for the transmitter intermodulation requirement is
that the emissions output level shall not exceed the unwanted emission limits
specified for operating band unwanted emission in sub-clause 9.7.4,
transmitter spurious emission in sub-clause 9.7.5, and ACLR in sub-clause
9.7.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal specified
in Table 9.8.2-1 of 3GPP TS 38.104 [3] in an OTA environment.
When OTA ACLR, OTA OBUE and OTA spurious emission is defined, the relevance
for having a separate intra-system requirement disappears. The intra-system
case is covered by OTA unwanted emission requirement including the unwanted
emission for the whole system, hence a separate intra-system IMD requirement
is not needed when considering OTA.
## 9.9 Transmitter spatial emissions
### 9.9.1 General
Traditional antenna data sheets provide information on not only the antenna
gain in the intended direction but also the gain in unwanted directions.
Traditional metrics are:
\- Front to back ration (FBR) -- which captured the ratio of emissions behind
the antenna compared to those in the forward direction.
\- Side Lobe Ratio (SLR) -- ratio of the side lobe antenna gain to the main
lobe antenna gain.
For an AAS it is clear that these traditional metrics of antenna gain are not
directly applicable, as an AAS has the ability to manipulate the shape of the
spatial emissions to maintain optimum network throughput it is unlikely that
the spatial pattern of the emissions will relate to a specific beam pattern
with identifiable side and back lobes. An example of a realistic AAS beam
pattern in an operational environment is shown in Figure 9.9.1-1.
{width="3.3472222222222223in" height="2.2777777777777777in"}{width="3.125in"
height="2.361111111111111in"}
Figure 9.9.1-1: Example of a realistic AAS beam pattern in an operational
environment (with DFT subband precoding)
The influence that the shape of the antenna pattern (and wanted and unwanted
cell emission) has depends on the number of simultaneously operating beams,
which could be depending on the operational state of the beamforming algorithm
and operator configurations. The wanted and in the same time the unwanted
spatial emissions strongly depends on the number of simultaneously beams and
their shapes and directions.
The antenna pattern also depends on beamforming architectures and algorithms,
amplitude tapering level, antenna structure, etc. and is affected by realistic
propagation channel as described below in example.
In practice, several multipaths may exist to the UE, and radiation along each
of the multipaths comprises useful radiation.
For example:
It can be possible that a multipath reflection may result in a beam radiated
into the direction of a neighbor cell may be reflected back towards the wanted
UE and be useful as shown in Figure 9.9.1-2 (A). Furthermore, in a multipath
environment it may also be possible that radiation is both useful for the
scheduled UE and interference to other UEs with a different multipath profile.
In the example illustrated in figure 3, the beams are reflected back to the
wanted UE. However, the beam also causes interference to another UE, as shown
in Figure 9.9.1-2(B)
{width="3.638888888888889in" height="3.8194444444444446in"}
{width="2.5972222222222223in" height="3.7152777777777777in"}
(A) (B)
Figure 9.9.1-2: Example of how radiation may be both wanted and unwanted are
difficult to differentiate.
Furthermore, techniques such as beam tapering may reduce the side lobe levels
but at the cost of widening the beam and hence lowering EIRP. It has been
shown that under some circumstances this has a negative effect on network
throughput and hence a low side lobe level is not a beneficial target.
Hence the declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many circumstances
not directly relate to system performance on its own. This is because it is
often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted radiation, and
furthermore because the benefits of optimizing beamforming performance may
outweigh the impacts of "unwanted" radiation, leading to systems with
apparently higher unwanted radiation also providing superior throughput
performance. System performance should additionally be characterized taking
all factors into account.
However there remains some benefit in having a means to indicate the ratio of
emissions in the intended directions to the unintended directions.
An option declaration of the spatial emissions has therefore been defined,
this does not form part of the BS minimum requirements but a means for BS
vendors to have a common understanding of a means to declare and measure the
spatial emissions. This optional declaration should be also defined to limit
the evaluation complexities and take into account that not all antenna pattern
options could be evaluated due to many possibilities of AAS configuration in
term of beamforming techniques, number of beams, amplitude tapering level,
radiation pattern shaping for interference management, etc.
### 9.9.2 Declaration definition
The spatial emissions requirement can be separated into 2 ranges of
directions, those in the intended set of directions (in cell) and those in the
unwanted set of directions (out of cell). The intended set of directions (in
cell) is defined only for the _OTA peak directions set_ that corresponds to
the maximum expected steering angles of the AAS in azimuth and elevation. The
unwanted emissions unwanted directions are therefore defined as follows:
Out of cell direction set -- The set of directions which are outside the
intended directions of radiation or outside the wanted cell. Declared per
operating band. The out of cell direction set is defined when intended set of
directions (in cell) is specified for the _OTA peak directions set_ that
corresponds to the maximum expected steering angles of the AAS in azimuth and
elevation.
As it is not possible to predict the spatial pattern of the emissions when the
AAS is operational (as it depends on the channel, the UE' location and
allocation etc.) the declaration only applies to the AAS when it is
transmitting the conformance test directions where the beam pattern is
defined. The declaration is defined only for single beam emissions and one
declared operating condition.
The directions sets of transmitter directional requirements are defined by the
_OTA coverage range_ and the _OTA peak directions set(s)._ The EIRR accuracy
requirement uses a set of conformance directions based on the OTA peak
directions set(s) as shown in Figure 9.9.2-1.

Figure 9.9.2-1: Diagram showing an example of requirement declaration
The OTA peak directions set is a subset of the OTA coverage range. So clearly
the out of cell directions set must be outside the OTA coverage range and the
OTA peak directions set. AN example id given in Figure 9.9.2-2
{width="5.916666666666667in" height="4.875in"}
Figure 9.9.2-2: Example of out of cell directions set and declared single beam
at a single extreme steering direction.
Having described the spatial aspects of the declaration the power levels of
the power in the wanted direction (i.e. not in the out of cell direction set)
and the power in the unwanted direction set need to be declared.
There are 5 conformance directions out of cell power level is the average
power over these 5 conformance directions. For each of the conformance
directions the power level is the average power in the specified out of cell
directions set.
The out of cell power level and in cell power levels are declared for each of
the 5 conformance directions. In addition, the average in cell power level and
out of cell power level averaged over all 5 directions is declared. The reason
that the average is declared is that the average more accurately reflects the
impact of out of cell radiation to other cells.
The in-cell power level is the average power outside the out of cell
directions set (i.e. in the intended direction) averaged over the 5
conformance directions.
So the optimal declarations are:
Table 9.9.2-1: Optional Manufacturer declarations
Declaration identifier Declaration Description
* * *
DE.1 Out of cell directions set The set of directions which are outside the
intended directions of radiation or outside the wanted cell. Declared per
operating band. DE.2 Out of cell power level Declared in band average power
inside each of the out of cell directions set(s) (DE.1) declared for each of
the 5 conformance directions (D9.x) DE.3 In cell power level Declared in band
average power outside the out of cell directions set(s) (DE.1) declared for
each of the 5 conformance directions (D9.x) DE.4 Average out of cell power
level Declared in band average power inside each of the out of cell directions
set(s) (DE.1) averaged over the 5 conformance directions (D9.x). DE.5 Average
in cell power level Declared in band average power inside each of the out of
cell directions set(s) (DE.1) averaged over the 5 conformance directions
(D9.x)
NOTE 1: The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many circumstances
not directly relate to system performance on its own. This is because it is
often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted radiation, and
furthermore because the benefits of optimizing beamforming performance may
outweigh the impacts of "unwanted" radiation, leading to systems with
apparently higher unwanted radiation also providing superior throughput
performance. System performance should additionally be characterized taking
all factors into account.
NOTE 2: The Average out of cell power level reflects the impact of out of cell
radiation on other cells more accurately than the out of cell power level for
individual test beams.
## 9.10 Beam switching speed
### 9.10.1 General
The necessity of Beam switching speed requirement was discussed in RAN4. Beam
forming (BF) is one of the essential capabilities for NR FR2 to compensate for
large path-loss (BF is not required as a mandatory in legacy RAT and NR FR1).
If the beam is not pointing in the direction of the target UE, DL performance
may be affected. If multiple UEs are scheduled in different directions, the
beam must be able to switch between them. It will be necessary that the BS can
change steering direction in time which will not negatively impact DL
performance. The steering speed capability is guaranteed by existing
requirements such as EIRP accuracy or EVM while the requirements relevant to
beam forming such as EIRP accuracy are specified in specific directions within
the declared Range by the manufacture.
Based on RAN1 agreed OFDM symbol design, BS needs to switch own beam to
different directions of different UEs at next OFDM symbol without any guard
time. In this case, in order to prevent the DL performance degradation, the
switching time should be at least less than cyclic prefix (CP) length (normal
CP length unless otherwise stated). Following Table 9.10.1-1 shows CP length
for each SCS.

### 9.10.2 Estimated switching speed
The direction of the beam from a phased array is changed by adjusting the
phase of the signal applied to each of the elements in the antenna array. This
may be implemented in a number of ways:
\- Digital beam forming -- in this case the phase is adjusted in the baseband
-- it can be considered that the time taken to adjust beam direction is so
fast it is negligible.
\- Analogue beam forming
\- Analogue phase shifters -- devices which implement a controllable phase
shift such as PIN diodes. This is probably the slowest reacting method of
phase shift, such circuits have a reaction time in the 10s of ns and a worst
case of 100ns can be considered.
\- Switched phase shifters -- RF switches are used to switch different
transmission line delays, such circuits will react based on the RF switching
time, GaAs switches react in approximately 10ns.
\- Hybrid beam forming -- mixture of analogue and digital beam forming, worst
case will have similar switching time to the analogue part.
The worst-case beam switching time is hence based on the analogue
implementation and is estimated as \ 3824 | | | | | | 16bits if transport block size â‰¤ 3824 | +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Code block CRC | 24bits (if more than 1 code block) | +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Target coding rate | 308/1024 for REFSENS and ICS | | | | | | 658/1024 for Dynamic Range | +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
