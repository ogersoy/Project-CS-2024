# 4 Background
Recently, two countries such as Japan and China have announced their "5G"
spectrum strategies and roadmaps for the frequency range between 4.4-5.0 GHz
to deploy commercial stems for NR as follows.

### 7.1.1 Transmitter characteristics
#### 7.1.1.1 UE maximum output power
The MOP requirements for Band 42 and 43 single-carrier were specified as 23
dBm +2/-3 dB for power class 3 based on simulation results shown in Table
7.1.1.1-1 in August 2011.

From these tables, no significant filter IL degradation for Band n79 can be
seen compared to that of Band 42 and 43 at ETC condition. Therefore, MOP for
Band n79 should be aligned with those of Band 42 and 43 at least.
Agreement: MOP for Band n79 is to be 23 dBm +2/-3 dB
### 7.1.2 Receiver characteristics
#### 7.1.2.1 Reference sensitivity
With the same investigation as UE maximum output power described in 7.1.1.1,
no significant filter IL degradation for Band n79 can be seen compared to that
of Band 42 and 43 at ETC condition. In addition, from LNA perspective, the
fractional bandwidth of Band n79 pass-band is 12.8 % which is smaller than
that of Band n78 (14.1 %). Hence, NF of Band n79 shouldn't be higher than that
of Band n78. Therefore, reference sensitivity for Band n79 should also be
aligned with those of Band n78 at least.
Agreement: REFSENS for Band n79 should be 1 dB larger than that of bands which
have NR smallest sensitivity (less RF challenges) such as Band n1.

#### 7.1.2.2 Blocking
##### 7.1.2.2.1 Out-of-band blocking
Based on filter performance shown in Table 7.1.1.1-1 and 7.1.1.1-2, out-of-
band blocking requirement needs to be optimized as with LTE band 42 and 43 as
below.
