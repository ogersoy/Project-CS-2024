# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
The present document is part 1 of a multi-part deliverable covering the 5G
System (5GS) User Equipment (UE) protocol conformance specification, as
identified below:
\- **3GPP TS 38.523-1: \"5GS; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;
Part 1: Protocol\"** (the present document).
\- 3GPP TS 38.523-2 [2]: \"5GS; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;
Part 2: Applicability of protocol test cases\".
\- 3GPP TS 38.523-3 [3]: \"5GS; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;
Part 3: Protocol Test Suites\".
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the protocol conformance testing for the 3GPP
UE connecting to the 5G System (5GS) via its radio interface(s).
The following information can be found in the present document (first part of
a multi-part test specification):
\- the overall test structure;
\- the test configurations;
\- the conformance requirement and references to the core specifications;
\- the test purposes; and
\- a brief description of the test procedure, the specific test requirements
and short message exchange table.
The applicability of the individual test cases is specified in the ICS
proforma specification (3GPP TS 38.523‑2 [2]). The Test Suites are specified
in part 3 (3GPP TS 38.523‑3 [3]).
The present document is valid for UE implemented according to 3GPP Releases
starting from Release 15 up to the Release indicated on the cover page of the
present document.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.
