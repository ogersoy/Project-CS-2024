# 4 Non-Terrestrial Networks Overview -- background information
## 4.1 Roles for Non-Terrestrial Networks in 5G system
Thanks to the wide service coverage capabilities and reduced vulnerability of
space/airborne vehicles to physical attacks and natural disasters, Non-
Terrestrial Networks are expected to
\- foster the roll out of 5G service in un-served areas that cannot be covered
by terrestrial 5G network (isolated/remote areas, on board aircrafts or
vessels) and underserved areas (e.g. sub-urban/rural areas) to upgrade the
performance of limited terrestrial networks in cost effective manner,
\- reinforce the 5G service reliability by providing service continuity for
M2M/IoT devices or for passengers on board moving platforms (e.g. passenger
vehicles-aircraft, ships, high speed trains, bus) or ensuring service
availability anywhere especially for critical communications, future
railway/maritime/aeronautical communications, and to
\- enable 5G network scalability by providing efficient multicast/broadcast
resources for data delivery towards the network edges or even user terminal.
The benefits relate to either Non-Terrestrial networks operating alone or to
integrated terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial networks. They will impact
coverage, user bandwidth, system capacity, service reliability or service
availability, energy consumption, connection density (See [5]).
A role for Non-Terrestrial Network components in the 5G system is expected for
the following verticals: transport, Public Safety, Media and Entertainment,
eHealth, Energy, Agriculture, Finance, Automotive.
## 4.2 5G Use Cases wherein Non-Terrestrial Network components have a role
### 4.2.1 5G use cases introduction
A use case, typically refers to the interactions between a role and a system,
to achieve a specific goal. Hence, it is necessary to identify the goal of the
service enabled by a Non-Terrestrial network component integrated in the 5G
system.
The tables in the clauses after respectively identify for each of the 5G
service enablers, the use cases wherein Non-Terrestrial Network components
have a role to play.
\- 5G service enablers refer to eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), URLLC
(Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications) and mMTC (massive Machine Type
Communications).
\- 5G use cases correspond to the interactions between a stakeholder (user,
operator, service provider) and the 5G system, to achieve a specific goal.
\- The role of the Non-Terrestrial Network refers to services enabled by the
Non-Terrestrial Network component in the 5G system to support the use case.
\- 3GPP reference documents are provided in which the use cases are mentioned.
NOTE: While the propagation delay of satellite systems may be an issue for
certain applications requiring ultra low latency, the importance of satellite
for Critical Communications including public safety communications due to
their dependability and large coverage area is well known.

## 4.3 Satellite and aerial access network architecture principles
Non-Terrestrial Network access typically features the following system
elements:
\- NTN Terminal: It may refer to directly the 3GPP UE or a terminal specific
to the satellite system in case the satellite doesn\'t serve directly 3GPP
UEs.
\- A service link which refer to the radio link between the user equipment and
the space/airborne platform. In addition the UE may also support a radio link
with terrestrial based RAN.
\- A space or an airborne platform embarking a payload which may implement
either a bent-pipe or a regenerative payload configuration:
\- A bent pipe payload: Radio Frequency filtering, Frequency conversion and
amplification:
\- A regenerative payload: Radio Frequency filtering, Frequency conversion and
amplification as well as demodulation/decoding, switch and/or routing,
coding/modulation. This is effectively equivalent to having base station
functions (e.g. gNB) on board the space/airborne vehicle
\- Inter satellite/aerial links in case of regenerative payload and a
constellation of satellites. ISL may operate in RF frequency or optical bands
\- Gateways that connect the satellite or aerial access network to the core
network
\- Feeder links which refer to the radio links between the Gateways and the
space/airborne platform
We shall distinguish between two types of Satellite and Aerial access network
\- Broadband access network serving Very Small Aperture Terminals that can be
fixed or mounted on a moving platform (e.g. bus, train, vessel, aircraft,
etc.). In this context, Broadband refers to at least 50 Mbps data rate and
even up to several hundred Mbps (satellite) or even up to several Gbps
(aerial) on the downlink. The service links operate in frequency bands
allocated to satellite and aerial services (Fixed, Mobile) above 6 GHz.
\- Narrow or wide band access network serving terminals equipped with Omni or
semi directional antenna (e.g. handheld terminal). In this context, Narrowband
refers to less than 1 or 2 Mbps data rate on the downlink. The service links
operate typically in frequency bands allocated to mobile satellite or aerial
services below 6 GHz.
It is also helpful to distinguish between satellite and aerial systems with
inter-satellite links (ISL) or inter-aerial links (IAL) and those without
ISL/IAL.
For Aerial networks, we consider a configuration where base station functions
are on board the airborne vehicle. The purpose of this network component is to
provide the 5G service enablers to handheld devices.
Based on these principles, the figures below illustrate possible satellite and
aerial access network architectures.

It is recommended to select a range of deployment scenarios with either bent
pipe or regenerative payloads. Note that the technical details of implementing
the ISL interface is beyond the scope of this study.
## 4.4 Characteristics of NTN Terminals for satellite / aerial access network
Table 4.4-1 gives the minimum RF characteristics of the terminals operating
respectively in Ka band (e.g. very small aperture terminals) and in S band
(e.g. handheld terminals).

This | | | | will impact the UE | | | | RF characteristics | | | | as below: | | | | | | | | - Equivalent EIRP | | | | of 20 dBm (-10 dBW) | | | | under satellite | | | | coverage. | | | | | | | | - Equivalent G/T of | | | | -36,6 dB/K under | | | | satellite coverage. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
Note that other performance may be considered.
## 4.5 Air/Space borne vehicle characteristics
Table 4.5-1 provides characteristics of aerial and satellite vehicles that are
relevant for the purpose of the study item:

The characteristics of the air/space-borne vehicles create specific Doppler
and propagation delay conditions that NR has to cope with.

## 4.6 Coverage pattern of NTN
Satellite or aerial vehicles typically generate several beams over a given
area. The foot print of the beams are typically elliptic shape.
The beam footprint may be moving over the earth with the satellite or the
aerial vehicle motion on its orbit. Alternatively, the beam foot print may be
earth fixed, in such case some beam pointing mechanisms (mechanical or
electronic steering feature) will compensate for the satellite or the aerial
vehicle motion.

The scenarios attributes used in the Table 5.1-1 are described below.
Only the main attributes are discussed in this clause, for simplification
purposes. Complementary attributes that should be set up for each scenario are
described in the clause 7.
The [use cases]{.underline} mentioned in the Table 5.1-1, are described in
clause 4.2.1.
## 5.2 Attributes
**[Platform orbit and altitude]{.underline}**
This attribute stands for the Platform orbit type (GEO, Non-GEO) and its
altitude.
A platform is either a satellite (alias space-borne vehicle), or a HAPS
(airborne vehicle).
See clause 4.5 for further characteristics of Air / space borne vehicles.
**[Carrier frequency between air / space-borne platform and UE]{.underline}**
The study addresses the whole frequency range between 0.5 -- 100 GHz. For
channel modelling and for the identification of areas of impact on the NR ,
the following frequency bands will be in particular considered:
\- For VSAT, Ka band: Downlink: 19.7 - 21.2 GHz, Uplink: 29.5 -- 30.0 GHz

Beam pattern stands for \"beam coverage pattern\". It is described in clause
4.6.
**[Access scheme]{.underline}**
For these scenarios, the FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing) is selected,
versus TDD (Time Division Duplexing).
FDD means that the transmitter and the receiver operate at different carrier
frequencies. Uplink and downlink sub-bands are separated by the named
frequency offset.
**[Channel Bandwidth (DL + UL)]{.underline}**
_This scenario attribute stands for the available bandwidth for channels, for
DL and for UL. It depends on the used carrier frequencies. For evaluation
purposes, we will consider:_

the bandwidth is up to 800MHz on both Downlink and Uplink
\- For Satellite and aerial networks operating in frequency bands below 6 GHz,
the bandwidth is up to 80MHz on both Downlink and Uplink
**[NTN architecture options]{.underline}**
See clause 4.7.
**[NTN terminal type]{.underline}**
_For evaluation purposes:_

aperture diameter (circular polarisation).
\- For each 3GPP FDD power class (PC), the maximum output Power is: 33dBm (2W)
for PC 1, 27dBm (0.5W) for PC 2 and 23dBm (0.20W) for the PC 3, with an
omnidirectional antenna. In a 1st approach and for evaluation purposes, the PC

See clause 4.4 for further characteristics of UE of satellite / aerial access
network.
**[NTN terminal distribution]{.underline}**
This attribute is set to either:
\- 100% outdoors UEs,
\- 100% indoors UEs,
\- Or mixed indoors & outdoors UE distribution
**[NTN terminal Speed]{.underline}**
This attribute is a generic term relative to the transmitter/receiver which is
on board the satellite or aerial platform. It stands for:
\- High speed / low speed UE
\- High speed / low speed platform (such as Trains, Boats embedding base
stations )
For evaluation purposes, the selected maximum values are:
\- 1000 km/h (e.g. aircraft)
\- 500 km/h (e.g. high speed trains)
The effect of the maximum NTN terminal speed as well as satellite or aerial
motion are considered in each deployment scenario.
See clause 4.5 for further characteristics on air / space borne platform.
## 5.3 Doppler and Propagation delay characterisation
### 5.3.1 Methodology
We shall distinguish between geostationary satellite, non geo stationary
satellite and HAPS platforms.
#### 5.3.1.1 Propagation delay
We consider the one way propagation delay as the delay:
\- from the Gateway to the UE via the space/airborne platform (bent pipe
payload)
\- from the space/airborne platform to the UE (regenerative payload)
The Round Trip Time corresponds to the two way propagation delay:
\- from the Gateway to the UE via the space/airborne platform and return (bent
pipe payload)
\- from the space/airborne platform to the UE and return (regenerative
payload)
For the propagation delay analysis, we consider a minimum gateway elevation
angle of 5° (the elevation angle of the space/air borne platform from the
Gateway). While the minimum terminal elevation angle is typically 10°.
The actual propagation delay depends on the space/airborne platform altitude
and respective position of the gateway and terminal.
#### 5.3.1.2 Differential delay
The differential delay corresponds to the difference of propagation delays
between two chosen points that are at some specific positions within the beam
foot print: for example the points can be selected at nadir and Edge of
Coverage.
The path to gateway is likely to be the same for all terminals, but this just
to simplify the computation.
#### 5.3.1.3 Doppler shift/variation
Doppler shift: Shift of the signal frequency due to the motion of the
receiver, the transmitter or both.
Doppler variation rate: During time, the Doppler shift is evolving. This is
called the Doppler variation rate or simply Doppler rate.
The Doppler shift and Doppler variation depend on the relative speed of the
space/airborne platforms, the speed of the UE, and the carrier frequency.
The figure below recalls the basic geometry of the system. The carrier
frequency of the signal received at satellite is affected by the motion of the
transmitter. The Doppler on the signal received by the UE from the satellite
is also impacted by the motion of the UE in addition to the motion of the
satellite or HAPS. Since both the air/spaceborne vehicle and the UE are moving
relatively to the Earth, their respective effects can be added algebraically.
In the present document, we can follow a non-relativistic approach to compute
the Doppler shift and variation rate given that the ratio between the relative
speed of the transmitter or receiver and the light velocity is negligible.
\- For a terminal at a speed of 1000 km/h (or 0.277 km/s): this ratio is
0.277/300000 = 0.00009
\- For a relative speed of Non-Geo satellite of 7.5 km/s (orbital speed): the
ratio is 0.000025
The signal received by the satellite at a nominal carrier frequency Fo is
affected by a Doppler shift.
The Doppler shift is computed with the formula:
Doppler shift formula: ∆F = Fo*V* cos (θ)/c
Where
\- Fo: nominal carrier frequency
\- V = UE velocity
\- Θ is the angle between the velocity vector V of the mobile (Transmitter or
receiver ) and the direction of propagation of the signal between the UE and
the space/airborne platform.
{width="4.846527777777778in" height="2.426388888888889in"}
Figure 5.3.1.3-1: Definition of the theta angle between space/airborne
platform and the direction of the UE in motion
When a transmitter is moving away from a receiver, ∆F is negative.
When a transmitter is moving towards a receiver, ∆F is positive.
The Doppler shift variation corresponds to the variation of the Doppler shift
over time. In other words, it refers to the derivative of the Doppler shift
function of time.
### 5.3.2 Geo-stationary platforms
Geostationary platform are orbiting at 35786 km altitude in the equatorial
plan, and is fixed with respect to the earth. Nevertheless, due to some
imperfection of the terrestrial potential, the satellite has some motion
around its orbital position, as described in a further section.
#### 5.3.2.1 Propagation delay
One should distinguish between
\- Bent pipe payloads
\- One way propagation delay is the sum of feeder link propagation delay and
user link propagation delay, thus the propagation delay between Gateway and UE
via the satellite
\- Round Trip Time is the delay over the path, Gateway-Satellite-UE-Satellite-
Gateway. It corresponds to twice the one way propagation delay
\- Regenerative payloads (decoding/coding on board)
\- One way propagation delay is the propagation delay between the satellite
and the UE
\- Round Trip Time is the delay over path: satellite-UE-satellite
In both cases the transit time and/or processing time are not taken into
account.
For the propagation delay computation, the min elevation angle is set at 5°
for the Gateway, and is set at 10°for the terminal can be set at various
elevation angles, but we consider that the worst case is 10° elevation angle.
The following table summarises the different situation and the different
distances in km and the different propagation delays in ms.

Satellite 81172 270.572
* * *
#### 5.3.2.2 Differential delay
In this clause, we compute the differential delays between specific positions:
for instance at nadir and Edge of Coverage.
The path to gateway is supposed to be the same for all UEs.
Table 5.3.2.2-1: Differential Delay for GEO satellite

For Geostationary satellites we have also taken a satellite located at 10 ° E
and we have computed different differential delays between some points,
provided all points were linked to the same Gateway.
The table is valid for both bent pipe satellite and regenerative satellite.

* * *
#### 5.3.2.3 Doppler shift
In principle, the Geostationary satellite is fixed and therefore no Doppler
shift is induced except that due to possible UE motion.
In reality the satellite is moving around its nominal orbital position, due to
perturbations (e.g. sun, moon) and to non-spherical component earth attraction
which impact the earth gravitational force.
The satellite must be kept to inside a box described here below. The satellite
is typically maintained inside a box that has the following dimensions, by
thrust or plasmic propulsion.
{width="5.3277777777777775in" height="2.5076388888888888in"}
Figure 5.3.2.3-1: Trajectory box for a Geostationary satellite
Without maintaining the satellite inside the box, the motion could be a higher
value like inclination up to +/6 °.
We take the hypothesis that the satellite is kept in the limited box. The
trajectory that the satellite follows is an \"8\" as shown in next figure. The
plane is seen from the centre of the Earth. The blue arrows in the next figure
indicate the sense of motion of the satellite around its orbital position So.
{width="4.330555555555556in" height="3.4319444444444445in"}
Figure 5.3.2.3-2: Geostationary satellite trajectory
In the figure above, the trajectory of the satellite is represented as seen
from a point at the equator having same longitude as the nominal Geostationary
satellite orbital position.
A geostationary satellite will cover the whole trajectory in 24 Hours.
The average tangential velocity of a geostationary satellite with respect to
an earth point is around 2.74 m/s.
Satellite maintained in a typical trajectory box (see figure 2) characterized
by
\- +/- 37.5 km in both latitude and longitude directions corresponding to an
aperture angle of +/- 0.05 °.
\- +/- 17.5 km in the equatorial plane.
To illustrate the Doppler shift computation using the Doppler Shift formula,
we shall consider some concrete cases:
\- Geostationary Satellite at 10 ° E (over Europe)
\- First a High Speed Train (500 km/h) from Paris to Lille (France) and from
Paris to Strasbourg (France)
\- Secondly an air plane (1000 km/h and 10 km altitude) moving in the same
directions.
We first compute the Doppler shift while supposing the satellite has no
motion, but on a moving UE, and secondly we evaluate the impact of the
satellite motion on a fixed UE.
**[First case: Satellite is considered fixed with respect to earth
point]{.underline}**
In the high speed train going north from Paris the obtained Doppler shift is
provided here below

The Doppler shift is highest for a platform moving along longitude compared to
a moving platform along latitude.
In the figure below, we consider a train travelling North from the Equator at
a constant speed of 500 km/h. The two extreme points in the figure are 3600
seconds apart. The Doppler shift plotted as a function of the latitude. The
maximum rate of change of Doppler shift is approximately -23 mHz/s
{width="6.5472222222222225in" height="3.29375in"}
Figure 5.3.2.3-3: Doppler Shift at 2 GHz for a High Speed Train travelling
along a longitude (North direction)
In the figure below, we consider an aircraft travelling North from the Equator
at a constant speed of 1000 km/h. Similarly to the previous plot, the two
extreme points are 1800 seconds apart. The Doppler shift plotted as a function
of the latitude. The maximum rate of change of Doppler shift is approximately
-90 mHz/s.

> However these values are reached only when cos (θ) is equal to 1 or -1.
> Where θ is the angle between the vector speed and the direction of wave
> propagation (the axis UE-Satellite).
**[Second case: Satellite is moving on its \"8\"]{.underline}**
When satellite is moving from S2 to S1, the Doppler shift in Paris is the
following
Table 5.3.2.3-4:Example of Doppler shift when satellite is moving
* * *
Frequency 2GHz 20 GHz 30 GHz Doppler shift (Hz) -0.25 -2.4 -4.0
* * *
When satellite is moving from S1 to S4, the Doppler shift in Paris is the
following
Table 5.3.2.3-5:Example of Doppler shift when satellite is moving
* * *
Frequency 2GHz 20 GHz 30 GHz Doppler shift (Hz) 2.25 22.5 34
* * *
Doppler shift is higher than in the previous case, though still very low
compared to the case of Non GEO satellites.
When satellite is in near GEO orbit with inclination up to 6°, the Doppler
shift can reach around 300 Hz at 2 GHz, then 3000 Hz at 20 GHz and 4500 Hz at
30 GHz, which are still compatible with OFDM.
### 5.3.3 Aerial vehicle
The altitude of aerial vehicle also called UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) can
be between 8 and 50 km, including HAPS. HAPS is a station located on an aerial
object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point
relative to the Earth.
The general UAS based system architectures are presented in the following
picture.
{width="2.8333333333333335in"
height="1.9222222222222223in"}{width="2.9180555555555556in"
height="1.9027777777777777in"}
Figure 5.3.3-1: UAS based system architectures
The coverage can be divided into small cells, and usually the minimum
elevation angle for a Mobile Terminal is 5°.
The platform can move around its nominal position within a few kilometres at a
maximum tangential velocity of 15 m/s.
This can result in maximum Doppler shift (in absolute value) of 100 Hz @ 2GHz,
1000 Hz @ 20 GHz and 1500 Hz @ 30 GHz due to Haps motion.
In S band, at 100 km/h a car will suffer a Doppler shift of +/- 185 Hz maximum
The Doppler variation can be evaluated with a car moving from one edge to
another at 100 km/h , covering 450 km . The Doppler variation will be around
-0.0025 Hz/s. So no impact on demodulation
At 5° elevation angle the distance to the aerial vehicle is 229 km, and if we
suppose the Gateway is at same distance
\- One way delay is around 1.526 ms
\- Round Trip Time is 3.053 ms
\- Differential delay between nadir and Edge of Coverage: 0.697 ms
### 5.3.4 Non geostationary satellites
The Non-Geostationary case comprises three examples
\- LEO at 600 km
\- LEO at 1500 km
\- MEO at 10000 km
#### 5.3.4.1 Propagation delay
In the case of bent pipe satellites, one way propagation delay is the sum of
feeder link propagation delay and user link propagation delay, thus the
propagation delay between Gateway and UE.
In the case of regenerative satellite, one way propagation delay is the
satellite to UE propagation delay.
In both cases the transit time and/or processing time are not taken into
account.
In the case of bent pipe satellite, the Round Trip Time is the physical path
duration of the path : Gateway-Satellite-UE-Satellite-Gateway, that is in fact
twice the one way propagation delay.
In the case of regenerative satellite, the round trip delay is the delay
corresponding to the following path :satellite-UE-satellite.
In the computation, Gateway is set at 5° (TBC) elevation angle, and terminal
can be set at various elevation angles, but we consider that the reference
case is 10° elevation angle for the propagation delay computation.
The following table summarises the different situations and the different
distances in km and the different propagation delays in ms.
The results for the three cases of NGSO satellites are summarized in the next
table.

#### 5.3.4.3 Doppler Shift and variation rate
The following picture summarizes the methodology used for Non Geostationary
systems. We evaluate the Doppler shift which is maximum when the UE is located
in the orbital plane.
{width="3.2680555555555557in" height="3.4875in"}
Figure 5.3.4.3-1: System Geometry for Doppler computation
The picture describing the system geometry shows the satellite \"S\" on its
circular orbit. The vector V corresponds to the orbital speed vector.
The Doppler shift is computed for a Mobile Terminal \"M\" located in the
orbital plan, and corresponds to the maximum value.
One of the impacting factors on the Doppler shift value is the angle between
{width="0.19166666666666668in" height="0.19166666666666668in"} and the speed
vector {width="9.166666666666666e-2in" height="0.18333333333333332in"}. Angle
called θ.
\- The satellite is at an altitude h, and R is the earth radius.
\- The satellite has the velocity {width="9.375e-2in" height="0.1875in"}, and
the transmitted frequency is F~c~.
\- The Doppler shift value F~d~ due to satellite motion is expressed by the
formula
\- {width="2.5520833333333335in" height="0.2708333333333333in"}
\- Where
\- θ is the angle between satellite velocity and
{width="0.19166666666666668in" height="0.19166666666666668in"}.
\- u the angle between {width="0.21875in" height="0.1875in"} and
{width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.1875in"}
\- {width="0.21875in" height="0.1875in"} is the vector between earth centre
and point on earth
\- {width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.1875in"}is the vector between
earth centre and the satellite
\- angle u is varying with the satellite motion: u(t) = V*t/(R+h) with t the
time
\- α is the elevation angle to the satellite of the UT in M.
\- γ can be computed as follow:
\- {width="0.4583333333333333in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}
\- The Doppler formula is obtained after some computation.
At this altitude the speed of the satellite in circular orbit is 7.5622
km.s^-1^. So we can use non-relativistic approximation to compute Doppler
shift.
Also at first order we neglect the speed of earth which is 327 m/s at 45°
latitude and 464 m/s at the equator.
For all Non GSO cases, the satellite speeds are the following
\- At 600 km : V =7.5622 km.s^-1^
\- At 1500 km : V =7.1172 km.s^-1^
\- At 10000 km : V =4.9301 km.s^-1^
##### 5.3.4.3.1 Case at 2 GHz
Both (Downlink) D/L and (Uplink) U/L the signal is around 2GHz and we limit
the curves at 2 GHz.
If we consider now a moving UE at 1000 km/h, and moving in the same direction
than the satellite, we have determined the worst case impact in the following
graph. We can define the bounds by adding the Doppler shift due to the
satellite motion and the Doppler shift due to the UE motion.
All the curves are gathered in the next graphs, showing clearly the boundaries
of the Doppler shift depending on the sense of motion between the satellites
and the UE.
Three NON GSO satellites cases are provided.

Note that the Maximum Doppler shift variation in absolute value is always
negative and observed when the Doppler shift is zero.
#### 5.3.4.4 Doppler Shift and variation rate
The following picture summarizes the methodology used to compute Doppler shift
for Non Geostationary satellite systems. It assumes a Cartesian coordinate
system such that the moving satellite and the receiver are on the y-z plane.
The Doppler shift experienced by a stationary receiver can be computed as
follows as a function of time:
{width="1.5104166666666667in" height="0.34375in"}
where _f_ ~0~ is the carrier frequency, **d**(t) is the distance vector
between the satellite and the receiver, and **x** ~SAT~(t) is the vector of
the satellite position. These vectors can be expressed as:
{width="3.6666666666666665in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
{width="3.558333333333333in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
where _R_ ~E~ is the Earth radius, _h_ is the satellite altitude, and
{width="0.2916666666666667in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is the satellite
angular velocity.
{width="3.0076388888888888in" height="3.1791666666666667in"}
Figure 5.3.4.4-1: System geometry for Doppler computation (Satellite moves in
the Y-Z plane)
After some mathematical manipulation [7], the Doppler shift as a function of
the elevation angle is computed in a closed-form expression as follows:
{width="1.6354166666666667in" height="0.3125in"}
where the angular velocity is , with _G_ the gravitational constant and M~E~
the Earth mass.
If the receiver is placed on board an aircraft or a high speed train, there
will be an additional term of Doppler shift resulting from its own velocity.
In case of Non Geostationary satellites, the Doppler shift due to satellite
movement is much higher than the one caused by UE movement. For GEO and HAPS,
the Doppler shift component is mainly caused by the UE movement.
### 5.3.5 Synthesis for each scenarios
Following table summarises the different Doppler shift, Doppler Shift
variation and propagation delays. The main impairments are the Doppler shifts
and Doppler variation in deployment scenarios D3 and D4. (Non-geostationary
platforms at 600 km).

# 6 Non-Terrestrial Networks channel models
## 6.1. Status/expectation of existing information for satellite/HAPS channels
### 6.1.1 Channel modeling works outside of 3GPP
ITU recommendations are encompassing most recent works and measurements on
satellite channel models.
\- ITU-R P.681 [10] defines the Land Mobile Satellite channel with
measurements up to 20 GHz
\- ITU-R P.618 [11] describes atmospheric effects such as gas attenuation,
scintillation, rain and cloud attenuation.
### 6.1.2 Targeted user environment
Only outdoor conditions are considered for satellite operations, since
performance requirements are not expected to be met with the available link
budget for indoor communications.
Since HAPS are closer to the Earth, resulting in less path loss than in
satellite access networks, additional indoor conditions are also considered
for HAPS.
Several user environments will be considered, depending on the frequency band:
open, rural, suburban, urban and dense urban. In open environments (such as
fixed terminals or terminals mounted on boats/aircrafts), an AWGN channel is
assumed.
### 6.1.3 Modeling objectives
The requirements for channel modelling are as follows:
\- Support a frequency range from 0.5 GHz up to 100 GHz. Two frequency bands
are targeted in particular: below 6 GHz and Ka bands. For Ka band
communications, the uplink frequency is around 30 GHz while the downlink
frequency is around 20 GHz.
\- Accommodate UE mobility. For satellite channel models, mobility speed up to
1000 km/h is supported; this corresponds to aircrafts that can be served by
satellite access. For HAPS channel models, mobility speed up to around 500
km/h is supported, corresponding to high speed trains.
## 6.2 Differences between satellite/HAPS and cellular channel modelling
Figures 6.2-1 and 6.2-2 compare the macro-cellular and satellite access links
in NLOS and LOS cases, respectively. The terrestrial propagation is quite
similar: multipath propagation is caused by objects near the user. However,
the angular spread from satellite is almost zero (due to its distant location)
while it can still be several degrees from the base station.

Figure 6.2-3: Combined satellite and terrestrial channels (conceptual
drawing).
## 6.3 Coordinate system
A three-dimensional global coordinate system is considered, described as
\"Earth Centred Earth fixed\". The Earth is approximated as a true sphere with
radius of 6371 km. The coordinates\' origin O lies in the center of the earth,
x-y plane locates in the equator plane with x-axis pointing to 0 degree
longitude, y axis pointing to 90 degree longitude, and z-axis pointing to
geographical north pole from the origin O.
A UE or a satellite position is described by a set of three
parameters$(x,y,z)$, with $\sqrt{x² + y² + z²} = \text{6371}\text{km}$ for all
UEs and for all satellites.
The proposed coordinate system is illustrated in Figure 6.3-1 for a non-GEO
satellite constellation.
{width="2.74375in" height="2.6069444444444443in"}
Figure 6.3-1: Illustration of the coordinate system
## 6.4 Antenna modelling
### 6.4.1 HAPS/Satellite antenna
**Satellite antenna pattern**
The following normalized antenna gain pattern, corresponding to a typical
reflector antenna with a circular aperture, is considered
1 {width="0.6388888888888888in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}
{width="1.2868055555555555in" height="0.6076388888888888in"}
{width="1.2868055555555555in" height="0.32083333333333336in"}
where J~1~(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind and first order with
argument x, is the radius of the antenna\'s circular aperture, k = 2πf/c is
the wave number, f is the frequency of operation, c is the speed of light in a
vacuum and θ is the angle measured from the bore sight of the antenna\'s main
beam. Note that _ka_ equals to the number of wavelengths on the circumference
of the aperture and is independent of the operating frequency.
The normalized gain pattern for a = 10 c/f (aperture radius of 10 wavelengths)
is shown in Figure 6.4.1-1.
{width="3.49375in" height="2.623611111111111in"}
**Figure 6.4.1-1: Satellite antenna gain pattern for aperture radius 10
wavelengths,_a _=10_ c _/_ f_**
**HAPS antenna pattern**
Two different antenna patterns are considered:
\- The above antenna pattern defined for satellite scenarios, based on the
Bessel function.
\- The 3GPP antenna pattern defined for the base station in Section 7.3 of
[12], corresponding to a uniform rectangular panel array with dual linear
polarization.
### 6.4.2 UE antenna pattern
The following reference UE antenna patterns are adopted for fast fading:
\- Quasi Isotropic - Linear polarisation (Quasi isotropic refers to dipole
antenna which is omni-directional in one plane)
\- Co-phased array - Dual Linear polarisation (one for below 6 GHz band and
one for above 6 GHz band as described in [48])
\- \"VSAT type - circular polarization: fixed or tracking\" UE antenna pattern
(only in deployment scenarios featuring flat fading conditions)
## 6.5 Methodology to define channel models
### 6.5.1 System-level methodology
Only drop-based simulations are considered, similarly to [12].
The baseline model to generate channel coefficients is the one described in
[12] for terrestrial links, and depicted in Figure 6.5.1-1.
Figure 6.5.1-1: Channel coefficient generation procedure issued from [12]
An alternative and simplified model can be applied if all UE meet the flat
fading criteria. In this case, the channel coefficients reduce to a single
tap, since the channel is not frequency selective. This simplified model,
derived from [10] is depicted in Figure 6.5.1-2.
Figure 6.5.1-2: Simplified channel coefficient generation issued from [10]
### 6.5.2 Link-level methodology
Similarly to [12], reference CDL and TDL are considered for link-level
simulations. For given environment and elevation angle, they are obtained from
a single instance of the baseline model used for system level simulations
(i.e. the one derived from [12]).
For flat fading conditions (including AWGN) no channel model is needed for
link-level simulations.
## 6.6 Large scale model
### 6.6.1 LOS probability
Line-Of-Sight (LOS) probability depends on UE environment and elevation angle,
and is obtained from Table 6.6.1-1. Reference elevation angles are considered
from 10° to 90° with a 10° step. For an UE-to-satellite or UE-to-HAPS link,
the LOS probability is taken from the nearest reference elevation angle.
Table 6.6.1-1 LOS probability

Elevation Dense urban scenario Urban scenario Suburban and Rural scenarios 10°
28.2% 24.6% 78.2% 20° 33.1% 38.6% 86.9% 30° 39.8% 49.3% 91.9% 40° 46.8% 61.3%

82.0% 96.8% 95.2% 90° 98.1% 99.2% 99.8%
* * *
### 6.6.2 Path loss and Shadow fading
The signal path between a satellite or HAPS transmitter and an NTN terminal
undergoes several stages of propagation and attenuation. The path loss (PL) is
composed of components as follows:
{width="1.9166666666666667in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}, (6.6-1)
where $\text{PL}$is the total path loss in dB,
$\text{PL}_{b}$ is the basic path loss in dB,
$\text{PL}_{g}$ is the attenuation due to atmospheric gasses in dB,
$\text{PL}_{s}$ is the attenuation due to either ionospheric or tropospheric
scintillation in dB,
$\text{PL}_{e}$is building entry loss in dB.
This section specifies the basic path loss model ($\text{PL}_{b}$) which
accounts for the signal\'s free space propagation, clutter loss, and shadow
fading. Attenuations due to building entry loss, atmospheric gasses and
scintillation are described in Sections 6.6.3, 6.6.4 and 6.6.6, respectively.
The free space path loss (FSPL) in dB for a separation distance _d_ in meter
and frequency {width="0.125in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} in GHz is given
by
{width="3.1805555555555554in" height="0.25in"} (6.6-2)
For a ground terminal, the distance _d_ (a.k.a. slant range), as shown in
Figure 6.6.2-1, can be determined by the satellite/HAPS altitude $h_{0}$ and
elevation angle α by
{width="2.625in" height="0.3194444444444444in"}, (6.6-3)
where $R_{E}$ denotes Earth radius.
Figure 6.6.2-1: Slant range d between a satellite and a ground terminal
Clutter loss (CL) models the attenuation of signal power caused by surrounding
buildings and objects on the ground. It depends on the elevation angle α, the
carrier frequency f~c~, and the environment. Shadow fading (SF) is modeled by
a log-normal distribution, which when expressed in decibel unit, is a zero-
mean normal distribution with a standard deviation $\sigma_{\text{SF}}^{2}$,
i.e., $N(0,\sigma_{\text{SF}}^{2})$.
The basic path loss in dB unit is modeled as
{width="2.44375in" height="0.25in"}, (6.6-4)
where is the free space path loss, $\text{CL}(\alpha,f_{c})$is clutter loss,
and $\text{SF}$ is shadow fading loss represented by a random number generated
by the normal distribution, i.e., $\text{SF}$ \~$N(0,\sigma_{\text{SF}}^{2})$.
When the UE is in LOS condition, clutter loss is negligible and should be set
to 0 dB in the basic path loss model.
The values of and $\text{CL}$ are given in tables 6.6.2-1 to 6.6.2-3 at
reference elevation angles for different scenarios. The UE in a particular
scenario should take the values corresponding to the reference angle nearest
to its elevation angle α.

### 6.6.3 O2I penetration loss
For an indoor Earth-based station, account must be taken of the additional
loss between the station and the adjacent outdoor path. The additional loss
varies greatly with the location and construction details of buildings, and a
statistical evaluation is required. Recommendation ITU‑R P.2109 gives a
suitable building entry/exit-loss model for this purpose.
Experimental results, such as those collated in Report ITU-R P.2346, shows
that, when characterised in terms of entry loss, buildings fall into two
distinct populations: where modern, thermally-efficient building methods are
used (metallised glass, foil-backed panels) building entry loss is generally
significantly higher than for \'traditional\' buildings without such
materials. The model therefore gives predictions for these two cases.
This classification, of \'thermally efficient\' and \'traditional\', refers
purely to the thermal efficiency of construction materials. No assumption
should be made on the year of construction, type (single or multi-floors),
heritage or building method.
For building entry loss, it is important to consider the thermal efficiency of
the complete building (or the overall thermal efficiency). A highly thermally
efficient main structure with poorly insulated windows (e.g. single glazed
with thin glass) can make the building thermally inefficient and vice versa.
Thermal transmittance, commonly referred as U-value, provides a quantifiable
description of thermal efficiency. Low U-values represent high thermal
efficiency. Typically, the presence of metallised glass windows, insulated
cavity walls, thick reinforced concrete and metal foil back cladding is a good
indication of a thermally efficient building.
NOTE: For example, U-values of \ 0.6 _σ~φ~_ > 0.5-0.7

##### 6.6.6.1.2 Ionospheric scintillation location dependence
As previously mentioned, scintillation effects differ at low and high-
latitudes, and they are not observed at mid-latitudes except for strong
geomagnetic storms. At high-latitudes (e.g., above 60°), the effect mainly
occurs from the high-latitude edge of the Van Allen outer belt into polar
region. On the other hand, Equatorial scintillations occur around ±20° of
latitude of the magnetic equator and they are due to large (\~100 km) depleted
ionization volumes driven through the F region, leaving a plume of small-scale
(tens of cm to m) irregularities surrounding the depletion, which can extend
well through F-layer peak. They are produced by convective plasma processes.
Irregularities with this range of scales are not independent from larger-scale
plasma structures to those of smaller-scale irregularities.
The cross-correlation between _S~4~_ and _σ~φ~_ is markedly different between
high geomagnetic latitudes and low latitudes. Amplitude scintillations
dominate at low-latitudes, and phase scintillations dominate at high
latitudes, however, they are not exclusively and both effects can be expected
in the two regions.
##### 6.6.6.1.3 Frequency scaling
For frequency scaling, typically the following relation on amplitude
scintillation _S~4~_ index is used:
{width="1.1527777777777777in" height="0.4722222222222222in"} (6.6-11)
with _n_ =1.5 recommended for L-band frequencies. In [14], values of _n_
derived from satellite measurement data between several pairs of frequencies
from 30 MHz up to 6 GHz are presented, ranging from 1 to 2. This relationship
is valid particularly for weak scattering assumptions (higher elevations and
low to moderate _S~4~_ values below 0.6). For high _S~4~_ values (_S~4~_ =1),
the relation saturates with _n_ equal to 0.
For phase scintillations, an equivalent relation is used:
{width="1.1666666666666667in" height="0.4722222222222222in"} (6.6-12)
with _n_ =1 recommended for L-band frequencies and also reaching saturation
for high _σ~φ~_ values.
As an illustrative example, the frequency scaling between GPS L1, L2 and L5
bands (1.57542, 1.22760 and 1.17645 GHz, respectively) is presented in Figure
6.6.6.1.3-1, where scintillation events in two bands are compared against each
other and against the theoretical values described by 6.6-11 and 6.6-12.

GPS L1, L2 and L5 bands
##### 6.6.6.1.4 Model for Ionospheric scintillation loss
The proposed method for the ionospheric scintillation loss is based on the so-
called _Gigahertz scintillation model_ ([13], Section 4.8), and it is valid
only for the regions located approximately 20° north and south of the magnetic
equator. At high-latitudes (e.g., above 60°), this model is not applicable,
whereas for other latitude locations the ionospheric scintillation can be
neglected.
To evaluate the scintillation effects that can be expected in a given
situation the following steps may be used:
**_Step 1_** : Figure 6.6.6.1.4-1 provides scintillation occurrence statistics
on equatorial ionospheric paths: peak‑to-peak amplitude fluctuations,
_P~fluc~_ , (dB), for 4 GHz reception from satellites in the East at elevation
angles of about 20° (**P** solid curves) and in the West at about 30°
elevation (**I** dotted curves). The data are given for different times of
year and sunspot number.
**_Step 2_** : Since Figure 6.6.6.1.4-1 relates to 4 GHz, values for other
frequencies are found by multiplying these values by (  _f_ /4)^--1.5^ where
_f_ is the frequency of interest (GHz).
**_Step 3_** : Since one element of link budget calculations is related to
signal loss due to ionospheric scintillation, _A~IS~_ , the following
relationship is recommended:
{width="1.0138888888888888in" height="0.2916666666666667in"} {QUOTE
{width="0.9083333333333333in" height="0.2in"} } (6.6-13)
NOTE: The most widely used parameter in describing amplitude scintillations
phenomena is the amplitude index _S_ ~4~. It is adopted to define three main
regime conditions (see Table 6.6.6.1.1-1), and it is related to _P~fluc~_
using the empirical approximation:
_P~fluc~_ = 27.5 _S_ ~4~^1.26^ (6.6-14)
where the empirical conversion table is presented in Table 1 of [13].
{width="5.743055555555555in" height="6.127083333333333in"}
Figure 6.6.6.1.4-1: Annual statistics of peak-to-peak fluctuations observed at
Hong Kong earth station (Curves I1, P1, I3-I6, P3-P6) and Taipei earth station
(Curves P2 and I2). Extracted from [13].
For system-level simulations below 6 GHz, $\text{PL}_{S}$is equal to _A~IS~_
from Equation (6.6-13) for latitudes of maximum ±20°. For latitudes between
±20° and ±60° of latitude, $\text{PL}_{S} = 0$. Finally, for latitude above
±60°, the presented ITU model is not applicable; nevertheless, in those
regions the scintillation phenomena are mainly affecting the signal phase and
having negligible effects on the signal amplitude. For such reasons, the
choice of $\text{PL}_{S} = 0$ is also applied for latitude above ±60°.
As baseline for system-level simulations below 6 GHz in the regions of maximum
±20°, the additional path loss due to scintillation $\text{PL}_{S}$ is equal
to the ionospheric attenuation level at 99% of the P3 curve derived from
Figure 6.6.6.1.4-1. For example, by applying the presented _Gigahertz
scintillation model_ , the attenuation at 2 GHz center frequency is summarized
in the following equation:
{width="3.183333333333333in" height="0.4083333333333333in"}
#### 6.6.6.2 Tropospheric scintillation
Scintillation corresponds to rapid fluctuations of the received signal
amplitude and phase. Tropospheric propagation shall only be considered for
frequencies above 6 GHz.
Tropospheric scintillation is a phenomenon that causes rapid amplitude and
phase fluctuations of signals from satellite communication systems. Unlike,
ionospheric scintillation, the effect of tropospheric scintillation increases
with the carrier frequency of the signal, being especially significant above
10 GHz. In this case, the signal fluctuations are caused by sudden changes in
the refractive index due to the variation of temperature, water vapor content,
and barometric pressure.
Besides increasing with the carrier frequency, the effects of scintillation
also increase with low elevation angles, due to the longer path of the signal,
and wide beam width receiving antennas.
##### 6.6.6.2.1 Model for Tropospheric scintillation loss
The ITU-R recommendation algorithm for fading prediction [11] permits an
accurate prediction of the amplitude. This method consists in three parts:
\- Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading at free-space elevation
angles ≥ 5° (Section 2.4.1 in [13]).
\- Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading for fades ≥ 25 dB (section
2.4.2 in [13]).
\- Prediction of the amplitude scintillation in the transition region between
the above two distributions (section 2.4.3 in [13]).
An illustrative example of typical power attenuation levels as a function of
the elevation angle is depicted in Figure 6.6.6.2.1-1. The user location is
Toulouse (France), the carrier frequency is set to 20 GHz, and circular
polarization is assumed. Even though tropospheric scintillation is latitude
dependent, it is suggested to take this plot as a reference for satellite link
margin computation.

Figure 6.6.6.2.1-1: Complementary cumulative probability function of the
tropospheric scintillation attenuation at 20 GHz in Toulouse (France).
As baseline for system-level simulations above 6 GHz, the fading due to
scintillation $\text{PL}_{S}$ is equal to the tropospheric attenuation level
at 99% of the time derived from Figure 6.6.6.2.1-1 and summarized in Table
6.6.6.2.1-1. Alternatively, it can be drawn for each UE based on its
corresponding CDF from Figure 6.6.6.2.1-1, assuming no correlation between
different UE.

the average value of the direct path amplitude A over one event, [_p~B,min~ ,

[]{.underline}
[Step 3]{.underline}: Draw M~Ai~, the mean power of the direct signal, as a
normally distributed parameter function of
$(\mu_{M_{A}},\sigma_{M_{A}})_{G,B}$ expressed in dB.
$M_{A_{i}}\text{\textasciitilde}N(\mu_{M_{A_{i}}},\sigma_{M_{A_{i}}})$
Compute _Σ~Ai~ and MP~i~, respectively the standard deviation of the direct
signal and the mean multipath power both expressed in dB where suscript i
designate the good or bad state, as follow:_
_Σ~Ai~_ = _g_ ~1 _i_ ~_M~Ai~ + g_ ~2 _i_ ~ (6.7-6)
_MP~i\ ~_ = _h_ ~1 _i_ ~_M~Ai~ + h_ ~2 _i_ ~ (6.7-7)
[]{.underline}
[Step 4]{.underline}: Draw the power of the direct signal $P_{D}$ following
the normally distribution($M_{A_{i}},\Sigma_{A_{i}}$) and derive the K factor
as $P_{D}$-$\text{MP}_{i}$ (all expressed in dB).
For each UE, the channel is therefore characterized by a single Rice
distributed tap.
Note that the above procedure is only valid for simulation durations up to a
few TTIs. It is further assumed that no state change occurs during the
simulation duration.
For longer simulations, the procedure described in clause 6.2 from [10] must
be applied, as the K factor must not be considered as constant.
Note that individual fading values at a given time may directly be obtained
after step 3 of the above procedure, based on the Loo distribution:
_(6.7-8)_
With 2$\sigma_{i}^{2}$being the multipath mean received power expressed in dB,
i.e. _MP~i\ ~_ = 10log (2$\sigma_{i}^{2}$)
Similarly to [10], a Jake\'s Doppler spectrum is considered for UE mobility.
Additional Doppler shift due to satellite motion should be taken into account
according to the following formula:
,
Where denotes the satellite speed, _c_ denotes the speed of light, _R_ denotes
the earth radius, _h_ denotes the satellite altitude, denotes the satellite
elevation angle, and denotes the carrier frequency.
The satellite speed, satellite elevation angle and UE speed should be
considered to be constant during the simulation duration, if limited to few
TTIs.
### 6.7.2 Frequency selective fading
In the fast fading model, the process in 7.5 of TR 38.901 [12] is used. This
section is not a stand-alone description of the fast fading model, but it
describes the differences between the channel models used for terrestrial and
satellite/HAPS communications. As can be seen from Figure 6.7.2-1, there is
not much difference in local scattering between the HAPS and satellite cases.
Therefore, the same fast fading parameters can be used for the both cases,
including different satellite orbits as well. The critical parameter is the
elevation angle of the LOS path of the satellite/HAPS vs. ground horizon.

Instead of the parameterization tables in TR 38.901 [12] (Table 7.5-6 Part-1
and Part-2) the following tables shall be used.
NOTE 1: Some channel models may lead to pessimistic results of the performance
of satellite/HAPS to UE link especially in the higher elevations due to the
high number of clusters and low K factor.
NOTE 2: In some cases, the correlation distances are shorter in real world
conditions.
Angular scaling factors in cluster generation need to be added to the NTN
scenarios that have lower number of clusters than the scenarios described in
TR 38.901 [12] (Table 6.7.2-1aa below corresponds to Table 7.5-2 in TR 38.901

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. NOTE 9: The number of clusters is based on a limited data. The number may be different in the real field conditions. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. NOTE 9: The number of clusters is based on a limited data. The number may be different in the real field conditions. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. NOTE 9: The number of clusters is based on a limited data. The number may be different in the real field conditions. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. NOTE 9: The number of clusters is based on a limited data. The number may be different in the real field conditions. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

_f c_ is carrier frequency in GHz; _d_ 2D is BS-UT distance in km. NOTE 1: _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _ZSD_ = rms zenith spread of departure angles, _ZSA_ = rms zenith spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor. NOTE 2: The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model. NOTE 3: All large scale parameters are assumed to have no correlation between different floors. NOTE 4: The following notation for mean (_μ_ lgX=mean{log10(X) }) and standard deviation (_σ_ lgX=std{log10(X) }) is used for logarithmized parameters X. NOTE 5: For all considered scenarios the AOD/AOA distributions are modelled by a wrapped Gaussian distribution, the ZOD/ZOA distributions are modelled by a Laplacian distribution and the delay distribution is modelled by an exponential distribution. NOTE 6: For UMa and frequencies below 6 GHz, use _f c _= 6 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values. NOTE 7: For UMi and frequencies below 2 GHz, use fc = 2 when determining the values of the frequency-dependent LSP values. NOTE 8: For satellite (e.g.GEO/LEO), the departure angle spreads are zeros, i.e. µlgASD and µlgZSD are –∞, and corresponding standard deviations are zeros. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
## 6.8. Additional modelling components
### 6.8.1 Time-varying Doppler shift
The Doppler shift generally depends on the time evolution of the channel as
the joint results due to the movement of Tx and Rx, or scatterer movement. As
mentioned above, the movement of BS and UE are time-varying, especially in the
spaceborne case. Then, the more general form to describe the phase rotation
due to the Doppler shift can be calculated as:
.
Here, ${\hat{r}}_{\text{rx},n,m}(t)$ is the normalized vector that points into
the direction of the incoming wave as seen from the Rx at time $t$.
$\overrightarrow{v}\left( t \right)$ denotes the velocity vector of the Rx at
time $t$. is the normalized vector that points into the direction of the
outgoing wave as seen from the Tx at time $t$. denotes the velocity vector of
the Tx at time $t$. While $t_{0}$ denotes a reference point in time that
defines the initial phase, e.g. $t_{0} = 0$.
### 6.8.2 Faraday rotation
The Faraday rotation is introduced to describe the rotation of the
polarization due to the interaction of the electromagnetic wave with the
ionized medium in the earth\'s magnetic field along the path. In case of
propagation for spaceborne BS above the ionosphere, the Faraday rotation
should be calculated as:
$F_{r} = \begin{bmatrix} \text{cos}(\psi_{n,m}) & \- \text{sin}(\psi_{n,m}) \
\text{sin}(\psi_{n,m}) & \text{cos}(\psi_{n,m}) \ \end{bmatrix}$ _(6.8-1)_
The equations 7.5-28 and 7.5-29 in [12] should be updated by post-multiplied
with $F_{r}$for the channel coefficient generation of the _m^th^_ path in the
_n^th^_ cluster, as equations 6.8-1a and 6.8-1b, respectively:
$\begin{matrix} H_{u,s,n,m}^{\text{NLOS}}(t) =

frequency in GHz.
## 6.9 Channel models for link level simulations
The link level models follow the same principles as the link level models
specified in TR38.901 section 7.7.
### 6.9.1 CDL models
The CDL models are defined for the S and Ka bands and are applicable to
different environments and elevation angles. NTN-CDL-A and NTN-CDL-B are
constructed to represent two different channel profiles for NLOS, while NTN-
CDL-C and NTN-CDL-D are constructed for LOS. The parameters of these models
can be found in Tables 6.9.1-1 to 6.9.1-4.
Table 6.9.1-1a: Void
Table 6.9.1-1b: Void
Due to the long propagation distance between the NTN gNB and ground UE, the
azimuth and elevation angular spreads of departure, ASD and ZSD, can be
considered zero, and all cluster AOD and ZOD angles the same. The coordinate
system can be chosen in such a way that all AODs are zero. With the NTN gNB at
an elevation angle _α_ with respect to the UE, ZOD of all clusters is 90⁰+_α_
, as shown in Figure 6.9.1-1. The CDL models in Tables 6.9.1-1 to 6.9.1-4 use
50⁰ elevation angle between the NTN gNB and UE, resulting in ZODs equal to
190⁰. For a desired elevation angle _α_ ~desired~, the cluster ZOD needs to be
set to
{width="2.017361111111111in" height="0.25555555555555554in"} (6.9-1)
{width="4.214583333333334in" height="3.4541666666666666in"}
**Figure 6.9.1-1 Elevation angle _α_ at UE with NTN gNB**
Depending on the frequency band, environment scenario, and elevation angle of
the intended link level simulations, suitable DS, ASA, ZSA, and Rician
K-factor in case of LOS, can be determined from the channel model parameters
in Section 6.7.2.
Each CDL model can be scaled in delay and AOA to achieve desired RMS delay
spread and ASA according to the procedures specified respectively in
subclauses 7.7.3 and 7.7.5.1 of TR 38.901 [12]. With the same angle scaling
principle, each CDL model can also be scaled in ZOA to achieve desired ZSA,
taking into account the difference between the desired elevation angle and
reference elevation angle, by
{width="4.831944444444445in" height="0.5041666666666667in"} (6.9-2)
where
{width="0.8875in" height="0.3125in"} is the scaled ZOA,
> {width="0.7375in" height="0.30416666666666664in"} is the desired ZSA,
>
> {width="0.6986111111111111in" height="0.30416666666666664in"} is the RMS
> zenith angular spread of the reference model,
>
> {width="0.8875in" height="0.3125in"} is the cluster ZOA of the reference
> model,
>
> {width="0.8027777777777778in" height="0.3125in"} is the mean angle of ZOA of
> the reference model,
>
> {width="0.8159722222222222in" height="0.3125in"} is the desired mean ZOA,
>
> {width="1.5993055555555555in" height="0.30416666666666664in"} is the
> difference between the desired and reference elevation angles between the
> NTN gNB and UE.
The resultant ZOA angles after scaling may need to be wrapped to the domain
[0,180] by the same rule in TR 38.901: if {width="1.4951388888888888in"
height="0.32083333333333336in"}, it should be set to
{width="1.1555555555555554in" height="0.33055555555555555in"}.
For LOS channel models, the K-factor of NTN-CDL-C and NTN-CDL-D can be set to
a desired value following the procedure described in subclause 7.7.6 of TR
38.901.
Doppler shift due to UE and satellite motion should be calculated based on
section 6.8.1. For simulations over a few TTIs, constant speed for the UE and
the satellite and constant satellite elevation angle may be considered

### 6.9.2 TDL models
The Tapped Delay Line (TDL) models are filtered from the CDL models according
to the section 7.7.4 of TR 38.901 [12] by assuming isotropic UE antenna. Two
TDL models, namely NTN-TDL-A and NTN-TDL-B are constructed to represent two
different channel profiles for NLOS, while NTN-TDL-C and NTN-TDL-D are
constructed for LOS. The parameter of these models can be found in Tables
6.9.2-1 to 6.9.2-4.
Table 6.9.2-1a: Void
Table 6.9.2-1b: Void
The Doppler spectrum for each tap is defined as described in subclause 7.7.2
of TR 38.901. Each TDL model can be scaled in delay to achieve desired RMS
delay spread according to the procedure specified in subclause 7.7.3 of TR
38.901. For LOS channel models, the K-factor of NTN-TDL-C and NTN-TDL-D can be
set to a desired value following the procedure described in subclause 7.7.6 of
TR 38.901.
Additional Doppler shift due to satellite motion should be taken into account
according to the following formula:
,
Where denotes the satellite speed, _c_ denotes the speed of light, _R_ denotes
the earth radius, _h_ denotes the satellite altitude, denotes the satellite
elevation angle, and denotes the carrier frequency.
This additional Doppler shift should be applied to all taps of the TDL model.
The satellite speed, satellite elevation angle and UE speed should be
considered to be constant during the simulation duration, if limited to few

# 7 Potential key impact areas on NR to support NTN
## 7.1 Specific constraints associated to NTN
This clause describes selected specific Non Terrestrial Network design
constraints that need to be addressed when considering the Non-Terrestrial
Network deployment scenarios.
Table 7.1-1: Specific design constraints of Non Terrestrial Network
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Non Terrestrial Network Design | Differences between NTN and | | Constraints | cellular systems | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Propagation channel | As detailed in clause 6, the | | | main differences lies in | | | different multi path delay and | | | Doppler spectrum model . | | | | | | For narrowband signals and | | | frequency bands below 6 GHz, the | | | time dispersion may be ignored. | | | | | | We shall assume outdoor | | | conditions and line-of-sight | | | operations for the UE for | | | communication via satellite. In | | | HAPS system, indoor conditions | | | are also addressed, which | | | implies the need to consider | | | non-line-of-sight conditions as | | | well. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Frequency Plan and channel | The allocated spectrum to a | | Bandwidth | satellite system is respectively | | | 2 x 15 MHz (UL & DL) at S band | | | and about 2 x 2500 MHz (UL & DL) | | | at Ka band. In addition, | | | satellite systems at S and Ka | | | bands use mostly circular | | | polarizations. | | | | | | Frequency re-use and flexibility | | | of spectrum allocation in the | | | different cells may be supported | | | and therefore the maximum | | | channel bandwidth per cell is | | | assumed to be respectively 2 x | | | 15 MHz (UL & DL) at S band and 2 | | | x 800 MHz (UL & DL) at Ka band. | | | | | | For efficient spectrum usage, | | | the system should always | | | minimise the risk of inter cell | | | interference. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Power limited link budget | The main design drivers of | | | satellite and HAPS based | | | communication systems are; | | | | | | - To maximise the throughput | | | for a given transmit power from | | | the UE on the UL and from the | | | satellite/HAPS on the DL. | | | | | | - To maximise the availability | | | of the service under deep fading | | | situations (typically between 20 | | | and 30 dB in Ka band for 99.95% | | | availability) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Cell pattern generation | Space and HAPS systems typically | | | feature larger cells compared to | | | cellular networks. In addition, | | | the cells may be moving (without | | | a fixed earth reference point) | | | in case of NGSO (Non | | | Geostationary Satellite Orbit) | | | satellite or HAPS system. | | | | | | These large cells especially at | | | low operational elevation angles | | | will create a significant | | | differential propagation delay | | | between a UE at cell centre and | | | UE at cell edge and the ratio of | | | the differential increases as | | | the altitude of the satellite | | | and HAPS decreases. In other | | | words, the ratio between | | | propagation delays at cell | | | centre and cell edge is likely | | | to be higher in the context of | | | HAPS as compared to | | | geostationary satellite systems. | | | | | | This will impact contention | | | based access channels when the | | | position of UEs is not known by | | | the network. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Propagation Delay | Satellite systems feature much | | characteristics | larger propagation delays than | | | terrestrial systems. The one-way | | | delay between the UE and the RAN | | | (whether on-board the | | | satellite/HAPS or on the ground) | | | may reach up to 272.4 ms for GSO | | | (Geostationary Synchronous | | | Orbit) systems, and is greater | | | than 14.2 ms for NGSO | | | (Non-Geosynchronous Orbit) | | | systems. In the case of HAPS, | | | the one way delay is less than | | | 1.6 ms and hence comparable with | | | cellular networks. | | | | | | This larger delay will likely | | | impact all signalling loops | | | especially at access and | | | transport (data transfer) | | | levels. | | | | | | The analysis of the propagation | | | delay is detailed in clause 5.3. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Mobility of the | In cellular networks, | | infrastructure\'s transmission | transmission equipment refers to | | equipment | base stations (gNB) or Remote | | | Radio Heads (RRH). They are | | | usually fixed, except when on | | | board a moving platform such as | | | a train. | | | | | | In Non-Terestrial Networks, the | | | transmission equipment is on | | | board the space/HAPS. For GSO | | | systems, the transmission | | | equipment is quasi static with | | | respect to the UE with only | | | small Doppler effects. For HAPS, | | | the transmission equipment is | | | moving around or across a | | | theoretical central point and | | | hence creates Doppler. For NGSO | | | systems, the satellites move | | | relative to the earth and | | | creates higher Doppler effects | | | than for GSO systems. | | | | | | The Doppler depends on the | | | relative satellite/HAPS velocity | | | with respect to the UE, and on | | | the frequency band. Doppler can | | | be characterized by a maximum | | | Doppler Shift and a Doppler | | | variation rate. | | | | | | This effect will continuously | | | modify the carrier frequency, | | | phase and spacing and may create | | | Inter Carrier Interference | | | (ICI). | | | | | | As detailed in clause 5.3, | | | assuming a worst case UE | | | velocity of 1000 km/h: | | | | | | - For LEO in S band (2 GHz): | | | +/- 48kHz Doppler Shift and - | | | 544 Hz/s Doppler variation rate | | | | | | - For LEO in Ka band (20 GHz): | | | +/- 480kHz Doppler Shift and -- | | | 5.44 kHz/s Doppler variation | | | rate | | | | | | - For LEO in Ka band (30 GHz): | | | +/- 720kHz Doppler Shift and -- | | | 8.16 kHz/s Doppler variation | | | rate | | | | | | Note, although these values are | | | high, most of the Doppler shift | | | and Doppler variation rate can | | | be pre/post compensated, | | | exploiting the knowledge of the | | | satellite/HAPS motion that can | | | be anticipated through modelling | | | (e.g. ephemeris of satellites) | | | as well as UE location if known. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Service continuity between | Whenever a UE leaves or enters | | land-based 5G access and | cellular coverage, a hand-over | | non-terrestrial based access | to or from the satellite/HAPS | | networks | system can take place to ensure | | | service continuity. The handover | | | triggering mechanisms might be | | | different for each direction | | | e.g. leave satellite as soon as | | | there is enough cellular signal, | | | but only leave cellular when | | | there is a very low cellular | | | signal. | | | | | | The hand-over procedure should | | | take into account the service | | | enablers, the characteristics | | | and the measurement reports of | | | both access technologies. The | | | following aspects should be | | | considered: | | | | | | - Support both non-transparent | | | air/spaceborne (on-board | | | processing) and bent-pipe | | | architectures | | | | | | - Handover preparation and HO | | | failure/RLF handling | | | | | | - Time synchronization | | | | | | - Measurement object | | | coordination -- incl. gap | | | allocation & alignment | | | | | | - Lossless handover support | | | | | | - Specifics related to | | | intra-Non Terrestrial network | | | mobility, as well as between | | | Non-Terrestrial and Cellular | | | networks | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Radio resource management | In order to support varying | | adapted to network topology | traffic demand while also taking | | | UE mobility requirements into | | | account, requires minimal | | | response time of the access | | | control functionality. | | | | | | In cellular systems, access | | | control is typically located in | | | the gNB close to the UE. | | | Moreover coordination between | | | gNBs is possible through the Xn | | | interface (between gNBs | | | interface) or via a central | | | entity. | | | | | | In satellite systems, access | | | control is mostly located at | | | satellite base station, gateway | | | or hub level which may prevent | | | optimal response time for access | | | control. Hence, pre-grants, Semi | | | Persistent Scheduling (SPS) | | | and/or grant free access scheme | | | would be beneficial. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Terminal mobility | The challenge is to support very | | | high speed UEs such as aircraft | | | systems featuring maximum speeds | | | of 1000 km/h (see 3GPP TS 22.261 | | | [6]). | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
## 7.2 NR features/protocols potentially affected
This clause identifies the NR Features/protocols **in bold** that may require
some adaptations to support operation via Satellite or HAPS. Other solutions
may be identified but don\'t require adaptations of the standard.
Table 7.2-1: NR Features/protocols that may require some adaptations to
support operations via Satellite or HAPS
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Non-Terrestrial | Impacted NR areas | NR Features that may | | Network design | | require adaptations | | constraints | | to support NR | | | | operation via | | | | Satellite or HAPS | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Propagation channel | Physical Layer | For satellite-based | | | | systems the signal | | | | is mostly direct LOS | | | | and follows a Ricean | | | | distibution with | | | | strong direct signal | | | | component; slow | | | | fading is possible, | | | | due to temporary | | | | signal masking e.g. | | | | under trees and | | | | bridges. | | | | | | | | For HAPS based | | | | systems, the signal | | | | contains significant | | | | multipath components | | | | and follows a Ricean | | | | model. Similarly to | | | | cellular systems, a | | | | frequent and fast | | | | fading of max 100 ms | | | | coherence time is | | | | expected, mainly due | | | | to signal components | | | | recombination. | | | | | | | | To improve | | | | performance, the | | | | receivers\' | | | | synchronisation | | | | configuration at | | | | both UE and gNB | | | | level, could be | | | | adapted especially: | | | | | | | | - The **Reference | | | | signals** in the | | | | physical signals | | | | (e.g. DL: PSS, SSS, | | | | Reference Signals; | | | | UL: DMRS, SRS), the | | | | **Preamble sequence | | | | and aggregation** | | | | (related to random | | | | access channel), to | | | | take into account | | | | the Doppler and | | | | possibly some | | | | specific multi path | | | | channel model. | | | | | | | | - The **Cyclic | | | | Prefix** to | | | | compensate for the | | | | delay spread and the | | | | jitter/phase. The | | | | **sub-carrier | | | | spacing** (SCS) of | | | | the OFDM signal may | | | | be extended with | | | | greater SCS values | | | | to accommodate | | | | larger Doppler (To | | | | Be Confirmed). | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Frequency plan and | Physical Layer | The **carrier | | channel Bandwidth | | numbering** could be | | | | reviewed to support | | | | the targeted | | | | spectrum (S band, Ka | | | | band) and the | | | | **pairing between | | | | UL/DL bands** with | | | | specific band | | | | separation. | | | | | | | | Specifically, for Ka | | | | band NTN deployment | | | | scenarios, the 5G | | | | radio interface mode | | | | foreseen for above 6 | | | | GHz bands shall be | | | | configured to | | | | support FDD access | | | | scheme (e.g. with | | | | two mono directional | | | | carriers operated in | | | | opposite direction | | | | on both UL and DL | | | | bands). This will | | | | require the system | | | | to configure and | | | | possibly **adapt the | | | | MAC and network | | | | layer** signalling | | | | in a specific | | | | manner. | | | | | | | | The **carrier | | | | bandwidth** could be | | | | extended up to a | | | | maximum of 800 MHz. | | | | Alternatively | | | | **carrier | | | | aggregation** method | | | | can be used to | | | | provide equivalent | | | | throughput while | | | | enabling a greater | | | | flexibility of | | | | carrier allocation | | | | between the cells | | | | while respecting | | | | frequency reuse | | | | constraints. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Power limited link | Physical Layer | To maximise the | | budget | | throughput / power | | | | ratio, the operation | | | | point in the power | | | | amplifier at | | | | satellite or at the | | | | UE shall be set as | | | | close as possible to | | | | the saturation | | | | point, when needed. | | | | To support this, | | | | several techniques | | | | can be considered | | | | and possibly | | | | combined together: | | | | | | | | - Extended | | | | multicarrier | | | | **modulation and | | | | coding schemes** | | | | especially for the | | | | UL that features low | | | | Peak to Average | | | | Power Ratio (PAPR) | | | | that are more robust | | | | against distortions | | | | | | | | - PAPR reduction | | | | and nonlinear | | | | distortion | | | | mitigation through | | | | signal processing | | | | techniques (e.g. | | | | pre-distortion | | | | mechanisms). | | | | | | | | - Operating the | | | | high power amplifier | | | | (UE and | | | | satellite/HAPS | | | | level) with the | | | | minimum output | | | | back-off if | | | | necessary. | | | | | | | | To maximise the | | | | signal availability | | | | with slow and deep | | | | fading, especially | | | | for UE at cell edge, | | | | it is recommended to | | | | provide **modulation | | | | and coding schemes** | | | | featuring very low | | | | SNR operating points | | | | or other | | | | alternatives | | | | especially for mMTC | | | | service enablers. | | | | This may lead to | | | | extend the | | | | Modulation Coding | | | | Scheme of NR towards | | | | very low Es/No to | | | | meet the reliability | | | | requirements of | | | | critical | | | | communications or | | | | low energy | | | | consumption | | | | scenarios. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Power limited link | MAC layer (Resource | To maximise the | | budget | Allocation) | spectral efficiency | | | | and accommodate | | | | limited power | | | | terminals, the MAC | | | | layer should be able | | | | to allocate | | | | **Physical Resource | | | | Blocks** in the most | | | | flexible way. | | | | Reduced size of | | | | **Physical Resource | | | | Blocks** should be | | | | considered (e.g. | | | | single tone | | | | transmission or | | | | transmission over | | | | one OFDM sub carrier | | | | of same or larger | | | | bandwidth than a | | | | single OFDM | | | | carrier). | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Cell pattern | Physical layer | The differential | | generation | | delay due to large | | | | cell size may create | | | | near far effect | | | | between UEs during | | | | the **initial access | | | | procedure** when the | | | | UEs positions are | | | | not known. This may | | | | require an extended | | | | acquisition window | | | | to improve | | | | performance. | | | | | | | | Note however that if | | | | the UE position | | | | becomes known during | | | | a session, the | | | | differential delay | | | | can be compensated | | | | by the network. | | | | | | | | For broadcast | | | | service, specific | | | | signalling may be | | | | needed to | | | | accommodate the | | | | larger and moving | | | | cells. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Propagation Delay | Physical layer | User traffic, such | | characteristics | | as voice or video | | | | conference services, | | | | is latency and | | | | jitter sensitive. | | | | | | | | In cellular | | | | networks, HARQ | | | | retransmission may | | | | lead to jitter (e.g. | | | | typically up to 8ms | | | | in the case of LTE | | | | FDD mode). A | | | | mitigation scheme | | | | called TTI Bundling | | | | on UL is defined.

## 7.3 NR modifications to support the Non-Terrestrial Network deployment
scenarios
For each deployment scenarios, the [actual]{.underline} impacts on NR are
identified.
### 7.3.1 Methodology
For each of the NR Features that may require adaptations to support NR
operation via Satellite or HAPS, identified in chapter 7.2, the problem
statement in terms of issue are assessed, potential areas of impact on NR
protocol are identified.

### 7.3.2 Motion of the space/aerial vehicles
#### 7.3.2.1 Hand-Over and paging
##### 7.3.2.1.1 Problem statement
NGSO satellites move rapidly with respect to any given UE location. As an
example, on a 2-hour orbit, a LEO satellite is in view of a stationary UE from
horizon to horizon for about 20 minutes. Since each LEO satellite may have
many beams, the time such a UE stays within a beam is typically for only a few
minutes. The fast pace of change creates problems for paging as well as
handoffs for a stationary UE as well as a moving UE.
Since handover happens in general when the UE or relay is in CM-ACTIVE and
RRC-CONNECTED state, the procedure is time critical to avoid loss data. In NTN
systems based on NGSO satellites, the cells or spot beams are moving at high
speeds and so the handover procedure from one spot beam to the next or from
one satellite to the next has to be executed quickly otherwise the UE may not
make use the target beam and/or satellite resources efficiently and in the
worst case may suffer loss of data.
NR beam management for mobility between spot-beams on the same base station
cannot be ported to satellite to minimize the handoff overhead. The NR beam
management might assume same frequency on the adjacent beams, but for, the
adjacent beams on the same satellite may use different frequencies or
different polarization. Thus, the beam management procedures may have to be
modified.
The problem for paging needs more detailed explanation. In NR based cellular
networks, a UE camps on a cell. The cell is uniquely identified by the RAN
from which the UE is receiving the radio signals from. A collection of cells
is called a Tracking Area. A collection of Tracking Areas is called as a
Registration Area. A cell belongs to a Tracking area and a Registration Area.
As long as the UE stays within a Registration Area, no location update is
needed. The UE in the CM-IDLE state will perform a Registration Area update
when it moves out of a Tracking Area.
The AMF only needs be aware of the UE location to the granularity of
Registration Area when a UE is in the CM-IDLE state. If a packet arrives from
internet for this UE in CM-IDLE state, the AMF attempts to page the UE on all
cells belonging to the Registration Area in order to notify the arrival of
packets to it. All RANs that receive the page transmits a page in the
corresponding cells to reach UE that may be anywhere in the Registration Area.
In Non-GEO satellite access network, a UE camps on a beam of a satellite, but
as beams move, it ends up camping on different beams and different satellites
over time even though UE may not have moved. Unlike terrestrial framework
where a cell on the ground is tied to radio communication with a RAN, in Non-
GEO satellite access network, the satellite beams are moving. There is no
correspondence between cells on the ground and satellite beams. The same cell
on the ground is covered by different satellites and different beams over
time. Therefore, for the initial Registration, the Satellite based radio
access network will not be able to provide the Tracking Area information to
AMF based on which beam and which satellite the Registration Request was
received. Given that tracking areas are defined on the ground and Non-GEO
beams are moving, there is no one-to-one correspondence between moving beams
and fixed tracking areas or registration areas on the ground. However, this
information is necessary for UE to determine if it needs to perform a
registration area update with AMF in NR.
##### 7.3.2.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
For handover and paging to operate successfully and efficiently in the NGSO
satellite networks, the NR UEs may need to be capable of geo-location. One
possibility is that the NR UE may be aware of their locations and may report
this to the satellite RAN if needed. (For fixed installations, their location
can be reported once at time of installation.)
The ephemeris information of the NGSO satellites can be used to determine
their footprints of each of the beams, and its velocity all the time.
Therefore, for a given UE location at any given time, the network has
information as to which beam of which satellite covers that location best. It
also knows the duration that UE location would remain to be covered by the
beam and which beam on the same satellite, or a different satellite will be
the best candidate to switch over next, and at what time. If positioning
information of the UEs is available at the network, the possibility to
simplify handover procedure and reduce measurement reporting overhead require
further study.
##### 7.3.2.1.3 NR impact considerations
No impact for HAPS or GEO satellite based NTN. For Non-GEO satellite based
NTN, adaptation of the NR handover and paging protocols needs further study
possibly taking advantage of the knowledge of the UE location and satellite
ephemeris information.
#### 7.3.2.2 TA adjustment
##### 7.3.2.2.1 Problem statement
MEO, LEO and HAPS systems feature a strong varying delay because
satellite/HAPS and UE are fast-moving and are not relatively static. In this
case, the individual timing advances of the UEs may need to be dynamically
updated and appropriate TA index values may be needed to solve the long strong
delay in the overall distance of the propagation on NTN link.
The issues or technical problems to solve, related to TA alignment in
Satellite communications, are as follows:
1\. A strong delay variation is caused by moving satellites generating a fast
change in the overall distance of the propagation from UE over Satellite to
BS.
2\. The delay is much longer over a satellite link than one TTI.
A strong delay variation is caused by moving satellites generating a fast
change in the overall distance of the radio link between UE and BS via
satellite. The delay is much higher and variable over a satellite radio link
than over a terrestrial radio link. This delay largely exceeds the TTI
(Equivalent to one frame) of NR which is equal to or less than 1 ms. However,
the delay variation is quite predictable knowing the satellite orbits and UE
position.
Hence, TA alignment is an important feature of NR that will be impacted by
introduction of NTN in 5G to ensure that all uplink transmissions are
synchronized at gNB reception point.
##### 7.3.2.2.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
A timing advance command [20], $T_{A}$, for a TAG indicates adjustment of the
current $N_{\text{TA}}$ value, $N_{\text{TA_old}}$, to the new $N_{\text{TA}}$
value, $N_{\text{TA_new}}$, by index values of $T_{A}$ = 0, 1, 2,..., 63,
where for a subcarrier spacing of $2^{\mu} \cdot \text{15}$ kHz,
$N_{\text{TA_new}} = N_{\text{TA_old}} + \left( T_{A} - \text{31} \right)
\cdot \text{16} \cdot \text{64}/2^{\mu}$.
As shown in Figure 7.3.2.2.2-1, transmission of uplink frame number
{width="5.2083333333333336e-2in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} from the UE
shall start {width="1.7083333333333333in" height="0.1875in"} before the start
of the corresponding downlink frame {width="5.2083333333333336e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} at the UE, where
{width="0.22916666666666666in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} can be derived
by the UE based on the index value {width="0.14583333333333334in"

height="0.16666666666666666in"} is the basic timing unit [21][22][23].
{width="6.0472222222222225in" height="3.4090277777777778in"}
Figure 7.3.2.2.2-1: Time alignment at gNB with TA
In case of satellite, the high delay drift of individual non-GEO satellites is
quite predictable because the motion of the satellites follows known paths.
The very fast update of the TA is neither required in terrestrial links, nor
in GEO satellite links. In both scenarios, the terminal mobility is dominating
the TA requirements.
Another technical issue that arises is that the delay variation over the
satellite link is much more than a TTI. E.g. if the SCS is increasing from 15
kHz to 60 kHz, the TTI goes down from 1 ms to 250 μs. The required TA
adjustment range for satellite links will become larger that the TTI with any
SCS selection and the transmission timing of the UE has to be adjusted over
the borders of individual TTIs.
Table 7.3.2.2.2-1: TA granularity, and step size with SCS
* * *
Subcarrier spacing (SCS) configuration parameter, µ SCS [kHz] RB band-width
[kHz] TA gran-ularity [Ts] T~step~ [ns] Max Ta step size [µs] 0 15 180 1024

* * *
This max Ta step should be valid only for extended cyclic prefix. With normal
cyclic prefix, we expect this maximum step not to exceed the normal CP length
(e.g. CP length is 4.7 µs in 15kHz SCS case). It means that the number of Ta
commands to be sent per second to track the maximum drift of 35 µs/s is about
10 per second for 15 kHz SCS case, 40 per second for 60 kHz SCS, and 80 per
second for 120 kHz SCS case. The number of Ta commands to be sent per second
is important but can be implemented.
##### 7.3.2.2.3 NR impact considerations
Solutions need to be studied to ensure alignment of uplink signals over the
NTN links to overcome the predictable delay of NTN.
#### 7.3.2.3 Initial synchronization in downlink
##### 7.3.2.3.1 Problem statement
In order to access the 5G network, the UE has to detect the PSS and the SSS.
Those synchronization signals allow time and frequency correction, and Cell Id
detection. UE in cellular network has to get good one-shot detection
probability at -6 dB received baseband SNR condition with less than 1% false
alarm rate as defined in chapter 7.1.5 of [24], with robustness against
initial frequency offset up to 5 ppm.
We expect that requirements (SNR level of -6 dB, frequency error robustness of
5 ppm and 1% false alarm) defined for terrestrial UE will be kept the same for
NTN UE. Even if the SNR level of NTN systems is typically in the range of -3
to 13 dB SNR.
In cellular networks, transmission equipment (gNB or RRH) are usually fixed,
except when on board a moving platform such as a train.
In Non-Terrestrial Networks, the transmission equipment is on board the
satellite/HAPS.
\- For geostationary systems, the transmission equipment is quasi static with
respect to the UE with only small Doppler shift.
\- For HAPS, the transmission equipment is moving around or across a
theoretical central point but creates small Doppler shift.
\- For non-geostationary systems, the satellites move relative to the earth
and creates higher Doppler shift than for geostationary systems.
The Doppler shift depends on the relative satellite/HAPS velocity with respect
to the UE, and on the frequency band.
In term of Doppler shift, the worst case for NTN systems corresponds to non-
geostationary systems, at lowest altitude (i.e. 600 km), where the speed of
the satellite embedding transmission equipment is 7.5 km/s.
As detailed in clause 5.3, assuming a worst case NTN terminal velocity of 1000
km/h:
\- For LEO in S band (2 GHz): Up to +/- 48kHz Doppler Shift in downlink for
the whole satellite coverage (spot)
\- For LEO in Ka band (20 GHz): Up to +/- 480kHz Doppler Shift in downlink for
the whole satellite coverage (spot)
If frequency error robustness requirement is 5 ppm (i.e. 10kHz for S band, 100
kHz for Ka band), it means that this worst case described above is not covered
by current 5G specifications. To be inferior or equal to 5ppm error, the
satellite altitude has to be above 13000 km.
Actually, the Doppler shift amplitude to be compensated is less than 48 kHz
for S band and 480 kHz for Ka band, because in satellite communication
systems, all satellites whether GSO or NGSO generate multi beams and each beam
foot print corresponds to a cell. The Max Doppler shift amplitude observed at
the satellite coverage foot print edges will be reduced within each beam
footprint. The lower the beam width, the less the Doppler shift amplitude.
##### 7.3.2.3.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
In case the altitude of the satellite is above a certain altitude (about 13
000 km) or if center beam pre-compensation is sufficient to reach the 5 ppm
requirements, no impact is foreseen.
##### 7.3.2.3.3 NR impact considerations
In case the above conditions are not met, further studies are required to
accommodate the high Doppler shift during the cell synchronization procedure
in non-Terrestrial networks.
Note that this high Doppler shift can be known based on UE location and
satellite ephemeris and hence could be for example pre compensated. This could
prevent impact on the NR but may need to be confirmed with further study.
#### 7.3.2.4 DMRS time density
##### 7.3.2.4.1 Problem statement
As analyzed in Section 5.3, the maximum Doppler variation rates during the
field tests appeared in the scenarios of LEO at the altitude of 600 km, and
are -544 Hz/s with carrier frequency of 2 GHz, -5.44 kHz/s with carrier
frequency of 20Ghz and -8.16 kHz/s with carrier frequency of 30 GHz, where the
maximum Doppler variation rate is the maximum slope (maximum derivative) of
the Doppler shift curves. In NR network, there are up to 4 DMRS symbols per
slot and the duration of one slot can be configured to 1 ms, 0.5 ms, 0.25 ms,
0.125 ms or 0.0625 ms, which correspond to the subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz,
30 kHz, 60 kHz, 120 kHz and 240 kHz respectively, as shown in Figure
7.3.2.4.1-1. Table 7.3.2.4.1-1 summarizes the potential maximum Doppler shift
in one slot in NTN based on the observed maximum Doppler variation rate during
the field tests. As shown in Table 7.3.2.4.1-1, it is observed that the
potential maximum Doppler shifts are up to 0.544 Hz with carrier frequency of
2 GHz in DL/UL, up to 5.44 Hz with carrier frequency of 20 GHz in DL and up to
8.16 Hz with carrier frequency of 30 GHz in UL.

In the existing LTE network, the frequency error at the UE side shall be
within ±0.1 PPM observed over a period of 0.5 ms [25]. In NR network, the
frequency error at the UE side shall be within ±0.1 PPM observed over a period
of 1 ms[26].
##### 7.3.2.4.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
The frequency error corresponding to ±0.1 PPM is ±200 Hz with carrier
frequency of 2 GHz, ±2 kHz with carrier frequency of 20 GHz and ±3 kHz with
carrier frequency of 30 GHz. Compared to the requirement of frequency error at
the UE side, the maximum Doppler shift in one slot in LEO scenarios during
field test is negligible, see Table 7.3.2.4.1-1. This result is also valid for
other configurations with higher DMRS time density per time slot as
configurable in 5G NR. Similar conclusion could be observed at the eNB side
too [27][40].
##### 7.3.2.4.3 NR impact considerations
As a conclusion, no impact on NR specifications is needed for DMRS positioning
in time in NTN deployment scenarios because the maximum Doppler Variation in
NTN is negligible compared to the minimum requirement of frequency error at
both gNB and UE sides in NR.
### 7.3.3 Altitude of the space/aerial vehicles
#### 7.3.3.1 HARQ
The HARQ process is a very time-critical mechanism. HARQ operation becomes
even more critical at extremely long RTT, i.e., as in case of NTN and extreme
coverage scenarios.
In satellite communication, the RTT normally exceeds the maximum conventional
HARQ timers (after which an ACK is received) or the maximum possible number of
HARQ processes (i.e., a flexible pool of parallel HARQ processes similar to
LTE). This is also true even for LEO constellations, where the RTT varies
between 15 to 63 times longer than that of the terrestrial RTT [28]. Thereby,
simply extending the number of HARQ processes linearly to RTT induced by the
satellite channel might not be feasible for some UEs due to memory
restrictions and the maximum possible parallel processing channels
[41][42][43][44][45]. Furthermore, gNBs also have to consider this latency
impact on the number of their active HARQ processes. Therefore, it is
important to study the impact on NR HARQ operation for the introduced NTN
delays. Figure 7.3.3.1-1 depicts the HARQ feedback RTT, i.e., from data
retransmission time up to acknowledge reception at a bent-pipe satellite. The
figure also shows the backhauling delay {width="0.1875in"

##### 7.3.3.1.1 Problem statement
NR has extended the number of HARQ processes in Rel. 15 to 16 processes [29].
For NR NTN satellite transmission, the number of HARQ processes may need to be
further extended flexibly according to the induced RTT delay. Here, the
minimum required number of HARQ processes can be computed directly from the
RTT delay of each satellite constellation, e.g., LEO, MEO and GEO, using the
following formula [28]:
{width="1.1354166666666667in" height="0.2604166666666667in"} (7.3.3.1-1)
where {width="0.5833333333333334in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} is the
minimum required number of HARQ processes, {width="0.25in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} is 1ms assuming a reference numerology 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing, and {width="0.3541666666666667in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"} is the time duration between the initial
transmission of one transport block (TB) and the corresponding ACK/NACK
complete decoding.
The {width="0.3541666666666667in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} is depicted
in Figure 7.3.3.1.1-1 considering the RTT ({width="0.3645833333333333in"
height="0.1875in"}), transmission time ({width="0.4583333333333333in"

respectively. {width="0.3541666666666667in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} is

##### 7.3.3.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in non-terrestrial
networks
Handling a higher number of parallel HARQ processes and its feasibility for
NTN have been addressed in [46] [41] [32]. The impacts of NTN delays on the
existing HARQ-supporting mechanisms need to be addressed in a subsequent
study.
At least the following principles can be considered in further study:
**\- Enhancing existing HARQ operation** to extend the HARQ processing
accommodating low to moderate NTN RTT delays.
**\- Limiting HARQ capabilities and/or disabling HARQ** for long RTT delays.
##### 7.3.3.1.3 NR impact considerations
It is required to study the impact on NR HARQ operation due to the long RTT
delay of a non-terrestrial network. The impacts should be considered as well
for the NTN UEs and serving gNBs, when the number of HARQ processes is either
extended to satisfy high reliability scenarios or limited/disabled for longer
NTN delays.
#### 7.3.3.2 MAC/RLC procedures
##### 7.3.3.2.1 Problem statement
UE operating in GEO satellite access networks can experience a one-way
propagation time of 240 ms at the minimum, 270 ms at the maximum between UE
and satellite base station. The base station can observe the acknowledgement
of packets sent to the UE only after the round trip plus some processing time,
which is more than ½ second later. Similarly the UE can observe
acknowledgement for its packet sent to the base station in about the same time
interval. For the LEO satellite systems with typical 600 km orbit, the one way
propagation delay changes continuously between 2 ms when the satellite is
directly above, and 7 ms when the satellite is seen with 10° elevation.
ARQ requires that the transmitted packets be buffered in anticipation of
potential packet loss and released only after the successful receipt of an
acknowledgement, or until a time-out mechanism reinitiating a retransmission.
The long round trip delay requires larger transmission buffer, and potentially
limits the number of retransmission allowed for each transmitted packet in
both the forward and return links. Note that in LEO satellite systems, the ARQ
transmit buffer size, and retransmission mechanism must be designed for the
longest possible delay, i.e. at the lowest elevation.
Scheduling mechanisms must be able to cope with the long RTT. UL scheduling
delay parameters are expected to be redefined to accommodate the RTT of the
associated deployment scenario.
##### 7.3.3.2.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
For efficient ARQ operation in GEO or NGSO satellite networks, NR UE and base
stations must size their transmission buffer and the retransmission time-out
mechanism according to the longest round-trip delay to be anticipated. The
number of retransmissions allowed before a packet is dropped from the
retransmission buffer may also be adjusted.
UL scheduling delay parameters are expected to be redefined to accommodate the
RTT of the associated deployment scenario.
##### 7.3.3.2.3 NR impact considerations
No impacts on the ARQ protocol itself, except parameter sizing needs to
account for the longer delay of the NTN network.
#### 7.3.3.3 Physical layer procedures (ACM, power control)
##### 7.3.3.3.1 Problem statement
As mentioned in section 7.3.3.2.1, UE operating in GEO satellite access
networks can experience a one-way propagation time up to 270 msec. Using LEO
satellite access network with 600 km orbit, the one way propagation delay
changes continuously between 2 ms, and 7 ms. The slow reaction time is
expected to have performance impact on some of the physical layer procedures
particularly those with close loops such as power control and ACM.
##### 7.3.3.3.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
While slower reaction on the control loops affects the performance of all the
control loops between UE and base station, most of them require some
adjustments in implementation, but not fundamentally different design.
While the link margin may be different for specific links and systems
depending on applications, satellite power is typically at a premium. Due to
the large free space loss and limited EIRP and battery power available at UE,
power margin is also limited for mobile terminals. Thus, a very limited amount
of power control, if at all, is available for the GEO satellite links. Due to
the long delay in the loop, the power control is not expected to track fast
fading, but may be used to track slower power variations.
For Ka-band satellites, ACM is an essential tool that maintains connection
through rain fades, which typically changes somewhat slower than the ½ second
round trip delay. It generally works well with some hysteresis to avoid
excessive oscillations between two ACM modulation coding modes. But, this
reaction time is too slow for ACM to adapt for changes of signal strength for
mobile terminals when line of sight is interrupted by shadowing.
For GEO systems in S-band, the main issue is multipath fading, which can be
much faster than ½ second round trip delay. As such, ACM will not be able to
follow it. ACM algorithm typically attempts to settle on a modulation coding
mode that closes the link if possible, by giving up some power to maintain a
margin.
For LEO satellites, ACM may also be used to adapt for the large variation of
free space loss. The variation is sufficiently slow compared to the 20 ms
worst case round trip delay. It should also be able to react to shadowing
fades to a large extent, but still unable to follow fast fading.
##### 7.3.3.3.3 NR impact considerations
Further studies need to be performed to define the required margin for power
and ACM control loops to accommodate to the long RTT.
### 7.3.4 Cell size (Beam foot print)
#### 7.3.4.1 PRACH and Random access
##### 7.3.4.1.1 Problem statement
_The RTT in NTN can be much larger than the RTT in terrestrial network as
analyzed in Section 5.3. Therefore, it is necessary to consider its impact on
PRACH and random access procedure. As shown in_ Figure 7.3.4.1.1-1, for one
given beam covering a cell, there is one common propagation delay for all
served UEs and one relative propagation delay for each served UE. _If the
common propagation delay can be compensated, then the NTN PRACH signal design
will depend on the relative propagation delay, which is limited up to 200km in
current specifications regarding TA range. However even if only the difference
value left, a NTN PRACH signal design and PRACH procedure design are still
needed since the common propagation delay could be thousands of kilometers
which cannot be ignored._

Figure 7.3.4.1.1-1: NTN systems, new geometry and the cell size
##### 7.3.4.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
**[Random Access Response]{.underline}**
For non-terrestrial networks, the round-trip time can be much larger than the
round-trip time in terrestrial networks (up to 600 ms for the case of GEO
satellites, with bent pipe architecture). However the current window for the
PRACH response in NR, which starts at $\left\lceil \left( \Delta \cdot
N_{\text{slot}}^{\text{subframe,}\text{.}\mu} \cdot
N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}} \right)/T_{\text{sf}} \right\rceil \cdot
T_{\text{sf}}/\left( N_{\text{slot}}^{\text{subframe,}\text{.}\mu} \cdot
N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}} \right)$ symbols after transmitting the last
symbol of the preamble and has the size of \"rar-WindowLength\", cannot cover
this round-trip time [30]. Therefore, the random access response window length
in NR should be revisited to accommodate the round-trip time of NTN. However,
extending the RA response window size in the existing procedure introduces
unnecessary UE monitoring intervals thus more power saving due to large
propagation delay in NTNs. Therefore, the solution to handle long propagation
delay with the consideration of power saving at the UE side needs to be
further studied.
**[PRACH Sequence and Format]{.underline}**
Considering that the cell size of NTN HAPS is not extremely large, the current
NR preamble format design should be enough to support HAPS. The current NR
preamble format design should be enough to support HAPS but for Satellite it
needs to be revisited [30][31][23][39][32]. As shown _in Figure 7.3.4.1.1-1,_
the difference d3 = d2 -- d1 depends on the elevation angle, as listed in
Table 7.3.4.1.2-1.
Table 7.3.4.1.2-1 Differential _delay_ d3 = d2 -- d1 vs. satellite elevation
angle

{width="0.15625in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}[degree] cell radius

* * *
Clearly, the difference d3 exceeds the maximum cell coverage supported by the
NR preamble format of 2x 100 km for satellite elevation angles below 60
degrees. In such a case, NR preamble format needs to be extended for NTN
system considering different footprint of NTN cells. So it should be further
studied if new random access preamble format is needed for spaceborne
vehicles.
The effect of the residual differential delay may be mitigated as follows:
\- Case 1: NTN differential delay ≤ Max currently specified NR PRACH CP
duration.\ In this case no change is required to the specified NR RACH
procedure.
\- Case 2: NTN differential delay > Max currently specified NR PRACH CP
duration.\ In this case different solutions are possible which are for further
study.
**[RACH Procedure]{.underline}**
For PRACH procedure, huge propagation delay [66.7μs, 120ms] [3] corresponding
to BS heights [8km, 35786km] will lead to long RA response procedure [33][32].
As a result, it is necessary to shorten the RA transmission/retransmission
delay and design an NTN-specific RAR window based on the given BS information
to make the UE efficient and power saving.
##### 7.3.4.1.3 NR impact considerations
Regarding NR PRACH waveform/format, no NR spec impacts are identified if the
GNSS based techniques are applicable at the UE side, otherwise, potential
enhancements w.r.t PRACH waveform/format may be needed which are for further
study. For RACH procedures, potential enhancements can be studied regardless
of whether the GNSS based techniques are applicable or not.
#### 7.3.4.2 TA in Random access response message
##### 7.3.4.2.1 Problem statement
The Timing advance mechanisms ensure that transmissions from all UEs operating
in the same cell are synchronized when received by the same gNB. A TA command
is provided to the UE in a RAR message during initial access, as well as
later, to adjust the uplink transmission timing for PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS. TA
adjustment is analyzed in Section 7.3.2.2.
The timing advance ({width="0.22916666666666666in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}) is given by:
{width="1.1458333333333333in" height="0.3125in"}
where {width="0.9791666666666666in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} and TA is
an integer between 0 and 3846.
The maximum value of the TA command sent in RAR message constraints the
maximum distance between an UE and the serving base station, which also
defines the maximum allowed cell size, as illustrated in Table 7.3.4.2.1-1.
Table 7.3.4.2.1-1: Terrestrial link distance for 5G NR
+---------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------+ | Sub | 15 kHz | 30 kHz | 60 kHz | 120 kHz | 240 kHz | 480 kHz | | carrier | | | | | | | | spacing | µ= 0 | µ= 1 | µ= 2 | µ= 3 | µ= 4 | µ= 5 | +---------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------+ | ** | 0.67 | 0.335 | 0.1675 | 0.0838 | 0.0419 | 0.0209 | | Maximum | | | | | | | | timing | | | | | | | | advance | | | | | | | | (ms)**| | | | | | | +---------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------+ | ** | 300 | 150 | 75 | 37.5 | 18.75 | 9.38 | | Maximum | | | | | | | | link | | | | | | | | d | | | | | | | | istance | | | | | | | | (TA = | | | | | | | | 3846) | | | | | | | | (km)** | | | | | | | +---------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------+
Even at 15kHz, the maximum cell size is below the satellite altitude, for both
LEO and GEO scenarios. Therefore, it is not expected that the timing advance
mechanism can be reused as is for satellite networks.
For HAPS scenarios, the HAPS altitude is quite negligible compared to the
maximum link distance for low numerology. In these cases, the maximum allowed
cell size for terrestrial operations needs to be slightly reduced to ensure
the maximum link distance is never exceeded. For high numerology however, the
maximum link distance may be smaller than the HAPS altitude, leading to the
same conclusion as for satellite operations.
##### 7.3.4.2.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
**Compensation of entire propagation delay by TA**
For satellite operations, it is expected that TA mechanism cannot be reused as
is to compensate for the propagation delay. For HAPS operations, the mechanism
can be reused as is in some cases (low numerology and/or low HAPS altitude).
The maximum cell size shall then be redefined to ensure that the maximum
allowed link distance is never exceeded.
**Common delay known and handled by the network**
In this case, TA compensates only for differential delay/distance, so that the
maximum TA value defines the maximum allowed differential delay/distance.
Considering Figure 7.3.4.1.1-1, it can be easily shown that the maximum
differential distance is achieved when {width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} is minimum. As shown in Table 7.3.4.2.2-1, the
maximum differential distance is almost equal to the maximum cell diameter for
{width="0.53125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}.
Table 7.3.4.2.2-1: Maximum cell size for {width="0.6145833333333334in"

* * *
In first approximation, it can be stated that the existing TA mechanism can
compensate the differential delay if the cell diameter does not exceed the
maximum link distance given in Table 7.3.4.2.1-1.
##### 7.3.4.2.3 NR impact considerations
In HAPS operations, extension of the maximum TA value could be considered to
extend the maximum allowed cell size, especially for high numerology.
In satellite operations, it is expected that the network can take into account
the common propagation delay. To extend the maximum cell size, different
approaches can be studied further.
### 7.3.5 Propagation channel
#### 7.3.5.1 DMRS frequency density
##### 7.3.5.1.1 Problem statement
For PDSCH, the mapping to physical resources of the Demodulation reference
signals is described in chapter 7.4.1.1.2 of [21] recalled below. There is
either one DM-RS symbol per slot or 2 in consecutive OFDM symbols within a
slot. The resource elements of this DM-RS symbol are scattered over different
subcarriers according to two configuration types.
In configuration type 1, DM-RS symbols are inserted every 2 subcarriers in
PDSCH. In configuration type 2, DM-RS symbols are inserted every 5 subcarriers
in PDSCH.

For PBCH, the mapping to physical resources of the Demodulation reference
signals is specified in Table 7.4.3.1-1 of [21]. DM-RS are inserted every four
subcarriers in PBCH on all OFDM symbols.
For PDCCH, the DM-RS symbols are inserted every 4 subcarriers as for PBCH
(chapter 7.4.1.3.2 in [21]).

The minimum coherence bandwidth for each NTN deployment scenario can be
computed with the following formula:
Minimum coherence bandwidth = 1/(alpha *delay spread)
with alpha being a constant between 1 and 50. As a worst case, it is set to 50
for the DM-RS mapping selection. The maximum delay spread depends on the UE
antenna directivity.

each deployment scenario

NOTE 1: In Ka band, typical antenna directivity is taken into account in the
delay spead estimate
NOTE 2: In S band, delay spread in satellite scenarios is lower than in HAPS
scenario, because the min operating SNR is lower which leads to discard
largest delay spread.
##### 7.3.5.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
For S band, the minimal coherence bandwidth has been computed with the formula
in the previous clause and an alpha value corresponding to a theoretical worst
case (Alpha set to 50). This may put some constraints on the SCS value
selection which needs to be further studied.
##### 7.3.5.1.3 NR impact considerations
Enhancement to NR specifications with respect to DMRS frequency diversity may
not be needed depending on possible SCS choice constraints that needs to be
further studied.
#### 7.3.5.2 Cyclic prefix
##### 7.3.5.2.1 Problem statement
Originally, the NR CP has been dimensioned for terrestrial transmissions
characterized by high delay spread due to multi path propagation. This clause
describes selection criteria of the CP that need to be addressed when
considering using NR in Non-Terrestrial Network deployment scenarios.
##### 7.3.5.2.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
**Delay spread in satellite propagation channels**
Signal echoes are associated to the presence of indirect rays that reach the
receiver antenna and carry a significant energy with respect to the energy of
the direct ray.
ITU-R recommendation [34] defines for the 2 GHz band three parameter sets of
wideband models, including LOS and NLOS cases, applicable for an elevation
range from 15 to 55° and for urban, suburban and rural environments. The delay
spread of these three parameter sets ranges between 180 ns to 250 ns, whereas
the 250 ns are stated to cover 90% of the cases.
For higher elevations than 55°, we assume that the delay spread of the
satellite channel will be in the same range or even lower due to the traveling
distances of the echoes arriving at a receiver.
Few papers are available on delay spread measurements in Ka-Band. Reference
[35] is stating the coherence bandwidth to be 30 MHz at 40 GHz with
omnidirectional antennas. According to [36], the coherence bandwidth (Δ f)~c~
of a channel with maximum delay spread Tm is
(Δ f)~c~ ≈ 1 / (5T)
For the stated coherence bandwidth in [35], this results in a maximum delay
spread of T~m~ = 25 ns for omni-directional antennas. For directional
antennas, echoes with significant delay are normally filtered out by the
antenna radiation pattern, so flat fading can be assumed for Ka-band signals.
**CP length defined in NR**
The possible CP lengths currently defined for New Radio [21] are summarized in
the following table:
Table 7.3.5.2.2-1: CP lengths and minimum/maximum RF bandwidth of NR as
currently defined in [21]
* * *
Subcarrier spacing (SCS) configuration parameter µ SCS [kHz] normal CP length

2 60 _1,172_ _16,67_ 3 120 _0,586_ Not defined 4 240 _0,293_ Not defined
* * *
##### 7.3.5.2.3 NR impact considerations
It is observed that lower numerologies (µ= 0, 1) are associated with CP
lengths exceeding the requirement of NTN, resulting in a slightly reduced
spectral efficiency due to the over-dimensioned CP (e.g. overhead is for µ= 0:
(4.688µs - 0.25µs) / 66.67 µs = 6.7 %).
High numerologies (µ= 3, 4) result in CP lengths which are well matching to
propagation characteristics in Ka-Band.
The extended CP for a SCS of 60 kHz is not required, because it is
significantly larger than required for satellite applications.
Enhancement to NR specification is not expected for NTN applications due to
the NTN channel model delay spread compatible with the existing specified CP
values.
### 7.3.6 Duplex mode
#### 7.3.6.1 FDD/TDD Duplexing mode
##### 7.3.6.1.1 Problem statement
Most of the existing satellite systems operate in the frequency bands
designated for FDD mode, with defined transmit direction. For some frequency
bands, TDD mode is possible.
When considering TDD mode, a guard time is necessary to prevent UE to
simultaneously Transmit and reception. This guard time directly depends on the
propagation delay between UE and gNB. This guard time will directly impact the
useful throughput and hence the spectral efficiency.
When considering Non-Terrestrial networks, this guard time should commensurate
the round trip delay.
Guard time would range between 2 x 7 ms for LEO at 600 km and 2 x 270 ms for
GEO satellite access networks since NTN terminals can experience a one-way
propagation time of
\- 240 ms at minimum and 270 ms at maximum between UE and satellite base
station for GEO
\- 2 ms at minimum and 7 ms at maximum between UE and satellite base station
for LEO at 600 km altitude
Such excessive guard time would lead to a very inefficient radio interface
especially in GEO or even MEO based access.
It may be acceptable in the case of LEO access system with the need to deal
with the variable delay.
##### 7.3.6.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
The applicability of the duplexing mode TDD or FDD depends on the regulations
(ITU-R and/or national) associated to the targeted spectrum.
##### 7.3.6.1.3 NR impact considerations
FDD is preferred duplexing mode for most NR based NTN access network.
In case the regulations allow it, TDD mode can be considered for both HAPS and
LEO satellite based access network with potential NR impacts if required.
### 7.3.7 Satellite or aerial Payload performance
#### 7.3.7.1 PT-RS
##### 7.3.7.1.1 Problem statement
Phase variations in time domain can be caused by different phenomena: presence
of phase noise, frequency drifts due to Doppler shift, or due to insufficient
frequency synchronization (e.g. residual CFO), etc. Phase noise, caused by
imperfect oscillator implementation technology destroys the orthogonality of
subcarriers in OFDM-based systems especially in FR2. Phase noise causes CPE,
resulting in a constant rotation angle of the modulation constellation, and
ICI, resulting in scattering of the constellation points in OFDM based
systems. Doppler effects and/or residual CFO cause frequency shifts translated
into time domain phase ramps at OFDM symbol level.
The phase variations translating all the above effects may significantly
degrade the performance and need compensation. When mild, these variations can
be absorbed by the DM-RS in the channel estimation process. But when strong
phase variations are present, which is particularly the case at carrier
frequencies above 6GHz, more frequent support than the one provided by DM-RS
is necessary in order to track the remaining variations.
In NR, PT-RS has been introduced in [21], [23] to compensate for phase errors.
PT-RS configuration in NR is very flexible and allows user-specific
configuration depending on scheduled MCS/bandwidth, UE RF characteristics, DM-
RS configuration, waveform, etc.
##### 7.3.7.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
It has been proposed that eMBB should be supported for NTN and the modulation
order might not always be low. PT-RS is needed in NTN at high carrier
frequencies, where the maximum received SNR is limited by the phase noise.
Considering the high speed of airborne/spaceborne vehicles, CFO and Doppler
shift/spread might be worse in NTN and therefore CFO and Doppler estimation
need to be considered.
A number of phase noise masks such as DTH or VSAT use cases considered in
[37], or other state of the art bent pipe of satellite or HAPS payloads as
described in Annex B are considered as pertinent for non-terrestrial
communications. Phase noise masks pertinent for terrestrial equipment
operating in mmWave have been defined in NR in [38].
The performance of phase tracking algorithms is highly dependent on a large
set of variables such as carrier frequency, subcarrier spacing, UE specific RF
characteristics, configured MCS/bandwidth, frame length, DMRS configuration,
Doppler, receiver implementation options, etc.
##### 7.3.7.1.3 NR impact considerations
PTRS is needed in NR supporting NTN for phase error compensation. PTRS
configuration in NR is very flexible. Typical phase noise masks of state of
the art bent pipe of satellite or HAPS payloads in Non-Terrestrial networks
can be efficiently compensated by the current NR design in the absence of
important Doppler shifts and/or residual CFO at a carrier frequency of up to
30 GHz. Some further investigation is needed in the case of important Doppler
shifts and/or residual CFO, or in the presence of the specific phase noise
masks of on board payloads significantly different from the ones considered in
cellular network so far, or with very large channel bandwidths.
#### 7.3.7.2 PAPR
##### 7.3.7.2.1 Problem statement
A key component in the satellite payload architecture is a PA. It exhibits
nonlinear behavior when driven near saturation in an effort to increase power
efficiency. Nonlinear distortion causing constellation warping and clustering,
thus complicating signal reception. One measurement that determines the
vulnerability of the transmitted signal to nonlinear distortion is the PAPR,
with higher values associated with worse impact.
In the NR downlink, CP-OFDM is used. CP-OFDM is composed of superposition of
narrowband orthogonal subcarriers, resulting in higher PAPR values compared
with the underlying modulation in a single carrier. The PAPR is a function of
the number of subcarriers in the signal, as well as the underlining
modulation.
The amount of distortion caused by nonlinear amplifier characteristics is a
function of the PAPR of the signal. The greater the PAPR, the greater the
distortion can be. The distortion can be reduced by increasing the backoff of
the amplifier operating point. But this reduces the amplifier efficiency
accordingly. Tradeoffs are often made between the amplifier OBO and the
nonlinear signal distortion, such that the total degradation of output power
and signal distortion is minimized.
As an example, the figures (NOTE 1) below show the total degradation of CP-
OFDM with over a typical satellite transponder is about 6 dB for QPSK
modulation and 7.6 dB for 16-QAM, whereas that for DFT-spread-OFDM is about 4
dB for QPSK and 6 dB for 16-QAM. The difference between CP-OFDM and DFT-
spread-OFDM is 1.6-2 dB.
NOTE 1: See ETSI TR 103 297 \"Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES), SC-
FDMA based radio waveform technology for Ku/Ka band satellite service\", ,
V.1.1.1., (2017-07). Pages 29-30.

OFDM total degradation
The additional 2 dB output backoff may represent 20 to 40 percent reduction of
link capacity compared to State of the art satellite radio interface,
depending on whether the satellite is bandwidth limited or power limited.
As for HAPS, the payload architecture may be very similar to satellite, and
power amplifier remains to be a key component, although SSPA is likely to be
used instead of traveling wave tube. Regardless, the PAPR difference between
CP-OFDM and DFT-spread-OFDM also requires different OBO which translates to
different total distortion. The higher total distortion of CP-OFDM ultimately
means lower capacity. In this case, however, the problem may be less acute,
since the payload power efficiency may not be as critical.
##### 7.3.7.2.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
networks
The use of CP-OFDM in the downlink does not restrict NR operation in non-
terrestrial networks, but it may affect the system performance:
\- In one case, a satellite transponder is sufficiently wide and sufficiently
powerful to accommodate more than one FDM carriers, each of which is a
different NR CP-OFDM signal. The satellite amplifier is backed off to minimize
the intermodulation between these FDM carriers within the same transponder.
For such cases, the distortion introduced by the amplifier nonlinearity is
small, with little impact.
\- In second and much more common case for communicating to small UEs, the
satellite amplifier is used to send only one NR CP-OFDM downlink. It is highly
desirable to operate the amplifier with as small OBO as possible. But, due to
the higher PAPR of CP-OFDM signal, sufficient OBO is necessary. To close the
link, it may be necessary to reduce the size of CP-OFDM carrier or operate the
CP-OFDM carrier with a lower modulation and coding mode. Either way, the
forward link capacity is reduced significantly.
On the uplink, DFT-spread-OFDM might be beneficial.
##### 7.3.7.2.3 NR impact considerations
PAPR reduction techniques of CP-OFDM signal on the downlink would be
beneficial to optimize the capacity of non-terrestrial networks and therefore
could be considered in future studies.
### 7.3.8 Network architecture
#### 7.3.8.1 Protocols
##### 7.3.8.1.1 Problem statement
Non-Terrestrial networks differ from typical cellular networks in terms of
network architecture, deployment scenarios as well as coverage which may span
across several countries.
Potential impacts on the NR specifications could be minimized through suitable
mapping options of the Logical NG RAN architecture onto the NTN network
architecture.
The respective NG-RAN logical architecture and the NTN network architecture
are depicted below. The area of impacts associated to the NG-RAN mapping
options need to be identified.

Furthermore, when dealing with mobility of UEs, one should distinguish:
\- The mobility induced by the motion of the NTN platform, in particular when
considering Non-Geostationary Satellites;
\- The mobility of the terrestrial equipment:
\- when moving from one beam to another beam generated by a satellite or a
HAPS
\- The mobility of UE between beams generated by different satellites or HAPS
\- The mobility of UE between NTN (Satellite or HAPS) and cellular access
Location update, paging and hand-over RAN related protocols may need to be
adapted to accommodate
\- The extended delay of NTN for intra NTN access mobility
\- The differential delay when mobility between satellite access and cellular
access
\- The mobility of the cell pattern generated by non geo-stationary satellites
##### 7.3.8.1.2 Assessment of conditions for NR operation in Non-Terrestrial
Networks
**RAN architecture mapping**
There are several options to instantiate the RAN architecture in Non-
Terrestrial networks. It depends on whether the satellite or HAPS implement a
bent pipe payload or a processed payload. This leads to the following example
mapping options that prevent the need to create new interfaces or reference
points. Note that there may exist other mapping options not listed here.

networks

Processed -- low Mapping option 2 Processed - high Mapping option 3
* * *
A bent pipe satellite/HAPS payload implements Radio frequency conversion,
analogue filtering and amplification. A processed payload implements some RAN
functions. The type of gNB functions that can be embarked will be constrained
by the available power and mass on board satellite/HAPS.
Here under are depicted different mapping options of the logical NG RAN
architecture onto the physical architecture of Non-Terrestrial networks which
prevents to modify the NG RAN architecture.

entities.

Given that Non-terrestrial networks feature longer propagation delays, the
timers associated to the protocols transported over the feeder and service
links may require to be extended. This applies for example to F1 as well as
N1, N2 and N3 reference points.
In mapping option 1, the Satellite or HAPS implements an RF repeater (with
frequency conversion), whereas in mapping option 2, they implement some kind
of \"intermediate\" node which could be based on the outcomes of 3GPP TR
38.874: \"Study on Integrated Access and Backhaul\".
It is recommended to consider the outcome of this TR 38.874 and see how it can
be applicable to Non-Terrestrial networks (especially for NTN deployment
scenarios 2 and 3) and what areas of impact it may create. Other mapping
options may be considered depending on different CU-DU lower layer split for
NR that may be defined (See TR 38.816).
**Location update, paging and hand-over RAN related protocols**
Table 7.3.8.1.2-3 identifies the possible areas of impact on NR associated to
Location update, paging and hand-over RAN related protocols in different types
of non-terrestrial networks.

##### 7.3.8.1.3 NR impact considerations
Thanks to suitable mapping options of the logical architecture of NG RAN onto
the physical architecture of non terrestrial network, modifications of the NG
RAN architecture are not needed in terms of reference points, interfaces or
functions.
However the N1/N2/3 and GTP based F1 interface protocols may need to be
adapted to accommodate the non terrestrial networks feeder link
characteristics (long delay, BER).Depending on the non-terrestrial network
deployment scenarios, other impacts on NR specification may have to be
considered among which, location update, paging and hand-over RAN related
protocols and handling of network identifies.
Last, it may be considered how the architecture being defined in 3GPP TR38.874
\"Study on Integrated Access and Backhaul\" can be used in the context of
various Non-Terrestrial networks deployment scenarios.
# 8 Recommendations on the way forward
## 8.1 General outcomes
This report has
\- provided detailed descriptions of some deployment scenarios for non-
terrestrial networks and the related system parameters such as altitude,
orbit, etc.
\- defined a way to generate Non-Terrestrial network channel models leveraging
on the models defined in TR 38.901 \"Study on channel model for frequencies
from 0.5 to 100 GHz (Release 14)\"
\- identified potential key impact areas on the NR to support Non-Terrestrial
networks
In line with 3GPP TR 38.901, the study considered channel models in Non-
Terrestrial networks operating in any frequency bands between 0.5 and 100 GHz.
## 8.2 Reference deployment scenarios
A number of scenarios is considered in clause 5.1 \"Scenarios overview\"
including GEO, Non-GEO as well as HAPS based access networks. The intent is to
assess relatively worst-case scenarios with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler
variation rate, Delay and Delay variation rate. For non-GEO deployment
scenarios, the altitude has been set to 600 km, which is pessimistic with
respect to the Doppler, and Doppler rate, related effects.
Non-Terrestrial access networks can be used to serve directly User Equipment
or indirectly via a relay node.
## 8.3 Non-Terrestrial network channel modelling
Leveraging on the models defined in TR 38.901 \"Study on channel model for
frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz (Release 14)\", complementary features and
specific parameters have been identified and proposed in chapter 6 of this
report to generate Non-Terrestrial network channel models for all possible
deployment scenarios characterised by altitude/orbit of space/aerial vehicles,
user environments (rural, sub-urban, urban and dense urban), targeted user
equipment type (omni or directive antennas, LOS/NLOS conditions) as well as
frequency bands.
## 8.4 NR impacts to support Non-Terrestrial networks
### 8.4.1 Type of potential NR impacts

### 8.4.2 Assessment of potential NR impacts to support Non-Terrestrial
networks
Table 8.4.2-1 identifies the potential area of impacts on the NR
specification. This will depend on the deployment scenarios. The intent is to
identify the main studies to be carried out taking into account the defined
NTN channel model to enable operation of NR in Non-Terrestrial networks. Other
areas of impact are identified which could lead to performance improvement.

NOTE 1: Some of the considered deployment scenarios assume indirect access
based on fixed or even mobile relays. For NGSO-based deployment scenarios NTN
and/or relays mounted on a moving platform such as a train, mobility
management also needs further studies.
NOTE 2: The common delay, the Differential delay as well as their time
variation may need to be compensated.
NOTE 3: Doppler/Delay compensation techniques can be implemented especially
for Non GEO satellites:
\- GNSS based techniques: The User Equipment equipped with a GNSS receiver
determines its position and the universal time. Thanks to pre-loaded / updated
ephemeris of the satellite constellation which can be theoretical or actual,
the UE is able to compute the position and motion of the possible serving
satellites enabling to determine the Doppler shift and variation rate as well
as the absolute Delay and Delay variation.
\- Non GNSS based techniques can also be envisaged and implemented.
