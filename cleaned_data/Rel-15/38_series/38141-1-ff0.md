# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Base Station (BS) _Type 1-C_ and _Type 1-H_.
These have been derived from, and are consistent with the conducted
requirements for _BS Type 1-C_ and _BS Type 1-H_ in NR BS specification
defined in TS 38.104 [2].
A _BS type 1-C_ only has conducted requirements so it requires compliance to
this specification only.
A _BS type 1-H_ has both conducted and radiated requirements so it requires
compliance to the applicable requirements of this specification and TS
38.141-2 [3].
_BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_ have only radiated requirements so they
require compliance to TS 38.141-2 [3] only.

# 4 General conducted test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1 of
this specification, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The frequency
ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.104 [2].
The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.104 [2] and the references
therein. Test Tolerances for the conducted test requirements explicitly stated
in the present document are given in Annex C of the present document.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
For _BS type 1-H_ when a requirement is applied per _TAB connector_ then the
test uncertainty is applied to the measured value. When a requirement is
applied for a group of _TAB connectors_ then the test uncertainty is applied
to sum of the measured power on each _TAB connector_ in the group.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

#### 4.9.2.3 Data content of Physical channels and Signals for NR-FR1-TM
Randomisation of the data content is obtained by utilizing a PN sequence
generator and the length-31 Gold sequence scrambling of TS 38.211 [17], clause
5.2.1 which is invoked by all physical channels prior to modulation and
mapping to the RE grid.

clause 4.9.2.2.
\- Generate this amount of bits from the output of the PN23 sequence generator
[23]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with a starting seed of \"all
ones\" in the first allocated slot of each frame. The PN sequence is
continuous over the slot boundaries.

generated for all symbols (in the DL, UL or special slots) or only DL symbols
(in the DL or special slots). For TMs with multi-users, the PN sequence can be
generated per user (_n_ ~RNTI~ ).
\- NR-FR1-TMs utilize 1, 2 or 3 user PDSCH transmissions distinguished by
$n_{\text{RNTI}}$. For each NR-FR1-TM, PRBs are mapped to user

## 4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or non-
contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum operation
and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply both at
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block gaps. For each
such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges respectively.
## 4.11 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For _multi-band connector_ the conducted test requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply separately to each supported _operating band_ unless otherwise stated.
For some conducted test requirements, it is explicitly stated that specific
additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band connector(s)_
as detailed in the requirement clause. For BS capable of multi-band operation,
various structures in terms of combinations of different transmitter and
receiver implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping of
transceivers to one or more _antenna_ _connectors_ for _BS type 1-C_ or _TAB
connectors_ for _BS type 1-H_ in different ways are possible. For _multi-band
connector(s)_ the exclusions or provisions for multi-band apply. For _single-
band connector(s)_ , the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, _operating band_ unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this connector that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, _single-band
requirements_ shall apply to this connector configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are
applicable. _Single-band requirements_ are tested separately at the connector
configured for single-band operation, with all other connectors terminated.
A _BS type 1-H_ may be capable of supporting operation in multiple _operating
bands_ with one of the following implementations of _TAB connectors_ in the
_transceiver array boundary_ :
\- All TAB connectors are single-band connectors.
\- Different sets of single-band connectors support different operating bands,
but each TAB connector supports only operation in one single operating band.
\- Sets of single-band connectors support operation in multiple operating
bands with some single-band connectors supporting more than one operating
band.
\- All TAB connectors are multi-band connectors.
\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of TAB connectors
provides support of the type BS type 1-H capability of operation in multiple
operating bands.
Unless otherwise stated all conducted test requirements specified for an
_operating band_ apply only to the set of _TAB connectors_ supporting that
_operating band_.
In the case of an _operating band_ being supported only by _single-band
connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min
cell group_ , _single-band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB
connectors_.
In the case of an _operating band_ being supported only by _multi-band
connector_ s supporting the same _operating band_ combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ , _multi-
band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB connectors_.
For _multi-band connectors_ supporting the bands for TDD, the RF requirements
in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur
between the bands.
NOTE 1: The case of an _operating band_ being supported by both _multi-band
connectors_ and _single-band connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell
group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not covered by the present
release of this specification.
NOTE 2: The case of an _operating band_ being supported by _multi-band
connectors_ which are not all supporting the same _operating band_ combination
in a _TAB connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_
is not covered by the present release of this specification.
NOTE 3: The conducted test requirements for _multi-band connectors_ supporting
bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release of this
specification.

bands are considered.
# 6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
### 6.1.1 BS type 1-C
General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
If a number of _single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors_ have been
declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary to be
tested to demonstrate conformance.
### 6.1.2 BS type 1-H
General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
If a number of _single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors_ have been
declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary to be
tested to demonstrate conformance.
In clause 6.6.3.5.4, if representative _TAB connectors_ are used then per
connector criteria (i.e. option 2) shall be applied.
_The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported geographical
cells (N~cells~, D.24) relates to the BS setting with the minimum amount of
cell splitting supported with transmission on all TAB connectors supporting
the operating band. The manufacturer shall also declare TAB connector TX min
cell groups (D.34)._ Every _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in an
_operating band_ shall map to one _TAB connector TX min cell group_ supporting
the same _operating band. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is
implementation dependent._
_The number of active transmitter units that are considered when calculating
the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for BS type 1-H is calculated as
follows:_
N~TXU,\ counted~ = min(N~TXU,active~, 8Â·N~cells~)
_Further:_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ = _N~TXU,counted~/N~cells~_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the _basic limits_ as described in
clause 6.6.
NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of _active transmitter unit_
s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.
## 6.2 Base station output power
### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The conducted BS output power requirements are specified at _single-band
connector_ , or at _multi-band connector_.
The _rated carrier output power_ of the _BS type 1-C_ shall be as specified in
table 6.2.1-1.

no upper limit for the P~rated,c,sys~ or P~rated,c,TABC~ of the Wide Area Base
Station.
For Band n41 operation in Japan, the rated output power, P~rated,c.sys~ for BS
type 1-H or the sum of P~rated,c,AC~ over all _antenna connectors_ for BS type
1-C declared by the manufacturer shall be equal to or less than 20 W per 10
MHz bandwidth.
The output power limit for the respective BS classes in tables 6.2.1.-1 and
6.2.1-2 shall be compared to the rated output power and the declared BS class.
It is not subject to testing.
### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ , or per _multi-
band connector_ supporting transmission in the _operating band_.
The minimum requirement for _BS type 1-C_ is defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause
6.2.2.
The minimum requirement for _BS type 1-H_ is defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause
6.2.3.
### 6.2.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the _maximum carrier output
power_ across the frequency range and under normal and extreme conditions.
### 6.2.4 Method of test
#### 6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment:
\- Normal, see annex B.2,
\- Extreme, see annexes B.3 and B.5.

4.9.1.
\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ for _multi-band connector(s)_ , see
clause 4.9.1.
Under extreme test environment, it is sufficient to test on one NR-ARFCN or
one RF bandwidth position, and with one applicable test configuration defined
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8. Testing shall be performed under extreme power supply
conditions, as defined in Annex B.5.
NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.
#### 6.2.4.2 Procedure
For _BS type 1-H_ where there may be multiple _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until
all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested.
1) Connect the power measuring equipment to _single-band connector(s)_ or to
_multi-band connector(s)_ under test as shown in annex D.1.1 for _BS type 1-C_
for in annex D.3.1 for _BS type 1-H_. All connectors not under test shall be
terminated.
2) For single carrier set the connector under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2 at _rated carrier output
power_ P~rated,c,AC~ for _BS type 1-C_ and P~rated,c,TABC~ for _BS type 1-H_
(D.21).
For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.
3) Measure the _maximum carrier output power_ (P~max,c,AC~ for _BS type 1-C_
and P~max,c,TABC~ for _BS type 1-H_) for each carrier at each connector under
test.
In addition, for _multi-band connectors_ , the following steps shall apply:
4) For a _multi-band connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved _operating band_ where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other _operating band_.
### 6.2.5 Test requirement
For each _single-band connector_ or _multi-band connector_ under test, the
power measured in clause 6.2.4.2 in step 3 shall remain within the values
provided in table 6.2.5-1 for normal and extreme test environments, relative
to the manufacturer\'s declared P~rated,c,AC~ for _BS type 1-C_ , or relative

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
6) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single carrier test models shall apply, with no carrier
activated in the other band. In addition, when contiguous CA is supported,

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)
#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency.
The requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR requirement in clause

table 6.6.3.5.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply
in _sub block gaps_ for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.
For a _multi-band connector_ , the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in _Inter RF Bandwidth gaps_ for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.6.3.5.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in
_Inter RF Bandwidth gaps_ for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.
The requirement applies during the _transmitter ON period_.
#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ , or per _multi-
band connector_ supporting transmission in the _operating band_.
The minimum requirement for _BS type 1-C_ is defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause
6.6.3.3.
The minimum requirement for _BS type 1-H_ is defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause

##### 6.6.3.4.2 Procedure
For _BS type 1-H_ where there may be multiple _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.1.1 for _BS type 1-C_ or in annex D.3.1 for _BS type 1-H_.
Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until all _TAB connectors_
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested.
1) Connect the _single-band connector_ or _multi-band connector_ under test to
measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for _BS type 1-C_ and in annex
D.3.1 for _BS type 1-H_. All connectors not under test shall be terminated.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.
> The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
> ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
> 4.1.2.2-1.
2) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
(D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models NR-FR1â€‘TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at _rated carrier output power_
P~rated,c,AC~ for _BS type 1-C_ and P~rated,c,TABC~ for _BS type 1-H_ (D.21).

setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.
3) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel frequency as
specified in table 6.6.3.5.2â€‘1. In multiple carrier case only offset
frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier frequency used
shall be measured.
4) For the ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for non-contiguous
spectrum operation, or inside _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ for multi-band
operation:

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking
#### 7.4.2.1 Definition and applicability
The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the _antenna connector_
for _BS type 1-C_ or _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H_ in the presence of an
unwanted interferer, which is an NR signal for general blocking or an NR
signal with one resource block for narrowband blocking.
#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirements for _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_ are in TS 38.104
[2], clause 7.4.2.2.
#### 7.4.2.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to withstand
high-levels of in-band interference from unwanted signals at specified
frequency offsets without undue degradation of its sensitivity.
#### 7.4.2.4 Method of test
##### 7.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or partially
located outside the supported frequency range, then the test shall be done
instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and only with the interferer
located inside the supported frequency range.
##### 7.4.2.4.2 Procedure for general blocking
The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

In addition, for a _multi-band_ _connector_ , the following steps shall apply:
6) For _multi-band_ _connector_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
#### 7.4.2.5 Test requirements
The throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to _BS
type 1-C_ _antenna connector_ or _BS type 1â€‘H_ _TAB connector_ using the
parameters in tables 7.4.2.5-1, 7.4.2.5-2 and 7.4.2.5-3 for general blocking
and narrowband blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.5 for each channel bandwidth and
further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal
is further specified in annex E.
The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth
or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.
For _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H,_ the in-band blocking requirement applies
from F~UL_low~ - Î”f~OOB~ to F~UL_high~ + Î”f~OOB~, excluding the downlink
frequency range of the _operating band_. The Î”f~OOB~ for _BS type 1-C_ and _BS
type 1-H_ is defined in table 7.4.2.5-0.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _antenna connector_ for _BS
type 1-C_ and at the _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H._
Table 7.4.2.5-0: Î”f~OOB~ offset for NR _operating bands_
BS type _Operating band_ characteristics Î”f~OOB~ (MHz)
* * *
_BS type 1-C_ F~UL_high~ -- F~UL_low~ â‰¤ 200 MHz 20 200 MHz \ NOTE: In this case for FDD operation the test is performed when both TX and
> RX are ON, with the TX _antenna connectors_ / _TAB connectors_ terminated.
For a _ntenna connectors_ / _TAB connectors_ supporting both RX and TX in TDD,
the requirements apply during the _transmitter OFF period_. For _antenna
connectors_ / _TAB connectors_ supporting both RX and TX in FDD, the RX
spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious emissions
requirements, as specified in clause 6.6.5.
For RX-only _multi-band_ _connectors_ , the spurious emissions requirements
are subject to exclusion zones in each supported _operating band_. For _multi-
band_ _connectors_ that both transmit and receive in _operating band_
supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are applicable during the
_TX OFF period_ , and are subject to exclusion zones in each supported
_operating band_.
For _BS type 1-H_ manufacturer shall declare _TAB connector RX min cell
groups_ (D.33). Every _TAB connector_ of _BS type 1â€‘H_ supporting reception in
an _operating band_ shall map to one _TAB connector RX min cell group_ , where
mapping of _TAB connectors_ to cells/beams is implementation dependent.
The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating the
conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for _BS type 1-H_ is
calculated as follows:
N~RXU,counted~ = min(N~RXU,active~ , 8 Ã— N~cells~)
N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of _basic limits_ and is derived as
N~RXU,countedpercell~ = _N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where N~cells~ is defined
in clause 6.1._
> NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and is
> independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at the _antenna connector_ for
_BS type 1-C_ or _TAB connector_ for _BS type 1-H_ in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.

###### ## Annex F (normative): Void
###### ## Annex G (normative): Propagation conditions
# G.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:
> \- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized by
> a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile can be
> further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum delay
> spanned by the taps.
>
> \- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay profile
> and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical spectrum shape
> and a maximum Doppler frequency.
>
> \- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25
> GHz -- 52.6 GHz).
## G.2.1 Delay profiles
The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 [20] TDL models. The
simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps are only
used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay profiles
specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.
\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 [20].
\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays
\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 [20].
\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done
simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay
resolution.
\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them by
calculating their linear power sum.
\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows
\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)
\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the weakest,
select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows
\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of the
weakest tap and the second delay tap.
\- Remove the second delay tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows
\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.
\- Remove the second-to-last tap.
\- Otherwise
\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has the
smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.
\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the weakest tap
and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.
\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.
\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference for
merging.
\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power of the
weakest tap and the selected tap.
\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged tap is
the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.
\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap is
the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.
\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average delay of
the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on the sampling
grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay. Otherwise, the
location of the merged tap is rounded towards the direction of the selected
tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns 20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or
equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher power). The weakest tap and the
selected tap are removed.
\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.
\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8 dB)
\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of the
last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.
\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.
NOTE 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification steps
may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3, and G.2.1.1-4 for
the corresponding model.
NOTE 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the linear
domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the linear domain.
### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1
The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low, medium
and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters are
specified in G.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are specified in
tables G.2.1.1-2 \~ table G.2.1.1-4.

correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a = 0.00012.

###### ## Annex H (normative): In-channel TX tests
# H.1 General
The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant parameters that
describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the TX under test in a
single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
# H.2 Basic principles
The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of the TX
under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal, that is
generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error free
received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally complex)
baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only. These
numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP length, 30 kHz SCS
and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz (_N_ ~RB~ = 273). The
application of the text below, however, is not restricted to this parameter
set.
## H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a sampling rate which is
the product of the SCS and the _FFT size_ , and it is named $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$. The _FFT size_ is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS. In the time domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is
modelled as a signal with the following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- carrier frequency,
\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
For the example in the annex, the _FFT size_ is 4096 based on table 6.5.3.5-3.
The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the _FFT size_ and SCS.
## H.2.2 Ideal signal
Two types of ideal signals are defined:
The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the signal is described
in the test models.
The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols are
set to 0 V),
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,
\- nominal timing.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.
## H.2.3 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the following:
\- Carrier frequency error
\- EVM
\- Resource element TX power
\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)
Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX chain
after equalisation.
## H.2.4 Measurement points
The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described in
figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a
zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1 in figure
H.2.4-1. The FFT window of _FFT size_ samples out of (_FFT size_ \+ cyclic
prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\"
box. The _FFT size_ and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS.
In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic prefix
larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and 6.5.3.5-4.
Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and the formula how
to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two symbols according to the
sampling rate.
Table H.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP length
for normal CP
* * *
SCS (kHz) # slots in subframe Symbol # and slot # with longer CP Longer CP
length
* * *
15 1 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 128 (symbol 7, slot 0)
30 2 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 64 (symbol 0, slot 1)
60 4 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 32 (symbol 0, slot 2)
* * *
For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096 samples
out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic prefix than
the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length = 352).
Figure H.2.4-1: Reference point for FR1 EVM measurements
# H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are varied in
order to minimise the difference between $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between $z\left(
\upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier frequency
error.
From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.
NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre-FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
inbetween the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration).
NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and sample
frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinuish between both.
After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.
# H.4 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is _FFT size_ samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD, there
are $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs performed where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of symbols in a slot for
normal CP is 14.
The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.
For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples per
OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the acquired
number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM
requirements shall be met within a window _W_ \ \- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
> active within the slot,
>
> \- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource blocks
> with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
>
> \- $I\left( t,f \right)$ _is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the
> measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
>
> \- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under test.
NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer is
calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals.
## H.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals the
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slot duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the
equalizer estimation step.
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}{\sum_{j =
1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$
_Where_ $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot _i_.
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window _W_ extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ in the expressions above
and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ in the
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ calculation where (_l_ and _h_ , low
and high; where low is the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
high is the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).
Thus:
$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max_{}\left(
{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}
\right)$
The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.
## H.7.2 Averaged EVM (TDD)
Let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with downlink symbols
within a 10 ms measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging in the time domain
can be calculated from $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ slots of different 10 ms
measurement intervals and should have a minimum of $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots
averaging length where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM results
in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the sum by the
number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient (RMS).
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$
_Where_ $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot _i_.
The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window _W_ extremities. Thus
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using $\widetilde{t}
= \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using $\widetilde{t}
= \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (_l_ and _h_ , low and high; where low
is the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the
timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).
$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max_{}\left(
{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}
\right)$
In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the minimum integer
number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$ is determined
by.
$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times
N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$
and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30 kHz SCS
and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.
Unite by RMS.
$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$
The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.
