# 4 General aspects
## 4.1 NG Architecture
The NG-RAN is layered into a Radio Network Layer (RNL) and a Transport Network
Layer (TNL). The NG-RAN architecture, i.e. the NG-RAN logical nodes and
interfaces between them, are defined as part of the RNL.
The NG-RAN architecture consists of a set of gNBs and ng-eNBs which are
connected to the 5GC through the NG interface and is specified in TS 38.300
[7].
The NG-RAN may have several NG access points towards the 5GC. As a minimum,
each NG access point\ (in NG-RAN or 5GC) shall independently fulfil the
requirements of the relevant NG specifications (3GPP 38.41x series - see
clause 7).
NG is a logical interface.
There may be multiple NG-C logical interfaces towards the 5GC from any one NG-
RAN node. The selection of the NG-C interface is then determined by the NAS
Node Selection function as described in clause 5.
There may be multiple NG-U logical interfaces towards the 5GC from any one NG-
RAN node. The selection of the NG-U interface is done within the 5GC and
signalled to the NG-RAN node by the AMF.
## 4.2 NG interface general principles
The general principles for the specification of the NG interface are as
follows:
\- the NG interface is open;
\- the NG interface supports the exchange of signalling information between
the NG-RAN and 5GC;
\- from a logical standpoint, the NG is a point-to-point interface between an
NG-RAN node and a 5GC node. A point-to-point logical interface is feasible
even in the absence of a physical direct connection between the NG-RAN and
5GC;
\- the NG interface supports control plane and user plane separation;
\- the NG interface separates Radio Network Layer and Transport Network Layer;
\- the NG interface is future proof to fulfil different new requirements and
support of new services and new functions;
\- the NG interface is decoupled with the possible NG-RAN deployment variants;
\- the NG Application Protocol supports modular procedures design and uses a
syntax allowing optimized encoding /decoding efficiency.
## 4.3 NG interface specification objectives
The NG interface specification facilitates the following:
\- inter-connection of NG-RAN nodes with AMFs supplied by different
manufacturers;
\- separation of NG interface Radio Network functionality and Transport
Network functionality to facilitate introduction of future technology.
## 4.4 NG interface capabilities
The NG interface supports:
\- procedures to establish, maintain and release NG-RAN part of PDU sessions;
\- procedures to perform intra-RAT handover and inter-RAT handover;
\- the separation of each UE on the protocol level for user specific
signalling management;
\- the transfer of NAS signalling messages between UE and AMF;
\- mechanisms for resource reservation for packet data streams.
# 5 Functions of the NG interface
## 5.1 General
The following clauses describe the functions supported over the NG interface.
## 5.2 Paging function
The paging function supports the sending of paging requests to the NG-RAN
nodes involved in the paging area e.g. the NG-RAN nodes of the TA(s) the UE is
registered.
## 5.3 UE Context Management function
The UE Context management function allows the AMF to establish, modify or
release a UE Context in the AMF and the NG-RAN node e.g. to support user
individual signalling on NG.
The function also enables the AMF to manage RRC state notifications of a CM-
CONNECTED UE.
## 5.4 Mobility Management function
The mobility function for UEs in CM-CONNECTED includes the intra-system
handover function to support mobility within NG-RAN and inter-system handover
function to support mobility from/to EPS system. It comprises the preparation,
execution and completion of handover via the NG interface.
## 5.5 PDU Session Management function
The PDU Session function is responsible for establishing, modifying and
releasing the involved PDU sessions NG-RAN resources for user data transport
once a UE context is available in the NG-RAN node.
NGAP supports transparent relaying of PDU Session related information by the
AMF as described in TS 23.502 [6].
## 5.6 NAS Transport function
The NAS Signalling Transport function provides means to transport or reroute a
NAS message (e.g. for NAS mobility management) for a specific UE over the NG
interface.
## 5.7 NAS Node Selection function
The interconnection of NG-RAN nodes to multiple AMFs is supported in the 5GS
architecture.
Therefore, a NAS node selection function is located in the NG-RAN node to
determine the AMF association of the UE, based on the UE\'s temporary
identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the AMF. When the UE\'s temporary
identifier has not been yet assigned or is no longer valid the NG-RAN node may
instead take into account slicing information to determine the AMF.
This functionality is located in the NG-RAN node and enables proper routing
via the NG interface. On NG, no specific procedure corresponds to the NAS Node
Selection Function.
## 5.8 NG Interface Management function
The NG-interface management functions provide
\- means to ensure a defined start of NG-interface operation (reset);
\- means to handle different versions of application part implementations and
protocol errors (error indication).
## 5.9 Warning Message Transmission function
The warning message transmission function provides means to transfer warning
messages via NG interface or cancel ongoing broadcast of warning messages. It
also provides the capability for the NG-RAN to inform the AMF that ongoing PWS
operation has failed for one or more areas, or that one or more areas may be
reloaded by the CBC.
## 5.10 Configuration Transfer function
The Configuration Transfer function is a generic mechanism that allows the
request and transfer of RAN configuration information (e.g. SON information)
between two RAN nodes via the core network.
## 5.11 Trace function
The Trace function provides means to control trace sessions in the NG-RAN
node.
## 5.12 AMF Management function
The AMF management function supports AMF planned removal and AMF auto-recovery
as specified in TS 23.501 [8].
## 5.13 Multiple TNL Associations Support Function
When there are multiple TNL associations between a NG-RAN node and an AMF, the
NG-RAN node selects the TNL association for NGAP signalling based on the usage
and the weight factor of each TNL association received from the AMF, and uses
the TNL association as specified in TS 23.501 [8] and TS 23.502 [6]. If an AMF
releases a TNL association or a TNL association has failed, the NG-RAN node
selects a new one as specified in TS 23.501 [8] and TS 23.502 [6].
## 5.14 AMF Load Balancing function
The NG interface supports the indication by the AMF of its relative capacity
to the NG-RAN node in order to achieve load-balanced AMFs within the pool
area.
## 5.15 Location Reporting function
This function enables the AMF to request the NG-RAN node to report the UE\'s
current location, or the UE\'s last known location with timestamp, or the
UE\'s presence in a configured area of interest.
## 5.16 AMF Re-allocation function
This function allows to redirect an initial connection request issued by an
NG-RAN node from an initial AMF towards a target AMF selected by 5GC. In this
case the NG-RAN node initiates an Initial UE Message procedure over one NG
interface instance and receives the first downlink message to close the UE-
associated logical connection over a different NG interface instance.
## 5.17 UE Radio Capability Management function
The UE Radio Capability Management function is related to the UE radio
capability handling.
## 5.18 NRPPa Signaling Transport function
The NRPPa (NR Positioning Protocol A) Signalling Transport function provides
means to transport an NRPPa (3GPP TS 38.455 [10]) message transparently over
the NG interface.
## 5.19 Overload Control function
The overload function provides means to enable AMF controls the load that the
NG-RAN node(s) are generating.
## 5.20 Report of Secondary RAT data volumes Function
The Report of Secondary RAT data volumes Function enables the NG-RAN node to
report Secondary RAT usage data information in case of MR-DC, either with a
dedicated procedure or by including Secondary RAT usage data information in
other messages.

The control plane protocol stack of the NG interface is shown on Figure 7.1-1.
The transport network layer is built on IP transport. For the reliable
