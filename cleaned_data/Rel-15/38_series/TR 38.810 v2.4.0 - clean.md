# 1 Scope
The objective of this study is to define the over the air (OTA) testing
methodology for UE RF, UE RRM, and UE demodulation requirements for New Radio,
the associated measurement uncertainty budget(s), and the related test
tolerances.
The testing methodology development targets frequencies above 6 GHz, and the
work is prioritized according to the frequency ranges that are included in the
NR work item.
For mmWave NR UEs, RF requirements are specified as OTA requirements, using
the applicable metrics. The definitions of these requirements are expected to
align the spatial coverage of the requirement with the UE\'s working condition
acceptable in expected directions. NR is expected to be used in more than one
type of UEs, and different spatial coverage requirements may apply to
different UE types.

\- Laptop mounted equipment (such as plug-in devices like USB dongles)
\- Laptop embedded equipment
\- Tablet
\- Wearable devices
\- Vehicular mounted device

\- Fixed mounted devices (e.g. sensors, automation etc.)
\- Other UE types are not precluded for discussion as a second priority.

values equals to the number of receiver branches on the UE
\- Additional TI functionality is not precluded
## 4.4 Equivalence criteria
The following 11 points have been agreed as a framework for developing OTA
test to prove equivalence.
1) Multiple test methods may exist for each requirement.
2) Each test method will require its own test procedure.
3) A single conformance requirement applies for each core requirement,
regardless of test procedure.
4) Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty applies for all test
methods addressing the same test requirement. Test methods producing
significantly worse uncertainty than others at comparable cost should not
impact the common maximum accepted test system uncertainty assessment.
5) Common test tolerances apply for all test methods addressing the same test
requirement.
6) A common way of establishing the uncertainty result from all test methods\'
individual budgets is established.
7) A common method of making an uncertainty budget (not a common uncertainty
budget) is established.
8) Establish budget format examples for each addressed test method in the form
of lists of uncertainty contributions. Contributions that may be negligible
with some DUT and substantial with others should be in this list. For each
combination of measurement method and test parameter develop a list with
measurement uncertainties.
9) Describe potential OTA test methods. The description requires information
about the test range architecture and test procedure. Addressing each item in
each uncertainty budget with respect to the expected distribution of the
errors, the mechanism creating the error and how it interacts with properties
of the DUT.
10) Providing example uncertainty budgets in the TR will be useful in order to
demonstrate the way a budget should be defined and how calculating its
resulting measurement uncertainty is done, but the figures used in the
examples will clearly be only examples and not applicable in general.
11) Each test method is required to provide technical documentation showing
the equivalence of testing methodologies, justification on applicability
statement and usage of same baseline metrics for the alternative
methodologies.
> Each testing methodology needs to provide applicability to test the
> following metrics and outline the testing aspects once the metrics are
> properly defined:
  * EIRP and TRP based metric
  * EIS based metric
  * Transmit signal quality
  * Radiated Spurious Emissions
  * Blocking (currently only IBB defined)
NOTE: Potential dynamic range limitations, measurement uncertainties and
detailed test procedures are to be considered within UE conformance test
aspects for 5G System with NR and LTE (Work Item 5GS_NR_LTE-UEConTest).
The linking of core requirements via test methods to conformance requirements
is depicted in Figure 4.4-1.

# 5 UE RF testing methodology
## 5.1 General
It is reasonable to expect a high level of integration of high-frequency NR
devices (e.g., devices operating above 6 GHz). Such highly integrated
architectures may feature innovative front-end solutions, multi-element
antenna arrays, passive and active feeding networks, etc. that may not be able
to physically expose a front-end cable connector to the test equipment.
For UE RF test methodology at high frequency (f > 6 GHz), the following
general aspects apply:
\- OTA measurement is the testing methodology for UE RF at high frequency (f >
6 GHz)
\- Permitted test methods are defined in subclause 5.2 and shall demonstrate
equivalence to the far field environment.
## 5.2 Permitted test methods
A permitted test method meets the equivalence criteria to the far field
environment by having an MU less than or equal to the threshold MU for at
least one test case. The applicability of methods is described in subclause
5.3.
### 5.2.1 Direct far field (DFF)
#### 5.2.1.1 Description
The DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for f > 6 GHz is capable of
centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1
below.
{width="3.0in" height="2.2819444444444446in"}
Figure 5.2.1.1-1: DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics
The key aspects of the DFF setup are:
\- Far-field measurement system in an anechoic chamber
\- The criterion for determining the far-field distance is described in
5.2.1.2
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains
a polarization reference.
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the link antenna and the
DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains a polarization reference;
this positioning system for the link antenna is in addition to the positioning
system for the measurement antenna and provides for an angular relationship
independently controllable from the measurement antenna.
\- **For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in non-
standalone (NSA) mode with 1 UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is used to
provide the LTE link to the DUT.** The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE
signal without precise path loss or polarization control.
\- **For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT.** The NR FR1
link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.
The applicability criteria of the DFF setup are:
\- The DUT radiating aperture is D â‰¤ 5 cm
\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures or
multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested
\- If multiple antenna panels that are phase coherent are defined as a single
array, the criterion on DUT radiating aperture applies to this single array
\- D is based on the MU assessment in Annex B.1.1.3
\- The measurement distance larger than the far-field criteria defined in
subclause 5.2.1.2 is not precluded
\- If the uncertainties can be further optimized, the MU may be reduced or D
may be increased
\- A manufacturer declaration on the following elements is needed:
\- Manufacturer declares antenna array size
\- EIRP, TRP, EIS, EVM, spurious emissions and blocking metrics can be tested.
#### 5.2.1.2 Far-field criteria
The minimum far-field distance R for a traditional far field anechoic chamber
can be calculated based on the following equation: $R >
\frac{2D^{2}}{\lambda}$where D is the diameter of the smallest sphere that
encloses the radiating parts of the DUT. The near/far field boundary for
different antenna sizes and frequencies is shown in Table 5.2.1.2-1.
Table 5.2.1.2-1: Near field/far field boundary for different frequencies and
antenna sizes for a traditional far field anechoic chamber
* * *
D(cm) Frequency (GHz) Near/far boundary (cm) Path Loss(dB) Frequency (GHz)
Near/far boundary (cm) Path Loss(dB) 5 28 47 54.8 100 167 76.9 10 28 187 66.8
100 667 88.9 15 28 420 73.9 100 1501 96 20 28 747 78.9 100 2668 101 25 28 1167
82.7 100 4169 105 30 28 1681 85.9 100 6004 108
* * *
As can be seen in the table, the distance can be very large for larger antenna
sizes and higher frequencies. This could lead to very large chambers that
would be prohibitively expensive.
Generally, the exact antenna size of the DUT is unknown since the device will
be in its own casing during the test and this also depends on other factors
such as ground coupling effects that depend on the design. The largest device
size (e.g. diagonal) could be used; however, this would lead to very large
chambers even for relatively small devices. A practical way to determine the
far field distance is needed.
It has been proposed to determine the testing distance based on a manufacturer
declaration. One of the risks of this approach is that a distance shorter than
the actual far field is chose. It should be further studied whether this could
lead to underperforming devices passing the tests due to measurement
inaccuracies (e.g. whether a shorter distance will lead to better measurement
results than the actual far field distance).
Additionally, an experimental method was proposed to determine the far field
distance based on path loss measurements. This method is based on the fact
that the path loss exponent is different in the near field and the far field.
By measuring the path loss gradient over a certain distance, the near/far
field boundary could be found. The results of an experiment conducted on a
Band 3 LTE device are shown in Figure 5.2.1.2-1. The minimum far field
distance can be found at the regression intercept point.
{width="4.000694444444444in" height="2.604861111111111in"}
Figure 5.2.1.2-1: LTE UE FDD band 3 measurements to determine the minimum far-
field distance
The figure shows an example result for the case where the frequency is 1.85
GHz. The approximate device dimensions were 13 x 8 cm. Under these conditions,
the canonical minimum far-field distance would be 28.7 cm. According to this
method, the minimum measurement distance would be 13.8 cm. Further work is
required to determine whether this technique provides valid results for much
higher frequencies and general device types.
Methods to reduce measurement distance for AAS BS are Compact Antenna Test
Range, One Dimensional Compact Range, and Near Field Test Range which are all
listed in TR 37.842 [9]. These may be used for NR provided they meet the
equivalence criteria relative to the baseline measurement setup. Other methods
are not precluded.
#### 5.2.1.3 Testing and calibration aspects
##### 5.2.1.3.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure
The calibration measurement is done by using a calibration antenna with known
gain values. For the calibration measurement, the reference antenna is placed
in the centre of the quiet zone. If an antenna with moving phase centre is
used, a multi-segmented approach could be chosen where for multiple frequency
segments the respective phase centre of the calibration antenna is placed in
the centre of quiet zone. The calibration process determines the composite
loss, L~path,pol~, of the entire transmission and receiver chain path gains
(measurement antenna, amplification) and losses (switches, combiners, cables,
path loss, etc.). The calibration measurement is repeated for each measurement
path (two orthogonal polarizations and each signal path). Additional details
of the calibration procedure are outlined in [13].
##### 5.2.1.3.2 EIRP Measurement Procedure
The TX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIRP scan (separately for each
orthogonal polarization) with a grid points that is 10224 (2.5deg step size)
using constant step approach or 7080 using constant density approach (using
the charged particle implementation). The TX beam peak direction is where the
maximum total component of EIRP is found. The spherical coverage measurement
grid points is the same as that for beam peak direction searching, i.e. 10224
(2.5deg step size) for constant step or 7080 for constant density (using the
charged particle implementation). The measurement grids is calculated under
assumption of 8x2 patch antenna array, MU of absolute TX power beam peak
measurement of 0.5dB.
1) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the measurement
antenna with polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the
previously determined TX beam peak direction and respective polarization.
2) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the test.
3) Measure the mean power (P~meas,\ Î¸~) of the modulated signal arriving at
the power measurement equipment (such as a spectrum analyser, power meter, or
gNB emulator).
4) Calculate EIRP~Î¸~ by adding the composite loss of the entire transmission
path for utilized signal path, L~EIRP,Î¸~, and frequency to the measured power
P~meas,Î¸~
5) Measure the mean power (P~meas,Ï†~) of the modulated signal arriving at the
power measurement equipment.
6) Calculate EIRP~Ï†~ by adding the composite losses of the entire transmission
path for utilized signal path, L~EIRP,Ï†~, and frequency to the measured power
P~meas,Ï†~
7) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~Î¸~ + EIRP~Ï†~
##### 5.2.1.3.3 TRP Measurement Procedure
> The min. number of measurement points for TRP measurement grid is calculated
> based on 8x2 patch antenna array, a maximum standard deviation of 0.25dB.
>
> If constant step approach is used for TRP measurement, several measurement
> grids are permitted:
  1. 264 measurement points (15deg step size) with TX beam peak oriented in any direction; an additional mean error of 0.34dB need to be considered by using classic TRP equation);
  2. 612 measurement points (10deg step size) with the TX beam peak oriented in any direction using classic TRP equation; no additional mean error needs to be considered
> If constant density approach (using the charged particle or the golden
> spiral implementation) is used, the min. number of measurement points is
> 140; no additional mean error needs to be considered.
1) Connect the SS with the DUT through the measurement antenna with desired
polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the desired TX
beam direction and respective polarization.
2) Lock the beam toward that direction and polarization for the entire
duration of the test.
3) For each measurement point, measure P~meas,Î¸~ and P~meas,Ï†~. The angle
between the measurement antenna and the DUT (Î¸~Meas~, Ï†~Meas~) is achieved by
rotating the measurement antenna and the DUT (based on system architecture).
4) Calculate EIRP~Î¸~ (EIRP~Ï†~) by adding the composite loss of the entire
transmission path for utilized signal paths, L~EIRP,Î¸~, (L~EIRP,Ï†~) and
frequency to the measured powers P~meas,Î¸~ (P~meas,Ï†~)
5) The TRP value for the uniform measurement grid is calculated using\
{width="3.5347222222222223in" height="0.4861111111111111in"}\ Where N is the
number of angular intervals in the nominal theta range from 0 to Ï€ and M is
the number of angular intervals in the nominal phi range from 0 to 2Ï€.\ The
TRP values for the constant density grids are calculated using:\
{width="2.638888888888889in" height="0.4652777777777778in"}\ where
{width="0.10416666666666667in" height="0.1597222222222222in"} is the number of
measurement points.
##### 5.2.1.3.4 EIS Measurement Procedure
The RX beam peak direction is found with a 3D RSRP scan (separately for each
orthogonal polarization) with a same grid points as 3D EIRP scan. The RX beam
peak direction is where the maximum total component of RSRP is found.
1) Establish a connection between the DUT and the SS with the downlink signal
applied to the Î¸-polarization of the measurement antenna
2) Position the UE so that the beam is formed towards the measurement antenna
in the RX beam peak direction
3) Determine EIS~Î¸~ for Î¸-polarization, i.e., the power level for the
Î¸-polarization at which the throughput exceeds the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel
4) Switch the downlink to the Ï†-polarization of the measurement antenna
5) Determine EIS~Ï†~ for Ï†-polarization, i.e., the power level for the
Ï†-polarization at which the throughput exceeds the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel
6) Calculate the resulting EIS for the total component
EIS = [1/EIS~Î¸~ +1/EIS~Ï†~]^-1^
##### 5.2.1.3.5 EVM Measurement Procedure
The TX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIRP scan (separately for each
orthogonal polarization) with a grid that is TBD. The TX beam peak direction
is where the maximum total component of EIRP is found.
1) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the measurement
antenna with polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the
previously determined TX beam peak direction and respective polarization.
2) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the test.
3) Measure EVM~Î¸~ for the Î¸-polarization of the modulated signal arriving at
the measurement equipment (such as a signal analyser, or gNB emulator).
4) Measure EVMÏ† for the Ï†-polarization of the modulated signal arriving at the
measurement equipment (such as a signal analyser, or gNB emulator).
6) Compare EVM~Î¸~ and EVMÏ† against the test requirement. If either EVM~Î¸~ or
EVMÏ† meets the requirement, pass the UE.

orthogonal polarization) with a grid that is TBD. The RX beam peak direction
is where the maximum total component of RSRP is found.
1) Establish a connection between the DUT and the SS with the downlink signal
applied to the Î¸-polarization of the measurement antenna
2) Position the UE so that the beam is formed towards the measurement antenna
in the RX beam peak direction
3) Apply a signal with the specified reference measurement channel on the
Î¸-polarization, setting the power level of the signal 3dB below the level for
the total component stated in the requirement.

### 5.2.2 Direct far field (DFF) setup simplification for centre of beam
measurements
#### 5.2.2.1 Description
The DFF setup in 5.2.1 can be simplified in the following way to perform
centre of the beam measurements:
\- The measurement and the link antenna can be combined so that the single
antenna is used to steer the beam and to perform UE RF measurements.
The measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for f > 6 GHz capable of centre
of beam measurements and is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1 below.
{width="3.0in" height="2.370138888888889in"}
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: Centre of beam measurement setup of UE RF characteristics
The applicability criteria of the simplified DFF setup for centre of beam
measurements are defined in 5.2.1.1.
#### 5.2.2.3 Far-field criteria
The far-field criteria of the simplified DFF setup for centre of beam
measurements are defined in 5.2.1.2.
#### 5.2.2.3 Testing and calibration aspects
The same testing and calibration aspects apply as outlined in 5.2.1.3.
### 5.2.3 Indirect far field (IFF) method 1
The IFF method 1 creates the far field environment using a transformation with
a parabolic reflector. This is also known as the compact antenna test range
(CATR). Refer to Annex E for additional information.
#### 5.2.3.1 Description
The IFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for f > 6 GHz is capable of
centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure 5.2.3.1-1
below.
Figure 5.2.3.1-1: IFF method 1 (CATR) measurement setup of UE RF
characteristic
The key aspects of this test method setup are:
\- Indirect Far field of Compact Antenna Test Range as the one used in [9]
with quiet zone diameter at least D.
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains
a polarization reference.
\- Before performing the UBF, the measurement probe acts as a link antenna
maintaining polarization reference with respect to the DUT. Once the beam is
locked then the link is to be passed to the link antenna which maintains
reliable signal level with respect to the DUT.
\- For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in non-
standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is used to
provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE
signal without precise path loss or polarization control.
\- **For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT.** The NR FR1
link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.
The applicability criteria of this test method are:
\- The total test volume is a cylinder with diameter d and height h.
\- DUT must fit within the total test volume for the entire duration of the
test.
\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures or
multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested.
\- EIRP, TRP, EIS, EVM, spurious emissions and blocking metrics can be tested.
\- No manufacturer declaration is needed.
#### 5.2.3.2 Far-field criteria
The CATR system does not require a measurement distance of $R >
\frac{2D^{2}}{\lambda}$ to achieve a plane wave as in a standard far field
range.
The tables 5.2.3.2-1 and 5.2.3.2-2 below show the paths losses which can be
expected for the CATR compared to a Fraunhofer limit distance ($R >
\frac{2D^{2}}{\lambda}$).

antenna sizes for a traditional far field anechoic chamber

* * *
For CATR, the FF distance is seen as the focal length, distance between the
feed and reflector for a CATR, which can be calculated as shown below (as a
rule of thumb although it can vary depending on system implementation):
\- D =x [m]
\- size of reflector = 2*D
\- R = focal length = 3.5*size of reflector = 3.5*(2*D)
In a CATR, from the reflector to the quiet zone, there is a plane wave with no
space loss.
For both direct FF and CATR, free space path loss is calculated by applying
the Free Space Loss formula with R=FF distance: {width="0.5194444444444445in"
height="0.41388888888888886in"}.

The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna (SGH used in
figure 5.2.3.3.1-1) with known efficiency or gain values. In the calibration
measurement the reference antenna is measured in the same place as the DUT,
and the attenuation of the complete transmission path (Câ†”A, as in figure
5.2.3.3.1-1) from the DUT to the measurement receiver (EIRP), and from the RF
source to DUT (EIS) is calibrated out. Figure 5.2.3.3.1-1 presents a setup of
a typical compact antenna test range for EIRP calibration:

##### 5.2.3.3.2 EIRP Measurement Procedure
The TX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIRP scan (separately for each
orthogonal polarization) with a grid that is TBD. The TX beam peak direction
is where the maximum total component of EIRP is found.

antenna with polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the
previously determined TX beam peak direction and respective polarization.

### 5.2.4 Near field to far field transform (NFTF)
The NFTF method computes the metrics defined in Far Field by using the Near
Field to Far Field transformation.
#### 5.2.4.1 Description
The NFTF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for f > 6 GHz is capable
of centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure
5.2.4.1-1:
{width="4.08125in" height="3.5in"}
Figure 5.2.4.1-1: Typical NFTF measurement setup of EIRP/TRP measurements
The key aspects of the Near Field test range are:
  * Radiated Near Field UE beam pattern are measured and based on the > NFtoFF mathematical transform, the final metric such as EIRP is > the same as the metric for the baseline setup
  * A positioning system such as the angle between the dual-polarized > measurement/link antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of > freedom and maintains a polarization reference
  * For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in > non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link > antenna is used to provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link > antenna provides a stable LTE signal without precise path loss or > polarization control.

  * EIRP, TRP, and spurious emissions metrics can be tested.
#### 5.2.4.2 Testing and calibration aspects
##### 5.2.4.2.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure
Calibration accounts for the various factors affecting the measurements of the
EIRP. These factors include components such as range length path loss, cable
losses, gain of the receiving antenna, etc. Each measured data point for
radiated power is transformed from a relative value in dB to an absolute value
in dBm. For doing that the total path loss from the DUT to the measurement
receiver, named L path loss is calibrated out. The calibration measurement is
usually done by using a reference antenna with known gain. This approach is
based on the so called gain-comparison method. Figure 5.2.4.3-1 shows the
typical configuration for measuring path loss.
{width="6.3in" height="3.227777777777778in"}
Figure 5.2.4.2-1: NFTF -- Typical setup for path loss measurement
The L path loss can be determined from the power into the reference antenna by
adding the gain of the reference antenna:
Piso = Pref + Gref
so that:
L path loss = Pref + Gref - Ptest
In order to determine Pref, a cable reference measurement is performed in
order to calibrate out the A, and B paths. Assuming that the power at the
source is fixed, it can be showed that:
Pref-Ptes=Prec\'-Prec
Where Prec and Prec\' are the power measured at the receiver during the
calibration measurement with the reference antenna and the power measured at
the receiver during the cable reference measurement respectively. L path loss
is then given by:
L path loss = Gref + Prec\' - Prec
##### 5.2.4.2.2 EIRP Measurement Procedure
The TX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIRP scan (separately for each
orthogonal polarization) with a grid that is TBD. The TX beam peak direction
is where the maximum total component of EIRP is found.
1) Connect the SS (System Simulator) to the DUT through the measurement
antenna with polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the
previously determined TX beam peak direction and respective polarization.
2) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the test.
3) Perform a 3D pattern measurement (amplitude and phase) with the DUT sending
a modulated signal.
4) Determine the EIRP for both polarization towards the TX beam peak direction
by using a Near Field to Far Field transform.
5) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~Î¸~ + EIRP~Ï†~
##### 5.2.4.2.3 TRP Measurement Procedure
1) Connect the SS to the DUT through the measurement antenna with polarization
reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the previously determined TX
beam peak direction and respective polarization.
2) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the test.
> 3) Perform a 3D pattern measurement (amplitude and phase) with the DUT
> sending a modulated signal.
4) For each measurement point on the TBD grid, determine the EIRP for both

## 5.3 Test method applicability
The test methods in subclause 5.2 are applicable to test cases based on being
less than or equal to a threshold MU.
The threshold MU for the equivalence framework will be based on direct far
field (DFF) test method for D â‰¤ 5 cm and for indirect far field (IFF) test
method for D > 5 cm.
A permitted test method will have applicability to at least one test case.
Applicability is a function of DUT Antenna Configuration as defined in Table
5.3-1. DUT Antenna Configuration can be chosen by an optional declaration from
a manufacturer.

* * *
DUT Antenna Configuration Description Configuration 1 Maximum one antenna
panel with D â‰¤ 5 cm active at any one time Configuration 2 More than one
antenna panel D â‰¤ 5 cm without phase coherence between panels active at any

# 6 UE RRM testing methodology
## 6.1 General
Testability aspects of the UE have been considered. Unless otherwise indicated
below, device under test (DUT) refers to UE nodes. The exact list of RRM tests
for UE can only be determined once the core requirements are settled.
For frequency bands above 6 GHz (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors
are assumed not to be available at DUT and the OTA testing is considered as
the baseline approach for NR UE RRM testing methodology.
The possibility of performing conducted tests using an intermediate frequency
(IF) were evaluated. It was decided that this approach would be challenging to
standardise for various reasons since IF is an internal interface in the DUT
and using a standardised IF (signal level, number of IF ports, IF frequency
etc.) would preclude many different DUT implementations including direct
conversion receivers. In addition, IF testing excludes all components which
operate at the radio frequency such as RF filters, duplexers, transmit receive
switch, low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), analogue beamforming
phase shifting elements etc., and the algorithms which control such components
from the test.
Further details of a suitable OTA test environment are to be discussed in the
work item, and may have impact to the core requirements which are defined. For
example, side conditions for the applicability of core requirements should be
defined in a way in which they can be ensured in an OTA environment.

\- Wanted and noise (AWGN) signals can be transmitted from one or both active
probes. Test description will define the exact signal/noise/SNR/SINR level per
TRxP at the reference point.

# 7 UE demodulation and CSI testing methodology
## 7.1 General
This clause describes the testing methodology for NR UE demodulation and CSI
reporting for FR2. Unless otherwise indicated below, device under test (DUT)
refers to UE nodes. The exact list of demodulation and CSI reporting tests for
the UE can only be determined once the core requirements are settled and the
test methodologies are considered in generic way to allow testing of typical
UE demodulation CSI metrics.
For frequency bands above 6 GHz (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors

and using a standardised IF (signal level, number of IF ports, IF frequency
etc.) would preclude many different DUT implementations including direct

## 8.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB
sources are modelled as Single probe channel models.
### 8.2.1 Single probe channel modelling methodology
Two options for Single probe channel modelling methodology were identified as
described in subclause 8.2.1.1 and 8.2.1.2, including details on generating
each single probe channel option.
Both Option 1 and Option 2 methodologies were concluded as feasible from test
equipment perspective. Selection between the methodologies and the selection
of specific parameters (e.g. power delay profile) are to be done in the scope
of Rel. 15 NR UE performance requirements work.
FR2 measurement system is expected to support modelling of multi-path fading
for single carrier scenarios with channel bandwidth of at least 200 MHz. The
support of channel modelling for CA scenarios is not precluded.
### 8.2.1.1 Channel model Option 1
Channel model option 1 is based on the TDL methodology in the TR 38.901 Error:
Reference source not found:
  * The multi-path propagation conditions model consists of several > parts:
    * A power delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\" (TDL), characterized by a number of taps with certain power at fixed positions on a sampling grid.
    * The channel model parameters include the Delay spread scaling factor and the maximum Doppler frequency. The test system shall allow flexible control of the respective parameters.
  * Each tap is modeled based on the Jakes fading model.
  * Generation of TDL channel models and power delay profiles from CDL > channel models by including spatial filters to capture Tx and Rx > antenna patterns is not precluded and based on the procedure > described in the TR 38.901 Error: Reference source not found.
The method to generate fading coefficients (Jakes fading model) satisfying the
target parameters is not specified in [10]. Traditionally, there has been two
methods to implement this type of tapped delay line models:
  * The first alternative is to use the noise filtering, where the > Doppler power spectrum is realized by Doppler spectrum shaping > filtering of iid complex Gaussian noise sample sequences. This > step is followed by generating the MIMO correlations between > sequences by multiplying them with factored target MIMO > correlation matrix. The matrix has dimensions US x US, where U and > S denote the number of Rx and Tx antennas, respectively.
  * The second alternative is the sum-of-sinusoids method, where the > temporal characteristics (Doppler power spectrum) are generated by > summing a number of sinusoids with specific phase, amplitude and > frequency characteristics. This step is followed by generating the > MIMO correlations between sequences by multiplying them with > factored target MIMO correlation matrix. The matrix has dimensions > US x US, where U and S denote the number of Rx and Tx antennas, > respectively.
### 8.2.1.2 Channel model Option 2
This subclause considers channel model methodology with non-Jakes spectrum.
Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the gNB emulator and test
chamber probe is modelled based on Clustered Delay Line (CDL) methodology in
TR 38.901 [10]. Doppler Spread and MIMO correlation related to such
methodology is defined in subclauses 8.2.1.2.1 and 8.2.1.2.2 respectively.
To generate the multi-path fading propagation conditions, the following step
by step procedure modified from [10] should be used to generate channel
coefficients using the CDL models:
[Step 1:]{.underline} Generate cluster delays $\tau_{n,\text{scaled}}$ (from
subclause 7.7.3 in [10])
The RMS delay spread values of CDL models are normalized and they must be
scaled in delay so that a desired RMS delay spread can be achieved. The scaled
delays can be obtained according to the following equation:
$\tau_{n,\text{scaled}} = \tau_{n,\text{model}} \cdot
\text{DS}_{\text{desired}}$ (1)
in which
  * $\tau_{n,\text{model}}$ is the normalized delay value of the _n_ th cluster in a CDL in Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of [10]
  * $\tau_{n,\text{scaled}}$ is the new delay value (in [ns]) of the _n_ th cluster
  * $\text{DS}_{\text{desired}}$ is the wanted delay spread (in [ns]) and it must be specified as a channel model parameter
[Step 1.1:]{.underline} In the case of LOS models (D and E) scale cluster the
powers as specified in subclause 7.7.6 of [10]. The target Ricean K-factor
values _K_ ~desired~ must be specified.
[Step 2:]{.underline} Generate departure and arrival angles (based on
subclause 7.7.1 step 1 in [10] combining 7.7-5 and part of step 7 in subclause
7.5 in [10] adding some clarifications to the parameters considered)
Generate arrival angles of azimuth using the following equation
$\varphi_{n,m,\text{AOA,scaled}} =
\frac{\text{AS}_{\text{desired}}}{\text{AS}_{\text{model}}}\left(
\varphi_{n,\text{AOA}} + c_{\text{ASA}}\alpha_{m} - \mu_{\varphi,\text{model}}
\right) + \mu_{\varphi,\text{model}}$, (2)
where
  * _Ï†~n,~_ ~AOA~ and _c_ ~ASA~ are the cluster AOA and the cluster-wise rms azimuth spread of arrival angles (cluster ASA), respectively, in Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of [10]
  * _Î±~m~_ denotes the ray offset angles within a cluster given by Table 7.5-3 of [10],
  * $\mu_{\varphi,\text{model}} = \text{arg}\left{ \sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}{\text{exp}\left( \text{jÏ†}_{n,m} \right)P_{n,m}^{l\text{inear}}}} \right}$ is the mean angle of the original channel model table in NLOS case (equation is specified in Annex A.2 of [10]) and the LOS angle $\mu_{\varphi,\text{model}} = \varphi_{1,\text{AOA}}$ in LOS case,
  * $\text{AS}_{\text{model}}$ are the angular spreads. derived^1)^ from the original CDL Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of [10], they are listed in Table 8.2.1.2-1
  * $\text{AS}_{\text{desired}}$ is the wanted angular spread. It must be specified.
The angular scaling according to eq. (2) is applied to the ray angles and no
further scaling is performed. The generation of AOD
($\varphi_{n,m,\text{AOD}}$), ZSA ($\theta_{n,m,\text{ZOA}}$), and ZSD
($\theta_{n,m,\text{ZOD}}$) follows a procedure similar to AOA as described
above.
Note: The azimuth angles may need to be wrapped around to be within [0, 360]
degrees, while the zenith angles may need to be clipped to be within [0, 180]
degrees.
^1)^ _The angular spread in this case is the rms angular spread without
finding the minimum value over angular rotations._

Table 8.2.1.2-1 contains the angle spread values of the original CDL models of
38.901 ([2]) before any angular scaling. The values are calculated for the
angles AOD, AOA, ZOD, and ZOA angles after removing the mean angle
{width="0.8in" height="0.18333333333333332in"} following the definition of rms
angular spread in TR25.997, without finding the minimum over circular shifts.
[]{.underline}
[Step 3:]{.underline} Coupling of rays within a cluster for both azimuth and
elevation (based on step 2 in 7.7.1 in [10] assuming fix coupling instead of
random)
Couple AOD angles $\varphi_{n,m,\text{AOD}}$ to AOA angles
$\varphi_{n,m,\text{AOA}}$ within a cluster _n_. Couple ZOD angles
$\theta_{n,m,\text{ZOD}}$ with ZOA angles $\theta_{n,m,\text{ZOA}}$using the
same procedure. Couple AOD angles $\varphi_{n,m,\text{AOD}}$ with ZOD angles
$\theta_{n,m,\text{ZOD}}$within a cluster _n_. Instead of random procedure,
the coupling is performed using the fixed coupling pattern. It must be
specified.
[Step 4:]{.underline} Generate the cross-polarization power ratios (from
subclause 7.7.1 step 3 in [10])
Calculate the linear cross polarization power ratios (XPR) _Îº_ for each ray
_m_ of each cluster _n_ as
$\kappa_{n,m} = \text{10}^{\frac{X}{\text{10}}}$, (3)
where _X_ is the per-cluster XPR in dB and must be specified.
[Step 5:]{.underline} Specify gNB beam pattern (based on subclause 7.3 of [10]
plus assumptions for gNB antenna)
With definitions and symbols of subclause 7.3 of [10] (except substitute
N:=_N~e~_ , M:=_M~e~_ to avoid ambiguity), specify parameters (_M~g~_ ,
_N~g~_ ,  _M~e~_ ,  _N~e~_ ,  _P_) and (_d~H~_ , _d~V~)._
Antenna element radiation patterns, including orientation of the element main
polarization components as well as orientation of the antenna array should be
specified.
It is assumed the co-polarized elements of the array are combined to a single
RF port, i.e. they compose an antenna array that can form beams by setting
certain weights per element.Weight vector for the first polarization and for
the second polarization is
{width="3.7333333333333334in" height="0.30833333333333335in"} (4)
where ${\overline{d}}_{\text{tx},m_{e},n_{e}}$ is the location vector of
transmit antenna element {width="0.85in" height="0.175in"} and
{width="0.7916666666666666in" height="0.175in"}.
[Step 6]{.underline}: Specify initial phases
Instead of drawing initial phases {width="1.4833333333333334in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} randomly for each ray _m_ of each cluster _n_
and for four different polarisation combinations (_Î¸Î¸_ , _Î¸Ï•,_ _Ï•Î¸,_ _Ï•Ï•_),
initial phases must be specified.
[Step 7:]{.underline} Coefficient generation (based on step 4 in [10])
Follow the same procedure as in Steps 10 and 11 in Subclause 7.5 in [10], with
the exception that all clusters are treated as "weaker cluster", i.e. no
further sub-clusters in delay should be generated^2)^. Additional clusters
representing delay spread of the stronger clusters are already provided in
Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 in [10]. Once weight vector in equation 4 is
combined with eq. (7.5-22) and eq. (7.5-29) in [10], the following equations
apply respectively:
{width="5.961111111111111in" height="0.4388888888888889in"} (5)
{width="6.355555555555555in" height="0.4305555555555556in"} (6)
where s goes from 1 to S, being S the number of gNB RF ports
^2)^ _Note: This may need to be changed such that the three rows of CDL tables
containing equal angular parameters are treated as a single cluster with three
mid-paths as in Step 11 of Subclause 7.5 in [10]._
As shown above, this model is using following parameters
  * Base CDL model from CDL models defined in [10, Subclause 7.7.1] characterized by normalized delay, power, AOA, AOD, ZOA and ZOD for each cluster; delay spread, angular spread and mean angle for AOA, AOD, ZOA and ZOD. Further simplification of CDL models in [10, Subclause 7.7.1] can be defined in UE demodulation performance discussion.
  * Emulated gNB related parameters: gNB antenna field pattern, gNB antenna orientation and polarization
  * Emulated UE related parameters: UE antenna field pattern, UE antenna orientation and polarization, UE speed and direction
  * Initial phases {width="1.4833333333333334in" height="0.26666666666666666in"} for each ray _m_ of each cluster _n_ for NLOS paths and distance d~3D~ (explained in [10, Figure 7.4.1-1] to model LOS path loss) for LOS path.
  * Tx/Rx beam selection procedure between emulated gNB and emulated UE antenna
  * Rician K factor for LOS CDL base models
  * Carrier Frequency
  * Fixed pairing between angles of arrival and angles of departure in Step 2 described in [10, Subclause 7.7.1].
#### 8.2.1.2.1 MIMO Correlation
From equation 7.5-22 in [10], fading coefficients are generated per Tx per Rx
for each cluster. Therefore, MIMO correlation matrix can be computed from
those coefficients for each cluster. So, MIMO correlation matrix spectrum is
implicit in the way we generate the fading channel coefficients and does not
need to be modelled explicitly.
It is noted that the MIMO correlation can be controlled by introducing Ricean
K-factor to all model scenarios and setting the K-factor properly.
Alternatively, the MIMO correlation can be controlled by modifying the XPR
parameter. However, this depends on the selected antenna model.
### 8.2.2 Path Delay grid for channel models
The path delay grid for the channel models is defined as equidistant delay
grid n*âˆ†T with nâˆˆN~0~ and âˆ†Tâ‰¤1/BW.
For single carrier scenarios BW is defined as 200 MHz. For intra-band CA
scenarios BW requires further studies. The BW used for these scenarios will be
discussed and decided as part of the NR work item performance part.
In case multiple taps of the original delay profile end up with the same
delay, the powers of the individual taps are added, resulting in a single path
with the combined power.
Each tap of the denormalized delay profiled shall be mapped to the closest
point of the delay grid defined by n*âˆ†T. In case a tap in the delay profile
lies equidistant between two points of the delay grid, it shall be mapped to
the larger delay grid point.
An example for mapping the delays in a denormalized profile to the equidistant
delay grid is given in clause 8.X.1.
### 8.2.2.1 Example for determining the resulting delay profile
A power delay profile after denormalization is given as follows in Table
8.2.2.1-1.
Table 8.2.2.1-1: Original power delay profile

_Ïƒ~3~^2^_ 23 4 _Ïƒ~4~^2^_ 26 5 _Ïƒ~5~^2^_ 27 6 _Ïƒ~6~^2^_ 33
* * *
With the assumption of âˆ†T â‰¤1/(200 MHz) the taps from Table 8.2.2.1-1 can be
mapped onto an equidistant delay grid as shown in Table 8.2.2.1-2.
Table 8.2.2.1-2: Power delay profile after mapping to delay grid

* * *
Since multiple taps share the same delay, those taps need to be combined into
a single tap as shown in Table 8.2.2.1-3.

## 8.3 Static propagation conditions
The test methods shall allow emulation of the following static propagation
conditions for the UE with 2RX antenna port as follows.
For 1 port transmission the emulated channel matrix is defined in the
frequency domain by
$H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 1 \ \end{pmatrix}$.
For 2 port transmission the emulated channel matrix is defined in the
frequency domain by
$H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & j \ 1 & \- j \ \end{pmatrix}$.
Note: Channel matrices above for static propagation conditions are the channel
matrices generated by the channel emulator.
###### ### Annex A: Environment conditions
# A.1 Operating voltage
All nominal voltage test cases shall be performed with the DUT operated in
stand-alone battery powered mode except for DUTs whose power is provided only
from AC mains. For extreme voltage test cases, the UE shall fulfil all the
requirements in the full voltage range, i.e. the voltage range between the
extreme voltages. When those test cases require an external power source with
cables connected to the DUT that could adversely affect the device
performance, it shall be demonstrated that there is negligible impact to
performance with the device operated in stand-alone battery powered mode
compared to the device operated in external power mode first before performing
the extreme voltage test cases.
###### ### Annex B: Measurement uncertainty
# B.1 Measurement uncertainty budget for UE RF testing methodology

### B.1.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute
gain is known at the frequencies of measurement
\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the transmitter or
receiver is performed.
The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:
1) The uncertainty source,

### B.1.1.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions
#### B.1.1.4.1 Positioning misalignment
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the beam peak direction of the receiving antenna due to imperfect rotation
operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and vertical
directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the beamwidth
of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a larger
measurement error for a narrower beam.
#### B.1.1.4.2 Measure distance uncertainty
The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of distance
between the measurement antenna and the DUT. If the distance of separation is
2D^2^/lambda based on D being the entire device size, then the phase variation
is 22.5deg. Whether this is the minimum acceptable criteria of phase taper
over the entire DUT is FFS and shall be assessed during final MU definition
for the test method. Any reduction in the distance of separation increases the
phase variation and creates an error which is DUT dependant. Determination of
limit of the error shall be done during final MU definition for the test
method.
#### B.1.1.4.3 Quality of quiet zone
The quality of the quiet zone procedure characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections
within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and support structures.
The MU term additionally includes the amplitude variations effect of
offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT from the centre of the
quiet zone as well as the directivity MU, i.e., the variation of antenna gains
in the different direct line-of-sight links. An additional MU term related to
phase variation and phase ripple effects which depends on measurement distance
is FFS and shall be assessed during final MU definition for the test method.
This might require an augmentation of the quality of the quiet zone validation
procedure.
#### B.1.1.4.4 Mismatch
Mismatch uncertainty occurs when;
\- Changing the signal path between the measurement and calibration procedure
\- Evaluating the insertion loss of a signal path
The mismatch uncertainty for a system consisting of a generator, a load and a
component in between is defined as
{width="5.104166666666667in" height="0.3125in"},
Where {width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.18055555555555555in"} denotes
the reflection coefficient and {width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"} is the transmission coefficient, both in
linear voltage ratios.
For a cascade of several components, the interactions between all components
have to be evaluated. For example, for four devices in a row (shown in Figure
B.1.1.4.4-1) the following contributions have to be accounted for: AB, BC, CD,
ABC, BCD, ABCD. The term ABCD represents the interaction between A and D
(generator and load) with the components B and C in between.
Figure B.1.1.4.4-1: Cascade of components
The combined mismatch uncertainty is given by the root sum square of the
individual contributions:
{width="6.013194444444444in" height="0.2125in"}
In an optimized test procedure, the overall mismatch uncertainty is smaller
when matching pairs of mismatches exist in the calibration and measurement
stage since these pairs cancel each other out. Figure B.1.1.4.4-2 displays a
calibration setup, where device D is replaced by device F. The mismatch
contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC, BCE and ABCE. For a result
based on the measurement and calibration stage, the mismatch contributions AB,
BC, and ABC are matching pairs as they occur both in the measurement and
calibration stage. Thus, they can be eliminated [11], and the system mismatch
uncertainty is obtained as {width="3.9930555555555554in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}
Figure B.1.1.4.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path
In the following, an example mismatch uncertainty calculation for a TX/RX
patch from the measurement equipment to the measurement antenna is performed
for a frequency of 43.5GHz. The example path under investigation consists of
four SPDT switches, one SP6T switch and one DPDT switch and microwave cable
interconnects with PC2.4 mm connectors. The attenuation and reflectance of
typical components suitable for frequencies ranging up to 43.5 GHz have been
considered in the calculation of the mismatch uncertainty.
Figure B1.1.4.4-3 shows a sample system setup for an EIRP/EIS test case with
rather simple complexity of the switch box similar to a current sub 6GHz test
setup. It should be noted that the switch unit is significantly less complex
than a state-of-the-art switch unit currently used for conformance tests.

The calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of 43.5
GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e., the
expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.
Figure B.1.1.4.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the setup.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="1.9319444444444445in"}
Figure B.1.1.4.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage
For the VNA a return loss of 30 dB is assumed after a full two-port
calibration. The calculation of the system mismatch uncertainty applying the
elimination of matching pairs results in a value of 1.0 dB (standard
deviation) with an expanded value of 1.9 dB.
Since the overall mismatch uncertainty value is already a standard deviation,
which is RSS of values divided by the divisor (âˆš2), the overall mismatch
uncertainty value should be divided by actual divisor 1 when calculating total
mismatch.
#### B.1.1.4.5 Absolute antenna gain uncertainty of the measurement antenna
This contribution originates from differences in gain of the calibration
antenna versus the measurement antenna. In practice, the calibration antenna
is used as the measurement antenna so the uncertainty contribution is 0.00.
#### B.1.1.4.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the EIRP
tests as an absolute level. These receiving devices are spectrum analysers,
communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty value will be
indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to be ensured that
appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contributions are specified for the
settings used such as bandwidth and absolute level. If a power meter is used
zero offset, zero drift and measurement noise need to be included.
#### B.1.1.4.7 Phase curvature
This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of UE/reference antenna. At a
measurement distance of 2D^2^/lambda the phase curvature is 22.5 degrees. The
impact of this factor shall be assessed during final MU definition for the
test method.
#### B.1.1.4.8 Amplifier uncertainties
Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement uncertainty.
It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors associated with
the use of such components. For the case of external amplifiers, the following
uncertainties should be considered but the applicability is contingent to the
measurement implementation and calibration procedure.
\- Stability
\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of the
amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both measurement
and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall be considered.
This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by the manufacturers'
data sheet for the operating conditions in which the system will be required
to operate.
\- Linearity
\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier since
in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two different
input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either measured or
determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.
\- Noise Figure
\- When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the SNR at
the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the input. This
added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the Error Rate of the
receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An uncertainty can be
calculated through the following formula:
{width="2.0145833333333334in" height="0.3638888888888889in"}
\- Where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.
\- Mismatch
\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered
systematic and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, the mismatch
uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or determined by
the method described in [12].
\- Gain
\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered
systematic and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, this uncertainty shall
be considered.
#### B.1.1.4.9 Random uncertainty
This contribution is used to account for all the unknown, unquantifiable, etc.
uncertainties associated with the measurements.
Random uncertainty MU contributions are normally distributed. [Note: this is
different from "Miscellaneous uncertainty" or "Residual uncertainty" which can
include unknown systematic errors which may not be normally distributed.]
The random uncertainty term, by definition, cannot be measured, or even
isolated completely. However, past system definitions provide an empirical
basis for a value. Current LTE SISO OTA measurements have random uncertainty
contributions of \~0.2dB. A value of 0.5dB is suggested due to increased
sensitivity to random effects in more complex, higher frequency NR test
systems.
#### B.1.1.4.10 Influence of the XPD
This factor takes into account the uncertainty caused due to the finite cross
polar discrimination (XPD) between the two polarization ports of the
measurement probe. The XPD of the probe antenna shall be take into account
during final MU definition for the test method..
A typical probe antenna can have XPD of 30dB.
For example if a linearly-polarized sine wave is input to the measurement
antenna with a gradient of 45 degrees like the case in the following figure,
then a signal level of V-antenna and H antenna are equal.
When we consider a leakage from V to H, or H to V, they can be described with
the following equations.
{width="4.692361111111111in" height="0.2013888888888889in"} (1)
{width="4.692361111111111in" height="0.2013888888888889in"} (2)
Worst case can be assumed as the case that the phase of signal and leakage are
same, and it can be shown as follows
{width="3.6256944444444446in" height="0.27361111111111114in"} (3)
{width="3.602777777777778in" height="0.30069444444444443in"} (4)
If we put equations (3) in (1) and (4) in (2), we get following 2 equations.
{width="3.542361111111111in" height="0.34375in"} (5)
{width="3.542361111111111in" height="0.3645833333333333in"} (6)
Difference of amplitude between the case that there is a leakage and not can
be calculated as follows.
\- Amplitude when there is not the leakage: {width="0.14930555555555555in"
height="0.18125in"}
\- Amplitude when there is the leakage (Worst): {width="0.975in"
height="0.36319444444444443in"}
{width="4.191666666666666in" height="0.69375in"}
For example, if the XPD = -30dB, the calculated value can be as follows.
{width="3.1326388888888888in" height="0.35625in"}
#### B.1.1.4.11 Reference antenna positioning misalignment
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each other, this contribution
can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
#### B.1.1.4.12 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
This contribution originates from all uncertainties involved transmission
magnitude measurement (including drift and frequency flatness) with a network
analyser. The uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data
sheet. It needs to be ensured that appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty
contribution is specified for the absolute levels measured.
#### B.1.1.4.13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss have
to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer to measure
its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced. This contribution should be set as
zero.
#### B.1.1.4.14 Uncertainty of an absolute gain of the calibration antenna
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain
uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come from a
calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology Institute with
measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the guidelines outlined in
internationally accepted standards.
#### B.1.1.4.15 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
#### B.1.1.4.16 gNB emulator uncertainty
gNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple
external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a circulator, etc.)
in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level.
Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally there
occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity
and frequency characteristic of the gNB emulator.
For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as a calibration
equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration
measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be assumed as
systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer's data
in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed.
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is included in the absolute
level uncertainty.
#### B.1.1.4.17 Phase centre offset of calibration
Gain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre of the
calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up during the
calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the measurement
distance.
The phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper length
of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre of all
frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The associated
uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula [15]:
{width="1.5402777777777779in" height="0.5395833333333333in"}
Where d~m~ is the measurement distance and d~p~ is the maximum positional
uncertainty. For a Horn antenna this is equal to 0.5 the length of the taper.
This uncertainty is considered to have a rectangular distribution so the
standard uncertainty is calculated by dividing the uncertainty by âˆš3.
The same equation applies to log periodic antennas with d~m~ being 0.5 the
length of the boom.
For a dipole antenna, given that the phase centre of the antenna is easily
aligned with the centre of the set up the measurement uncertainty is zero.
If the calibration antenna (i.e. horn) is adjusted during the calibration to
align the phase centre to the setup centre then this uncertainty term can be
considered to be zero.
As an example a horn with a taper length of 50 mm, at 43.5 GHz and a
measurement distance of 72.55 cm the uncertainty term is 0.62, with a
rectangular distribution the standard uncertainty is 0.358 dB.
#### B.1.1.4.18 Quality of quiet zone for calibration process
During the calibration process the calibration antenna will be placed at the
centre of the quiet zone. Therefore, only point P1 from the procedure outlined
in B.1.1.4.3 needs to be considered for the quality of the quiet zone
validation measurement.
For gain calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the EIRP results obtained
following the method outlined in 2.10 shall be used. For efficiency
calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the TRP result obtained following
the method outlined in 2.9 shall be used.

See B.1.1.4.3
#### B.1.3.4.3 Standing wave between DUT and measurement antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between DUT and measurement antenna. This
value can be captured by sliding (lambda/4) the DUT towards the measurement
antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in
measured gain. DUT scattering/interaction can also cause standing wave.

#### B.1.3.4.5 Insertion loss variation of receiver chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement
stage.
#### B.1.3.4.6 RF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)

joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.

## B.1.4 NFTF setup
B.1.4.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute
gain is known at the frequencies of measurement
\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the transmitter or
receiver is performed.
The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:
1) The uncertainty source,
2) Uncertainty value,
3) Distribution of the probability,
4) Divisor based on distribution shape,
5) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and divisor).

The uncertainty assessment table is organized as follows:
\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna aperture
of the DUT is denoted as D, and the uncertainty assessment has been derived
for the case of D = 5 cm

### B.1.4.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions
#### B.1.4.4.1 Axes Alignment
Includes the following mechanical alignment errors:
  * The uncertainty related with the lateral displacement between the > horizontal and vertical axes of the DUT positioner.
  * The differences from 90Â° of the angle between the horizontal and > vertical axes.
  * The horizontal mis-pointing of the horizontal axis to the probe > reference point for Theta=0Â°.
These mechanical errors can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal
sphere. This uncertainty can be considered to have a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.2 Probe XPD
Refer to B.1.1.4.10 [7]. If the Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase is
measured and corrected for then this uncertainty term can be considered to be
zero.
#### B.1.4.4.3 Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase
The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.4 Probe Array Uniformity (for multi -probe systems only)
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different radiation patterns.
Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the uniformity of the probes
is achieved. This uncertainty term must be considered if the amplitude and
phase of each probe is not identical or corrected for. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution
#### B.1.4.4.5 Probe Pattern Effect
The probe/s pattern/s is assumed to be known so that the DUT measurement in
near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. If the probe pattern is known, then the uncertainty term is zero.
There is no direct dependence between the DUT pattern and the probe pattern in
near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal
distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.6 Multiple Reflections: Coupling Measurement Antenna and DUT
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the DUT when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.7 Quality of the Quiet Zone
See B.1.1.4.3
#### B.1.4.4.8 Measurement Distance
See B.1.1.4.2
#### B.1.4.4.9 NF to FF truncation
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the DUT. Care must be taken in order
to make sure the removed signals are not from the DUT itself. This term also
includes the uncertainty related to the scan area truncation. This uncertainty
is usually negligible. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal
distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.10 Mismatch of receiver chain
See B.1.1.4.4
#### B.1.4.4.11 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment
See B.1.1.4.6.
#### B.1.4.4.12 Amplifier uncertainties
See B.1.1.4.8
#### B.1.4.4.13 Phase Recovery Non-Linearity over signal bandwidth
This uncertainty originates from the non-linearity of the phase recovery for
wide band signal. The phase recovery can be due to either phase non-linearity
of the receiver and/or the DUT itself. The method to quantify the non-
linarites is not defined.
#### B.1.4.4.14 Phase Drift and Noise
This uncertainty is due to the noise level and drift of the test range and
should be determined or measured at the DUT location. The noise level is
usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.15 Leakage and Crosstalk
This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system setup.
The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random amplitude and
phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.16 Random uncertainty
See B.1.1.4.9
#### B.1.4.4.17 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
See B.1.1.4.12

# B.2 Measurement uncertainty budget for UE RRM testing methodology
## B.2.1 Direct far field (DFF) setup
B.2.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT. In some
cases, uncertainty may also arise from a calibration or alignment process
before the measurements.
When a calibration process is used before the measurements, the uncertainty
tables should be presented with two stages:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute
gain is known at the frequencies of measurement
\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the transmitter or
receiver is performed.
The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:
> 1) The uncertainty source,
>
> 2) Uncertainty value,
>
> 3) Distribution of the probability,
>
> 4) Divisor based on distribution shape,
>
> 5) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and divisor).
B.2.1.2 Uncertainty budget format
The uncertainty contributions depend on the parameter being controlled and/or
the measurement being made. A separate table is provided for each.

B.2.1.5 Assessment of testable SNR range for D=5cm
The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated by
the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise provided by
the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and potentially
limiting the testable SNR range.
For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set much
higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible. However for
over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically be delivered into
the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test point is likely to be
closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation is allowable.
The Assessment of testable SNR range will follow the same principle as
B.3.1.5, but the values related to the test system may be different and may
provide a different testable SNR range.

B.2.2.5 Assessment of testable SNR range
The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated by
the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise provided by
the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and potentially
limiting the testable SNR range.
For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set much
higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible. However for
over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically be delivered into
the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test point is likely to be
closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation is allowable.
The Assessment of testable SNR range will follow the same principle as
B.3.1.5, but the values related to the test system may be different and may
provide a different testable SNR range.

B.3.1.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions
#### B.3.1.4.1 gNB emulator SNR uncertainty
This contribution originates from setting the ratio of signal and noise in the
conducted part of the test system. It is estimated to be the same as for LTE
conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which is Â±0.3dB. The default for
values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence interval, normal distribution.
#### B.3.1.4.2 gNB emulator Downlink EVM
When simulations of demodulation performance are run, the downlink signal is
modelled with a defined EVM, representing imperfections in the signal
transmitted by the gNB. This EVM value is agreed across companies to align
simulations, and is normally lower than the gNB EVM requirement, to represent
"typical" conditions. The EVM used for simulations is therefore built in to
the requirement points, normally specified as the SNR required to meet a
specified throughput, with a defined modulation and Reference channel, under
defined propagation conditions.
For a conformance test, the EVM defined for the simulations is taken as a
maximum allowed value for the test system, as a worse gNB emulator EVM would
make the signal harder to demodulate, and disadvantage the UE. In a test
system the EVM cannot normally be set to a specific value, but is specified to
be no higher than a defined value.
Following this approach, the uncertainty from gNB emulator Downlink EVM is a
one-sided distribution, with beneficial effect. Without treating the positive
and negative uncertainties separately, and as it would not make the SNR worse,
the effective uncertainty is 0dB.
#### B.3.1.4.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments
This contribution originates from imperfections in the gNB emulator fading
model, compared to the applied fading model. It is estimated to be the same as
for LTE conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which is Â±0.5dB. The default
for values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence interval, normal
distribution.
B.3.1.5 Assessment of testable DL SNR range and accuracy for D=15cm
The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated by
the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise provided by
the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and potentially
limiting the testable SNR range. The calculations and graphs in this subclause
allow this SNR degradation to be assessed over a range of scenarios.
For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set much
higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible. However for
over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically be delivered into
the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test point is likely to be
closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation is allowable.
#### B.3.1.5.1 Method and Parameters
For demodulation test, DL SNR is given as a test parameter to test the
performance capability of demodulation of DUT under such SNR environment. Such
SNR environment is generated by the test system by injecting both desired
signal and artificial AWGN noise. To fulfil the purpose of the test, the
configured SNR should be accurate enough at the UE receiver. If the absolute
power level of the signal and noise from the test system is too low, then the
SNR would be degraded due to the UE's internal noise. The actual SNR at the UE
receiver can be considered as follows:
SNR_actual = S_rx/(N_rx+Nktb*F_UE)
where,
> F_UE : Noise figure (NF) of the UE
>
> Nktb : Thermal noise level
>
> S_rx, N_rx : Received signal power for the desired signal and AWGN
> (artificial noise) respectively, at reference point (UE baseband receiver
> port).
>
> SNR_target = S_rx /N_rx = S_tx/N_tx, which is given parameter for
> demodulation test
>
> S_tx, N_tx : Transmit signal power for the desired signal and AWGN
> (artificial noise), respectively
>
> S_rx = S_tx * PL(d)* G_UE * IL_UE
>
> N_rx = N_tx * PL(d) * G_UE * IL_UE
>
> S_tx = P_tx
>
> N_tx = S_tx / SNR_target
>
> P_tx: Probe TX power
>
> PL(d): The free space pathloss, which depends on the distance d between the
> test antenna and DUT.
>
> G_UE: UE receive antenna array gain
>
> IL_UE: UE receiver implementation loss
>
> Note: In the above, all symbols are represented as linear (non-dB) values.
We note that in calculations for EIS, in addition to the UE receiver antenna
gain and UE receiver noise figure, a term "Total implementation loss" is also
used. The effect of this is to degrade the effective noise figure further.
Noting also that the UE receiver antenna gain, noise figure and implementation
loss depend on frequency, the values in Table B.3.1.5.1-1 have been used for
assessing the testable SNR range:
**Table B.3.1.5.** 1-1: Assumed UE parameters
* * *
                                    24GHz   43GHz
UE Antenna Gain (G_UE) 7 8 dBi UE Noise Figure (F_UE) 10 12 dB UE
Implementation loss (IL_UE) -10 -11 dB Nktb -174 -174 dBm/Hz
* * *
The possible transmitted signal strengths from the test antenna S_tx, N_tx
depend on the capability of test system. The feasible transmit power depends
on the conducted cable losses, the Test system transmit antenna gain and the
final amplifier characteristic, especially the P1dB compression point.
Considering the cable losses, probe antenna gain of 12dB and commercially
available mmWave Amplifiers, and the crest factor of the downlink signal (not
to cause additional EVM error from test system side), the feasible transmit
power from the probe antenna is calculated below.
**Table B.3.1.5.** 1-2: Assumed Test system parameters
* * *
                            24GHz                        43GHz

dB Probe antenna gain 12 12 dB Power from Test antenna **+18** **+15** **dBm**
Transmission bandwidth 100M, 200M, 400M, 800M, 1G Hz
* * *
The third part to consider is the free space path loss between the probe
antenna and the UE antenna, shown below:
**Table B.3.1.5.** 1-3: Free Space path loss
* * *
                      24GHz   43GHz
\@0.5m separation -54.0 -59.1 dB \@0.7m separation -57.0 -62.0 dB \@1.0m
separation -60.1 -65.1 dB
* * *
The radiative near field measurement distance is calculated for a DUT with
radiating aperture D = 15cm, using the formula in clause 7.2.1.2:
**Table B.3.1.5.** 1-4: Radiated near-field distance for D = 0.15m

                                 24GHz    43GHz
Wavelength 0.0125 0.0070 m Radiated near-field distance 0.32 0.43 m
* * *
#### B.3.1.5.2 Example calculation of SNR error
The example calculation of SNR error in Table B.3.1.5.1-1 illustrates the
method for a specific set of parameters. It starts by calculating the wanted
signal S_tx and wanted noise N_tx at the test antenna, and calculates the
wanted spectral densities seen by the UE receiver. It then calculates the
unwanted noise, based on the noise figure of the UE receiver and thermal
noise. The wanted and unwanted noise contributions are combined, to re-
estimate the actual SNR seen by the UE receiver.
The set of parameters chosen here is not a recommendation, they are chosen
only to illustrate the method.

24GHz, 0.7m

B.3.2 Direct far field (DFF) setup
The Measurement uncertainty contributions and uncertainty assessment are
expected to be the same as for the Direct near field (DNF) setup in B.3.1.
The Assessment of testable SNR range will follow the same principle as
B.3.1.5, but the values related to the test system may be different and may
provide a different testable SNR range.

###### ### Annex C: UE coordinate system
# C.1 Reference coordinate system
This annex defines the measurement coordinate system for the NR UE. The
reference coordinate system, reused from the LTE MIMO OTA definition in [5],
is provided in Figure C.1-1 below.
{width="1.7479166666666666in" height="2.4993055555555554in"}
Figure C.1-1: Reference coordinate system
The following aspects are necessary:
\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed in
order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the test
\- An understanding of the origin of the test system (i.e. the direction in
which the x-axis points inside the test chamber) is needed in order to define
unambiguous DUT orientation, DUT beam, signal, interference, and measurement
angles
# C.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
Table C.2-1 below provides the test conditions and angle definitions.
Table C.2-1: Test conditions and angle definitions

For each UE requirement and test case, each of the parameters in Table C.2-1
are defined as single values or ranges of values, such that DUT positioning,
DUT beam direction, and angles of the signal, link/interferer, and measurement
are specified.
Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations, the order of rotations is
important and needs to be defined when multiple DUT orientations are tested.
The rotations around the x, y, and z axes can be defined with the following
rotation matrices
{width="2.19375in" height="1.0in"}
{width="2.2222222222222223in" height="1.0in"}
and
{width="2.125in" height="1.0in"}.
with the respective angles of rotation, _Î±_ , _Î²_ , _Î³_ and
{width="0.8888888888888888in" height="1.0in"}
Additionally, any translation of the DUT can be defined with the translation
matrix
{width="1.875in" height="1.0in"}
with offsets t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively and with
{width="0.875in" height="1.0in"}
The combination of rotations and translation is captured by the multiplication
of rotation and translation matrices.
For instance, the matrix M
describes an initial rotation of the DUT around the z axis with angle _Î³_ , a
subsequent rotation around the y axis with angle _Î²_ , and a final rotation
around the x axis with angle _Î±_. After those rotations, the DUT is translated
by t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively.
# C.3 DUT positioning guidelines
The centre of the reference coordinate system shall be aligned with the
geometric centre of the DUT in order to minimize the offset between antenna
arrays integrated at any position of the UE and the centre of the quiet zone.
Near-field coupling effects between the antenna and the
pedestals/positioners/fixtures generally cause increased signal ripples. Re-
positioning the DUT by directing the beam peak away from those areas can
reduce the effect of signal ripple on EIRP/EIS measurements. Figure C.3-1 and
C.3-2 illustrate how to reposition the DUT in a distributed axes and combined
axes system, when the beam peak is directed to the DUTs upper hemisphere (DUT
orientation 1) or the DUTs lower hemisphere (DUT orientation 2).
{width="4.502083333333333in" height="2.973611111111111in"}
**Figure C.3-1: DUT re-positioning for distributed-axes system**
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="2.5819444444444444in"}
**Figure C.3-2: DUT re-positioning for combined-axes system**
For EIRP/EIS measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure the pedestal is
not obstructing the beam path and that the pedestal is not in closer proximity
to the measurement antenna/reflector than the DUT. For TRP measurements, re-
positioning the DUT makes sure that the beam peak direction is not obstructed
by the pedestal and the pedestal is in the measurement path only when
measuring the back-hemisphere. No re-positioning during the TRP measurement is
required.
###### ### Annex D: Quality of the quiet zone validation
# D.1 General
This annex describes the procedures for validating the quality of the quiet
zone for the baseline measurement system, subclause 5.2.1 and the simplified
baseline setup for centre of beam measurements, subclause 5.2.2.
# D.2 Procedure to characterize the quality of the quiet zone for the baseline
system
This procedure is mandatory before the test system is commissioned for
certification tests and characterizes the quiet zone performance of the
anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections within the anechoic
chamber including any positioners and support structures. Additionally, it
includes the effect of offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT
from the centre of the quiet zone, i.e., the centre of rotation of the DUT and
measurement antenna positioning systems as well as the directivity MU, i.e.,
the variation of antenna gains in the different direct line-of-sight links.
The quiet zone is illustrated in Figure D.2-1 which includes the definitions
of centre of quiet zone range, i.e., the geometric centre of the positioning
systems, and the range length, i.e., the distance between the centre of the
quiet zone and the aperture of the measurement antenna.
{width="4.999305555555556in" height="2.2909722222222224in"}
Figure D.2-1: Quiet Zone Illustration
The outcome of the procedures can be used to predict the
\- variation of the TRP measurements, spherical surface integrals of EIRP/EIS,
when the DUT is placed anywhere within the quiet zone and with the beam formed
in any arbitrary direction inside the chamber
\- variation of the EIRP/EIS measurements when the DUT is placed anywhere
within the quiet zone and with the beam formed in any arbitrary direction
inside the chamber
The reference coordinate system defined in Appendix C applies to this
procedure.
## D.2.1 Equipment used
The reference antenna under test (AUT) that is placed at various locations
within the quiet zone shall be a directive antenna with similar properties of
typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs. The characteristics in terms of
Directivity and Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW) of the reference AUT are shown in
Figure D.2.1-1, D.2.1-2, and D.2.1-3.

{width="6.688194444444444in" height="2.9618055555555554in"}
Figure D.2-3: 2xHPBW-H mask
AUT shall be symmetric on E and H planes.
The above masks for the reference antenna are met based on antenna vendors'
calibration report.
For the measurement, a combination of signal generator and spectrum analyser
or a network analyser can be used. The multi-port (with three ports) network
analyser is most suitable to reduce test time as both polarizations of the
measurement antenna can be measured simultaneously and multiple frequencies
can be measured in a sweep.
## D.2.2 Test frequencies
The frequencies to be used to characterize the quality of the quiet zone shall
be identified during final test method definition in RAN5 WG. The quiet zone
validation analysis is performed for each frequency individually.
## D.2.3 Reference measurements
The quality of the quiet measurements for integrated RF parameters such as TRP
shall use 3D pattern measurements of the reference antenna patterns as they
most closely resemble the 3D/spherical surface measurements/integrals of EIRP
or EIS. Therefore, the quality of the quiet zone measurements for TRP metrics
shall be based on efficiency measurements. On the other hand, the quality of
the quiet zone measurements for single-directional EIRP and EIS metrics shall
be based on gain measurements of the direct line-of-sight link between the
reference AUT and the measurement antenna.
## D.2.4 Size of the quiet zone
The size of the quiet zone within which the variations of measurements are
evaluated depends on the size of the DUT. For smartphones, the quiet zone
shall be considered a sphere with radius of R=7.5cm. Alternate quiet zone
sizes can be defined for larger DUTs.
## D.2.5 Minimum range length
The minimum range length depends on the size of the DUT and the minimum far-
field distance of typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs.
## D.2.6 Reference AUT positions
The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different reference
positions, shown in Figure D.2.6.1-1 and D.2.6.2-1
While position 1, P1, is the centre of the quiet zone, the remaining
positions, 2 through 7, are off-centre positions each displaced by the radius
of the quiet zone, R. The coordinates of the respective test points are shown
in Table D.2.6-1.

## D.2.7 Reference AUT orientations
As different areas within the chamber could yield variations in the field
uniformity inside the quiet zone caused by reflections, it is important to
characterize the electromagnetic fields with the reference antennas uniformly
illuminating the anechoic chamber.
In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization manageable in
terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the reference measurements for
the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna positions with the antenna rotated
around the y axis with 5 different angles _Î²_ , i.e., _Î²_ = 0^o^, 45^o^,
90^o^, 135^o^, and 180^o^, and rotated around the z axis with 8 different _Î³ *
= 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical
illustration of the some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure
D.2.7.1-1 with a reference AUT placed at position 6, P6, for reference antenna
polarization_ Î³ _~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure D.2.7.1-2 illustrates the reference AUT
orientations for the reference polarization_ Î³*~pol~ = 90^o^.
The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as
for the distributed-axes system.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="3.247916666666667in"}
Figure D2.7.1-1: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 6, P6 for
reference antenna polarization Î³~pol~ = 0^o^.

Figure D.2.7.1-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 6, P6, for
reference antenna polarization Î³~pol~ = 90^o^.
When facing the z-axis, _Î³_ = 0^o^ and _Î³_ = 180^o^, the antenna does not need
to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the z axis. A single roll
orientation is sufficient since those orientations are unique. Due to the
pedestal, distributed-axes systems are not able to measure towards the _Î³_
=180^o^ direction; for those systems, the reference measurements at this
reference AUT orientation can be skipped.
If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex C.3 is adopted for the
EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet zone analysis
is sufficient only for *Î³ * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, and 180^o^~.~
### D.2.7.2 Combined-axes system
In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization manageable in
terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the reference measurements for
the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna positions with the antenna rotated
around the x axis with 5 different angles Î±, i.e., Î± = -90^o^, -45^o^, 0^o^,
45^o^, and 90^o^ and rotated around the y axis with 8 different angles _Î²_ =
0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical
illustration of some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure
D.2.7.2-1 with a reference AUT placed at position 4, P4, for reference antenna
polarization _Î³_ ~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure D.2.7.2-2 illustrates the reference AUT
orientations for the reference polarization _Î³_ ~pol~ = 90^o^.
The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as
for the combined-axes system.
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="3.3604166666666666in"}

reference antenna polarization Î³~pol~ = 0^o^.

Figure D.2.7.2-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 4, P4, for
reference antenna polarization Î³~pol~ = 90^o^.
When facing the y axis, _Î±_ = 90^o^ and _Î±_ = -90^o^, the antenna does not
need to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the y axis. A single
rotation is sufficient since those orientations are unique. Due to the
pedestal of the 2-axis positioner, combined-axes systems are not able to
measure towards the _Î²_ = 180^o^ direction; for those systems, the reference
measurements at this reference AUT orientation can be skipped.
If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex C.3 is adopted for all
EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet zone analysis
is sufficient only for *Î² * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, and 180^o^~.~
## D.2.8 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty calculations for TRP
The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for TRP and
offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone is the standard
deviation of the various efficiency measurement results that are based on the
7 different reference AUT positions, the respective reference AUT
orientations, and the two reference AUT polarization orientations..
## D.2.9 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty for EIRP/EIS
The MU for the quality of the quiet zone for EIRP/EIS includes the additional
MU element of the directivity of the DUT and measurement antennas as shown in
Figure D.2.9-1. The EIRP/EIS measurements are taking the peak gains of the
respective antennas into account with the reference AUT placed in the centre
of the quiet zone. Once the antenna is displaced in directions other than the
measurement antenna, the direct line-of-sight link is taking reduced antenna
gains into account. The type of reference AUT should therefore have similar
pattern properties as typical UE antennas. For systems with very large range
lengths, the directivity MU will be insignificant.
The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for EIRP/EIS,
offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone, and directivity is
the standard deviation of the single-point gain measurement results that are
based on the 7 different reference AUT positions, the respective reference AUT
orientations, and the two reference AUT polarization orientations.

###### ### Annex E: Rationale behind IFF method 1
# E.1 IFF method 1 -- working principle
A CATR (Compact Antenna Test Range) is a collimator system in which the
spherical wave is transformed in plane wave within the desired quiet zone
(QZ). In other words, a compact range project the measurement (range) antenna
infinitely far away thus making it a far-field range. Figure E.1-1 does show
this concept:
{width="2.9833333333333334in" height="2.9972222222222222in"}{width="3.2375in"
height="2.498611111111111in"}
Figure E.1-1: Compact Range -- working principle
This is a reciprocal system setup. For TX measurements, the device under test
will radiate a spherical wavefront to the range collimator which focalises
into the feed antenna only the propagation vector which matches with the
boresight direction of the reflector. On the other hand, for RX measurements,
the feed antenna would radiate a spherical wavefront to the range reflector
which is collimated towards the DUT. In other words, the spherical wavefront
is transformed into a plane wavefront when at the DUT.
In order to meet the requirements, the following parameters are mainly
considered when designing a CATR:
\- Quiet Zone
\- Focal length
\- Offset angle
\- Feed location
Figure E.1-2 does introduce the concept of quiet zone (QZ). Basically, the
plane wavefront (uniform amplitude and phase) is guaranteed in a certain
cylinder volume:
{width="3.3354166666666667in" height="3.0006944444444446in"}
Figure E.1-2: CATR -- Quiet Zone concept
Quiet Zone size would depend on mainly the reflector, feed taper, anechoic
chamber design. In figure E.1-3 is shown the phase distribution in the QZ for
a state of the art CATR designed for 3m QZ size at 18GHz:
{width="5.2375in" height="3.0027777777777778in"}
Figure E.1-3 Phase curvature within the CATR QZ
It has to be noted that the total phase variation in the QZ for a CATR is much
lower than the phase variation (22.5deg) for a typical direct FF range.
# E.2 IFF method 1 - a far field system
In this subclause the CATR key points are reported.
## E.2.1 Quiet zone
Quiet zone quality can be impacted by amplitude uniformity, phase planarity
and polarization purity.
Amplitude uniformity is mainly due to feed pattern, alignment and reflector
design while phase planarity is due to feed alignment and reflector design.
The polarization purity is mainly due to the parabolic system geometry
considering high polarization purity feeds.
The test procedure defined in TR 38.810 Annex D.2 for determining the MU
contribution from the quiet zone quality applies equally well to both direct
far-field and CATR systems.
Plots in Figure E.2.1-1 and E.2.1-2 show the amplitude and phase taper plots
of the in the quiet zone of a CATR system.
{width="3.1368055555555556in" height="2.4506944444444443in"}
Figure E.2.1-1: Amplitude variation across the quiet zone of 15cm
{width="3.129861111111111in" height="2.5125in"}
Figure E.2.1-2: Phase variation across the quiet zone of 15cm
The measurements of quiet zone in the planes shown in Figure E.2.1-1 and
Figure E.2.1-2 that
\- The overall amplitude variation within the quiet zone is less than 1.2 dB
\- The overall phase variation within the quiet zone is less than 10Ëš
## E.2.2 Implementation Requirements
When it comes of CATR implementations, the reflector design is one of the key
point to be considered. Another important piece is the feed antenna location
in the system setup. Different implementations may exist based on the test
system frequency range and quite zone requirements.
### E.2.2.1 Reflector(s) Type
The reflector design does play an important role when designing a CATR.
A Compact Range is a geometrical optical design, for which the reflector(s) is
large in wavelength. Edges diffraction (edges are like cylindrical sources)
needs to be minimized using edge treatment. Common edge treatments are:
\- Serrated edge -- figure E.2.2.1-1 (right)
\- Rolled edge -- figure E.2.2.1-1 (left)
\
Figure E.2.2.1-1: Reflector Types -- Rolled edge (left), Serrated Edge (right)
The lower frequency limit of a compact range depends on the edge treatment.
The Quality of the Quiet Zone is characterized for CATR ranges and always
includes the reflections off the edges of the reflector. The example
specifications for a CATR system can be seen in Table E.2.2.1-1. These
specifications should show that the impact of these reflections is minor. In
order to meet such specifications, the reflector must be designed in a way to
reduce the reflection off the edges (the edges are either curved or have
serrated edges).
Table E.2.2.1-1: Example of CATR system specifications
* * *
Frequency Range (GHz) 1.5 -- 100 Quiet Zone Dimensions [H x W x L] (m) 0.5 x
0.5 x 0.5 Cross Polarization (dB) -30
* * *
#### E.2.2.1.1 Serrated Edge
The direction of the edge is designed such that minimum diffraction enters the
quiet zone sources. With serrations, there is a smooth transition between
parabolic surface of the reflector and free space, thus reducing the
diffraction effects and directing the diffracted field away from the QZ. The
length of serrations defines the lowest frequency of operation. Typical
serrations length is 5Î».
#### E.2.2.1.2 Rolled edge
The edges of the compact range reflector are no longer cut off abruptly but
are smoothly bent backwards thus reducing the energy at the edges of the
reflector. With well-designed rolled edge, diffraction reduces compared to
serrated edge at the low and middle end of the frequency spectrum.
### E.2.2.2 Feed Antenna location
The following are the feed locations most commonly used when designing a CATR:
\- Side-fed
\- Floor-fed
\- Diagonal-fed
For a side-fed system, the feed is placed on one side of the chamber at the
same height as the centre of the quiet zone so that the ray from the feed to
the reflector to the centre of the quiet zone spans a horizontal plane. For a
floor-fed system, the feed in placed on the floor between the reflector and
the quiet zone so that the ray from the feed to reflector to the centre of the
quite zone spans a vertical plane. In case of diagonal-fed (corner-fed)
system, the feed is in a corner between side wall and floor so that the ray
from the feed to the reflector to the centre of the quiet zone spans a
diagonal plane. Typically the diagonal fed-system allows for size reduction of
the anechoic chamber of approximately âˆš2.
# E.3 IFF method 1 -- reciprocity
CATR systems are inherently reciprocal, i.e. they support device
characterization in both transmit and receive modes and it has been already
used as such within 3GPP: TR 37.842 for testing active antenna systems
describes base station conformance testing for radiated transmit power (EIRP)
in subclause 10.3.1 as well as for OTA sensitivity (EIS) in subclause 10.3.2.
The theoretical analysis behind this statement can be as follows:
C.A. Balanis (in his book "Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design," Ch. 3, pp.
127-132) provides a thorough discussion of reciprocity and its consequences
for radiation patterns: In brief, it shows that, due to reciprocity, the
antenna patterns measured by a receiving probe antenna with the DUT
transmitting will be identical to those measured by the DUT in receive mode
when the probe antenna is transmitting. It is further explained that
reciprocity holds whenever certain conditions are met, e.g. the device
materials and propagation medium are linear.
These are the conditions met in a CATR:
As the nominally spherical wave from the feed antenna propagates toward the
mirror, it's power density per area, , falls off with the square of the
distance from the feed antenna so that at the mirror,
, (1)
where is the power transmitted from the feed antenna, is the gain of the feed
antenna, and is approximately the focal length of the mirror. The precise
distance from the feed antenna to the centre of the mirror is typically
slightly longer than the focal length due to the off-axis illumination and
parabolic curvature of the mirror.
does not change as the beam propagates to the DUT since the beam is
collimated. For a DUT in the quiet zone, the power received by the DUT is the
product of and the DUT's effective aperture, . This effective aperture depends
on the orientation of the DUT relative to the beam, indicated by the DUT's
elevation angle, , and its azimuth angle, . The DUT's gain, is related to this
aperture according to the formula
(2)
Thus, the ratio of received power to transmitted power, is
(3)
From this derivation, it is clear that the path-loss for a CATR does not
depend on the total distance between the feed antenna and the DUT but on the
focal length of the mirror instead.
Less intuitive is the derivation of the path loss when the DUT is in transmit
mode. In that case, the DUT's radiation pattern can be treated as a
superposition of plane waves propagating in different directions. This
superposition concept is valid whether the mirror is in the near or far-field
of the DUT. As shown in Figure E.3.1-1, the mirror captures plane waves
propagating in a range of directions, but the different directions are focused
to different points by the mirror. Only those plane waves propagating along
the optical axis of the mirror (indicated in pink) are focused into the feed
antenna for measurement; in this mode, the feed antenna is receiving the
signal from the DUT. Plane waves at larger angles not captured by the mirror
are instead absorbed by the anechoic chamber. The particular angle measured by
the feed antenna can be varied by rotating the DUT. For example, a rotation of
the DUT in this figure could align the blue plane wave with the optical axis
allowing measurement of the transmitted power in that direction.

Figure E.3-1: CATR when DUT is in transmit mode
The feed antenna can only capture radiation from the relatively small range of
angles that converge to a point within its aperture. The maximum angular
deviation from the optical axis that can be accepted by the feed antenna is
given by
{width="1.3583333333333334in" height="0.31666666666666665in"} (4)
where is the radius of the aperture, is the focal length of the mirror, and
the small angle approximation - a very good approximation for typical CATR
geometries - has been invoked for simplicity.
The radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle), , emitted by the DUT is
the total power emitted divided by radians and multiplied by the gain of the
DUT;
(5)
The total power accepted by feed antenna is the integral of over the range of
angles that converge within its aperture. Using the small angle approximation,
the integral gives
(6)
Substituting for using (4), and with the aperture of the feed antenna as , the
ratio of power received by the feed antenna to power transmitted by the DUT is
(7)
Equation (7) shows that the transmission losses from the DUT to the feed are
identical to the transmission losses from the feed to the DUT, given by Eq.
(3), thus proving reciprocity.
This reciprocity result, which holds true regardless of DUT orientation,
assures identical antenna pattern measurements for DUTs in both transmit and
receive modes. Beyond pattern measurements, this result also has implications
for other device tests. EIRP and EIS tests are both possible in a CATR system
as the same path losses are present in both directions. Likewise, EVM in
transmit and receive are supported since both will experience the same
predicted path losses given in Eqs. (7) and (3).
Reporting measurement results in order to further detail the reciprocity of a
CATR by showing the comparison between the s12, and s21 coefficients of the
scattering matrix have been obtained as follows:
\- Measurement results are from a commercial CATR at mmWave. This range is
capable of measuring DUTs within 24GHz to 40GHz frequency range. The CATR is
designed for a 1.5m QZ and the results are from a QZ ripple test (field
distribution) activity done on the setup. In figure E.3-2 the QZ ripple test
setup is shown:
{width="4.886111111111111in" height="3.2194444444444446in"}
Figure E.3-2: CATR- QZ ripple test (field distribution) set up
\- A Standard Gain Horn (SGH) is used as reference antenna. Since it is a
field distribution measurement where the ability of the CATR to emulate a
plane wave in the QZ is tested, for all the measurements the SGH aperture was
pointing the CATR's reflector. The reference antenna has been swept on the X
and Y-axis when at different Z positions. Especially, Vertical cut means that
the scan is done long the Y-axis while Horizontal Cut means that the scan is
long the X-axis. In both cases, Vertical and Horizontal components of the
field are measured in amplitude, and phase (complex quantity). The aim is to
define the amplitude and phase taper in the QZ. For our measurements, s21 and
s12 coefficients have been measured and compared for each Y axis positions
(Vertical Cut) when the SGH is at Z=0, centre of the QZ.
\- Comparison between s21 and s12 complex coefficients (amplitude and phase)
is reported for 26.5GHz and Vertical Cut. Figure E.3.1-3 and E.3.1-4 show the
reciprocity in terms of amplitude and phase

# E.4 IFF method 1 -- DUT offset from the QZ centre
The uncertainty due to the DUT offset from the QZ centre can vary based on the
knowledge of antenna array position embedded in the DUT. In this subclause, an
analysis of the impact of this uncertainty for CATR is provided when measuring
single points quantities such as both EIRP (TX measurements) and EIS (RX
measurements).
In figure E.4-1, and E.4-2 the test scenarios A1 and A2 are reported for RX
tests and TX tests respectively:
{width="6.846527777777778in" height="2.092361111111111in"}
Figure E.4-1: CATR -- RX tests scenarios A1 and A2
The QZ is within the collimated beam. There are no free space losses between
the reflector and DUT. The only path loss is between the feed and the
reflector so since this distance is fixed, this path loss can be easily
calibrated. The final spatial attenuation is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2, where
F~L,eff~=effective focal length =(2*F~L~)/(1+cos(offset)). It means that the
distance from the QZ to the reflector is longer than the F~L~=focal length. In
a state of the art CATR, the offset is typically set to 27deg by design, so
that the F~L,eff~=1.058*F~L~.
As a consequence of this, if DUT is moved within the QZ, there is no change in
the path loss so the power received in A1 is equal to power received in A2.
The associated uncertainty is then 0dB.
However, due to diffraction from the reflector, the field distribution in the
Quiet Zone is not perfectly uniform. Therefore, there will be some variation
for the amplitude and phase of the received field. Typical amplitude
variations are less than 1 dB within the Quiet Zone and can be estimated by
the QZ characterization process.

Figure E.4-2: CATR -- TX tests scenarios A1 and A2
The following assumptions can be considered:
\- Reciprocity
\- For a CATR the reciprocity is valid
\- Path loss calculation is identical to the RX case
\- DUT will have a radiation pattern which can be described as a series of
plane wave propagating in different directions. The particular plane wave
propagating along the reflector centreline will be focused on the reflector
feed. Figure E.4-3 does show this:
{width="5.896527777777778in" height="3.104861111111111in"}
Figure E.4-3: CATR -- Radiation Pattern measurement when TX by DUT
\- By rotating the DUT in the QZ, the reflector moves a particular point of
the FF pattern along the CATR feed
\- No matter what the distances from the reflector are, the power received
from the feed is the same.
\- The final spatial attenuation at the feed is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2, where
F~L,eff~=effective focal length.
Based on the above assumptions the associated uncertainty is 0dB.
To better understand the above, mainly for the TX case -- DUT transmitting, in
Figure E.4-4 the CATR power transfer function is given:
{width="5.198611111111111in" height="2.3020833333333335in"}
Figure E.4-4: CATR -- Power Transfer Function
Blue and Red lines are representing the DUT receiving and transmitting
respectively. It is assumed that all sources are isotropic point sources. This
assumption can be generalized to real sources since any real source can be
expanded in a number of isotropic sources.
When transmitting from the QZ (TX case -- DUT transmitting) the spherical
wavefront is imaged by the lens/reflector in the focal point with the general
magnification factor so that the below equations are valid:
\- Loss up to the reflector -> 1/R\^2
\- Gain up to the reflector -> (R/F~L,eff~)\^2 -> magnification factor
(R/F~L,eff~) where F~L,eff~=effective focal length
\- Total gain -> 1/R\^2*(R/F~L,eff~)\^2=1/F~L,eff~\^2
When transmitting from the focal point -- Fp (RX case -- DUT receiving) the
spherical wavefront from the feed is become a "perfect" plane wave after the
lens/reflector. The final attenuation is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2.
It was shown that in both cases the attenuation in the system is proportional
to the free space path loss provided by the distance from the feed and
lens/reflector. The attenuation is independent from the distance to the QZ.

# E.6 IFF method 1 -- positioning system
CATR is provided with a positioning system such that the angle between the
dual-polarized measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of
freedom and maintains a polarization reference. In the CATR case, positioner
is placed at the quiet zone area where the DUT is.
# E.7 IFF method 1 -- link antennas
CATR for NR RF FR2 requirements includes a NR link antenna to allow off centre
beam measurements. Together with the UE beam lock test function, this link
antenna allows to measure the whole radiation pattern.
The way it is used is described below:
\- Before performing the UE beam lock test function, the measurement probe
acts as a link antenna maintaining polarization reference with respect to the
DUT. Once the beam is locked then the link is to be passed to the link antenna
which maintains reliable signal level with respect to the DUT. Then UE can be
rotated to measure the whole radiation pattern without losing the connection
with the system simulator.
Hence, thanks to the link antennas and the UE Beam lock test function, CATR is
capable of centre and off centre of beam measurements.
Additionally, for setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in
non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is used
to provide the LTE link to the DUT
\- The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE signal without precise path loss
or polarization control
CATR is provided with such LTE link antenna.
###### ### Annex F: Rationale behind NFTF method
# F.1 NFTF method -- working principle
A NFTF (Near Field to Far Field Transform) system measures the amplitude and
phase on a surface (spherical in this case) around he DUT. The 3D far field
pattern is obtained by using a modal spherical wave expansion. The Near Field
to Far Field Transform is based on the Huygen's principle. A direct solution
of the Helmholtz equations is found by applying boundary conditions on the
surface at an infinite distance away from the DUT. From the tangential fields
over the surface, the modal coefficients can be determined using the
orthogonality of the modal expansion.
The Near to Far field transform is performed in two steps:
  * Expansion (or projection) of the measured Near Field over a set of orthogonal basis functions to evaluate the transformed spectrum
> _E~meas~(r) = Spectrum * F~basis~(r)_
  * FF (EFF) computation using a the previously calculated spectrum and with the basis functions evaluated at rïƒ âˆž :
> _E~FF~ = Spectrum * F~basis~(rïƒ âˆž)_
The Nyquist sampling criterion must be met to obtain enough measurement points
for the near field to far field transform to be valid. The equations for the
sampling criterion are below:
{width="1.0in" height="0.5465277777777777in"}
Figure F.1-1: Sampling Criterion
The method outlined above is normally performed on antennas which are fed from
a signal source but can also apply to DUTs which are transmitting by using the
phase recovery technique.
# F.2 NFTF -- Spherical Scan
A circular probe array as shown in Figure F.3-1 can measure the full 3D
pattern with a rotation in azimuth only. Through use of electronic switching
between the probe array elements the points in elevation can be measured
without rotating the DUT in the elevation plane.
# F.3 NFTF -- Implementation for Self-Transmitting DUTs
## F.3.1 Phase Recovery Technique
{width="6.397222222222222in" height="3.623611111111111in"}
Figure F.3-1: Typical Test System using Phase Recovery Technique
Figure F.3-1 shows the block diagram of a Near Field Range with the Phase
Recovery Unit.
The technique is based on the synchronous reception of two signals, the
measurement and reference. The signal transmitted by the DUT is measured
simultaneously with two probes, one being the measurement probe and the other
being the reference probe. These two signals are fed into the PRU (Phase
Recovery Unit) and the amplitude and absolute phase are acquired.
## F.3.2 Obtaining EIRP and TRP
During the near field to far field transformation process, the calibration is
applied so that the transmitted power (EIRP) is transformed from dB to dBm.
Because the full 3D pattern is measured the TRP can be calculated using the
EIRP results. The EIRP results at beam peak can be also easily obtained.
# F.4 NFTF -- Measurement Uncertainty due to Phase Variation
{width="3.3645833333333335in" height="2.0in"} During the near field to far
field transform the DUT's offset from the reference coordinate system is
corrected for. This is can be achieved because the absolute phase is measured.
Figure F.4-1: Spherical Wave Coefficients (SWC) graphical representation
Figure 4.1 shows the Spherical Wave Coefficients of a horn measured at three
different distances away from the center of the reference coordinate system.
As can be seen in the figures:
  * The DUT far field pattern remains the same
  * The DUT far field phase changes with a vector component defined by the displacement of the reference coordinate system
  * The number of spherical wave that are needed to fully represent the antenna increases as the DUT moves further away from the center of the reference coordinate system.
  * As the minimum sphere increases ïƒ³ the number of field samples increases.
If the criteria above are respected during the near field acquisition, there
is no uncertainty due to the DUT offset from the reference coordinate system
(center of the QZ).
