measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.141-1 [5] and TS
38.141-2 [6] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum
requirements in this specification to create test requirements. For some
requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to
zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITUâ€‘R M.1545 [7].
## 4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
### 4.3.1 _BS type 1-C_
For _BS type 1-C_ , the requirements are applied at the BS _antenna connector_
(port A) for a single transmitter or receiver with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as an amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end _antenna connector_ (port
B).

Figure 4.3.1-2: _BS type 1-C_ receiver interface
### 4.3.2 _BS type 1-H_
For _BS type 1-H_ , the requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.
Figure 4.3.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for _BS type 1-H_
Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the _operating
band_ specific radiated interface is referred to as the _Radiated Interface
Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA
requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements
apply are detailed for each requirement.
Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of _TAB
connectors_ at the _transceiver array boundary_ , which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.
The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality
generating modulated transmit signal structures and performing receiver
combining and demodulation.
The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver units.
Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver units.
The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.
The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the RF
power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array, and/or
distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to the
transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.
How a conducted requirement is applied to the _transceiver array boundary_ is
detailed in the respective requirement clause.
### 4.3.3 _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_
For _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_ , the radiated characteristics are defined
over the air (OTA), where the _operating band_ specific radiated interface is
referred to as the _Radiated Interface Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated requirements
are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in
which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.
Figure 4.3.3-1: Radiated reference points for _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_
Co-location requirements are specified at the conducted interface of the _co-
location reference antenna_ , the c _o-location reference antenna_ does not
form part of the BS under test but is a means to provide OTA power levels
which are representative of a co-located system, further defined in clause
4.9.
For a _BS type 1-O_ the transceiver unit array must contain at least 8
transmitter units and at least 8 receiver units. Transmitter units and
receiver units may be combined into transceiver units. The
transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.
## 4.4 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated. The associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the
same for BS with and without connectors.
For BS _type 1-O_ and 2-O, BS classes are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 5 m.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to
2 m.
For _BS type 1-C_ and 1-H, BS classes are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
## 4.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by local and
regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions.

## 4.6 Applicability of requirements
In table 4.6-1, the requirement applicability for each _requirement set_ is
defined. For each requirement, the applicable requirement clause in the

## 4.7 Requirements for contiguous and _non-contiguous spectrum_
A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or non-
contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both _contiguous spectrum_ operation
and non-_contiguous spectrum_ operation.
For BS operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , some requirements apply both
at the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ edges and inside the _sub-block gaps_. For
each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth_ edges and the _sub-block_ edges respectively.
## 4.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For _multi-band connector_ or _multi-band_ _RIB_ , the RF requirements in
clause 6, 7, 9 and 10 apply separately to each supported _operating band_
unless otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that
specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band
connector(s)_ , and _multi-band RIB(s)_ as detailed in the requirement clause.
For _BS_ capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more _antenna_
_connectors_ for _BS type 1-C_ or _TAB connectors_ for _BS type 1-H_ in
different ways are possible. For _multi-band connector(s)_ the exclusions or
provisions for multi-band apply. For _single-band connector(s)_ , the
following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, _operating band_ unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this _connector_ that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to this _connector_ configured for single-band operation and no
exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-band
requirements are tested separately at the _connector_ configured for single-
band operation, with all other _antenna connectors_ terminated.
A _BS type 1-H_ may be capable of supporting operation in multiple _operating
bands_ with one of the following implementations of _TAB connectors_ in the
_transceiver array boundary_ :
\- All _TAB connectors_ are _single-band connectors_.
\- Different sets of _single-band connectors_ support different _operating
bands_ , but each _TAB connector_ supports only operation in one single
_operating band_.
\- Sets of _single-band connectors_ support operation in multiple _operating
bands_ with some _single-band connectors_ supporting more than one _operating
band_.
\- All _TAB connectors_ are multi-band _connectors_.
\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of _TAB connectors_
provides support of the type _BS type 1-H_ capability of operation in multiple
_operating bands_.
Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an _operating band_
apply only to the set of _TAB connectors_ supporting that _operating band_.
In the case of an _operating band_ being supported only by _single-band
connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min
cell group_ , _single-band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB
connectors_.
In the case of an _operating band_ being supported only by _multi-band
connector_ s supporting the same _operating band_ combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ , _multi-
band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB connectors_.
The case of an _operating band_ being supported by both _multi-band
connectors_ and _single-band connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell
group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ and is not covered by the
present release of this specification.
The case of an _operating band_ being supported by _multi-band connectors_
which are not all supporting the same _operating band_ combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not
covered by the present release of this specification.
_BS type 1-O_ may be capable of supporting operation in multiple _operating
bands_ with one of the following implementations at the _radiated interface
boundary_ :
\- All RIBs are _single-band RIBs_.
\- All RIBs are _multi-band_ _RIBs_.
\- A combination of single-band _RIBs_ and _multi-band RIBs_ provides support
of the _BS type 1-O_ capability of operation in multiple _operating bands_.
For _multi-band connectors_ and _multi-band RIBs_ supporting the bands for
TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous
uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements for _multi-band connectors_ and _multi-band RIBs_
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release
of this specification.
## 4.9 OTA co-location with other base stations
Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming the _BS
type 1-O_ is co-located with another BS of the same base station class, they
ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal degradation to
each other.
Unwanted emission and out of band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are mandatory
requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as it represents
the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.
NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level co-location is the most suitable method to show
conformance.
The _co-location reference antenna_ shall be a single column passive antenna
which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency range,
polarization, as the composite antenna of the _BS type 1-O_ and nominal 65Â°
horizontal half-power _beamwidth_ (suitable for 3-sector deployment) and is
placed at a distance _d_ from the edge of the _BS type 1-O_ , as shown in
figure 4.9-1.
{width="6.677083333333333in" height="4.041666666666667in"}
Figure 4.9-1: Illustration of _BS type 1-O_ enclosure and _co-location
reference antenna_
Edge-to-edge separation _d_ between the _BS type 1-O_ and the _co-location
reference antenna_ shall be set to 0.1 m.
The _BS type 1-O_ and the _co-location reference antenna_ shall be aligned in
a common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction, as shown
in figure 4.9-1.
The _co-location reference antenna_ and the _BS type 1-O_ can have different
width.
The vertical radiating regions of the _co-location reference antenna_ and the
_BS type 1-O_ composite antenna shall be aligned.
For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at the
_co-location reference antenna_ is different from the _BS type 1-O_ , a _co-
location reference antenna_ suitable for the frequency stated in the
requirement is assumed.
OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted interface
of a _co-location reference antenna_ , depending on the requirement this
interface is either an input or an output. For _BS type 1-O_ with dual
polarization _the co-location reference antenna_ has two conducted interfaces
each representing one polarization.
# 5 _Operating bands_ and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the _operating
bands_ and _BS channel bandwidths_ defined in the present release of
specifications.
NOTE: Other _operating bands_ and _BS channel bandwidth_ s may be considered
in future releases.
Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in which
NR can operate according to the present version of the specification are
identified as described in table 5.1-1.
Table 5.1-1: Definition of frequency ranges
Frequency range designation Corresponding frequency range

FR1 410 MHz -- 7125 MHz FR2 24250 MHz -- 52600 MHz
## 5.2 _Operating bands_
NR is designed to operate in the _operating bands_ defined in table 5.2-1 and

## 5.3 _BS channel bandwidth_
### 5.3.1 General
The _BS channel bandwidth_ supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or
downlink at the Base Station. Different _UE channel bandwidths_ may be
supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from UEs
connected to the BS. The placement of the _UE channel bandwidth_ is flexible
but can only be completely within the _BS channel bandwidth_. The BS shall be
able to transmit to and/or receive from one or more UE bandwidth parts that
are smaller than or equal to the number of carrier resource blocks on the RF
carrier, in any part of the carrier resource blocks.
The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guardband and the
_transmission bandwidth configuration_ is shown in figure 5.3.1-1.
.
Figure 5.3.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and _transmission bandwidth
configuration_ for one NR channel
### 5.3.2 _Transmission bandwidth configuration_
The _transmission bandwidth configuration_ N~RB~ for each _BS channel
bandwidth_ and subcarrier spacing is specified in table 5.3.2.-1 for FR1 and
table 5.3.2-2 for FR2.

NOTE: All Tx and Rx requirements are defined based on _transmission bandwidth
configuration_ specified in table 5.3.2-1 for FR1 and table 5.3.2-2 for FR2.
### 5.3.3 Minimum guardband and _transmission bandwidth configuration_
The minimum guardband for each _BS channel bandwidth_ and SCS is specified in
table 5.3.3-1 for FR1 and in table 5.3.3-2 for FR2.

The minimum guardband of SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block for each _BS channel
bandwidth_ is specified in table 5.3.3-3 for FR2.
Table: 5.3.3-3: Minimum guardband (kHz) of SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block (FR2)
* * *
SCS (kHz) 100 MHz 200 MHz 400 MHz 240 3800 7720 15560
* * *
NOTE: The minimum guardband in Table 5.3.3-3 is applicable only when the SCS
240 kHz SS/PBCH block is placed adjacent to the edge of the _BS channel
bandwidth_ within which the SS/PBCH block is located.
The number of RBs configured in any _BS channel bandwidth_ shall ensure that
the minimum guardband specified in this clause is met.

Figure 5.3.3-1: BS PRB utilization
In the case that multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol, the
minimum guardband on each side of the carrier is the guardband applied at the
configured _BS channel bandwidth_ for the numerology that is
transmitted/received immediately adjacent to the guard band.
For FR1, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and the
_BS channel bandwidth_ is >50 MHz, the guardband applied adjacent to 15 kHz
SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 30 kHz SCS for the same _BS
channel bandwidth_.
For FR2, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and the
_BS channel bandwidth_ is >200 MHz, the guardband applied adjacent to 60 kHz
SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 120 kHz SCS for the same
_BS channel bandwidth_.

Figure 5.3.3-2: Guard band definition when transmitting multiple numerologies
NOTE: Figure 5.3.3-2 is not intended to imply the size of any guard between
the two numerologies. Inter-numerology guard band within the carrier is
implementation dependent.

### 5.3.4 RB alignment
For each _BS channel bandwidth_ and each numerology, _BS transmission
bandwidth configuration_ must fulfil the minimum guardband requirement
specified in clause 5.3.3.
For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in clause
4.4.4.3 in [9], and the starting point of its _transmission bandwidth
configuration_ on the common resource block grid for a given channel bandwidth
is indicated by an offset to "Reference point A" in the unit of the
numerology.
For each numerology, all _UE transmission bandwidth configurations_ indicated
to UEs served by the BS by higher layer parameter _carrierBandwidth_ defined
in TS 38.331 [11] shall fall within the _BS transmission bandwidth
configuration_.
5.3.5 BS channel bandwidth per operating band
The requirements in this specification apply to the combination of _BS channel
bandwidths_ , SCS and _operating bands_ shown in table 5.3.5-1 for FR1 and in
table 5.3.5-2 for FR2. The _transmission bandwidth configuration_ in table
5.3.2-1 and table 5.3.2-2 shall be supported for each of the _BS channel
bandwidths_ within the BS capability. The _BS channel bandwidths_ are
specified for both the Tx and Rx path.

### 5.3A.1 _Transmission bandwidth configuration_ for CA
For _carrier aggregation_ , the _transmission bandwidth configuration_ is
defined per component carrier and the requirement is specified in clause
5.3.2.
### 5.3A.2 Minimum guardband and _transmission bandwidth configuration_ for CA
For intra-band contiguous _carrier aggregation_ , _Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth_ and _Guard Bands_ are defined as follows, see Figure 5.3A.2-1.
Figure 5.3A.2-1: Definition of _Aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth_ for intra-
band _carrier aggregation_
The _aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth_ , **BW~Channel_CA,~** is defined as
BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge,high~ - F~edge,low~ (MHz)
The lower bandwidth edge F~edge,\ low~ and the upper bandwidth edge
F~edge,high~ of the aggregated _BS channel bandwidth_ are used as frequency
reference points for transmitter and receiver requirements and are defined by
F~edge,low~ = F~C,low~ - F~offset,low~
F~edge,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,high~
The lower and upper frequency offsets depend on the _transmission bandwidth
configuration_ s of the lowest and highest assigned edge component carrier and
are defined as
F~offset,low~ = (N~RB,low~*12 + 1)*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB,low~ (MHz)
F~offset,high~ = (N~RB,high~*12 - 1)*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB,high~ (MHz)
N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the _transmission bandwidth configuration_ s
according to Table 5.3.2-1 or Table 5.3.2-2 for the lowest and highest
assigned component carrier, SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing
for the lowest and highest assigned component carrier respectively. SCS~low~,
SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ use the largest Î¼
value among the subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the operating
band for both of the channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and
BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ are the minimum guard band for lowest and highest
assigned component carrier according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said _Î¼_ value.
In case there is no common Î¼ value for both of the channel bandwidths, _Î¼_ =1
is used for SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and
BW~GB,high~.
For intra-band non-contiguous _carrier aggregation_ _sub-block bandwidth_ and
_sub-block edges_ are defined as follows, see figure 5.3A.2-2.
Figure 5.3A.2-2: Definition of _sub-block bandwidth_ for intra-band _non-
contiguous spectrum_
The _lower sub-block edge_ of the _sub-block bandwidth_ (BW~Channel,block~) is
defined as follows:
F~edge,block,\ low~ = F~C,block,low~ - F~offset,low~
The _upper sub-block edge_ of the _sub-block bandwidth_ is defined as follows:
F~edge,block,high~ = F~C,block,high~ + F~offset,high~
The _sub-block bandwidth_ , BW~Channel,block~, is defined as follows:
BW~Channel,block~ = F~edge,block,high\ -~ F~edge,block,low~ (MHz)
The lower and upper frequency offsets F~offset,block,low~ and
F~offset,block,high~ depend on the _transmission bandwidth configuration_ s of
the lowest and highest assigned edge component carriers within a _sub-block_
and are defined as
F~offset,block,low~ = (N~RB,low~*12 + 1)*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB,low~ (MHz)
F~offset,block,high~ = (N~RB,high~*12 - 1)*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB,high~ (MHz)
where N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth configurations
according to Table 5.3.2-1 or Table 5.3.2-2 for the lowest and highest
assigned component carrier within a _sub-block_ , respectively. SCS~low~ and
SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing for the lowest and highest assigned
component carrier within a _sub-block_ , respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~,
N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ use the largest Î¼ value
among the subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the operating band
for both of the channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,low~
and BW~GB,high~ are the minimum guard band for lowest and highest assigned
component carrier according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said _Î¼_ value. In case
there is no common Î¼ value for both of the channel bandwidths, _Î¼_ =1 is used
for SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~.
The _sub-block gap size_ between two consecutive _sub-blocks_ W~gap~ is
defined as follows:
W~gap~ = F~edge,block\ n+1,low~ - F~edge,block\ n,high~ (MHz)
## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the _BS channel bandwidths_. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined as following:
\- For NR FR1 _operating bands_ with 100 kHz channel raster,
â–ª Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
\- For NR FR1 _operating bands_ with 15 kHz channel raster,
â–ª Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-5 kHz, 0
kHz, 5 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz
â–ª Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-10 kHz, 0
kHz, 10 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz
\- For NR FR2 _operating bands_ with 60 kHz channel raster,
â–ª Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-20 kHz, 0
kHz, 20 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 60 kHz
â–ª Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-40 kHz, 0
kHz, 40 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 120 kHz
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the _BS channel bandwidths_ of the
two respective NR carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted depending on
the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular deployment
scenario.
#### 5.4.1.2 Channel spacing for CA
For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers, the channel spacing between
adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of least common multiple of
channel raster and sub-carrier spacing.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated NR carriers is
defined as follows:
For NR _operating bands_ with 100 kHz channel raster:
$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} =
\left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)}
- GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.6} \right\rfloor 0.3\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz})$
For NR _operating bands_ with 15 kHz channel raster:
$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} =
\left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)}
- GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.015 _2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor 0.015_
2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz})$
with
$\ n = \mu_{0}$
For NR _operating bands_ with 60kHz channel raster:
$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} =
\left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)}
- GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.06 _2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor 0.06_
2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz})$
with
$\ n = \mu_{0} - 2$
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the _BS channel bandwidths_ of the
two respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.2-1 and 5.3.2-2
with values in MHz, $\mu_{0}\ $the largest $\mu$ value among the subcarrier
spacing configurations supported in the _operating band_ for both of the
channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and Table 5.3.5-2 and
_GB~Channel(i)~_ the minimum guard band for channel bandwidth _i_ according to
Table 5.3.3-1 and Table 5.3.3-2 for the said $\mu$ value, with $\mu$ as
defined in TS 38.211 [9]. In case there is no common Î¼ value for both of the
channel bandwidths, Î¼~0~=1 is selected for NR _operating bands_ with 15 kHz
channel raster and _GB~Channel(i)~_ is the minimum guard band for channel
bandwidth i according to Table 5.3.3-1 for _Î¼=1_ with _Î¼_ as defined in TS
38.211[9].
The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous _carrier aggregation_ can be
adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster and sub-
carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to optimize performance
in a particular deployment scenario.
For intra-band non-contiguous _carrier aggregation_ , the channel spacing
between two NR component carriers in different _sub-blocks_ shall be larger
than the nominal channel spacing defined in this clause.
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster
The global frequency raster defines a set of _RF reference frequencies_
F~REF~. The _RF reference frequency_ is used in signalling to identify the
position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements. The global frequency
raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The granularity of
the global frequency raster is Î”F~Global~.
_RF reference frequencies_ are designated by an NR Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range [0...3279165] on the global frequency
raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the _RF reference frequency_
F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation, where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-
Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN.
F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + Î”F~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)
Table 5.4.2.1-1: NR-ARFCN parameters for the global frequency raster
Range of frequencies(MHz) Î”F~Global~ (kHz) F~REF-Offs~ (MHz) N~REF-Offs~ Range
of N~REF~
* * *
0 -- 3000 5 0 0 0 -- 599999 3000 -- 24250 15 3000 600000 600000 -- 2016666
24250 -- 100000 60 24250.08 2016667 2016667 -- 3279165
The _channel raster_ defines a subset of _RF reference frequencies_ that can
be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and downlink. The
_RF reference frequency_ for an RF channel maps to a resource element on the
carrier. For each _operating band_ , a subset of frequencies from the global
frequency raster are applicable for that band and forms a channel raster with
a granularity Î”F~Raster~, which may be equal to or larger than Î”F~Global~.
For SUL bands, for the uplink of all FDD bands defined in table 5.2-1 and for
band n34, n38 and n39,
F~REF,shift~ = F~REF~ + Î”~shift~, where Î”~shift~ = 0 kHz or 7.5 kHz
where Î”~shift~ is signalled by the network in higher layer parameter
_frequencyShift7p5khz_ as defined in TS 38.331 [11].
For band n34, n38 and n39, F~REF,\ shift~ is only applicable to uplink
transmissions using a 15 kHz SCS.
The mapping between the _channel raster_ and corresponding resource element is
given in clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each _operating band_ are
defined in clause 5.4.2.3.
#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping
The mapping between the _RF reference frequency_ on the channel raster and the
corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and can be used to
identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on the total number of
RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to both UL and DL. The
mapping must apply to at least one numerology supported by the BS.
Table 5.4.2.2-1: Channel Raster to Resource Element Mapping
                                   $$N_{\text{RB}}\text{mod}2 = 0$$   $$N_{\text{RB}}\text{mod}2 = 1$$
* * *
Resource element index 0 6 Physical resource block number
_k_ , and N~RB~ are as defined in TS 38.211 [9].
#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each _operating band_
The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each NR _operating band_ are
given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in table 5.4.2.3-1 for FR1 and table
5.4.2.3-2 for FR2, using the channel raster to resource element mapping in
clause 5.4.2.2.
\- For NR _operating bands_ with 100 kHz channel raster, Î”F~Raster~ = 20 Ã—
Î”F~Global~. In this case, every 20^th^ NR-ARFCN within the _operating band_
are applicable for the channel raster within the _operating band_ and the step
size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as \.
\- For NR _operating bands_ with 15 kHz channel raster below 3 GHz, Î”F~Raster~
= _I_ Ã— Î”F~Global~, where _I_ Ïµ {3,6}. In this case, every _I^th^_ NRâ€‘ARFCN
within the _operating band_ are applicable for the channel raster within the
_operating band_ and the step size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1
is given as \.
\- For NR _operating bands_ with 15 kHz and 60 kHz channel raster above 3 GHz,
Î”F~Raster~ = _I_ Ã—Î”F~Global~, where _I_ Ïµ {1, 2}. In this case, every _I^th^_
NRâ€‘ARFCN within the _operating band_ are applicable for the channel raster
within the _operating band_ and the step size for the channel raster in table
5.4.2.3-1 and table 5.4.2.3-2 is given as \.
\- For frequency bands with two Î”F~Raster~ in FR1, the higher Î”F~Raster~
applies to channels using only the SCS that is equal to or larger than the
higher Î”F~Raster~ and SSB SCS is equal to the higher Î”F~Raster~.
\- For frequency bands with two Î”F~Raster~ in FR2, the higher Î”F~Raster~
applies to channels using only the SCS that is equal to the higher Î”F~Raster~
and the SSB SCS that is equal to or larger than the higher Î”F~Raster~.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster
#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering
The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition when
explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not present.
A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The frequency
position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with corresponding number GSCN.
The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN for all the frequency ranges are
in table 5.4.3.1-1.
The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency SS~REF~
is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the subcarrier
spacing of the synchronization block is defined separately for each band.

specified at the _antenna connector_ for _BS type 1-C_ and at the _TAB
connector_ for _BS type 1-H_ , with a full complement of transceiver units for
the configuration in normal operating conditions.
_For BS type 1-H the manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of
supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas c_ overed by _beams).
The minimum number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the
BS setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with

the conducted TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for BS type 1-H is
calculated as follows:_
N~TXU,counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~ , 8Ã—N~cells~)_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of _basic limits_ and is derived as
N~TXU,countedpercell~ = _N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~_

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured carrier
signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be expressed as Error
Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the
difference between the ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the

This requirement shall apply to frame timing in MIMO transmission, _carrier
aggregation_ and their combinations.
Frames of the NR signals present at the BS transmitter _antenna connectors_ or
_TAB connectors_ are not perfectly aligned in time. The RF signals present at
the BS transmitter _antenna connectors_ or _transceiver array boundary_ may
experience certain timing differences in relation to each other.
The TAE is specified for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.
For _BS type 1-C_ , the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to different _antenna connectors_ for a
specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.
For _BS type 1-H_ , the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to _TAB connectors_ belonging to different
transmitter groups at the _transceiver array boundary_ , where transmitter
groups are associated with the _TAB connectors_ in the transceiver unit array

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
### 6.6.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
according to ITU definitions [2]. In ITU terminology, out of band emissions
are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _BS channel bandwidth_
resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but
excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are
caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but
exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is specified both
in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and _operating band_
unwanted emissions (OBUE).
The maximum offset of the _operating band_ unwanted emissions mask from the
_operating band_ edge is Î”f~OBUE~. The _Operating band_ unwanted emissions
define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink _operating band_ plus
the frequency ranges Î”f~OBUE~ above and Î”f~OBUE~ below each band. Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions
requirement.
The values of Î”f~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1 for the NR _operating
bands_.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
Table G.2.3.1.2-2, G.2.3.1.2-3 and G.2.3.1.2-4 as below.
The values in Table G.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4-digit precision. This is done using the equation:
Where the value "a" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a=0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in Table
G.2.3.1.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite after
round-off to 4-digit precision with a =0.00012.

### G.2.3.2 Multi-Antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in G.2.3.2 apply to two cases as
presented below:
\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized antennas
used at gNB
\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at both UE and gNB
The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna element with +90
degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For multiple TX antennas
case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at UE.
For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for the
other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number of TX or
RX antennas.
#### G.2.3.2.1 Definition of MIMO Correlation Matrices using cross polarized
antennas
For the channel spatial correlation matrix, the following is used:
Where
\- {width="0.3020833333333333in" height="0.21875in"} is the spatial
correlation matrix at the UE with same polarization,
\- is the spatial correlation matrix at the gNB with same polarization,
\- is a polarization correlation matrix,
\- is a permutation matrix, and
\- {width="0.3020833333333333in" height="0.2604166666666667in"}denotes
transpose.
