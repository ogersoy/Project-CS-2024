# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
FFS
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a general method used to derive Measurement
Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for UE conformance tests. The acceptable
uncertainties for each test case are documented and establish a system for
relating the Test Tolerances to the measurement uncertainties of the Test
System.
For UE radio transmitting and reception tests, only FR2 is considered in this
document. For UE RRM and Demodulation tests, both FR1 and FR2 are considered
in this document.
The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Tolerances are
included as .zip files.
The present document is applicable from Release 15 up to the release indicated
on the front page of the present Terminal conformance specifications.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.
