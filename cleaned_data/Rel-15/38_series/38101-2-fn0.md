# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**Aggregated Channel Bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth in which a UE transmits and
receives multiple contiguously aggregated carriers.
**Beam correspondence:** the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam for
UL transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on UL beam
sweeping.
**Carrier aggregation: Aggregation of two or more component carriers in order
to support wider transmission bandwidths.**
**Carrier aggregation band:** A set of one or more operating bands across
which multiple carriers are aggregated with a specific set of technical
requirements.
**Carrier aggregation bandwidth class:** A class defined by the aggregated
transmission bandwidth configuration and maximum number of component carriers
supported by a UE.
**Carrier aggregation configuration** : A combination of CA operating band(s)
and CA bandwidth class(es) supported by a UE.
NOTE: Carriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or non-contiguous.
**Cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth:** The cumulative aggregated channel
bandwidth is defined as the frequency band from the lowest edge of the lowest
CC to the upper edge of the highest CC of all UL and DL configured CCs.
**EIRP(Link=Link angle, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of the UE such that
the link angle is aligned with the measurement angle. EIRP (indicator to be
measured) can be replaced by EIS, Frequency, EVM, carrier Leakage, In-band
eission and OBW.
**EIRP(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of the
EIRP of the UE such that the measurement angle is aligned with the beam peak
direction within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty. EIRP (indicator
to be measured) can be replaced by Frequency, EVM, carrier Leakage, In-band
eission and OBW
**EIRP(Link=Spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of the
EIRP spherical coverage of the UE such that the EIRP link and measurement
angles are aligned with the directions along the spherical coverage grid
within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty. Alternatively, the
spherical coverage grid can be replaced by the beam peak search grid as the
results from the beam peak search can be re-used for spherical coverage.
**EIS (effective isotropic sensitivity):** sensitivity for an isotropic
directivity device equivalent to the sensitivity of the discussed device
exposed to an incoming wave from a defined AoA
**EIS(Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of the EIS
of the UE such that the measurement angle is aligned with the RX beam peak
direction within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty.
NOTE 1: The sensitivity is the minimum received power level at which specific
requirement is met.
NOTE 2: Isotropic directivity is equal in all directions (i.e. 0 dBi).
**Fallback group:** Group of carrier aggregation bandwidth classes for which
it is mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to lower order CA bandwidth
class configuration. It is not mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to
lower order CA bandwidth class configuration that belong to a different
fallback group.
**FWA UE:** A UE intended to be used in fixed wireless access scenario.
**Handheld UE:** A UE intended to be used in hand held scenario.
**Inter-band carrier aggregation:** Carrier aggregation of component carriers
in different operating bands.
NOTE: Carriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or non-contiguous.
**Intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation:** Contiguous carriers aggregated
in the same operating band.
**Intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation:** Non-contiguous carriers
aggregated in the same operating band.
**Link angle:** a DL-signal AoA from the view point of the UE, as described in
Annex J. If the beam lock function is used to lock the UE beam(s), the link
angle can become any arbitrary AoA once the beam lock has been activated.
**Measurement angle:** the angle of measurement of the desired metric from the
view point of the UE, as described in Annex J
**radiated interface boundary** : operating band specific radiated
requirements reference point where the radiated requirements apply
**radiated requirements reference point** : for the RF measurement setup, the
radiated requirements reference point is located at the centre of the quiet
zone. From the UE perspective the reference point is the input of the UE
antenna array.
**RX beam peak direction** : direction where the maximum total component of
RSRP and thus best total component of EIS is found
**Sub-block:** This is one contiguous allocated block of spectrum for
transmission and reception by the same UE. There may be multiple instances of
sub-blocks within an RF bandwidth.
**TX beam peak direction:** direction where the maximum total component of
EIRP is found
**TRP(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid):** measurement of the TRP of
the UE such that the measurement angles are aligned with the directions of the
TRP grid points within an acceptable measurement uncertainty while the link
angle is aligned with the TX beam peak direction
NOTE: For requirements based on EIRP/EIS, the radiated interface boundary is
associated to the far-field region
**UE transmission bandwidth configuration:** Set of resource blocks located
within the UE channel bandwidth which may be used for transmitting or
receiving by the UE.
**Vehicular UE:** A UE embedded in a vehicle

# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
The present document is a Single-RAT specification for NR UE, covering RF
characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conformance to the
present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the test requirements
specified in the conformance specification 3GPP TS 38.521-2 [5].
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 38.521-2 [5] defines test
tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in this
specification to create test requirements. For some requirements, including
regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined in 3GPP TS 38.521-2
[5].
## 4.2 Applicability of minimum requirements
a) In this specification the Minimum Requirements are specified as general
requirements and additional requirements. Where the Requirement is specified
as a general requirement, the requirement is mandated to be met in all
scenarios
b) For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is specified, in
addition to meeting the general requirement, the UE is mandated to meet the
additional requirements.
c) The spurious emissions power requirements are for the long-term average of
the power. For the purpose of reducing measurement uncertainty it is
acceptable to average the measured power over a period of time sufficient to
reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical nature of the signal
d) All the requirements for intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous CA apply
under the assumption of the same slot format indicated by _TDD-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon and TDD-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ in the PCell and
SCells for NR SA.
A terminal which supports CA or DC configurations, which include FR2 intra-
band CA combinations with multiple subblocks, where at least one of the
subblocks consists of a contiguous CA combination, is not required to support
all possible fallback combinations but can directly fall back to a single FR2
carrier. Deactivating carriers within the CA or DC combination is still
possible.
For FR2 intra-band CA configurations with multiple FR2 sub-blocks, where at
least one of the sub-blocks is a contiguous CA configuration:
\- if the field _partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req_ is not present, the UE shall meet
all applicable UE RF requirements for the highest order CA configuration and
all associated fallback CA configurations;
\- if the field _partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req_ is present, for each FR2 intra-
band CA configuration with multiple sub-blocks that the UE indicates support
for explicitly in UE capability signalling: the in-gap UE RF requirements in
clauses 7.5A, 7.5D, 7.6A, 7.6D apply as the equivalent requirements for the
associated fallback CA configurations with the same number of sub-blocks,
where at least one of the sub-blocks consists of a contiguous CA
configuration. The UE shall meet all applicable UE RF requirements for
fallback CA configurations with a lesser number of sub-blocks;
\- regardless of the field _partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req_ , the UE shall meet all
DL out-of-gap requirements for all lower order fallback CA configurations.

represents either polarized UL MIMO or spatial UL MIMO. RF requirements are
same. If UE supports both kinds of UL MIMO, then RF requirements only need to
be verified under either polarized or spatial UL MIMO.
# 5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating
bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications.
NOTE: Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future
releases.
Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in which
NR can operate according to this version of the specification are identified
as described in Table 5.1-1.

## 5.3 UE Channel bandwidth
### 5.3.1 General
The UE channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or
downlink at the UE. From a BS perspective, different UE channel bandwidths may
be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from
UEs connected to the BS. Transmission of multiple carriers to the same UE (CA)
or multiple carriers to different UEs within the BS channel bandwidth can be
supported.
From a UE perspective, the UE is configured with one or more BWP / carriers,
each with its own UE channel bandwidth. The UE does not need to be aware of
the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS allocates bandwidth to different UEs.
The placement of the UE channel bandwidth for each UE carrier is flexible but
can only be completely within the BS channel bandwidth.
The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guardband and the
transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in Figure 5.3.1-1.

Figure 5.3.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth
configuration for one NR channel
### 5.3.2 Maximum transmission bandwidth configuration
The maximum transmission bandwidth configuration N~RB~ for each UE channel
bandwidth and subcarrier spacing is specified in Table 5.3.2-1
Table 5.3.2-1: Maximum transmission bandwidth configuration N~RB~

### 5.3.3 Minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth configuration
The minimum guardband for each UE channel bandwidth and SCS is specified in
Table 5.3.3-1.
Table 5.3.3-1: Minimum guardband for each UE channel bandwidth and SCS (kHz)

* * *
NOTE: The minimum guardbands have been calculated using the following
equation: GB~channel~ = (BW~Channel~ x 1000 (kHz) - N~RB~ x SCS x 12) / 2 -
SCS/2, where N~RB~ are from Table 5.3.2-1 and GB~channel~ expressed in kHz.
The minimum guardband of receiving BS SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block for each UE
channel bandwidth is specified in table 5.3.3-2 for FR2.

NOTE: The minimum guardband in Table 5.3.3-2 is applicable only when the SCS
240 kHz SS/PBCH block is received adjacent to the edge of the UE channel
bandwidth within which the SS/PBCH block is located.

Figure 5.3.3-2 UE PRB utilization
In the case that multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol due
to BS transmission of SSB, the minimum guardband on each side of the carrier
is the guardband applied at the configured channel bandwidth for the
numerology that is transmitted immediately adjacent to the guard band.
If multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and the UE channel
bandwidth is > 200 MHz, the minimum guardband applied adjacent to 60 kHz SCS
shall be the same as the minimum guardband defined for 120 kHz SCS for the
same UE channel bandwidth.

Note: Figure 5.3.3-3 is not intended to imply the size of any guard between
the two numerologies. Inter-numerology guard band within the carrier is
implementation dependent.
### 5.3.4 RB alignment
For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in Clause
4.4.4.3 in [9], and the starting point of its transmission bandwidth
configuration on the common resource block grid for a given channel bandwidth
is indicated by an offset to \"Reference point A\" in the unit of the
numerology. The _UE transmission bandwidth configuration_ is indicated by the
higher layer parameter _carrierBandwidth [13] and will_ fulfil the minimum UE
guardband requirement specified in Clause 5.3.3.
5.3.5 Channel bandwidth per operating band
The requirements in this specification apply to the combination of channel
bandwidths, SCS and operating bands shown in Table 5.3.5-1. The transmission
bandwidth configuration in Table 5.3.2-1 shall be supported for each of the
specified channel bandwidths. The channel bandwidths are specified for both

## 5.3A UE channel bandwidth for CA
### 5.3A.1 General
### 5.3A.2 Minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth configuration for CA
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, _Aggregated Channel Bandwidth_
and _Guard Bands_ are defined as follows, see Figure 5.3A.2-1.
Figure 5.3A.2-1: Definition of _Aggregated Channel Bandwidth_ for intra-band
carrier aggregation
The _aggregated channel bandwidth,_ **BW~Channel_CA~** , is defined as
BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge,high~ - F~edge,low~ (MHz).
The lower bandwidth edge F~edge,\ low~ and the upper bandwidth edge
F~edge,high~ of the aggregated channel bandwidth are used as frequency
reference points for transmitter and receiver requirements and are defined by
F~edge,low~ = F~C,low~ - F~offset,low~
F~edge,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,high~
The lower and upper frequency offsets depend on the transmission bandwidth
configurations of the lowest and highest assigned edge component carrier and
are defined as
F~offset,low~ = (N~RB,low~*12 + 1)*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)
F~offset,high~ = (N~RB,high~*12 - 1)*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)
BW~GB~ = max(BW~GB,Channel(k)~)
N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth configurations
according to Table 5.3.2-1 for the lowest and highest assigned component
carrier, SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing for the lowest and
highest assigned component carrier respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~,
N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, and BW~GB,Channel(k)~ use the largest μ value among the
subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the operating band for both of
the channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,Channel(k)~ is the
minimum guard band for carrier k according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said _μ_
value.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation _Sub-block Bandwidth_ and
_Sub-block edges_ are defined as follows, see Figure 5.3A.2-2.
Figure 5.3A.2-2: Definition of sub-block bandwidth for intra-band non-
contiguous spectrum
The lower sub-block edge of the Sub-block Bandwidth (BW~Channel,block~) is
defined as
F~edge,block,\ low~ = F~C,block,low~ - F~offset,\ low.~
The upper sub-block edge of the Sub-block Bandwidth is defined as
F~edge,block,high~ = F~C,block,high~ + F~offset,\ high.~
The Sub-block Bandwidth, BW~Channel,block~, is defined as follows:
BW~Channel,block~ = F~edge,block,high\ -~ F~edge,block,low~ (MHz)
The lower and upper frequency offsets F~offset,block,low~ and
F~offset,block,high~ depend on the transmission bandwidth configurations of
the lowest and highest assigned edge component carriers within a sub-block and
are defined as
F~offset,block,low~ = (N~RB,low~*12 + 1)*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)
F~offset,block,high~ = (N~RB,high~*12 - 1)*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)
BW~GB~ = max(BW~GB,Channel(k)~)
where N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth configurations
according to Table 5.3.2-1 for the lowest and highest assigned component
carrier within a sub-block, respectively. SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-
carrier spacing for the lowest and highest assigned component carrier within a
sub-block, respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, and
BW~GB,Channel(k)~ use the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing
configurations supported in the operating band for both of the channel
bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,Channel(k)~ is the minimum
guard band for carrier k according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said _μ_ value.
The sub-block gap size between two consecutive sub-blocks W~gap~ is defined as
W~gap~ = F~edge,block\ n+1,low\ -~ F~edge,block\ n,high~ (MHz)
### 5.3A.3 RB alignment with different numerologies for CA
### 5.3A.4 UE channel bandwidth per operating band for CA
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting a carrier aggregation
bandwidth class with associated bandwidth combination sets specified in clause
5.5A.1. For each carrier aggregation configuration, requirements are specified
for all aggregated channel bandwidths contained in a bandwidth combination
set, UE can indicate support of several bandwidth combination sets per carrier
aggregation configuration. The requirements are applicable only when Uplink
CCs are configured within the frequency range between lower edge of lowest
downlink component carrier and upper edge of highest downlink component
carrier.
For intra-band non-contiguous downlink carrier aggregation, a carrier
aggregation configuration is a single operating band supporting two or more
sub-blocks, each supporting a carrier aggregation bandwidth class. The
requirements are applicable only when Uplink CCs are configured within the
frequency range between lower edge of lowest downlink component carrier and
upper edge of highest downlink component carrier.
Frequency separation class specified in Table 5.3A.4-2 indicates the maximum
frequency span between lower edge of lowest component carrier and upper edge
of highest component carrier that UE can support per band in downlink or
uplink respectively in non-contiguous intra-band operation.
For inter-band carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation configuration is a
combination of operating bands, each supporting a carrier aggregation
bandwidth class.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster
#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering
The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition when
explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not present.
A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The frequency
position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with corresponding number GSCN.
The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN for all the frequency ranges are
in Table 5.4.3.1-1.
The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency SS~REF~
is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the subcarrier
spacing of the synchronization block is defined separately for each band.

## 5.4A Channel arrangement for CA
### 5.4A.1 Channel spacing for CA
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation with two or more component
carriers, the nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR component
carriers is defined as the following unless stated otherwise:
For NR operating bands with 60kHz channel raster:
with
_n = µ~0~ -- 2_
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.2-1 with values in
MHz, μ~o~ is the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing configurations
supported in the operating band for both of the channel bandwidths according
to Table 5.3.5-1, and _GB~Channel(i)~ is_ the minimum guard band for channel
bandwidth _i_ according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said μ value, with μ as
defined in TS 38.211 [9].
The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster and sub-
carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to optimize performance
in a particular deployment scenario.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the channel spacing between
two NR component carriers in different sub-blocks shall be larger than the
nominal channel spacing defined in this clause.

### 6.2.2 UE maximum output power reduction
6.2.2.0 General
The requirements in clause 6.2.2 only apply when both UL and DL of a UE are
configured for single CC operation, and they are of the same bandwidth. A UE
may reduce its maximum output power due to modulation orders, transmit
bandwidth configurations, waveform types and narrow allocations. This Maximum
Power Reduction (MPR) is defined in clauses below. The allowed MPR for SRS,
PUCCH formats 0, 1, 3 and 4, and PRACH shall be as specified for QPSK
modulated DFT-s-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation. The allowed MPR for PUCCH
format 2 shall be as specified for QPSK modulated CP-OFDM of equivalent RB
allocation. When the maximum output power of a UE is modified by MPR, the
power limits specified in clause 6.2.4 apply.
For a UE that is configured for single CC operation with different channel
bandwidths in UL and DL, the requirements in clause 6.2A.2 apply.
For all power classes, the waveform defined by BW = 100 MHz, SCS = 120 kHz,
DFT-S-OFDM QPSK, 20RB23 is the reference waveform with 0 dB MPR and is used
for the power class definition.
#### 6.2.2.1 UE maximum output power reduction for power class 1
For power class 1, MPR for contiguous allocations is defined as:
MPR = max(MPR~WT~, MPR~narrow~)
Where,
MPR~narrow~ = 14.4 dB, when BW~alloc,RB~ ≤ 1.44 MHz, MPR~narrow~ = 10 dB, when
1.44 MHz \ RB~Start,High~ OR L~CRB~ >
Ceil(N~RB~/2)
An RB allocation belonging to table 6.2.2.1-1 is a Region 1 inner RB
allocation if
**RB~start~** ≥ **Ceil(1/3 N~RB~) AND RB~end~** \ 200 MHz.
> MPR~2~ shall be determined from Table 6.2.2.1-1 if UL BW~channel_CA~ ≤ 200
> MHz, from Table 6.2.2.1-2 if UL BW~channel_CA~ > 200 MHz.
and assume all UL CCs use the same SCS for the purpose of determination of
inner and outer RB allocations in Table 6.2.2.1-1 and Table 6.2.2.1-2:
N~RB~ shall be chosen as the sum of N~RB~ of all constituent UL CCs in the CA
configuration.
L~CRB~ shall be chosen as BW~alloc,RB~
RB~start~ shall be derived as: RB~start_allocatedCC~+N~RB_unallocatedCC_low~
RB~start_allocatedCC~ is the index of the first allocated RB in the CC with
allocation
N~RB_unallocatedCC_low~ is the sum of N~RB~ in all UL CCs lower in frequency
compared to the CC with allocation
When different waveform types exist across CCs, the requirement is set by the
waveform type used in the configuration with the largest MPR~C_CA~.
For non-contiguous RB allocations, the following rule for MPR applies:
MPR = max(MPR~C_CA~, -10*A + 14.4)
Where:
A = N~RB_alloc~ / N~RB_agg_C.~
N~RB_alloc~ is the total number of allocated UL RBs
> N~RB_agg_C~ is the number of the aggregated RBs within the fully allocated
> cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth assuming lowest SCS among all
> configured CCs
#### 6.2A.2.3 Maximum output power reduction for power class 2
For power class 2, MPR specified in clause 6.2A.2.4 applies.
Table 6.2A.2.3-1: (Void)
#### 6.2A.2.4 Maximum output power reduction for power class 3
For power class 3, MPR for UL contiguous allocations within the cumulative
aggregated bandwidth is denoted as MPR~C_CA~ and is defined in Table
6.2A.2.4-1.
Table 6.2A.2.4-1: Maximum power reduction (MPR~C_CA~) for UE power class 3

> MPR~2~ shall be determined from Table 6.2.2.3-1 if ULBW~channel_CA~ ≤ 200
> MHz, from Table 6.2.2.3-2 if UL BW~channel_CA~ > 200 MHz.
and assume all UL CCs use the same SCS for the purpose of determination of
inner and outer RB allocations in Table 6.2.2.3-1 and Table 6.2.2.3-2:
N~RB~ shall be chosen as the sum of N~RB~ of all constituent UL CCs in the CA
configuration.
L~CRB~ shall be chosen as BW~alloc,RB~
RB~start~ shall be derived as: RB~start_allocatedCC~+N~RB_unallocatedCC_low~
RB~start_allocatedCC~ is the index of the first allocated RB in the CC with
allocation
N~RB_unallocatedCC_low~ is the sum of N~RB~ in all UL CCs lower in frequency
compared to the CC with allocation
When different waveform types exist across CCs, the requirement is set by the
waveform type used in the configuration with the highest contiguous MPR.
For non-contiguous RB allocations, the following rule for MPR applies:
MPR = max(MPR~C_CA~, -10*A +7.0)
Where:
A = N~RB_alloc~ / N~RB_agg_C.~
N~RB_alloc~ is the total number of allocated UL RBs
> N~RB_agg_C~ is the number of the aggregated RBs within the fully allocated
> cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth assuming lowest SCS among all
> configured CCs
#### 6.2A.2.5 Maximum output power reduction for power class 4
For power class 4, MPR specified in clause 6.2A.2.4 applies.
### 6.2A.3 UE maximum output power with additional requirements for CA
#### 6.2A.3.1 General
Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network with network
signalling value indicated by the field _additionalSpectrumEmission._ To meet
these additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction (A-MPR) is
allowed for the maximum output power as specified in clause 6.2A.1. Unless
stated otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used. Unless otherwise stated, the
allowed total back off is maximum of A-MPR and MPR specified in clause 6.2A.2
For intra-band contiguous aggregation with the UE configured for transmissions
on two serving cells, the maximum output power reduction specified in Table
6.2A.3.1-1 is allowed for all serving cells of the applicable uplink
contiguous CA configurations.
Table 6.2A.3.1-1 specifies the additional requirements and allowed A-MPR with
corresponding network signalling label and operating band. The mapping between
network signalling labels and the _additionalSpectrumEmission_ IE defined in
TS 38.331 [13] is specified in Table 6.2A.3.1-2. Unless otherwise stated, the
allowed total back off is maximum of A-MPR and MPR specified in clause 6.2A.2.

### 6.3A.3 Transmit ON/OFF time mask for CA
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the general output power ON/OFF
time mask specified in clause 6.3.3.2 is applicable for each component carrier
during the ON power period and the transient periods. The OFF period as
specified in clause 6.3.3.2 shall only be applicable for each component
carrier when all the component carriers are OFF.
### 6.3A.4 Power control for CA
#### 6.3A.4.1 General
The requirements in this clause apply to a UE when it has at least one of UL
or DL configured for CA operation. The requirements on power control accuracy
in CA operation apply under normal conditions and are defined as a directional
requirement. The requirements are verified in beam locked mode on beam peak
direction. The requirements apply for one single PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS
transmission of contiguous PRB allocation per configured UL CC with power
setting in accordance with Clause 7.1 of [10]
#### 6.3A.4.2 Absolute power tolerance
The absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its
initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame at the start
of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a
transmission gap on each active component carriers larger than 20 ms. For SRS
switching, the absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter
to set its initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame at
the start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a
transmission gap on component carriers (to which SRS switching occurs) larger
than 20 ms. The requirement can be tested by time aligning any transmission
gaps on the component carriers. For intra-band contiguous CA, the absolute
power control tolerance per configured UL CC is given in Tables 6.3.4.2-1 and
6.3.4.2-2.
#### 6.3A.4.3 Relative power tolerance
The relative power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its
output power in a target sub-frame relative to the power of the most recently
transmitted reference sub-frame if the transmission gap between these sub-
frames is less than or equal to 20ms.
For intra-band contiguous CA, the requirements apply when the power of the
target and reference sub-frames on each component carrier exceed the minimum
output power as defined in clause 6.3A.1 and the total power is limited by
P~UMAX~ as defined in clause 6.2A.4. For the purpose of these requirements,
the power in each component carrier is specified over only the transmitted
resource blocks. The UE shall meet the requirements in tables 6.3.4.3-1 and
6.3.4.3-2 for transmission on each assigned component carrier, when the
average PSDs over each CC are aligned with each other in the reference sub-
frame. The requirements apply per component carrier to:
a. All possible combinations of PUSCH and PUCCH transitions
b. SRS and PUSCH/PUCCH transitions, only with simultaneous SRS of constant SRS
bandwidth allocated in the target and reference subrames
c. RACH, primary component carrier
When applicable, the power step ∆P between the reference and target subframes
shall be set by a TPC command and/or an uplink scheduling grant transmitted by
means of an appropriate DCI Format.
#### 6.3A.4.4 Aggregate power tolerance
The aggregate power control tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to
maintain its power during non-contiguous transmissions within 21 ms in
response to 0 dB TPC commands with respect to the first UE transmission and
all other power control parameters as specified in [10] kept constant.
For intra-band contiguous CA, the aggregate power tolerance per CC is given in
Tables 6.3.4.4.1-1 and 6.3.4.4.1-2, with simultaneous PUSCH configured. The
average PSDs over each assigned CC shall be aligned before the start of the
test. The requirement can be tested with the transmission gaps time aligned
between component carriers.
## 6.3D Output power dynamics for UL MIMO
### 6.3D.0 General
The requirements in subclause 6.3D shall be met with configurations specified
in sub-clause 6.2D.1.x, where 'x' depends on power class. Unless otherwise
specified, the requirements shall be verified in beam locked mode with the
test metric of EIRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).
### 6.3D.1 Minimum output power for UL MIMO
#### 6.3D.1.0 General
The minimum output power is defined as the mean power in at least one sub
frame (1ms). The minimum controlled output power is defined as the EIRP, i.e.
the sum of the power in the channel bandwidth for all transmit bandwidth
configurations (resource blocks), when the UE power is set to a minimum value.
#### 6.3D.1.1 Minimum output power for UL MIMO for power class 1
For UE supporting UL MIMO, the minimum output power shall not exceed the sum
of the value specified in Table 6.3.1.1-1 and the quantity 10*log~10~(Number
of Layers).
#### 6.3D.1.2 Minimum output power for UL MIMO for power class 2, 3 and 4
For UE supporting UL MIMO, the minimum output power shall not exceed the sum
of the value specified in Table 6.3.1.2-1 and the quantity 10*log~10~(Number
of Layers).
### 6.3D.2 Transmit OFF power for UL MIMO
For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit OFF power is defined as the TRP in the
channel bandwidth when the transmitter is OFF. The transmitter is considered
OFF when the UE is not allowed to transmit on any of its ports. During DTX and
measurements gaps, the transmitter is not considered OFF. The minimum output
power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.3.2-1. The requirement
is verified with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP
grid).
### 6.3D.3 Transmit ON/OFF time mask for UL MIMO
For UE supporting UL MIMO, the ON/OFF time mask requirements in clause 6.3.3
apply.
## 6.4 Transmit signal quality
### 6.4.1 Frequency Error
**The UE basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL
slot. The mean value of basic measurements of** UE modulated carrier frequency
shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period of 1 msec of
cumulated measurement intevals compared to the carrier frequency received from
the NR gNB.
The frequency error is defined as a directional requirement. The requirement
is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of Frequency (Link=TX
beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).
### 6.4.2 Transmit modulation quality
#### 6.4.2.0 General
Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected in-
channel RF transmissions from the UE. The transmit modulation quality is
specified in terms of:
\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)
\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer coefficients
generated by the EVM measurement process
\- Carrier leakage
\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB
All the parameters defined in clause 6.4.2 are defined using the measurement
methodology specified in Annex F.
All the requirements in 6.4.2 are defined as directional requirement. The
requirements are verified in beam locked mode on beam peak direction, with
parameter _maxRank_ (as defined in TS 38.331 [13]) set to 1. The requirements
are applicable to UL transmission from each configurable antenna port (as
defined in TS 38.331 [13]) of UE, enabled one at a time.
In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
_txDirectCurrentLocation_ in _UplinkTxDirectCurrentList_ IE (as defined in TS
38.331 [13]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause 6.4.2.2 and
6.4.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard to the carrier
leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the calculation of transmit
modulation quality.
#### 6.4.2.1 Error vector magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Before calculating the EVM, the measured waveform is corrected
by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified in
clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is
defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of
the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For
CP-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the
square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference
power expressed as a %.
The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence
for the PRACH and one slot for PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain. The EVM
measurement interval is reduced by any symbols that contains an allowable
power transient in the measurement interval as as defined in clause 6.3.3.
The RMS average of the basic EVM measurements over 10 subframes for the
average EVM case, and over 60 subframes for the reference signal EVM case, for
the different modulation schemes shall not exceed the values specified in
Table 6.4.2.1-1 for the parameters defined in Table 6.4.2.1-2 or 6.4.2.1-3,
depending on UE power class. For EVM evaluation purposes, all 13 PRACH
preamble formats and all 5 PUCCH formats are considered to have the same EVM
requirement as QPSK modulated.
The requirement is verified with the test metric of EVM (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 6.4.2.2 Carrier leakage
##### 6.4.2.2.1 General
Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform. The carrier leakage
requirement is defined for each component carrier. The measurement interval is
one slot in the time domain. The relative carrier leakage power is a power
ratio of the additive sinusoid waveform to the power in the modulated
waveform.
The requirement is verified with the test metric of Carrier Leakage (Link=TX

#### 6.4.2.3 In-band emissions
##### 6.4.2.3.1 General
The in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carriers and as a
function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission
bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output
power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB.

#### 6.4.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
The EVM measurement process (as described in Annex F) entails generation of a
zero-forcing equalizer. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined in
terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple of the equalizer coefficients (dB)
across the allocated uplink block. The basic measurement interval is the same
as for EVM.
For Pi/2 BPSK modulation, the minimum requirements are defined in Clause
6.4.2.5.
The peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained within
the frequency range of the uplink allocation shall not exceed the maximum
ripple specified in Table 6.4.2.4-1 for normal conditions. For uplink
allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the coefficients
evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet the corresponding
ripple requirement and the following additional requirements: the relative
difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 1 and the minimum
coefficient in Range 2 (Table 6.4.2.4-1) must not be larger than 7 dB, and the
relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum
coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 8 dB (see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).
The requirement is verified with the test metric of EVM SF (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 6.4.2.5 EVM spectral flatness for Pi/2 BPSK modulation
These requirements are defined for Pi/2 BPSK modulation. The EVM equalizer
coefficients across the allocated uplink block shall be modified to fit inside
the mask specified in Table 6.4.2.5-1 for normal conditions, prior to the
calculation of EVM. The limiting mask shall be placed to minimize the change
in equalizer coefficients in a sum of squares sense.

Inband emission requirement is defined over the spectrum occupied by all
configured UL and DL CCs. The measurement interval is as defined in clause
6.4.2.4. The requirement is verified with the test metric of In-band emission
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirements in this clause
apply with all component carriers active and with one single contiguous PRB
allocation in one of uplink component carriers. The inband emission is defined
as the interference falling into the non-allocated resource blocks for all
component carriers.

#### 6.4A.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
## 6.4D Transmit signal quality for UL MIMO
### 6.4D.0 General
For a UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements in
clause 6.4 apply but with all references to sub-clauses 6.3.1.x in clause 6.4
redirected to sub-clauses 6.3D.1.x, where 'x' depends on power class. The
requirements apply when the UE is configured for 2-layer UL MIMO transmission
as specified in Table 6.2D.1.3-3.
The requirement may alternatively be verified in each of the single layer UL
MIMO configurations as specified in Table 6.4D.0-1. In this case, the transmit
modulation quality requirements in clause 6.4 apply without modification.
Table 6.4D.0-1: Alternative UL MIMO configuration for transmit signal quality
tests
**Transmission scheme** **DCI format** **TPMI Index**
* * *
Codebook based uplink DCI format 0_1 0 Codebook based uplink DCI format 0_1 1
### 6.4D.1 Frequency error for UL MIMO
For a UE supporting UL MIMO, **the UE basic measurement interval of modulated
carrier frequency is 1 slot. The mean value of basic measurements of** UE
modulated carrier frequency at each layer shall be accurate to within ± 0.1
PPM observed over a period of 1ms of cumulated measurement intevals compared
to the carrier frequency received from the NR Node B.
### 6.4D.2 Transmit modulation quality for UL MIMO
For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements are
specified per layer in terms of:
Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)
EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer coefficients
generated by the EVM measurement process
Carrier leakage (caused by IQ offset)
For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements are
specified as the total component of EIRP in terms of:
In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB
The requirements are defined as directional requirements. The requirements are
verified in beam locked mode in the TX beam peak direction (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle).
In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
_txDirectCurrentLocation_ in _UplinkTxDirectCurrentList_ IE (as defined in TS
38.331 [13]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause 6.4D.2.2 and
6.4D.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard to the carrier
leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the calculation of transmit
modulation quality.
### 6.4D.3 Time alignment error for UL MIMO
For a UE with multiple physical antenna ports supporting UL MIMO, this
requirement applies to frame timing differences between transmissions on
multiple physical antenna ports in the codebook transmission scheme.
The time alignment error (TAE) is defined as the average frame timing
difference between any two transmissions on different physical antenna ports.
For a UE with multiple physical antenna ports, the Time Alignment Error (TAE)
shall not exceed 130 ns.
### 6.4D.4 Requirements for coherent UL MIMO
For coherent UL MIMO, Table 6.4D.4-1 lists the maximum allowable difference
between the measured relative power and phase errors between different
physical antenna ports in any slot within the specified time window from the
last transmitted SRS on the same antenna ports, for the purpose of uplink
transmission (codebook or non-codebook usage) and those measured at that last
SRS. The requirements in Table 6.4D.4-1 apply when the UL transmission power
at each physical antenna port is larger than 0 dBm for SRS transmission and
for the duration of time window. The requirement is verified with the test
metric of EIRP (Link=TX Beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

errors in a given slot compared to those measured at last SRS transmitted

## 6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth
Occupied bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total
integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum on the assigned channel. The
occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth configurations (Resources
Blocks) shall be less than the channel bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1-1.
The occupied bandwidth is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of OBW
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

### 6.5.2 Out of band emissions
#### 6.5.2.0 General
The Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-
linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This out of
band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and an
adjacent channel leakage power ratio. Additional requirements to protect
specific bands are also considered.
The requirements in clause 6.5.2.1 only apply when both UL and DL of a UE are
configured for single CC operation, and they are of the same bandwidth. For a
UE that is configured for single CC operation with different channel
bandwidths in UL and DL, the requirements in clause 6.5A.2.1 apply.
All out of band emissions for frequency range 2 are TRP.
#### 6.5.2.1 Spectrum emission mask
The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~) starting
from the ± edge of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. For frequencies offset
greater than F~OOB~ as specified in Table 6.5.2.1-1 the spurious requirements
in clause 6.5.3 are applicable.
The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table
6.5.2.1-1 for the specified channel bandwidth. The requirement is verified in
beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction,
Meas=TRP grid).

#### 6.5.2.3 Adjacent channel leakage ratio
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency. ACLR requirement is specified for a
scenario in which adjacent carrier is another NR channel**.**
NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal channel
spacing. The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel power are
measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in
Table 6.5.2.3-1.
If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than --35 dBm then the
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5.2.3-1. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

### 6.5.3 Spurious emissions
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions
unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission limits are specified in terms
of general requirements in line with SM.329 [7] and NR operating band
requirement to address UE co-existence. Spurious emissions are measured as
TRP.
To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution
bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be
integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent
noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the frequency
ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3-1 starting from the edge
of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. The spurious emission limits in Table
6.5.3-2 apply for all transmitter band configurations (NRB) and channel
bandwidths. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test
metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).
NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the
lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be
set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2. The highest
frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be set at
the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the
measurement bandwidth defined for the protected band.

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spurious emission limits
apply for the frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) from the edge
of the UL aggregated channel bandwidth, where F~OOB~ is defined as the twice
the UL aggregated channel bandwidth. For frequencies Δf~OOB~ greater than
F~OOB~, the spurious emission requirements in Table 6.5.3-2 are applicable.
#### 6.5A.3.1 Spurious emission band UE co-existence for CA
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified carrier aggregation
configurations for coexistence with protected bands.
NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the
lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be
set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2. The highest
frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be set at
the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the
measurement bandwidth defined for the protected band.

#### 6.5A.3.2 Additional spurious emissions
##### 6.5A.3.2.1 General
These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spectrum emission
requirement. Additional spurious emission requirements are signalled by the
network to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast message.
##### 6.5A.3.2.2 Void
##### 6.5A.3.2.3 Additional spurious emission requirements for CA_NS_202
When \"CA_NS_202\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission
shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5.3.2.3-1.
##### 6.5A.3.2.4 Additional spurious emission requirements for CA_NS_203
When \"CA_NS_203\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission
shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5.3.2.4-1. This requirement
also applies for the frequency ranges that are less than F~OOB~ (MHz) as

specified in Table 6.2D.1.3-3.
### 6.5D.2 Out of band emissions for UL MIMO
For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the out of band emissions requirements in clause
6.5.2 apply. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations
specified in Table 6.2D.1.3-3.
### 6.5D.3 Spurious emissions for UL MIMO
For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the spurious emissions requirements in clause
6.5.3 apply. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations
specified in Table 6.2D.1.3-3.
## 6.6 Beam correspondence
### 6.6.1 General
Beam correspondence is the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam for UL
transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on UL beam
sweeping. The beam correspondence requirement is satisfied assuming the
presence of both SSB and CSI-RS signals and Type D QCL is maintained between
SSB and CSI-RS. Unless explicitly addressed in subclauses below, the beam
correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE meets the corresponding
minimum peak EIRP requirement and spherical coverage requirement for that
power class with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink beam
sweeping.
### 6.6.2 (Void)
### 6.6.3 (Void)
### 6.6.4 Beam correspondence for power class 3
#### 6.6.4.1 General
The beam correspondence requirement for power class 3 UEs consists of three
components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.3), UE spherical
coverage (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.3), and beam correspondence tolerance (as
defined in Clause 6.6.4.2). The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled
if the UE satisfies one of the following conditions, depending on the UE\'s
beam correspondence capability IE _beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping_ ,
as defined in TS 38.306 [14]:
\- If _beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping_ is supported, the UE shall
meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-3 with its
autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping. Such a UE is
considered to have met the beam correspondence tolerance requirement.
\- If _beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping_ is not present, the UE shall
meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-3 with uplink beam
sweeping. Such a UE shall meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement
defined in Clause 6.6.4.2 and shall support uplink beam management, as defined
in TS 38.306 [14].
#### 6.6.4.2 Beam correspondence tolerance for power class 3
The beam correspondence tolerance requirement ∆EIRP~BC~ for power class 3 UEs
is defined based on a percentile of the distribution of ∆EIRP~BC~, defined as
∆EIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ - EIRP~1~ over the link angles spanning a subset of the
spherical coverage grid points, such that
\- EIRP~1~ is the total EIRP in dBm calculated based on the beam the UE
chooses autonomously (corresponding beam) to transmit in the direction of the
incoming DL signal, which is based on beam correspondence without relying on
UL beam sweeping.
\- EIRP~2~ is the best total EIRP (beam yielding highest EIRP in a given
direction) in dBm which is based on beam correspondence with relying on UL
beam sweeping.
\- The link angles are the ones corresponding to the top N^th^ percentile of
the EIRP~2~ measurement over the whole sphere, where the value of N is
according to the test point of EIRP spherical coverage requirement for power
class 3, i.e. N = 50.
For power class 3 UEs, the requirement is fulfilled if the UE\'s corresponding
UL beams satisfy the maximum limit in Table 6.6.4.2-1.

## 7.5 Adjacent channel selectivity
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to
receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency
of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on
the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the
adjacent channel(s).
The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of the
wanted signal and the interfering signal are both from the direction where
peak gain is achieved.
The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations, under
the assumption of polarization match.
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5-1 for all
values of an adjacent channel interferer up to --25 dBm. However, it is not
possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper range of
test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5-2 and Table 7.5-3 where the throughput
shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2, with one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1. The
requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle).

### 7.5A.2 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band non-contiguous CA
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two component carriers,
two different requirements apply for out-of-gap and in-gap. For out-of-gap,
the UE shall meet the requirements for each component carrier as specified in
clauses 7.5. For in-gap, the requirement applies if the following minimum gap
condition is met:
∆ _f~ACS~_ ≥ BW~1~/2 + BW~2~/2 + max(BW~1~, BW~2~),
where ∆ _f~ACS~_ _is the f_ requency separation between the center frequencies
of the component carriers and BW _~k~_ are the channel bandwidths of carrier
_k_ , _k_ = 1,2.
If the minimum gap condition is met, the UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clauses 7.5 for each component carrier considered. The respective
channel bandwidth of the component carrier under test will be used in the
parameter calculations of the requirement. In case of more than two component
carriers, the minimum gap condition is computed for any pair of adjacent
component carriers following the same approach as the two component carriers.
The in-gap requirement for the corresponding pairs shall apply if the minimum
gap condition is met.
For every component carrier to which the requirements apply, the UE shall meet
the requirement with one active interferer signal (in-gap or out-of-gap) while
all downlink carriers are active and the input power shall be distributed
among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with each other.

## 7.6 Blocking characteristics
### 7.6.1 General
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. The
blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a
spurious response occurs.
The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of the
wanted signal and the interfering signal are both from the direction where
peak gain is achieved.
The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations, under
the assumption of polarization match.
### 7.6.2 In-band blocking
In-band blocking is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a NR signal
at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an interferer at a given
frequency offset from the centre frequency of the assigned channel.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX
beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 7.6A.2.2 In-band blocking for Intra-band non-contiguous CA
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two component carriers,
the requirement applies to out-of-gap and in-gap. For out-of-gap, the UE shall
meet the requirements for each component carrier with parameters as specified
in 7.6.2-1. The requirement associated to the maximum channel between across
the component carriers is selected. For in-gap, the requirement shall apply if
the following minimum gap condition is met:
∆ _f~IBB~_ ≥ 0.5(BW~1~ + BW~2~) + 2 max(BW~1~, BW~2~),
where ∆ _f~IBB~ is the f_ requency separation between the center frequencies
of the component carriers and BW _~k~_ are the channel bandwidths of carrier
_k_ , _k_ = 1,2.
If the minimum gap condition is met, the UE shall meet the requirement
specified in Table 7.6.2-1 for each component carrier. The respective channel
bandwidth of the component carrier under test will be used in the parameter
calculations of the requirement. In case of more than two component carriers,
the minimum gap condition is computed for any pair of adjacent component
carriers following the same approach as the two component carriers. The in-gap
requirement for the corresponding pairs shall apply if the minimum gap
condition is met. For every component carrier to which the requirements apply,
the UE shall meet the requirement with one active interferer signal (in-gap or
out-of-gap) while all downlink carriers are active and the input power shall
be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with each
other.

## 7.9 Spurious emissions
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver. The spurious emissions power level is measured as TRP.
The power of any narrow band CW spurious emission shall not exceed the maximum
level specified in Table 7.9-1. The requirement is verified in beam locked
mode with the test metric of TRP (Link= TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP
grid).

## A.3.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, Tables A.3.3.2-1 and A.3.3.2-2 are applicable for
measurements of the Receiver Characteristics (clause 7).
Unless otherwise stated, Tables A.3.3.2-1 and A.3.3.2-2 also apply for the
modulated interferer used in Clauses 7.5 and 7.6 with test specific
bandwidths.
CSI-RS configuration parameter defined in Table A.3.1-2 is used for verifying
the beam correspondence requirement, 2 slots of CSI-RS shall be provided at
each test grid point. The DL channel shall be configured for zero power on all
tones except those used by CSI-RS in slots containing CSI-RS for beam
refinement, and the DL and UL channel sizes shall be the same during
verification.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Characteristics of the interfering signal
# D.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, a modulated full bandwidth NR downlink signal, which
equals to channel bandwidth of the wanted signal for Single Carrier case is
used as interfering signals when RF performance requirements for NR UE
receiver are defined. For intra-band contiguous CA case, a modulated NR
downlink signal which equals to the aggregated channel bandwidth of the wanted
signal is used.

Table D.2-1 describes the modulated interferer for different channel bandwidth
options.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Environmental conditions
# E.1 General
This annex specifies the environmental requirements of the UE. Within these
limits the requirements of the present documents shall be fulfilled.
# E.2 Environmental
The requirements in this clause apply to all types of UE(s).
## E.2.1 Temperature
All RF requirements for UEs operating in FR2 are defined over the air and can
only be tested in an OTA chamber.
The UE shall fulfil all the requirements in the temperature range for extreme
conditions, as defined in Table E.2.1-1, unless explicitly stated otherwise in
any requirement.
Table E.2.1-1: Temperature conditions
\+ 25 ⁰C ± 10 ⁰C For normal (room temperature) conditions with relative
humidity up to 75 %
* * *
-10°C to +55°C For extreme conditions
Outside this temperature range the UE, if powered on, shall not make
ineffective use of the radio frequency spectrum. In no case shall the UE
exceed the transmitted levels as defined in clause 6.2 for extreme operation.
## E.2.2 Voltage
Editor\'s note: This requirement is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:
Methodology to control the voltage in a case which a power cable is not
connected to DUT is FFS since it is not agreed whether we can connect the
power cable to DUT at the OTA measurement situation yet.
The UE shall fulfil all the requirements in the full voltage range, i.e. the
voltage range between the extreme voltages.
The manufacturer shall declare the lower and higher extreme voltages and the
approximate shutdown voltage. For the equipment that can be operated from one
or more of the power sources listed below, the lower extreme voltage shall not
be higher, and the higher extreme voltage shall not be lower than that

Figure F.1-1: EVM measurement points
## F.2 Basic Error Vector Magnitude measurement
The EVM is the difference between the ideal waveform and the measured waveform
for the allocated RB(s)
,
where
is a set of modulation symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the measurement period,
are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM,
is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and
is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation symbols is
equal to 1.
The basic EVM measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain
for PUCCH and PUSCH and over one preamble sequence for the PRACH.
# F.3 Basic in-band emissions measurement
The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the non-
allocated resources blocks. The in-band emission requirement is evaluated for
PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions. The in-band emission requirement is not
evaluated for PRACH transmissions.
The in-band emissions are measured as follows
,
where
is a set of OFDM symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the measurement period,
is the starting frequency offset between the allocated RB and the measured
non-allocated RB (e.g. or for the first adjacent RB),
(resp. ) is the lower (resp. upper) edge of the UL system BW,
and are the lower and upper edge of the allocated BW, and
is the frequency domain signal evaluated for in-band emissions as defined in
the clause (ii)
The relative in-band emissions are, given by
where
is the number of allocated RBs
The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in
the time domain. When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to
multiplexing with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement interval is reduced
by one OFDM symbol, accordingly.
In the evaluation of in-band emissions, the timing is set according to , where
sample time offsets and are defined in clause F.4.
# F.4 Modified signal under test
Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is able
to compensate a number of transmitter impairments.
The DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals or PRACH signal under test is modified and,
in the case of DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals, decoded according to:
where
is the time domain samples of the signal under test.
The CP-OFDM modulated signals or PUSCH demodulation reference signal or CP-
OFDM modulated signalsunder test is equalised and, in the case of PUCCH data
signal decoded according to:
where
is the time domain samples of the signal under test.
To minimize the error, the signal under test should be modified with respect
to a set of parameters following the procedure explained below.
Notation:
is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in relation
to nominal timing of the ideal signal.
is the RF frequency offset.
is the phase response of the TX chain.
is the amplitude response of the TX chain.
In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of length
(defined in the next clauses) or the last sample of the first window half if
is even.
The EVM analyser shall
\- detect the start of each slot and estimate and ,
\- determine so that the EVM window of length is centred
\- on the time interval determined by the measured cyclic prefix minus 16κ
samples of the considered OFDM symbol for symbol l for subcarrier spacing
configuration µ in a subframe, with l = 0 or l = 7*2\^µ for normal CP, i.e.
the first 16κ samples of the CP should not be taken into account for this
step. In the determination of the number of excluded samples, a sampling rate
of 1/T~c~ is assumed. If a different sampling rate is used, the number of
excluded samples is scaled linearly.
\- on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol symbol for all
other symbols for normal CP and for symbol 0 to 11 for extended CP.
\- on the measured preamble cyclic prefix for the PRACH
To determine the other parameters a sample timing offset equal to is corrected
from the signal under test. The EVM analyser shall then
\- correct the RF frequency offset for each time slot, and
\- apply an FFT of appropriate size. The chosen FFT size shall ensure that in
the case of an ideal signal under test, there is no measured inter-subcarrier
interference.
The carrier leakage shall be removed from the evaluated signal before
calculating the EVM and the in-band emissions; however, the removed relative
carrier leakage power also has to satisfy the applicable requirement.
At this stage the allocated RBs shall be separated from the non-allocated RBs.
In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH EVM, the signal on the non-allocated RB(s), ,
is used to evaluate the in-band emissions.
Moreover, the following procedure applies only to the signal on the allocated
RB(s).
\- In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate the TX
chain equalizer coefficients and used by the ZF equalizer for all subcarriers
by time averaging at each signal subcarrier of the amplitude and phase of the
reference and data symbols. The time-averaging length is 1 slot. This process
creates an average amplitude and phase for each signal subcarrier used by the
ZF equalizer. The knowledge of data modulation symbols may be required in this
step because the determination of symbols by demodulation is not reliable
before signal equalization.
\- In the case of PRACH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate the TX chain
coefficients and used for phase and amplitude correction and are seleted so as
to minimize the resulting EVM. The TX chain coefficients are not dependent on
frequency, i.e. and . The TX chain coefficient are chosen independently for
each preamble transmission and for each .
At this stage estimates of , , and are available. is one of the extremities of
the window , i.e. can be or , where if is odd and if is even. The EVM analyser
shall then
\- calculate EVM~l~ with set to ,
\- calculate EVM~h~ with set to .
# F.5 Window length
## F.5.1 Timing offset
As a result of using a cyclic prefix, there is a range of, which, at least in
the case of perfect Tx signal quality, would give close to minimum error
vector magnitude. As a first order approximation, that range should be equal
to the length of the cyclic prefix. Any time domain windowing or FIR pulse
shaping applied by the transmitter reduces the range within which the error
vector is close to its minimum.
## F.5.2 Window length
The window length _W_ affects the measured EVM and is expressed as a function
of the configured cyclic prefix length. In the case where equalization is
present, as with frequency domain EVM computation, the effect of FIR is
reduced. This is because the equalization can correct most of the linear
distortion introduced by the FIR. However, the time domain windowing effect
can\'t be removed.

# F.6 Averaged EVM
The general EVM is averaged over basic EVM measurements for n slots in the
time domain.
,
where n is
for PUCCH, PUSCH.
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus is calculated using in the expressions above and is calculated using .
Thus we get:
_The calculation of the EVM for the demodulation reference signal,_ , follows
the same procedure as calculating the general EVM, with the exception that the
modulation symbol set defined in clause F.2 is restricted to symbols
containing uplink demodulation reference signals.
The basic measurements are first averaged over n slots in the time domain to
obtain an intermediate average .
In the determination of each {width="0.7520833333333333in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, the timing is set to if , and it is set to
otherwise, where and are the general average EVM values calculated in the same
n slots over which the intermediate average is calculated. Note that in some
cases, the general average EVM may be calculated only for the purpose of
timing selection for the _demodulation reference signal EVM_.
Then the results are further averaged to get the _EVM for the demodulation
reference signal,_ ,
The PRACH EVM, , is averaged over 2 preamble sequence measurements for long
preamble formats as defined in table 6.3.3.1-1 in [9] and averaged over 10
preamble sequence measurements for short preamble formats as defined in table
6.3.3.1-2 in [9]..
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window _W_ extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus is calculated using and is calculated using .
Thus we get:
# F.7 Spectrum Flatness
The data shall be taken from FFT coded data symbols and the demodulation
reference symbols of the allocated resource block.
# F.8 Reserved
# F.9 Reserved
# F.10 EVM for dual transmit polarizations
## F.10.1 General
A zero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receiver architecture is used so that transmissions
by the UE, which are received by the test equipment on two polarizations, can
be demodulated by the test equipment receiver.
{width="6.5375in" height="3.248611111111111in"}
Figure F.10.1-1: EVM calculation block diagram for 2-Layer UL MIMO
The TE receives signals from 2 different ports on two antenna polarizations in
the test system.
For UL MIMO measurements a MIMO equalization step as described in section
F.10.2 is performed to separate the layers.
For single layer transmissions received on two polarizations the MIMO
equalization step as described in section F.10.2 is replaced by a maximum
ratio combining step as described in section F.10.3.
Each layer is then processed as described in section F.10.4 to receive the
measurement results for each individual layer.
## F.10.2 MIMO Equalization (UL MIMO transmission)
The MIMO equalization is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without using
any data symbols. For the equalization process all available DMRS symbols
shall be used.
The effective 2x2 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers, e.g. in case of DMRS antenna ports 0 and 2. In case
that same subcarriers are used, e.g. DMRS antenna ports 0 and 1, a channel
decomposition is necessary taking advantage of the orthogonal codes _w~f~_ and
_w~t~_ and assuming identical channel coefficients for adjacent subcarriers of
same CDM group.
Effective channel including the precoding matrix _P_ is:
$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix} {\widetilde{h}}_{0,0} &
{\widetilde{h}}_{0,1} \ {\widetilde{h}}_{1,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{1,1} \
\end{bmatrix}$$
with
$${\widetilde{h}}_{n,\nu} = \frac{y_{n}r_{\nu}^{*}}{{|r_{\nu}|}^{2}}$$
where _y_ denotes the received symbol on port index _n_ and _r_ the reference
signal for layer index _ν_.
Since reference signals of a specific layer are transmitted only on
subcarriers of one CDM group channel, interpolation is needed in order to
obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done
using the channel coefficients of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.
The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients are
obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing the moving
average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving average window size
is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of allocation the window size is
reduced accordingly.
The ZF equalizer coefficients are calculated as the inverse of the effective
channel matrix, in general:
$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{- 1}$
## F.10.3 Maximum Ratio combining (Tx diversity transmission)
The maximum ratio combining is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without
using any data symbols. For the equalization process all available DMRS
symbols shall be used.
The effective 2x1 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers. In case of transmit diversity, the effective channel
includes the precoding matrix _P_ :
$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix} {\widetilde{h}}_{0} \
{\widetilde{h}}_{1} \ \end{bmatrix}$$
with
$${\widetilde{h}}_{n} = \frac{y_{n}r^{*}}{{|r|}^{2}}$$
where _y_ denotes the received symbol on port index _n_ and _r_ the reference
signal.
Since reference signals are transmitted only on subcarriers of one CDM group,
channel interpolation is needed in order to obtain channel coefficients for
all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done using the channel coefficients
of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.
The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients are
obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing the moving
average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving average window size
is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of allocation the window size is
reduced accordingly.
The ZF equalizer coefficients for maximum ratio combining are calculated as
pseudo inverse of effective channel, in general:
$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{+} = {({\widetilde{H}}^{H}\widetilde{H})}^{-
1}{\widetilde{H}}^{H}$
## F.10.4 Layer processing
After performing either the MIMO equalization or maximum ratio combining as
described in section F.10.2 or F.10.3 respectively, each layer is processed
using the existing procedure as defined in Annex E of TS 38.521-2 [5].
Since the channel estimation is calculated only on the DMRS symbols, an
averaging including all 14 symbols of one slot, i.e. data and reference
signals, is needed in order to minimize EVM. The averaging is achieved by the
least square (LS) equalization method described for single layer in Annex E.3.
of TS 38.521-2 [5].
_MS(f,t)_ and _NS(f,t)_ are processed with a LS estimator, to derive one
equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated subcarrier. _EC(f)_ is
defined for each layer as:
$\text{EC}_{\nu}(f) = \frac{\sum_{t =
0}^{13}{\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)^{_}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}{\sum_{t =
0}^{13}{MS_{\nu}(f,t)^{_}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}$
With * denoting complex conjugation. _EC(f)_ are used to equalize layer data
symbols.
EVM equalizer spectral flatness is derived from equalizer coefficients for
each layer as follows:
$c_{\nu} = \left| \text{EC}_{\nu}(f) \right|\ \sqrt{\left| g_{\nu,0}
\right|^{2} + \left| g_{\nu,1} \right|^{2}}$
###### ## Annex G (normative): Difference of relative phase and power errors
# G.0 General
This annex gives further information needed for understanding and implementing
6.4D.4. The following terms should be understood as follows:
Relative phase error: refers to the phase difference between signals at
different antenna ports, which should be ideally 0. It should be understood as
for a slot i.e. (slot) relative phase. It is calculated based on DMRS symbols
of that slot or on SRS symbols.
Difference of relative phase error: refers to the difference between the
relative phase error determined per slot and the relative phase error
determined based on the SRS transmitted.
# G.1 Measurement Point
Figure G.1-1 shows the measurement point for the difference of relative phase
and power errors. To separate signals from the two transmitters, it is
necessary for the test equipment to perform joint demodulation by inverting
the 2x2 composite channel ('HGW') resulting from DUT precoding 'W' and antenna
virtualization 'G' and OTA channel between DUT and test equipment 'H'. Post
processing refers to the calculation of the phase/power errors, the averaging
of phase and power errors per RB per slot per channel port and the calculation
of difference between relative phases.

Figure G.1-1 - Measurement point for difference of relative phase/power error
for UL coherent MIMO
# G.2 Relative Phase Error Measurement
Here are listed the different aspects that may lead to different
interpretations.
## G.2.1 Symbols and subcarriers used
Phase error is determined based on DMRS REs (DMRS mapping type A with 3 DMRS
symbols per slot, the REs corresponding to the odd subcarriers and DMRS
symbols are non-allocated for data or DMRS) and SRS REs (with 4 SRS symbols in
the SRS slot, same SRS resource mapping is used for non-codebook-based and
codebook-based precoding).
For the DMRS and SRS to occupy identical SCs and maximimize their frequency
density, DMRS configuration type 1 and SRS comb2 configuration are used.
UL RMC described in Annex A.2 is used.
## G.2.2 CFO (carrier frequency offset) correction
The TE performs a CFO correction on a slot-by-slot basis using a common
frequency correction at the two uplink layers.
## G.2.3 Steps of the measurement method
Below are detailed the steps necessary to obtain the maximum difference of
relative phase error during the 20ms time window.
1 Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna port, the SRS relative
phase error based on the last SRS transmitted on Ant1 and Ant2, that relative
phase error serves as a reference for the calculation of the difference of
relative phase error for each slot inside the 20 ms time window.
The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted: $\left\lbrack 1 \times number_ of_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.
2 Calculation for the last SRS transmitted, for each RB of the SRS relative
phase errors based on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier SRS relative phase
errors determined in previous step.
The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted: $\left\lbrack 1 \times number_ of_ RBs \right\rbrack$.
3 CFO correction on slot-by-slot basis using a common frequency correction for
both antenna ports.
4 Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna port, the phase over
the slot being analyzed. The phase is extracted from the channel estimate
derived from the 3 DMRS symbols of the slot using the LSE technique.
The output is one vector of dimension $\left\lbrack 1 \times number_ of_
subcarriers \right\rbrack$ for each antenna port.
5 Calculation for a slot for each subcarrier of the relative phase error
(difference between the vectors determined in the previous step).
The output is subcarrier relative phase errors of a slot: $\left\lbrack 1
\times number_ of_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.
6 Calculation for a slot, for each RB of the relative phase errors based on
the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier relative phase errors determined in
previous step.
The output is a "slot relative phase error" vector for a slot:$\ \left\lbrack
1 \times number_ of_ RBs \right\rbrack$.
7 Calculation for a slot of the difference of relative phase errors based on
the "SRS relative phase error" (reference) determined in step 2 and the "slot
relative phase error" determined in previous step.
The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector for a slot:$\
\left\lbrack 1 \times number_ of_ RBs \right\rbrack$.
8 Calculation for a slot of the arithmetic mean value of the "difference of
relative phase error" vector determined in previous step, this value
corresponds to an RB.
The output is a "difference of relative phase error" value for a slot:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack.$
9 Perform for each slot of the 20ms time window, steps 3 to 8.
The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector: $\left\lbrack 1
\times number_ of_ slots \right\rbrack$.
10 Calculation of the maximum value of the "difference of relative phase
error".
The output is the "difference of relative phase error" that should be verified
as complying with the 40° maximum allowable difference of relative phase error
requirement: $\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack$.

Figure J.1-2: DUT default alignment to coordinate system
The following aspects are necessary:
\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed in
order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the test, e.g.,
in the drawings used in this annex, the three buttons are on the bottom of the
device (front) and the camera is on the top of the device (back).
\- An understanding of the origin and alignment the coordinate system inside
the test system i.e. the directions in which the x, y, z -axes points inside
the test chamber is needed in order to define unambiguous DUT orientation, DUT
beam, signal, interference, and measurement angles
# J.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
Tables J.2-1 through J.2-3 below provides the test conditions and angle
definitions for three permitted device alignment for the default test
condition, DUT orientation 1, and two different options for each permitted
device alignment to re-position the device for DUT Orientation 2 as outlined
by figures in Tables J.2-1 through J.2-3.

For each UE requirement and test case, each of the parameters in Table J.2-1
through J.2-3 need to be recorded, such that DUT positioning, DUT beam
direction, and angles of the signal, link/interferer, and measurement are
specified in terms of the fixed coordinate system.
Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations, the order of rotations is
important and needs to be defined when multiple DUT orientations are tested.
The rotations around the x, y, and z axes can be defined with the following
rotation matrices
{width="2.192361111111111in" height="1.0in"}
{width="2.2243055555555555in" height="1.0in"}
and
{width="2.122916666666667in" height="1.0in"}.
with the respective angles of rotation, _α_ ,  _β_ ,  _γ,_ and
{width="0.8875in" height="1.0in"}
Additionally, any translation of the DUT can be defined with the translation
matrix
{width="1.8770833333333334in" height="1.0in"}
with offsets t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively and with
{width="0.8770833333333333in" height="1.0in"}
The combination of rotations and translation is captured by the multiplication
of rotation and translation matrices.
For instance, the matrix M
$$M = T\left( t_{x},t_{y},t_{z} \right) \cdot R_{z}\left( \gamma \right) \cdot
R_{y}\left( \beta \right) \cdot R_{x}\left( \alpha \right)$$
describes an initial rotation of the DUT around the x axis with angle * α _, a
subsequent rotation around the y axis with angle_ β _, and a final rotation
around the z axis with angle_ γ*. After those rotations, the DUT is translated
by t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively.
# J.3 DUT positioning guidelines
The centre of the reference coordinate system shall be aligned with the
geometric centre of the DUT in order to minimize the offset between antenna
arrays integrated at any position of the UE and the centre of the quiet zone.
Near-field coupling effects between the antenna and the
pedestals/positioners/fixtures generally cause increased signal ripples. Re-
positioning the DUT by directing the beam peak away from those areas can
reduce the effect of signal ripple on EIRP/EIS measurements. Figure J.3-1 and
J.3-2 illustrate how to reposition the DUT in distributed axes and combined
axes system, when the beam peak is directed to the DUTs upper hemisphere (DUT
orientation 1) or the DUTs lower hemisphere (DUT orientation 2). While these
figures are examples of different positioning systems and other
implementations are not precluded, the relative orientation of the coordinate
system with respect to the antennas/reflectors and the axes of rotation shall
apply to any measurement setup.

Figure J.3-2: DUT re-positioning for an example of combined-axes system
For EIRP/EIS measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure the pedestal is
not obstructing the beam path and that the pedestal is not in closer proximity
to the measurement antenna/reflector than the DUT. For TRP measurements, re-
positioning the DUT makes sure that the beam peak direction is not obstructed
by the pedestal and the pedestal is in the measurement path only when
measuring the back-hemisphere. No re-positioning during the TRP measurement is
required.
