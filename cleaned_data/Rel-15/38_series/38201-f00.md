# 4 General description of layer 1
## 4.1 Relation to other layers
### 4.1.1 General protocol architecture
The radio interface described in this specification covers the interface
between the User Equipment (UE) and the network. The radio interface is
composed of the Layer 1, 2 and 3. The TS 38.200 series describes the Layer 1
(Physical Layer) specifications. Layers 2 and 3 are described in the 38.300
series.

Figure 1: Radio interface protocol architecture around the physical layer
Figure 1 shows the NR radio interface protocol architecture around the
physical layer (Layer 1). The physical layer interfaces the Medium Access
Control (MAC) sub-layer of Layer 2 and the Radio Resource Control (RRC) Layer
of Layer 3. The circles between different layer/sub-layers indicate Service
Access Points (SAPs). The physical layer offers a transport channel to MAC.
The transport channel is characterized by how the information is transferred
over the radio interface. MAC offers different logical channels to the Radio
Link Control (RLC) sub-layer of Layer 2. A logical channel is characterized by
the type of information transferred.
### 4.1.2 Service provided to higher layers
The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The access
to these services is through the use of a transport channel via the MAC sub-
layer. Details are specified in [2].
## 4.2 General description of layer 1
### 4.2.1 Multiple access
The multiple access scheme for the NR physical layer is based on Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP). For uplink,
Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) with a CP is also
supported. To support transmission in paired and unpaired spectrum, both
Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) are enabled.
The Layer 1 is defined in a bandwidth agnostic way based on resource blocks,
allowing the NR Layer 1 to adapt to various spectrum allocations. A resource
block spans 12 sub-carriers with a given sub-carrier spacing.
The radio frame has a duration of 10ms and consists of 10 sub-frames with a
sub-frame duration of 1ms. A sub-frame is formed by one or multiple adjacent
slots, each having 14 adjacent symbols. Further details on the frame structure
are specified in [2].
### 4.2.2 Physical channels and modulation
The physical channels defined in the downlink are:
\- the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH),
\- the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH),
\- the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH),
The physical channels defined in the uplink are:
\- the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH),
\- the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH),
\- and the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH).
In addition, signals are defined as reference signals, primary and secondary
synchronization signals.
The modulation schemes supported are
\- in the downlink, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM,
\- in the uplink, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM for OFDM with a CP and
Ï€/2-BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM for DFT-s-OFDM with a CP
### 4.2.3 Channel coding
The channel coding scheme for transport blocks is quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with
2 base graphs and 8 sets of parity check matrices for each base graph,
respectively. One base graph is used for code blocks larger than certain sizes
or with initial transmission code rate higher than thresholds; otherwise, the
other base graph is used. Before the LDPC coding, for large transport blocks,
the transport block is segmented into multiple code blocks with equal size.
The channel coding scheme for PBCH and control information is Polar coding
based on nested sequences. Puncturing, shortening and repetition are used for
rate matching. Further details of channel coding schemes are specified in [4].
### 4.2.4 Physical layer procedures
There are several Physical layer procedures involved. Such procedures covered
by the physical layer are;
\- Cell search
\- Power control
\- Uplink synchronisation and Uplink timing control
\- Random access related procedures
\- HARQ related procedures
\- Beam management and CSI related procedures
Through the control of physical layer resources in the frequency domain as
well as in the time and power domains, implicit support of interference
coordination is provided in NR.
### 4.2.5 Physical layer measurements
Radio characteristics are measured by the UE and the network and reported to
higher layers. These include, e.g. measurements for intra- and inter-frequency
handover, inter RAT handover, timing measurements, and measurements for RRM.
Measurements for inter-RAT handover are defined in support of handover to
E-UTRA.
