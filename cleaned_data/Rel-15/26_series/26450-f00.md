# 4 General
## 4.1 Background
The present document specifies the system level aspects of the Discontinuous
Transmission (DTX) function of the EVS codec. Specific codec functions that
implement the DTX functionality are described in TS 26.445 [2].
Discontinuous transmission (DTX) is a mechanism for the EVS Codec to encode
the input signal at a lower average rate by taking speech inactivity into
account. The DTX scheme is useful for the following purposes:
\- to conserve UE power,
\- to improve network capacity.
DTX in the transmitting path (uplink) shall be in operation in UEs if
commanded so by the network. The UE shall handle DTX in the receiving path
(downlink) at any time, regardless of whether DTX in the transmitting path is
commanded or not.
## 4.2 General organization
The default DTX mechanism described in the present document requires the
following functions:
\- a Signal Activity Detector (SAD) on the transmit (TX) side;
\- evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the transmit (TX) side in
order to transmit characteristic parameters to the receive (RX) side;
\- generation, on the receive (RX) side, of a similar noise called comfort
noise during periods where the transmission is switched off.
The Signal Activity Detector (SAD) is defined in TS 26.451 [11] and the
comfort noise functions in TS 26.449 [9]. Both are based partly on the EVS
Codec and its internal variables defined in TS 26.445 [2].
In addition to these functions, if the parameters arriving at the RX side are
detected to be seriously corrupted by errors, the speech or comfort noise
shall be generated from substituted data in order to avoid seriously annoying
effects for the listener. These functions are defined in TS 26.447 [7].
An overall description of the speech processing parts can be found in TS
26.441 [10]. An overview of the DTX operation is shown in Figure 1.

# 5 EVS Codec DTX Operation
## 5.1 Transmit (TX) side
There are two algorithms for extending the DTX hangover period. One is a
general hangover algorithm and other is specific to music. Both are defined in
clause 5.1.12.5 of TS 26.445 [2].
The main specification of the DTX/CNG algorithms is contained in clause 5.6 of
TS 26.445 [2].
The bit allocation of SID frames generated for DTX operation is defined in
clause 7.2 of TS 26.445 [2].
## 5.2 Receive (RX) side
Operation of the EVS decoder, including decoding of SID frames generated
during DTX operation is described in clause 6.7 of TS 26.445 [2].
