# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in

**Application:** an interactive service authored using the set of languages
defined by the present document.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [6] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if
any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [6].

# 4 Required Mark-up Support
## 4.1 Introduction
The present document defines a 3GPP HTML5 profile for use in 3GPP services,
such as PSS [2], MBMS [3] and MMS [5]. In this clause, the set of required
mark-up and APIs for the 3GPP HTML5 profile is defined.
The present document defines requirements and recommendations for Applications
and UEs conforming to the 3GPP HTML5 Profile.
## 4.2 Markup
The HTML5 [1] specification defines conformance requirements for user-agents
and documents:
\- Applications shall comply with conformance requirements for documents in
[1].
\- UEs shall comply with conformance requirements for user agents as defined
in [1].
## 4.3 Style
### 4.3.1 Introduction
Support for CSS as a whole is not required by HTML5, even though some features
are defined in terms of specific CSS requirements. This clause defines
requirements for CSS and other style and/or graphic related technologies.
### 4.3.2 Basic Graphic
\- UEs shall support CSS 2.1 [9].
\- UEs shall support CSS Color Module Level 3 [12].
\- UEs shall support CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 3
[15].
\- UEs shall support CSS Backgrounds and Borders [16].
\- UEs should support CSS Basic User Interface [14].
### 4.3.3 Device Adaptation, Layout and Processing
\- UEs should support CSS Media Queries [17].
\- UEs should support CSS Flexible Box Layout [19].
### 4.3.4 Advanced Graphic
\- UEs shall support the CSS Transforms [10].
\- UEs shall support CSS Transitions [11].
\- UEs shall support CSS Animations [18].
## 4.4 Scripting
Scripts are small programs that can be embedded into applications. While
defining features that rely on scripting, HTML5 does not mandate support for
scripting for all user-agents. Furthermore, scripting is defined using a
syntax that in most cases is independent from the underlying scripting
language. For such reasons, the present document has additional requirements
as defined in this clause.
\- UEs shall support scripting as defined in [1].
\- UEs shall support ECMA scripting language [13].
# 5 API Support
A number of specifications from W3C or other organizations define APIs that
provide additional functionalities to applications. This clause lists the
specifications that SHALL and SHOULD be supported by a UE.
\- UEs shall support the Forms API [1].
\- UEs shall support the Canvas API [22].
\- UEs shall support the XMLHttpRequest API [23].
\- UEs shall support the Media Source Extensions [24].
\- UEs shall support the ISO BMFF Byte Stream Format [25] with the MIME type
and subtypes audio/mp4 and video/mp4.
\- UEs should support the GeoLocation API [21].
\- UEs should support the Encrypted Media Extensions [26].
\- UEs should support the Web Socket API [8] with the protocol defined in RFC
6455 [28].
\- UEs should support the Server-Sent Events API [7].
\- UEs should support the WebCrypto API [27].
# 6 Service-Specific Aspects
## 6.1 Introduction
Additional requirements and usage restrictions are necessary depending on the
service type that uses the 3GPP HTML5 profile. In this clause, these aspects
are addressed.
## 6.2 DASH
When an HTML5 presentation uses DASH [4] for media streaming, then the HTML5
presentation may reference one or more DASH presentations through a reference
to the MPD either as a source of an HTML5 media element or as a reference from
one of the referenced resources.
The user agent should support DASH MPD as a supported MIME type for its source
elements and attributes, in which case the DASH playback is done by the user
agent.
