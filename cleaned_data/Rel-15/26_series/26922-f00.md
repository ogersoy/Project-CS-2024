# 4 Background
The present document reports the study on video telephony robustness
improvements extensions in Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS and provides
recommendation on their applicability for MTSI video telephony applications.
These extensions target error robustness for higher bitrate MTSI video
telephony as well as inter-working with WLAN use cases where error resiliency
is more important. In order to be technically competitive, e.g. to some
proprietary systems, MTSI should have the capability to employ mechanisms that
can offer different trade-offs between rendering delay, video rendering jitter
(smoothness) and video quality that can adapt to varying channel conditions
for better user experience. Retransmission, Forward Error Correction (FEC),
and complementary reference picture selection indication (RPSI) AVPF feedback
mechanisms offer these trade-offs. The present document first provides an
overview of the additional error resiliency (ER) tools that could improve the
performance of the Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS (TS 26.114 [3]). Then
test conditions representative of error conditions experienced in IMS Video
Telephony are presented. Following the description of the test conditions,
evaluation criteria for determining the benefits of proposed tools and
mechanisms is presented. Performance of the proposed ER tools is evaluated
under the defined testing conditions that take into account packet loss
rate/pattern, end to end delay, bitrate overhead and video smoothness (dropped
frames, rendering jitter). Based on the performance results, conclusions are
made in terms of recommendations for support of proposed ER tools and
mechanisms for Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS.
# 5 Overview of video robustness improvements extensions (VTRI_EXT) tools
## 5.1 Introduction
Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS (MTSI 3GPP TS 26.114 [3]) defines MTSI
clients\' sender and receiver behaviour utilizing IETF RFC 4585 [7] AVPF
Generic NACK and Picture Loss Indication (PLI) feedback messages for ER.
Current error correction scheme provides basic error correction through codec
level error resiliency (ER) mechanisms. Transport and application level error
resiliency schemes such as Retransmission (NACK), Forward Error Correction
(FEC) along with advanced codec level ER schemes such as Reference Picture
Selection (RPS) provide alternative error correction mechanisms that offer
different performance trade-offs. The performance of error correction schemes
varies with end-to-end delay, channel bandwidth and packet loss rate.
## 5.2 Retransmission
Retransmission (NACK) scheme [4] provides efficient error correction in terms
of bandwidth under short round-trip-time (RTT) cases with low packet loss
rates. The efficiency of retransmission scheme becomes more pronounced at
higher bitrates since selective retransmission of lost packets instead of
entire pictures are needed. Under low RTT scenarios it can provide low video
rendering jitter dependent on the de-jittering mechanism at the cost of
additional delay. If additional delay cannot be accommodated, then
retransmission can still provide recovery from error with video freezes during
recovery similar to the existing error resiliency scheme in TS 26.114.
## 5.3 Forward error correction
Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes [5] and [6] provide a mechanism that
balances video quality and end-to-end delay. FEC schemes can adapt to varying
channel error conditions. FEC is suitable for high RTT channels with high
packet loss rates where retransmission leads to high video rendering delay and
codec based recovery mechanisms like RPSI, PLI lead to frequent video freezes
and/or corruptions. FEC schemes are complemented by retransmission (NACK) or
RPSI, PLI feedback mechanisms to address FEC failure cases.
## 5.4 Reference picture selection
Reference picture selection indication (RPSI) feedback message in AVPF [7]
that is currently not supported in TS 26.114 offers establishment of common
reference point for recovery between the sender and the receiver. In essence
it provides codec level ER mechanism similar to the transport layer ER
mechanism supported by the generic NACK message in TS 26.114.
# 6 Test cases and conditions
## 6.1 QoS requirements for conversational video services
Specification TS 22.105 [2] defines the range of QoS requirements and end user
QoS requirements for conversational video services. According to TS 22.105,
the following requirements should be supported.

QoS test conditions used to evaluate the proposed tools should follow the
service requirements described in TS 22.105. In addition to QoS networks, test
conditions addressing interworking with non-QoS networks should be considered
for the following reasons:
\- Interworking with non-QoS networks is a relevant deployment use case and
may result in losses in the non-managed part of the delivery.
\- Despite QoS, there may be circumstances for which the QoS guarantees fail
and service continuity is relevant.
## 6.2 Channel conditions
Channels conditions from QoS LTE, best effort over the top (OTT) LTE and WiFi
channels are logged from video telephony calls for video configurations
defined in clause 6.4. Packet captures are conducted on video telephony (VT)
calls under mobile and stationary test conditions. Sending and receiving
rates, delay (RTT/2), packet loss patterns are derived from captures sending
and receiving times, timestamps and sequence numbers. The sources of the
packet losses are from the physical channel as well as congestion. During the
channel capturing process, the operating rate of the VT calls targeted rates
below the available bandwidth for avoiding congestion. It is not always
possible to avoid congestion during the capturing process. Logs exhibiting
frequent large variations in rate due to congestion are filtered out.
Packet losses are characterized by the burst patterns. A packet _loss-free_
burst of order _k~0~_ is observed in the loss pattern when at least _k~0~_
consecutive packets are correctly received. A packet loss burst order _k~0~_
starts and finishes with a missing packet (\"1\") and is composed of at most
_k~0~ -_ 1 consecutive received packets [11]. In the analysis presented in the
present document, _k~0~ =_ 1 is used for simplicity. Sequences of _m_ (total
number of logged packets) loss indicators are divided into _p_ alternating
loss-free burst (_X~j~_) and packet loss bursts (_Y~j~_). Average packet loss
rate _PLR~avg~_ , average loss free duration _X~avg~_ and average loss
duration _Y~avg~_ are computed as:
$\text{PLR}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\sum_{j = 0}^{p - 1}Y_{j}}{\sum_{j = 0}^{p -
1}{(X_{j} + Y_{j})}}$, (6.2-1)
$X_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{j = 0}^{p - 1}X_{j}$, (6.2-2)
$Y_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{j = 0}^{p - 1}Y_{j}$. (6.2-3)
## 6.3 Error profiles
### 6.3.1 Introduction
Error profiles representing guaranteed QoS and best effort (non-QoS) cases are
used for evaluation. A number of real channel capture logs from QoS and non-
QoS services are provided for emulation of channel conditions and/or
derivation of channel models for simulation of channel conditions. Captured
channel logs are used in the simulations of channel conditions for evaluation
of proposed error resiliency tools.
### 6.3.2 QoS LTE
IMS-VT QoS calls conducted under low speed mobile conditions covering near
cell and edge cell conditions were logged for analysis. QVGA (320x240), 15
fps, 350 kbps (maximum bitrate) H.264 video is used during the IMS-VT call. 17
MO to MT and 17 MT to MO logs selected from \~100 short duration calls (less
than 1 minute) are used. In Table 6.3-1, MO to MT (IMS-QoS Test1) and likewise
MT to MO (IMS-QoS Test2) call statistics are consolidated into one due to
short duration of the calls. Packet loss statistics are tabulated in Table
6.3-1. Clause A.1 provides packet loss patterns for the consolidated logs.
### 6.3.3 LTE-OTT
Video telephony calls over LTE-OTT were conducted under driving conditions.
One of the UEs is positioned in a stationary office environment with good LTE
signal and the other UE in a moving vehicle. VGA (640x480) 30 fps 600 kbps
(VT-LTE OTT Test1 & Test2) and QVGA 15 fps 300 kbps (VT-LTE OTT Test3 & Test4)
videos were used for collecting channel logs. Packet loss statistics are
tabulated in Table 6.3-1. Clause A.2 provides packet loss patterns for LTE-OTT
tests.
### 6.3.4 WiFi
Video telephony calls over WiFi are conducted in office environment.
Stationary office to office call and office to walking UE calls are logged.
720p (1 280x720) 30 fps 1 000 kbps video is used for collecting channel logs.
Total of 8 logs (VT-Wifi Test1-8) are collected. Packet loss statistics are
tabulated in Table 6.3-1. Clause A.3 provides packet loss patterns for WiFi
tests.

## 6.4 Test Content
For evaluation of ER tools, the two main factors that have impact on the
overall performance is the video bitrate and the frame rate. It is assumed
that the video is coded in low delay configuration, i.e. IPPPPP... or
IBBBB.... configuration. The video resolution, content, and codec type (AVC,
HEVC) have minimal impact since as described in clause 7, the corrupted
pictures will be considered as non-rendered pictures. The following video
resolutions, bitrate and frame rates are used during the evaluation process.

# 7 Evaluation criteria
## 7.1 Testing configuration
In order to simplify the evaluation process, it will be assumed that corrupted
video frames will not be rendered. When an error occurs, corrective action
based on retransmission, RPSI or FEC will be taken. These proposed tools can
be used alone or in combination. For example FEC and RPSI or FEC and NACK can
be used in combination to complement each other (i.e. when FEC fails, NACK or
RPSI can achieve recovery).
Video bitstreams are packetized into maximum packet length of 1 400 bytes.
Packetization byte overhead is ignored. Packet loss patterns are applied only
in one direction according to the error profiles defined in clause 6.3, i.e.
feedback channel is assumed to be error free. Sender and receiver side
processing (encoding/decoding + various other tasks) times are ignored. Frames
are generated at uniform time interval according to the frame rate.
Transmission delay of packets in each direction is equal to RTT/2. Frames are
packetized and sent as soon as they are encoded (i.e. at frame timestamps) at
the sender, and removed from the packet de-jitter buffer as soon as complete
frame data is available.
Decoding delay (_delay~D~_) is computed as the difference between the time of
removal from the de-jitter buffer for decoding and the capture timestamp (RTP
timestamp). End-to-end rendering delay (_delay~e2e~_) is determined as:
$\text{delay}_{e2e} = \text{avg}_{\text{delay}_{D}} + 3 \times
\text{std}_{\text{delay}_{D}}$, (7.1-1)
where, _avg_delay~D~_ is the average decoding delay and _std_delay~D~_ is
standard deviation of decoding delay. This is to accommodate variation in
arrival time of frames that can be rendered due retransmission. Frames that
are late by more than _delay~e2e~_ are not rendered. A hard limit of 400 ms is
also imposed according to requirements of TS 22.105. Only perfectly
reconstructed frames are rendered.
Every lost packet is reported to the sender side. For RPSI based recovery, it
is assumed that the recovery frame size is same as the frame size in the
bitstream that occurs at the recovery point and it generates an identical
picture to the picture occurring at the recovery point. This simplified
assumption is necessary for simplifying the simulations. It has negligible
effect on the simulation results (without this assumption, the recovery frame
size will be larger than the frame size occurring at the recovery point). For
NACK based recovery, missing packets are retransmitted. For FEC based recovery
an adaptive perfect FEC scheme (Reed Solomon) targeting 0,95 minimum recovery
probability for maximum loss rate occurring during the 10 second history
window is used. There is no interleaving of packets used and FEC packets do
not cross frame boundaries, i.e. FEC packets protect source data that belongs
to one frame. FEC overhead rate can be adjusted according to RTT time to
minimize frequency of freezes when RTT is large. In the simulation
environment, this method was not used.
## 7.2 Performance metrics
Assuming that there will be no corrupted pictures will be rendered, then the
parameters that affect the perceived video quality are:
1\. Bitrate overhead
2\. End-to-end rendering delay
3\. Number of frames not rendered
4\. Rendering smoothness measure (standard deviation of rendering time from
the target rendering time), i.e.
$\text{std}_{\text{renderdelta}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N - 1}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\left(
\Delta_{n} - \Delta_{\text{avg}} \right)^{2}}$. (7.2-1)
$\Delta_{n}$\'s are the time intervals between consecutively rendered frames
and $\Delta_{\text{avg}}$is the average of $\Delta_{n}$ for _N_ frames [12].
In terms of bitrate overhead, FEC and retransmission are the tools that have
bitrate overhead impact, FEC being the one that may have significant overhead.
Given a limited channel bandwidth, full channel utilization, bitrate overhead
impacts spatial video quality. The final effect of the overhead is the
reduction of effective video source rate. Although it is content dependent,
generally, bitrate reductions of 15% or more are perceivable. Bitrate overhead
is measured with respect to the video source rate.
End-to-end rendering delay for video, which impacts audio delay, is critical
for conversational services. The upper limit for tolerable delay is 400 ms.
Delays of 150 ms or below are not noticeable. During a call end-to-end delay
may vary. Among the proposed tools, retransmission is the only tool that may
have impact on the end-to-end delay.
Number frames not rendered convey information on the temporal video quality. A
frame will not be rendered if it has a packet that is missing or it is
dependent on past frames that had missing packets. It is related to ER failure
rate for frames. In general the higher it is, the worse the perceived video
quality is. However the distribution of non-rendered frames also impact the
visual quality. In [8], [9] and [10], it is reported that the frequent short
video freezes result in lower MOS scores than long infrequent video freezes.
Rendering smoothness measure in combination with number of not rendered frames
conveys distribution information of video freezes. These two metrics are
applicable to all proposed ER tools.
During the testing process, audio-video (AV) synchronization is assumed to be
preserved, i.e. long term delay in video forces audio to be delayed. End to
end delay in evaluation setup remains within the bounds specified in TS
22.105.
# 8 Results
## 8.1 Test cases
The performance of proposed tools under channel conditions defined in clause
6.3 are evaluated according to metrics defined for video quality in clause
7.2. Video test content defined in clause 6.4 is generated offline using an
H.264 encoder. A test setup that simulates channel conditions according to
conditions defined in clause 6.3 as well as error resiliency behavior of the
proposed tools is used. Evaluations of the proposed tools are conducted under
different round-trip-time (RTT) conditions with the captured channel logs.
Captured channel logs are used for simulating packet losses under RTT of (100
ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 400 ms). The proposed metrics defined in clause 7.2 are
logged to characterize behavior of each tool. Each tool is tested individually
and in combination with other tools. The following test cases are run:

## 8.6 Summary
Results in the previous clauses illustrates the behaviour of each tool under
different channel conditions. As a reference the performance of RPSI tool can
be taken since the behaviour of RPSI tool by itself is equivalent to the error
resilience behaviour in TS 26.114 that utilizes PLI and generic NACK messages.
The weakness of this tool is that for every loss point there is a freeze (not
rendered frames) of at least RTT duration. As RTT increases and PLR increases,
the amount of non-rendered frames increases. This can be observed in VT-Wifi
Test4 and Test8 where there is around 5% packet loss. As RTT increases from
100 ms to 400 ms, the percentage of rendered frames decreases from 79 - 85% to
63 - 75%. Since no retransmission is involved in this mechanism end to end
delay is preserved. The main strength of this tool is its efficient handling
of large burst losses that cannot be handled efficiently with other mechanisms
such as FEC and retransmission.
FEC can handle random losses and short burst losses in a way that RPSI,
retransmission cannot handle by introducing bitrate overhead. This becomes
more important as RTT and loss rate increases. By trading of spatial video
quality to temporal smoothness (i.e. less freezes) it can provide a very
robust way of handling errors. For the VT-Wifi Test4 and Test8 cases it can
provide rendered frame percentage of 93% and \~84% for RTT of 100 ms and 400
ms, respectively. FEC overhead can be modulated adaptively to adapt to the
channel conditions, i.e. loss rate and RTT.
Retransmission is an efficient recovery tool for low loss rates and low RTT.
Under these circumstances it can provide the most efficient recovery and
maintain smooth rendering without introducing high delay. This can be seen in
less than 1% packet loss cases with low RTT like 100 ms. In the higher RTT
cases, the end to end delay increases but can be kept under 400 ms cut off if
the loss rate is low.
FEC cannot recover all error cases. It needs a backup mechanism to handle the
error cases that cannot be recovered by FEC. This mechanism can be
retransmission, PLI or RPSI. It can also be combined with the current generic
NACK mechanism specified in TS 26.114.
# 9 Conclusions and recommendations
Results in clause 8 show the trade-offs of each proposed tool under various
channel conditions. FEC and selective retransmission offer benefits that
cannot be achieved by the existing ER tools supported in TS 26.114.
\- FEC provides robustness against moderate packet loss rates at high delay
scenario. FEC can especially handle random losses and short burst losses and
be beneficial in environments with high packet loss rates and/or high delay
(RTT). Use of FEC may however not be appropriate when packet losses are caused
by insufficient throughput (over radio access or due to congestions in
network) since it introduces some bit rate overhead. In order to compensate
for bit rate overhead, FEC may require to be used with efficient rate
adaptation mechanisms to reduce the source bit rate according to channel
conditions and not increase the total RTP bitrate. FEC will be used in
combination with other mechanisms to handle the error cases that cannot be
recovered by FEC (like PLI or RPSI or the current generic NACK mechanism
specified in TS 26.114):
\- For low RTT case with relatively high packet loss, using retransmission in
combination with FEC is beneficial since retransmission can efficiently handle
the FEC failure case.
\- For high RTT, relatively high packet loss conditions, using generic NACK
based recovery in combination with FEC is beneficial since generic NACK based
recovery does not introduce additional delay.
\- Selective retransmission offers efficient recovery mechanism under low
delay (RTT) and low failure (loss) rate conditions. Retransmission needs to
ensure that retransmitted packets arrive in time to meet delay requirements of
the end to end system. Higher packet loss rates may cause loss of
retransmitted packets, hence leading to larger end to end delay.
\- Existing generic NACK, PLI or RPSI based error correction mechanism can
provide an efficient recovery for low packet loss rates with high RTT
conditions. Generic NACK message can be used for indication of packets to be
retransmitted as well as informing the sender of loss of particular RTP
packets for sender to take necessary actions to recover from errors. These two
behaviours of the system for generic NACK message should be differentiated by
signalling or some other means. RPSI is a similar mechanism operating at codec
level that offers, in addition, establishment of common reference point for
recovery between the sender and the receiver. If retransmission based ER is
being used, the support for additional RPSI or existing NACK based error
correction mechanism is not essential since the failure cases for
retransmission based scheme would be rare. In that case PLI message can be
used to recover from errors.
FEC and retransmission provides ER mechanisms that are effective under
different channel conditions that can be encountered. These tools are
beneficial under non-QoS environments that are becoming more widely used with
IMS-VT terminals. In order to be competitive with non-IMS based solutions,
these tools should be supported. Although RPSI provides a clean mechanism to
address cases where FEC or retransmission fails, the existing generic NACK
based ER scheme can provide similar functionality. It is recommended that FEC
and retransmission should be supported in TS 26.114. Support for these
proposed tools should be negotiable during a call or at session setup.
NOTE 1: Proper implementation and usage of these different tools (e.g. trade-
off between quality & delay) are still left to the MTSI client implementers
taking into account the above recommendations. This has to be done according
to the service requirements and expected channel conditions that may differ
from the set of test cases and related error profiles defined in section 6 and
used for evaluation purpose. It is recommended to update TS 26.114 to include
the above text relevant for the mechanisms to recover from packet losses
included in TS 26.114 to provide additional information and guidelines on
usage and benefits under various channel conditions of these mechanisms.
