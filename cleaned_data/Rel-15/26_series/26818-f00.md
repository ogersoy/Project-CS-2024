# Introduction
In the context of the 3GPP activity on the definition of Audio media profiles
for Virtual Reality (VR) streaming services, several candidate solutions have
been considered. The submission process of Audio media profiles included
various tests characterizing the solution performances. The present document
presents the detailed test results provided by the solution proponents and the
crosscheck labs. The results were not compiled to any merit figures of the
candidate solutions hence no such merit figures were used in the selection of
the profile. The test results provided in the present document were not
generated to be used in direct comparison.
# 1 Scope
The present document is a collection of test results on candidate audio media
profiles for VR streaming services over 3GPP. A brief description of the 3
tests characterizing the audio media profile performances is presented under
clause 4. The following clauses provide the test results from the audio media
profile proponent as well as those from the crosscheck labs. The four
documented solutions are (in alphabetical order):
\- DTS-UHD
\- Metadata Assisted EVS Codec (MAEC)
\- OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Profile
\- Spatial AAC extension (spAACe)

# 4 VR streaming tests description
## 4.1 Test 1
The Test 1 assesses the Codec Quality Characterization for the audio profiles
submitted in the context of VR streaming services. The Test 1 Codec Quality
Characterization test methodology is defined in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.
This test assesses the _Basic Audio Quality_ attribute at different bit-rates
for a given audio profile.
The audio profile is tested:
\- according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5,
\- using its own _Reference Renderer_ for Reference and Degraded conditions,
\- over loudspeakers,
\- based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] (MUSHRA),
\- evaluating the _Basic Audio Quality_.
With 20 test items as input, Test 1 is split into two tests, Test 1a and Test
1b with 10 test items each.
If not included in the original Test 1a and Test 1b, a third test focused on
First Order Ambisonics (FOA) called Test 1c was provided. This FOA test only
considered the pure HOA source materials that were converted into FOA by
truncation to the 1st order.
## 4.2 Test 2
The Test 2 also assesses the Codec Quality Characterization for the audio
profiles submitted in the context of VR streaming services but, unlike Test 1,
in the binaural environment. The Test 2 Codec Quality Characterization test
methodology is defined in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7. This test also assesses
the _Basic Audio Quality_ attribute at different bit-rates for a given audio
profile.
The audio profile is tested:
\- according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7,
\- using a _Common Informative Binaural Renderer_ (CIBR) for reference and
degraded conditions,
\- over headphones,
\- based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] (MUSHRA),
\- evaluating the _Basic Audio Quality_.
With the same 20 input test items as for Test 1, Test 2 is split into two
tests, Test 2a and Test 2b with the same test items as Test 1a and Test 1b
respectively.
## 4.3 Test 3
The Test 3 assesses the Reference Binaural Renderer Quality Characterization
for the audio profiles submitted in the context of VR streaming services. The
Test 3 Reference Binaural Renderer Quality Characterization test methodology
is defined in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6. This test characterizes the audio
profile performance with _Reference Renderer_ and, optionally but strongly
recommended, the audio profile performance with _Common Informative Binaural
Renderer_.
The audio profile is tested:
\- according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6,
\- over headphones with head tracking,
\- evaluating the following attributes:
\- _Spatial Quality_
\- _Artefacts_
\- _Timbre Quality_
\- _Overall Quality_
Test 3 contains 12 test items. Test 3 is split into two sessions: One
comparing the candidate audio profile with CIBR 1st order, and the other
comparing the candidate audio profile with CIBR 3rd order.
# 5 DTS-UHD tests results
## 5.1 Xperi test results on Test 1
### 5.1.1 Test design
Test 1 has been conducted according to the 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5 using
the MUSHRA test methodology defined in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3].
Two tests were performed: Test 1a and Test 1b. Both tests consisted of ten
tracks and five systems under test (plus the hidden reference and two low-pass
anchors). The same ten post-screened listeners were used, so that the results
from Tests 1a and 1b may be combined for statistical analysis.
The following eight test signals were included in each of the MUSHRA trials:
\- Reference (uncompressed)
\- Content coded at 512 kbps
\- Content coded at 384 kbps
\- Content coded at 256 kbps
\- FOA anchor
\- FOA coded at 128 kbps
\- 7 kHz low-pass anchor (low-passed reference)
\- 3.5 kHz low-pass anchor (low-passed reference)
The FOA conditions have been included in all of the MUSHRA trials since,
including the FOA signals in some of the trials and not others would make the
statistical analysis of the results challenging. It has been suggested to make
the FOA conditions optional for Test 1, but that would amount to not
characterizing the FOA profile performance. There have also been suggestions
to test the FOA conditions separately, but that requires adding one more
separate test. Given the above, it was decided to include the FOA conditions
for all the test materials. This has the added value of assessing how an FOA
profile may perform, should one decide to convert various content types to an
FOA representation.
Since testing 128 kbps FOA without the corresponding equitable uncompressed
FOA signal would not allow assessing the impact of the compression itself, the
uncompressed FOA anchor is included throughout.
For the HOA-only content, the FOA anchor was created by truncating HOA to FOA.
For all the other contents, the FOA anchor was created by rendering the source
material to FOA with the Audio Profile renderer. The compressed FOA bit-
streams have been generated by encoding the FOA anchor with the same Audio
Profile encoder configuration as all the other contents.
### 5.1.2 Test processing
The source material and the corresponding metadata have been encoded with the
Xperi DTS-UHD VRStream Audio Profile encoder/decoder at the target bit-rates
of 256, 384, and 512 kbps, with the FOA content encoded at 128 kbps. The DTS-
UHD codec defined in ETSI TS 103 491 [4] uses a Variable Bit-Rate (VBR) model
that guarantees the target bit-rate when measured over a Group of Frames (GoF,
an interval between two consecutive sync frames). The GoF duration has been
set in these tests to 2 sec; i.e., the codec achieves Constant Bit-Rate for
each consecutive 2 sec audio segments. All the results correspond to the
instantaneous VBR peak rate not exceeding 2.5 times the target bit-rate.
The Xperi VRStream rendering process is based on the CIBR configuration (see
3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6) illustrated on Figure 5.1.1:
{width="3.959722222222222in" height="2.7743055555555554in"}
Figure 5.1.1: VRStream rendering process based on the CIBR configuration
with the following:
\- \"Documented Loudspeaker Renderer\" as described in the DTS VBAP renderer
specification in ETSI TS 103 584 [5].
\- The same ETSI TS 103 584 [5] VBAP renderer used for the ESD domain signal
conversion to the 7.4.1 loudspeaker configuration per Test 1 specification.
The following acronyms are defined to describe the processing of the test
material:
\- SM: source material
\- SM-FOA: source material rendered to the FOA domain
\- BS: compressed bit-stream
\- HOA-ESD: conversions between Ambisonics and ESD
\- ESD16-HOA: conversion from ESD-16 to HOA as described in Annex A
\- HOA-ESD16: inverse of ESD16-HOA
\- ESD4-FOA: conversion from ESD-4 to FOA as described in Annex A
\- FOA-ESD4: inverse of ESD4-FOA
\- R-ESD: rendering to the ESD
\- R-ESD16: rendering to ESD-16
\- For Channels/Objects: ETSI 103 584 specification
\- For HOA: the HOA-ESD16 conversion
\- R-ESD4: rendering to ESD-4
\- For Channels/Objects: ETSI 103 584 specification
\- For FOA: the FOA-ESD4 conversion
\- RX-7.1.4: rendering from ESD to the 7.1.4 loudspeaker output
\- Per ETSI 103 584 specification
With the above, the test material has been generated as follows:
\- Reference (uncompressed): SM â†’ R-ESD16 â†’ RX-7.1.4
\- FOA anchor (SM-FOA, uncompressed): SM â†’ R-ESD4 â†’ ESD4-FOA
\- Non-FOA Test Signals (compressed): BS â†’ Decoder â†’ R-ESD16 â†’ RX-7.1.4
\- FOA Test Signals (compressed): BS â†’ Decoder â†’ R-ESD4 â†’ RX-7.1.4

#### 5.1.7.5 Test 1c
An additional test for FOA has been conducted with the following four HOA
content items: Capoeira, CosmosJungle, DronesAndAnimals, and HOA6_Musicopter
(i.e., the four HOA-only test items in Test 1). The tests have been performed
under the same conditions as Tests 1a and 1b, with the same
uncompressed/compressed FOA test samples as processed for Test 1a and 1b.
Twelve experienced listeners participated in the test, with ten passing the
post-screening process as defined in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] clause 4.1.

Observations:
\- FOA at 128 kbps shows performance in the \"Excellent\" range, above 80, for
all test items
## 5.2 Xperi test results on Test 2
Test 2 specified in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7 has been marked as Optional.
Due to the time constraints, it was not possible to execute this test before
the specified deadlines.
## 5.3 Xperi test results on Test 3
Test 3 is designed to compare Audio Profile Reference Renderer (Test Signals)
with CIBR (Anchors). The test methodology is specified in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2]
clause 6. The test methodology is based in Comparison Category Rating (CCR).
The Xperi Audio Profile renderer is based on the CIBR configuration (see 3GPP
TS 26.259 [2] clause 6) as shown on Figure 5.3.1:
{width="6.210416666666666in" height="2.6284722222222223in"}
Figure 5.3.1: Xperi audio profile renderer is based on the CIBR configuration
Since the Xperi Audio Profile is configured with CIBR, this test reduces to
comparing two perceptually-equivalent signals. Specifically:
\- 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6.10 on Test 3, states: \"Proposed Audio Profile
shall be configured for an Operating Point providing transparent quality for
all Test Materials\".
\- Test 3 is split into two sessions: one comparing the candidate with CIBR
1st order and another comparing the candidate with CIBR 3rd order.
In other words:
\- The compressed and uncompressed signals in the tests are, per test
requirements, perceptually equivalent
\- If not, one would have failed the requirement of configuring the Operating
Point to provide transparent quality
\- Test 3 split into 1st order and 3rd order which leads to:
\- Comparing 1st order CIBR to 1st order CIBR, and
\- Comparing 3rd order CIBR to 3rd order CIBR
Conclusions:
\- Xperi VRStream Audio Profile renderer is equivalent to the CIBR reference
(the two using the same renderer configuration)
\- Test 3 results in comparing two perceptually-equivalent Test Signals
## 5.4 Xperi conclusions
The presented Test 1 results show:
\- Xperi VRStream Audio Profile at 256, 384 and 512 kbps performing in the
range from 85 to 95 MUSHRA points, i.e. all within the \"Excellent\" range
\- Xperi VRStream FOA Audio Profile at 128 kbps performing within 5 MUSHRA
points of the uncompressed FOA anchor, i.e. also \"Excellent\" with respect to
its equitable reference
\- An additional test for FOA-only content at 128 kbps also shows performance
above 80, i.e. in the \"Excellent\" quality range
The optional Test 2 was not fully executed before the specified deadline due
to time and resource constraints.
For Test 3, the Xperi VRStream Audio Profile renderer is equivalent to the
CIBR reference, the two using the same renderer configuration.
## 5.5 Fraunhofer IIS crosscheck results
### 5.5.1 Crosscheck package description
The Xperi cross check provided a combined package, including the original test
content processed by the renderer of the profile together with bandlimited
anchor signals and coded conditions under test, as well as a derived First
Order Ambisonics representation of the original test content and additionally
a coded version thereof.
An additional Test 1c for FOA has been conducted with the four HOA-only test
items available for Test 1. The tests have been performed under the same
conditions as Tests 1a and 1b, with the same uncompressed/compressed FOA test
samples as processed for Test 1a and 1b.
### 5.5.2 Test setup
#### 5.5.2.1 Test 1
The subjective listening tests were carried out based on the cross check
package provided by Xperi. The test procedure was a \"MUlti Stimulus test with
Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)\" based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] for the
subjective assessment of intermediate quality audio for assessing the _Basic
Audio Quality_ attribute described in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3].
Loudspeaker tests \"Test 1\" were conducted in the acoustically isolated
listening lab \'Mozart\' at Fraunhofer IIS, which fulfills the room acoustics
requirements described in ITU-R BS.1116-3 [6]. The signals were presented to
the listeners using a high quality speaker setup, consisting of 30 DynaudioÂ®
BM6A MKII^TM^ speakers (only 12 were active) and one GeithainÂ® TT920
subwoofer.
Test 1 was split into two separate tests. In one sub test, all original
derived content was tested against the provided references. This test was
conducted as two separate sessions, with sessions 1a and 1b using the same
assessors to allow the pooling of all test signals for statistical analysis.
In a second sub test the coded FOA content was tested against the provided
non-coded FOA reference signal. Bandlimited 3.5 and 7 kHz versions of the non-
coded FOA reference signal were added as low and mid-range anchor signals to
the test.
### 5.5.3 Test panel
As these listening tests are aimed to evaluate audio not at intermediate but
very high quality, only participants were chosen that were considered to be
expert listeners, as required in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.3.
Participants at the Fraunhofer IIS test site were chosen from the Audio
Division at Fraunhofer IIS that were considered to be expert listeners,
additionally external expert listeners participated in the test. All external
listeners have undergone a defined training program, participated in prior
Listening Tests, and proven to be critical and reliable listeners.
Of the listeners 3 were female, 15 male. Listener age ranged from 21 to 46
years.
In compliance with ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] the following rules for post-screening
in Tests 1 were used:
\- none of the hidden references are supposed to be rated below 90 and
\- none of all midrange anchors are to be rated lower than low anchors.
The Table 5.5.1 illustrates the number of listeners per test for Test 1.

### 5.5.4 Codec Quality Characterization Tests
#### 5.5.4.1 Introduction
For the cross check of the Xperi proposal Fraunhofer IIS conducted a series of
loudspeaker listening tests.
#### 5.5.4.2 Listening test over loudspeakers (Test 1)
##### 5.5.4.2.1 Original content Test 1 (Tests 1a and 1b)
Test 1 for the original content was split into two sessions Test 1a and 1b
with 10 items each, as defined in clause 4.1. Listeners randomly started with
one of the Tests 1a or 1b.
{width="6.698611111111111in" height="4.788194444444445in"}
Figure 5.5.1: Mean rating with 95% confidence interval of MUSHRA scores for
original content Test 1 (1a and 1b aggregated)
Figure 5.5.1 shows mean ratings with 95% confidence interval (computed
assuming normally distributed data and applying a t-distribution) for each
item as well as pooled over all items. Detailed numbers are provided in Table
5.5.2.
The Xperi proposal shows \"Good\" quality for the 256 kbps condition with an

# 6 Metadata Assisted EVS Codec (MAEC) tests results
## 6.1 Dolby test results on Test 1
### 6.1.1 Test plan
#### 6.1.1.1 Introduction
The test was carried out in accordance with test plan 3GPP TS 26.259 [2].
The Codec Quality Characterization Tests with loudspeaker rendering were
carried out according to MUSHRA test methodology ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3]. System
under test was Dolby\'s VRStream audio profile candidate [7], operated in two
modes, FOA and HIQ. These two modes were tested in two independent tests.
#### 6.1.1.2 Experimental design
The experimental design of the Codec Quality Characterization Tests was such
that all assessors rated all test Conditions. To control for possible
presentation order biases, the presentation order of the test items was fully
randomized during the experiment (double-blind test). The tests were run in
two sessions A and B with 10 test items each. The test material and allocation
to sets for sessions A and B was chosen by ETSI secretary. The test items were
time limited to a duration of 12s. The test of the system in FOA operation
mode tested 2 codec operation points (bit rates). The test of the system in
HIQ operation mode tested 4 codec operation points.
#### 6.1.1.3 Assessors
The selection of assessors followed the guidelines in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3]
clause 4.1. Only _experienced assessors_ participated in the experiments. Both
Dolby-external and Dolby-internal assessors were used.
**Pre- and post-screening of assessors**
Pre- and post-screening of assessors was done in accordance with ITU-R
BS.1534-3 [3].
The applied post-screening method excludes assessors who assign a very high
grade to a significantly impaired anchor signal, and those who frequently
grade the hidden reference as though it were significantly impaired, as
defined by the following metrics:
\- an assessor should be excluded from the aggregated responses if he or she
rates the hidden reference condition for > 15% of the test items lower than a
score of 90;
\- an assessor should be excluded from the aggregated responses if he or she
rates the mid-range anchor for more than 15% of the test items higher than a
score of 90. If more than 25% of the assessors rate the mid-range anchor
higher than a score of 90, this might indicate that the test item was not
degraded significantly by the anchor processing. In this case assessors should
not be excluded on the basis of scores for that item.
#### 6.1.1.4 Content
Critical audio Material representing typical virtual reality content was used
for this test. The test material as allocated to sessions A and B is shown in
the Table 6.1.1.

#### 6.1.1.5 Content presentation
The content presentation and grading process was done according to ITU-R
BS.1534-3 [3] clauses 5.3 and 5.4.
#### 6.1.1.6 Listening environment
The listening environment (room properties and acoustic properties) were fully
compliant with ITU-R BS.1116-3 [6] clause 8.2 and 8.3.
#### 6.1.1.7 Listening system
The listening system was loudspeaker-based with loudspeaker layout according
to layout J of ITU-R BS.2051-1 [8] Annex 1.
#### 6.1.1.8 Listening level
The listening level was according to ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] clause 8.
#### 6.1.1.9 Anchor/reference conditions
The tests included one Hidden Reference and two Anchor conditions. The two
Anchors were 3.5 kHz and 7 kHz low-pass filtered versions of the Reference
condition, as described in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] clause 5.1.
The Reference and Hidden Reference conditions were the source test material
items directly rendered to the loudspeaker setup through the Reference
Renderer of Dolby\'s Audio Profile proposal. Scene-, channel- and object-based
content were rendered as specified in the renderer description of Dolby\'s
VRStream audio profile candidate [7]. For the listening tests, all items were
rendered for the \"VR Layout\" (assuming L and R channels are at +/-45
degrees).
#### 6.1.1.10 System under test and test conditions
The Test Conditions were generated in accordance with the test plan
requirements.
One particular requirement for the tests are that all content be encoded to
the target bit rate +/- 10%. The Table 6.1.2 lists the encoded bit rates for
all content in the study both for FOA and HIQ tests. All content sits within
the targeted max allowed bit rates. The FOA at 81.2 kbps is not required for
the study but was added to demonstrate operation at lower bit rates.

## 6.3 Dolby test results on Test 3
### 6.3.1. Test plan
#### 6.3.1.1 Introduction
The test was carried out in accordance with test plan defined in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 6.
This test was carried out according to a methodology that was loosely inspired
by the Comparison Category Rating test paradigm.
System under test was Dolby\'s VRStream audio profile candidate [7], operated
in two modes, FOA and HIQ. These two modes were tested in a combined test.
#### 6.3.1.2 Experimental design
In the Renderer Comparison Test, the assessors compared two Test Conditions
(FOA and HIQ) against two Anchor Conditions on four audio quality Attributes.
The presentation of the Test and Anchor Conditions is binaural using head-
tracking. For each trial, one of the Test Condition is compared to one of the
Anchor Conditions as an A v. B comparison. To control for possible
presentation order biases, the Test Conditions were randomized such that
overall the test conditions were in the A samples in exactly half of the
cases. The test were conducted with 2 * 12 Test Materials and two Anchors for
a total of 48 trials (comparisons).
The test was divided in four sessions. The first session compares the FOA Test
Condition against the first Anchor and the second session compares the FOA
Test Condition against the second Anchor. The third session compares the HIQ
Test Condition against the first Anchor and the fourth session compares the
HIQ Test Condition against the second Anchor.
#### 6.3.1.3 Assessors
##### 6.3.1.3.1 Introduction
The selection of assessors followed the guidelines in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3]
clause 4.1. Only _experienced assessors_ participated in the experiments.
Dolby-internal assessors that were unfamiliar with the test context were used.
##### 6.3.1.3.2 Post-screening of assessors
No post-screening of assessors was done as there was no defined post-screening
procedure.
#### 6.3.1.4 Description of system under test
The test was carried out in accordance with Test Plan 3 defined in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2].
The system under test, defined as utilizing the system providing transparent
audio quality as specified in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6, was interpreted by
Dolby as sending content through the Dolby ingestion engine, bypassing the
encoder and decoder, and then rendering using the Dolby Reference renderer.
Dolby selected the default CIBR HOA3 as the Dolby Reference renderer. This
means that the system under test is identical to the HOA3 CIBR anchor.
The system under test for Test 3 implemented the following processing stages:
**System under Test (HiQ) -- \'ESD16HOA\':**
3GPP audio files
â†“
Ingestion engine to represent the audio input as scene and objects.
â†“

#### 6.3.1.6 Listening environment
The listening environment were fully compliant with the test plan requirements
defined in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7.6.
#### 6.3.1.7 Listening system
The listening system was headphone-based using the Common Informative Binaural
Renderer (CIBR) 3GPP TS 26.118 [9] clause 4.5.1.2 for both the Reference and
Degraded conditions.
The binauralisation was done using the HRTFs of the Google Resonance Audio
binauralizer plugin [10] of the CIBR, meaning that the HRTFs were based on a
head and torso simulator (HATS).
The headphones used were SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^. The headphone rendering was
equalized using equalization filters for that type of headphone. The
equalization filters were kindly provided by Qualcomm.
#### 6.3.1.8 Listening level
The listening level was as specified in the test plan defined in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2]. It was the understanding of the source that there was no agreed
way of normalizing the listening level of individual test items (test and
reference condition items). Consequently, the listening level was adjusted on
a global level across all test and reference items.
#### 6.3.1.9 Attributes
The Rendering Comparison Test will assess the four Audio Quality Attributes:
_Timbre_ (TIM), _Spatial_ (SPA), _Artefacts_ (ART) and _Basic Audio Quality_
(BAQ). In addition, the Rendering Comparison Test compares any residual
_Loudness_ (LOUD) difference between A and B samples through an additional
loudness scale.
#### 6.3.1.10 Description of test administration platform

## 6.4 Nokia crosscheck results on Test 1
### 6.4.1 Introduction
This clause 6.4 provides a report on the VRStream Audio Cross-Check Lab task
and results for Test 1 performed for the Dolby\'s VRStream audio profile
candidate [7] at Nokia Technologies.
### 6.4.2 Test description and results
The listening tests were carried out for the test items submitted by Dolby
Laboratories for the VRStream Audio Media Profile cross-check task. The test
procedure used for the evaluation was a \"MUlti Stimulus test with Hidden
Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)\" according to ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3]. The
listening tests took place at Nokia Technologies\' listening room in Tampere,
Finland. The listening room was equipped with a 7.1+4 setup consisting of
GenelecÂ® 8531A SAM^TM^ speakers for the horizontal ring, GenelecÂ® 8330A
SAM^TM^ speakers for the height channels, and a GenelecÂ® 7271A SAM^TM^ Studio
subwoofer. The MUSHRA software used for the test was ARL\'s STEP program. The
channel orders of the test item files were given in the accompanying
README.txt files and verified for correct listening setup.
Test 1 (listening test over loudspeakers) consisted of four sessions of 10
items each. These sessions are called HIQ_A, HIQ_B, FOA_A, and FOA_B. As the
names indicate, there are two types of sessions (HIQ, FOA) that are both
duplicated (A, B) for increased item coverage. The high-quality mode (HIQ)
testing covered four rates (r1, r2, r3, r4) in addition to hidden reference
(HR) and two anchor conditions (ref35, ref70). The First Order Ambisonics mode
(FOA) testing covered two rates (FOA_r1, FOA_r2) in addition to hidden
reference (HR) and two anchor conditions (foa35, foa70). The exact bit rates
were not known during the cross-check.
In total, 9 listeners participated in the listening tests. All the listeners
can be characterized as experienced listeners suitable for the MUSHRA test.
The session and item orders were randomized for each listener.
Figure 6.4.1 presents the high-quality mode (HIQ) aggregated mean ratings with
95% confidence interval for each item. Figure 6.4.2 presents the high-quality

## 6.5 Philips crosscheck results for HIQ mode on Test 2
### 6.5.1 Introduction
Philips Research conducted a codec quality characterization test for the HIQ
mode of Dolby\'s VRStream audio profile candidate [7]. Test 2 is an optional
Codec Quality Characterization Test defined to assess the Codec Quality of
proposed Audio Profiles. Its requirements are:
\- According to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7
\- Using _Common Informative Binaural Renderer_ for Reference and Degraded
conditions
\- Over headphones
\- Based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] (MUSHRA)
\- Evaluates _Basic Audio Quality_
### 6.5.2 Test setup
The audio material was received from Dolby using the cloud OneDrive ETSI 365\.
The test material was already divided into two sets of ten audio items each,
see Table 6.5.1. These two sets were tested in two separate sessions as
defined in clause 4.2.

The audio material was provided in two distributions, one without headphone
equalization and one with headphone equalization for SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^.
As the SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^ headphones were not used, the distribution
without headphone equalization was used.
The test was conducted using the MUSHRA methodology with randomized
representation. A quality scale is used where the intervals are labelled
\"bad,\" \"poor,\" \"fair,\" \"good,\" and \"excellent.\" The subjective
responses were recorded on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. The Audio Research
Labs STEP tool (version 2.00) was used for conducting the test. See Figure
6.5.1 for the setup of the STEP tool, and Figure 6.5.2 for an example of the
GUI of the STEP tool at the start of a listening session.

The listening test was conducted using BeyerdynamicÂ® DT990^TM^ headphones
(with no head-tracking) connected to an ASUSÂ® 15\" Win10 VivoBook S15^TM^
laptop in a quiet listening room with background noise levels not exceeding
the levels in Table 1 of 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6.6. Each of the 12
experienced assessors listened to both sets of 10 audio items. Half of the
assessors started with session 2a, the other half with session 2b. Before
starting the test itself the assessors started with a training session of two
items. Pre- and Post-screening of assessors was per ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] clause
4.1.2 and all assessors passed both pre- and post-screening.

### 6.5.4 Conclusions
A MUSHRA test was conducted at Philips Research using audio items provided by
Dolby. In the test, using headphones, the _Basic Audio Quality_ was assessed
by a panel of experienced listeners. The following conclusions can be drawn:
\- The scores for the Hidden Reference and the Anchor conditions are in line
with ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] (MUSHRA)
\- All four test conditions, i.e. Sys1, Sys2, Sys3 and Sys4 obtained a mean
score in the range from 87 to 96 points, i.e. all within the \"Excellent\"
range
\- The Sys2, Sys3 and Sys4 test conditions performed significantly better than
the Sys1 test condition
## 6.6 Ericsson crosscheck results for FOA mode
### 6.6.1 Codec Quality Characterization test with binaural rendering (Test 2)
#### 6.6.1.1 Test setup
Two codec quality characterization tests evaluating the _Basic Audio Quality_
on Dolby\'s VRStream audio profile candidate [7] with binaural rendering
according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] were conducted at the DRI-Audio section of
Ericsson Research in Sweden.
Both tests were done by 12 listeners that were instructed according to clause
6.6.1.5. By default SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^ head-phones were used, but three
listeners used the SennheiserÂ® HD 650^TM^ instead because of unavailability of
SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^. Nevertheless, head-phone equalization filters for
SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^ were applied for all listeners, i.e. also for listeners
with SennheiserÂ® HD 650^TM^ headphones as this was considered better than
utilizing no equalization at all because of their similar frequency responses.
#### 6.6.1.2 Test conditions
The test conditions, according to the labels of the test items, were:
\- foa35 (3.5 kHz low-pass anchor)
\- foa70 (7 kHz low-pass anchor)
\- r1
\- r2
\- ref (Hidden Reference)
#### 6.6.1.3 Test material
The test material of Test 2a and 2b was obtained from the Dolby folder at the
ETSI cloud. Each test included 10 items each according to Table 6.6.1. All
items were pre-equalized by the proponent using equalization filters provided
by Qualcomm for SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^ headphones. The equalization processing
was not cross-checked.

#### 6.6.1.4 Test results
Pre- and post-screening was applied according to ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] clause
4.1 resulting in 2 out of the 12 listeners being screened. These listeners
were using the SennheiserÂ® HD 650^TM^ headphones, meaning that the final
results were obtained by 9 listeners using SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^ and 1
listener using SennheiserÂ® HD 650^TM^ headphones.
The average scores with 95% confidence intervals, given a two-sided Student\'s
t-distribution, are presented in Figure 6.6.1 and Table 6.6.2. As the same
listeners were taking both sub-tests, i.e. test 2a and 2b, the test results
are combined for average scores. For statistical analysis, difference scores
in comparison to condition \"r2\" are presented in Figure 6.6.2 and Table

### 6.6.2 Renderer comparison test (Test 3)
#### 6.6.2.1 Test setup
A renderer comparison test according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6 was
conducted at the DRI-Audio section of Ericsson Research in Sweden. The
attributes evaluated were: _Spatial Quality_ (SPA), _Artefacts_ (ART),
_Timbre_ (TIM), _Basic Audio Quality_ (BAQ) and _Loudness/Level_ (LEV).
Because of limited time, only 7 listeners were able to finalize the test. This
is less than the requirement in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2].
SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^ headphones with the ThalesÂ® InertiaCube4^TM^ head-
tracker attached on top were used by all assessors.
No specific instructions were given to the assessors, but as they are
experienced listeners working with audio they had their own understanding of
the attributes.
#### 6.6.2.2 Test conditions
The test conditions were, according to the labels of the test items:
\- ESD16_ref (3rd order CIBR as defined in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2])
\- ESD4_fromHOA
#### 6.6.2.3 Test material
The test material of Test 3 was obtained directly from the proponent. The file
names were identical to the ones obtained from the Dolby folder at the ETSI
cloud except for a suffix EQ. The wave files are different, likely because of
the applied headphone equalization, but this processing has not been verified.
The test software was developed by the proponent and provided together with
randomized input signals for 10 listeners.
The test included 12 test items according to Table 6.6.4 as given by the
obtained material. All items were pre-equalized by the proponent using
equalization filters provided by Qualcomm for SennheiserÂ® HD 600^TM^
headphones.

## 6.7 Fraunhofer IIS crosscheck results
### 6.7.1 Crosscheck package description
This cross check report provides listening test results for the Dolby\'s
VRStream audio profile candidate [7].
Contained are listening test results for Tests 1 (HIQ and FOA) and Test 2
(HIQ) as provided by Dolby.
The Dolby cross check provided two basic configurations, HIQ tests are based
on the original test content processed by the renderer of the profile, whereas
FOA tests used a First Order Ambisonics representation of the original test
content both as a reference signal and to generate the coded conditions under
test.
### 6.7.2 Test setup
#### 6.7.2.1 Test 1
The subjective listening tests were carried out based on the cross check
package provided by Dolby. The test procedure was a \"MUlti Stimulus test with
Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)\" based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] for the
subjective assessment of intermediate quality audio for assessing the _Basic
Audio Quality_ attribute described in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3].
Loudspeaker tests \"Test 1\" were conducted in the acoustically isolated
listening lab \'Mozart\' at Fraunhofer IIS, which fulfills the room acoustics
requirements described in ITU-R BS.1116-3 [6]. The signals were presented to
the listeners using a high quality speaker setup, consisting of 30 DynaudioÂ®
BM6A MKII^TM^ speakers (only 12 were active) and one GeithainÂ® TT920
subwoofer.
Both Test 1 (HIQ and FOA) tests were conducted as two separate sessions, with
sessions a and b using the same assessors to allow the pooling of all test
signals for statistical analysis.
For the HIQ test the cross check package contained the provided reference
signal, 3.5 and 7 kHz anchors, and 4 test conditions r1, r2, r3 and r4. For
the FOA test the cross check package contained the provided reference signal,
3.5 and 7 kHz anchors, and 2 test conditions r1 and r2.
#### 6.7.2.2 Test 2
For \"Test 2\" the test procedure was a \"MUlti Stimulus test with Hidden
Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)\" based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] for the
subjective assessment of intermediate quality audio for assessing the _Basic
Audio Quality_ attribute described in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3].
Test 2 headphone listening tests were conducted in acoustically treated
listening rooms using STAX headphones.
Only the Test 2 HIQ was conducted as separate sessions, with sessions 2a and
2b using the same assessors to allow the pooling of all test signals for
statistical analysis.
### 6.7.3 Test panel
As these listening tests are aimed to evaluate audio not at intermediate but
very high quality, only participants were chosen that were considered to be
expert listeners, as required in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.3.
Participants at the Fraunhofer IIS test site were chosen from the Audio
Division at Fraunhofer IIS that were considered to be expert listeners,
additionally external expert listeners participated in the test. All external
listeners have undergone a defined training program and participated in prior
Listening Tests and proven to be critical and reliable listeners.
Of the listeners 2 were female, 22 male. Listener age ranged from 18 to 46
years.
In compliance with ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] the following rules for post-screening
in Tests 1 and 2 were used:
\- none of the hidden references are supposed to be rated below 90 and
\- none of all midrange anchors are to be rated lower than low anchors.
The Table 6.7.1 illustrates the number of listeners of Test 1 and 2.

\"Good\" quality in Test 1 FOA.
#### 6.7.4.3 Listening test over headphones (Test 2)
##### 6.7.4.3.1 Introduction
Tests over headphones were conducted as defined in clause 4.2 and 3GPP TS
26.259 [2]. The headphone equalization in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7.7, has
been omitted due to unavailability of equalization filters for the combination
of STAXÂ® headphones and Neumann KU100 dummy head when the tests were conducted
by Fraunhofer IIS.
In each test presentation of test signals, the presentation order was
randomized for each listener.
##### 6.7.4.3.2 Original content (Tests 2 HIQ)

## 6.8 Qualcomm crosscheck results on Test 1
### 6.8.1 Introduction and experimental design
ITU-R recommends that the \"testing, evaluation and reporting procedures given
in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] be used for the subjective assessment of intermediate
audio quality\". ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] has also been previously used in other
standardization activities pertaining to spatial audio coding such as the
MPEG-H standardization. To provide an understanding of what quality levels can
be achieved with the metadata-assisted EVS codec at the nominal bit-rates of
256 kbps, 384 kbps and 512 kbps, the Codec Quality Characterization Test
described in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5 was conducted.
In this experiment, 4 different bit-rates (an additional bit-rate of 160 kbps
was also provided by the proponent) were tested with 20 different test
materials covering object-based, scene-based (up to 6th order HOA), channel-
based audio and a combination of these formats.
The experimental design was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.2. The
experiment was divided in two sessions, each session covering 10 test
materials.
### 6.8.2 Selection of assessors
The selection of Assessors was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.3.
Participants were all members of Qualcomm Advanced Tech R&D group and familiar
with critical listening and audio quality evaluation. 10 assessors were
selected following pre- and post-screening processes.
### 6.8.3 Test materials
The test materials included twenty different signals covering a range of audio
content typical of Virtual Reality such as vocals, orchestra music, nature
sounds, etc. Each of the three different bit rates was tested with each of the
twenty different signals.
### 6.8.4 Presentation interface
The ARL STEP software v.2.04 was used for presentation of the samples and
collection of results.
### 6.8.5 Listening environment
The listening environment was a critical listening room compliant to 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 5.6.
### 6.8.6 Listening system
The listening system was loudspeaker-based (GenelecÂ® 8240A SAM^TM^
loudspeakers) with a setup according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.7.
### 6.8.7 Listening level
The listening level was adjusted according to the requirements in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 5.8.
### 6.8.8 Generation of anchor/reference and test conditions
The signal processing chain for generation of the Test Conditions is according
to the proponent\'s description. According to the proponent\'s report in
clause 6.1.1.10, the actual bit rates were in all Test Materials higher than
the target bit-rate. Table 6.8.1 shows the actual bit-rates for each content.

# 7 OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile test results
## 7.1 Fraunhofer IIS/Qualcomm test results
### 7.1.1 Test setup
#### 7.1.1.1 Test 1
The system under test, OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile, relies on MPEG-H
3D Audio [11], [12].
The subjective listening tests were carried out based on the test items
submitted by Dolby, Fraunhofer IIS, Qualcomm, and Xperi for VRStream Audio
Media Profile testing. The test procedure was a \"MUlti Stimulus test with
Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)\" based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] for the
subjective assessment of intermediate quality audio for assessing the _Basic
Audio Quality_ attribute described in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3].
Loudspeaker tests \"Test 1\" were conducted in the acoustically isolated
listening lab \'Mozart\' at Fraunhofer IIS, which fulfills the room acoustics
requirements described in ITU-R BS.1116-3 [6]. The signals were presented to
the listeners using a high quality speaker setup, consisting of 30 DynaudioÂ®
BM6A MKII^TM^ speakers (only 12 were active) and one GeithainÂ® TT920
subwoofer.
The reference and hidden reference conditions are the source test materials
rendered to the loudspeaker setup through the reference renderer of the OMAF
3D Audio Baseline Profile with the coding bypassed, as required in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 5.9.
The test conditions were generated with the target operating points of 256,
384, and 512 kbps. For First Order Ambisonics contents only the target bitrate
was set to 128 kbps, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.10. The
renderer used for the test conditions has been the same renderer as used for
the anchors and reference conditions.
Test 1 was conducted as three separate sessions, with sessions 1a and 1b using
the same assessors to allow the pooling of all test signals for statistical
analysis at the bit rates of 256, 384, and 512 kbps. An additional session 1c
was conducted, which only evaluated the FOA contents at 128 kbps. The test
signals used have been derived from the \'pure\' HOA signals by truncation to
1st order, as specified in clause 4.1.
#### 7.1.1.2 Test 2
The subjective listening tests for Test 2 were carried out based on the test
items submitted by Dolby, Fraunhofer IIS, Qualcomm, and Xperi for VRStream
Audio Media Profile testing. For testing FOA contents, the \'pure\' HOA
signals were truncated to 1st order. The test procedure was a \"MUlti Stimulus
test with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)\" based on ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3]
for the subjective assessment of intermediate quality audio for assessing the
_Basic Audio Quality_ attribute described in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3].
The test conditions were generated with the target operating points of 256,
384, and 512 kbps. For First Order Ambisonics contents only the target bitrate
was set to 128 kbps, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.10. The
renderer used for the test conditions has been the same renderer as used for
the anchors and reference conditions.
\"Test 2\" headphone listening tests were conducted in acoustically treated
listening rooms using STAX headphones.
Test 2 was conducted as three separate sessions, with sessions 2a and 2b using
the same assessors to allow the pooling of all test signals for statistical
analysis at the bit rates of 256, 384, and 512 kbps. For First Order
Ambisonics contents only the target bitrate was set to 128 kbps.
#### 7.1.1.3 Test 3
The subjective listening tests for Test 3 were carried out based on the test
items, submitted by Dolby, Fraunhofer IIS, Qualcomm, and Xperi for VRStream
Audio Media Profile testing and selected by the SA4 secretary for Test 3. The
test procedure was according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2].
\"Test 3\" headphone listening tests were conducted in acoustically treated
listening rooms using BeyerdynamicÂ® DT 990 pro^TM^ headphones with an HTCÂ®
Vive^TM^ tracker mounted on top.
### 7.1.2 Training and introduction phase
As recommended in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3], the participants were first introduced
to the test environment and given a training session (consisting of the items
following the item submission criteria, but none of the actual test items)
before performing the actual listening test.
#### 7.1.2.1 Test panel
As these listening tests are aimed to evaluate audio not at intermediate but
very high quality, only participants were chosen that were considered to be
expert listeners, as required in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.3.
Participants at the Fraunhofer IIS test site were chosen from the Audio
Division at Fraunhofer IIS that were considered to be expert listeners,
additionally external expert listeners participated in the test. All external
listeners have undergone a defined training program and participated in prior
Listening Tests and proven to be critical and reliable listeners.
Of the listeners 3 were female, 19 male. Listener age ranged from 21 to 33
years.
In compliance with ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] the following rules for post-screening
in Tests 1 and 2 were used:
\- none of the hidden references are supposed to be rated below 90 and
\- none of all midrange anchors are to be rated lower than low anchors.
For Test 3 no post-screening was applied.
The Table 7.1.1 illustrates the number of listeners per test.

Whereas the Figure 7.1.3 shows the processing workflow for Test 3, the Figures
7.1.1a, 7.1.1b, 7.1.2a and 7.1.2b show the codec and processing work flow used
to generate the Speaker- and Headphone signals used in the Listening Tests 1
and 2. The depicted Processing Steps are shortly explained here:
**Truncation to 1st Order**
\- \"pure\" HOA Test material is truncated to FOA i.e. keeping only first 4
Ambisonics components (W,X,Y,Z).
\- Is only used for Test 1c and 2c
**3GPP Input Files Conversion (3gpp- >.wav+.xml)**
\- All PCM Wave files of an original test item are multiplexed into one
Interleaved Multichannel PCM wav transparently (reversible).
\- Test Item configuration (speaker signal positions, HOA order, number of
Objects) of each VRStream Test Material is converted to Control Metadata .xml
file for the encoder
\- Object Metadata is repackaged into MPEG-H encoder input format (also stored
in MPEG-H metadata .xml file):
\- Resulting files:
\- Multichannel PCM .wav
\- Metadata .xml

\- Test 2c: Decoded Intermediate Audio Signals rendered to ESD configuration
with 4 Fliege points
#### 7.1.3.2 Bitrates
The MPEG-H encoder was configured to use the aforementioned target bit rates
during the encoding. Deviation from the target bitrate for the items in the
test is caused by the bit reservoir used in the MPEG-H encoder. It allows a
varying frame wise bit budget while maintaining a constant overall bitrate.
The size of the bit reservoir is specified by the buffer requirements in
MPEG-H 3D Audio Phase 2 [12], which are met for all test conditions. The
actually used bitrates and the deviations (which is the difference of Bitrate
and Target bitrate over Target bitrate) are detailed in Table 7.1.2 for 128
kbps, in Table 7.1.3 for 256 kbps, in Table 7.1.4 for 384 kbps and Table 7.1.5
for 512 kbps test conditions.

#### 7.1.4.3 Listening test over headphones (Test 2)
##### 7.1.4.3.1 Introduction
Tests over headphones were conducted as defined in clause 4.2 and 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] All stimuli have been binauraly rendered using the Common
Informative Binaural Renderer (CIBR). A definition of the CIBR can be found in
3GPP TS 26.118 [9] clause 4.6.1.2. The CIBR employs the SADIE KU100 HRTFs [13]
for binaural rendering. The headphone equalization in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2]
clause 7.7, has been omitted due to unavailability of equalization filters for
the combination of STAXÂ® headphones and Neumann KU100 dummy head when the
tests were conducted by Fraunhofer IIS.
The reference and hidden reference conditions are the source test materials
binaurally rendered to headphones through the CIBR. The ESD signals with 16
Fliege points as input to the CIBR were rendered through the reference
renderer of the OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Profile with the coding bypassed, which
is that the rendering of channels and objects content to the virtual
loudspeakers in ESD configuration is performed using the VBAP implementation
specified in MPEG-H 3D Audio Phase 2 [12] clause FC and MPEG-H 3D Audio [11]
clause 8, respectively.
The same encoded bitstreams as for the loudspeaker tests (Test 1) have been
used to generate the ESD signals, correspondingly the bitrates used for Test 2
are identical to Test 1, as reported in clause 7.1.2.2.
In each test presentation of test signals the presentation order was
randomized for each listener.
##### 7.1.4.3.2 Original content (Tests 2a and 2b)
Test 2 was split into two sessions Test 2a and 2b with 10 items each as
defined in clause 4.2. Listeners randomly started with one of the Tests 2a or
2b.

### 7.1.4.4 Reference binaural renderer Quality Characterization Tests
#### 7.1.4.4.1 Introduction
##### 7.1.4.4.2 Test system implementation
##### 7.1.4.4.2.1 Overview {#overview .H6}
Max/MSP was used to implement the test framework as required in 3GPP TS 26.259
[2] clause 6. Figure 7.1.8 shows a high-level block diagram for the
implementation.
{width="6.279861111111111in" height="2.5208333333333335in"}
Figure 7.1.8: High-level block diagram of Test 3 implementation on MAX/MSP.
The application takes a folder containing each test item in 2 formats, one
reference in ESD format and one folder of multi mono files with text files
describing the position and type of each source for the System under Test
(SuT).
Anchor/reference conditions were processed according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2]
clause 6.9.
For the anchor/reference conditions, the rendering of channels and objects
content to the virtual loudspeakers in ESD configuration is performed using
the VBAP implementation specified in MPEG-H 3D Audio Phase 2 [12] clause FC
and MPEG-H 3D Audio [11] clause 8, respectively.
For the test conditions, the mono files for the SuT were created by encoding
and decoding the original Test Materials at a very high bit rate and exported
via the external renderer interface of MPEG-H specified in OMAF 3D Audio
candidate [14] annex X.2. The encoding and decoding steps are performed in the
same way as described in clause 7.1.3.1.The metadata was converted to text
files for easy parsing inside of Max/MSP.
The application can then send the reference audio data in ESD format to the
Common Informative Binaural Renderer (CIBR) and the multi mono files to the
System Under Test. Both renderers are run in parallel when the user presses
play. An A/B switch allows the user to listen to each condition individually
for comparison and switch seamlessly between A and B. A definition of the CIBR
can be found in 3GPP TS 26.118 [9] clause 4.6.1.2.
The Max/MSP application was then running on macOS^TM^ systems, more
specifically on a Mac^TM^ mini (late 2012) with an IntelÂ® Core^TM^ i7 and 16GB
DDR3 RAM. A second test machine was a Mac mini (late 2014) with an IntelÂ®
Core^TM^ i7 and 16GB DDR3 RAM. Both machines were running Mac OS 10.13 High
Sierra^TM^.
##### 7.1.4.4.2.2 Graphical User Interface {#graphical-user-interface .H6}
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is depicted in Figure 7.1.9. The listener
can switch seamlessly between the two decoding processes through an A/B switch
for the purposes of comparison. By default, a loop section is enabled around
the entire item. The user can control the start and stop points of the looped
region and start/stop the playback.
The listener is presented with 5 sliders, which can be used to rate four
different audio quality attributes (_Timbre_ , _Spatial_ _Quality_ ,
_Artefacts_ and _Basic Audio Quality_), as defined in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2].
These sliders have a discrete scale from -3 to +3. The default rating on
start-up is zero. A separate slider can be used to rate the loudness
difference between the items. This is presented separately to the main four
attributes being tested.

##### 7.1.4.4.2.3 Motion sensing {#motion-sensing .H6}
The motion sensing system used for Test 3 was the _HTCÂ® Vive^TM^ Tracker_ for
head-tracking. The tracker is attached to the top of a _BeyerdynamicÂ® DT 990
Pro^TM^_ headphone via a screw fitting through the headband as shown in Figure
7.1.10, allowing for comfortable listening. The rotation information from the
tracker is received via OSC Messages in the Max Application. This is then
forwarded to both the CIBR path and the System under Test. The zero position
of the tracker is set for each listener at the beginning of the test.

##### 7.1.4.4.2.4 CIBR Implementation {#cibr-implementation .H6}
The CIBR implementation defined in 3GPP TS 26.118 [9] comprises three VST
plugins in series to achieve the desired output. The system is realized as a
Max/MSP object which takes sixteen channels of input audio in the equivalent
spatial domain (ESD) format and outputs a two-channel binauralized signal. For
a definition of the ESD and Fliege point locations as described in 3GPP TS
26.260 [15].
Firstly, the sixteen-channel ESD is converted to 3rd order B-Format Ambisonics
via an inverse HOA matrix. This sixteen-channel HOA signal is then fed into an
Ambisonics rotator and rotated using Euler angles received from the head
tracking device. This rotated HOA Signal is then binauralized in real-time,
resulting in a stereo signal.
The VST plugins used in this implementation are the Ambix_decoder_o3, which is
used in reverse to encode 3rd order B-Format Ambisonics from a sixteen-channel
ESD signal. The ambiX_rotator_o3 is used to rotate this Ambisonics signal in
the Ambisonics domain. Finally, ResonanceAudioMonitorVst from Google is used
to render the Ambisonics to a binauralized stereo signal. A link to these
plugins can be found in 3GPP TS 26.260 [15].
For the second test (Test 3b) a slightly different CIBR Implementation is
used, which differs in that it renders First Order Ambisonics from a four-
channel audio signal in the ESD format. The remaining signal chain is the same
as above, however the sixteen channel signals are replaced with four-channel
signals. The ResonanceAudioMonitorVST was also recompiled to use First Order
Ambisonics as input and rendering.
##### 7.1.4.4.2.5 System under test {#system-under-test .H6}
The system under test is the example external binaural renderer specified in
OMAF 3D Audio candidate [14] annex X. For implementation reasons in the
Max/MSP test framework, VST plugins were used where possible. The SuT accepts
the input from the external renderer interface as channels, objects, and HOA
(as ESD) and associated metadata and renders them as outlined in OMAF 3D Audio
candidate [14] annex X. The \'GBR\' (Generic Binaural Renderer) VST plugin and
the ambiX plugins are used to implement the system described in OMAF 3D Audio
candidate [14] annex X. The input folder includes text files which give
information on the position of each audio channel to be rendered, as well as a
file describing the type of HOA included in the item, if one is included. This
information is parsed and routed so that the positional information is
received by the GBR VST and the HOA information is received by both the GBR
VST and Ambisonics decoders. Information on the order of the HOA in ESD format
is used to determine which ESD-to-HOA matrix should be used for conversion to
a 3rd order Ambisonics. Audio for channels and objects is fed directly to the
GBR VST, whereas the Ambisonics signals are first fed to a the ambiX decoder
using the correct encoder matrix to convert to HOA3. The HOA3 signals are
rotated in the Ambisonics domain using the ambiX rotator VST plugin, before
being converted back to ESD using the ambiX decoder VST plugin for binaural
rendering inside the GBR VST. To avoid a double head-rotation, the head-
rotation in GBR is disabled for channels containing Ambisonics audio.
The HRIR used for both the System under Test and the CIBR is the SADIE KU100
[13]. Due to loudness differences, as outlined in clause 7.1.4.4.2.8, the
level of the HRIRs for the SuT was increased by 1.5 dB.
A diagram of how the system under test was integrated is shown in Figure
7.1.11.
{width="6.288194444444445in" height="1.9444444444444444in"}
Figure 7.1.11: Implementation of the system under test from Fraunhofer IIS
##### 7.1.4.4.2.6 HRIR {#hrir .H6}
The current Google Resonance Plugins do not provide a simple method for
switching the HRIR set. Because the HRIR set will be kept the same between the
two binaural rendering conditions, the binaural renderer under test will be
configured with the Neumann KU100 binaural head HRIR set from the SADIE
database [13].
##### 7.1.4.4.2.7 Equalization {#equalization .H6}
The headphone equalization in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6.7, has been omitted
due to unavailability of equalization filters for the combination of the
BeyerdynamicÂ® DT 990 Pro^TM^ headphones and Neumann KU100 dummy head when the
tests were conducted.
##### 7.1.4.4.2.8 Loudness adjustment {#loudness-adjustment .H6}
A preliminary test was conducted with six listeners to investigate the
suitability of the test administration system platform for conducting Test 3.
The preliminary test consisted of 12 items and the system under test is as
described in OMAF 3D Audio candidate [14] annex X. The preliminary test showed
that overall, the CIBR implementation for HOA3 and FOA was louder than the
system under test. To combat this in the final tests, the level of the system
under test was increased by 1.5dB to match the overall level of the CIBR
implementations.
##### 7.1.4.4.3 Test results
In accordance to the Test 3 specification in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2], the System
under Test was compared to the two CIBR variants, against the HOA3 CIBR and
the FOA CIBR.
Figure 7.1.12 shows mean ratings of the comparison of the System under Test
and the HOA3 CIBR with 95% confidence interval (computed assuming normally
distributed data and applying a t-distribution) for each item as well as
pooled over all items. Table 7.1.10 provides the numbered results for Test 3a.

for both HOA3 and FOA CIBR implementations for the _Timbre_ , _Spatial
Quality_ , and _Basic Audio Quality_ scales. On the _Artefacts_ scale, the SuT
is not worse than the CIBR. The assessors rated the CIBR FOA louder than the
SuT and the SuT louder than the CIBR HOA3.
# 8 spAACe test results
## 8.1 Qualcomm test results on Test 1
### 8.1.1 Introduction and experimental design
ITU-R recommends that the \"testing, evaluation and reporting procedures given
in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] be used for the subjective assessment of intermediate
audio quality\". ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] has also been previously used in other
standardization activities pertaining to spatial audio coding such as the
MPEG-H standardization. To provide an understanding of what quality levels can
be achieved with spAACe at the bit-rates of 256 kbps, 384 kbps and 512 kbps,
the Codec Quality Characterization Test described in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause
5 was conducted.
In this experiment, 3 different bit-rates were tested with 20 different test
materials covering object-based, scene-based (up to 6th order HOA), channel-
based audio and a combination of these formats.
The experimental design was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.2. The
experiment was divided in two sessions, each session covering 10 test
materials.
### 8.1.2 Selection of assessors
The selection of Assessors was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.3.
Participants were all members of Qualcomm Advanced Tech R&D group and familiar
with critical listening and audio quality evaluation. 10 assessors were
selected following pre- and post-screening processes.
### 8.1.3 Test materials
The test materials included twenty different signals covering a range of audio
content typical of Virtual Reality such as vocals, orchestra music, nature
sounds, etc. Each of the three different bit rates was tested with each of the
twenty different signals.
### 8.1.4 Presentation interface
The ARL STEP software v.2.04 was used for presentation of the samples and
collection of results.
### 8.1.5 Listening environment
The listening environment was a critical listening room compliant to 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 5.6.
### 8.1.6 Listening system
The listening system was loudspeaker-based (GenelecÂ® 8240A SAM^TM^
loudspeakers) with a setup according to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 5.7.
### 8.1.7 Listening level
The listening level was adjusted according to the requirements in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 5.8.
### 8.1.8 Generation of anchor/reference and test conditions
The signal processing chain for generation of the Test Conditions is shown in
Figure 8.1.1. Consistent with the requirements in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause
5.9, the Hidden Reference was generated following a similar chain but with all
encoding/decoding operations bypassed, i.e. only the Reference Rendering
operations were enabled. The Anchors were generated from the Hidden Reference
by low-passing the signals at 3.5 kHz and 7 kHz.
{width="6.291666666666667in" height="3.5118055555555556in"}
Figure 8.1.1: Signal processing chain for generation of the test conditions
The technical details are as follows :
\- The LFE signal given in the hybrid content (LFE combined with objects
and/or HOA) was mapped to CH#4 of the 7.1+4 layout via the LFE Mapper block.
For Test 2, the LFE signal given in the hybrid content was panned to the
nominal angular direction of the LFE loudspeaker in the ESD speaker layout by
means of VBAP [16].
\- HOA (SN3D/ACN) was rendered to 7.1+4 using the HOA rendering matrices for
HOA orders N=3, N=4, N=6 which are shown in Table 8.1.1, Table 8.1.2 and Table
8.1.3, respectively.
\- Audio objects were rendered to 7.0+4 and subsequently mapped to 7.1+4. This
was accomplished by means of the OBJ Mapper block, which takes the output of
the 7.0+4 as an input and it outputs a set of signals for the 7.1+4 where CH#4
(the LFE channel) contains silence.
\- Actual bit-rates for all 20 test items are listed in Table 8.1.4.

## 8.2 Qualcomm test results on Test 2
### 8.2.1 Introduction and experimental design
ITU-R recommends that the \"testing, evaluation and reporting procedures given
in ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] be used for the subjective assessment of intermediate
audio quality\". ITU-R BS.1534-3 [3] has also been previously used in other
standardization activities pertaining to spatial audio coding such as the
MPEG-H standardization. To provide an understanding of what quality levels can
be achieved with spAACe at the bit-rates of 256 kbps, 384 kbps and 512 kbps,
the Codec Quality Characterization Test described in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause
5 was conducted and described in clause 8.2 (Test 1). However, because in Test
1 the reference condition passes through the rendering stage of the audio
profile (potentially discarding important audio content), a test with a Common
Informative Binaural Renderer is strongly recommended. Results of the Codec
Quality Characterization Test with the Common Informative Binaural Renderer
described in 3GPP TS 26.118 [9] clause 4.5 are reported.
In this experiment, 3 different bit-rates were tested with 20 different test
materials covering object-based, scene-based (up to 6th order HOA), channel-
based audio and a combination of these formats.
The experimental design was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7.2. The
experiment was divided in two sessions, each session covering 10 test
materials.
### 8.2.2 Selection of assessors
The selection of Assessors was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7.3.
Participants were all members of Qualcomm Advanced Tech R&D group and familiar
with critical listening and audio quality evaluation. 11 assessors were
selected following pre- and post-screening processes.
### 8.2.3 Test materials
The test materials included twenty different signals covering a range of audio
content typical of Virtual Reality such as vocals, orchestra music, nature
sounds, etc. Each of the three different bit rates was tested with each of the
twenty different signals.
### 8.2.4 Presentation interface
The ARL STEP software v.2.04 was used for presentation of the samples and
collection of results.
### 8.2.5 Listening environment
The listening environment noise floor was compliant to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2]
clause 7.6.
### 8.2.6 Listening system
Compliant to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 7.7, the listening system was
headphone-based using a SennheiserÂ® HD 800^TM^ headphone equalized for the
Neumann KU100 (same head simulator used for the HRTF database).
### 8.2.7 Headphone impulse response measurement
A custom MATLAB script for the acquisition of acoustic impulse responses was
used to measure the two SennheiserÂ® HD 800^TM^ headphone drivers with the
internal microphones of a Neumann KU100 HATS. A 2.25-second-long logarithmic
sine sweep ranging from 20Hz to 22kHz was used to make the measurements. Each
driver\'s impulse response was measured as the time averaged response over
five repeated measurements. To mitigate intra-subject variability, the
headphones were removed and replaced between repetitions. After averaging, the
impulse response for each driver was truncated to 16,384 samples and windowed
by a Tukey window with a taper ratio of 0.7 (generated with the MATLAB
function tukeywin). Finally, the two-channel impulse response matrix was
normalized to have a maximum absolute sample value of 1 and saved as a WAV
file.
### 8.2.8 Headphone compensation filter generation
Compensation filters for the left and right drivers of the SennheiserÂ® HD
800^TM^ reference headphones were generated using the impulse responses
described in clause 8.2.7. The filter design procedure was accomplished in
MATLAB, leveraging the AKregulatedInversion method in the AKTools MATLAB
toolbox [17]. Regularized least mean squares inversion was used to generate 16
384 sample FIR filters. 1/6th octave smoothed inverted copies of the original
headphone impulse responses were used as the regularization curves with Î²=0.2.
The resulting minimum phase inverse filters were fit to a target function
defined by a 2nd order 40 Hz highpass filter cascaded with a 1st order 20 kHz
lowpass filter. Finally, the compensation filters were smoothed by 1/6th
octave band, windowed in the time domain to a length of 256 samples, and saved
to WAV files for future use.
### 8.2.9 Listening level
The listening level was adjusted according to the requirements in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 7.8.
### 8.2.10 Generation of anchor/reference and test conditions
The signal processing chain for generation of the Test Conditions is shown in
Figure 8.2.1. Consistent with the requirements in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause
7.9, the Hidden Reference was generated following a similar chain but with all
encoding/decoding operations bypassed, i.e. only the Reference Rendering
operations were enabled. The Anchors were generated from the Hidden Reference
by low-passing the signals at 3.5 kHz and 7 kHz.

Figure 8.2.1: Signal processing chain for generation of the test conditions
for Test 2
Technical details are as follows:
\- HOA (SN3D/ACN) was rendered to the Equivalent Spatial Domain (ESD) by means
of the inverse of the ESD-to-N3 matrix specified in Annex A. Where applicable,
the HOA content (whose order was larger than N=3) was truncated to N=3 before
rendering it to the ESD16 format. The angular directions of the ESD virtual
loudspeakers are defined in 3GPP TS 26.260 [15].
\- The CIBR binauralisation engine, described in 3GPP TS 26.118 [9] clause 4.5
was implemented.
\- In all Tests, audio objects were rendered to the target playback layouts by
means of the VBAP method described in [16]. The metadata used by the object
renderer implemented for these tests are azimuth, elevation, and gain factor.
\- The headphone compensation filters used (indicated by the blocks HPCompL
and HPCompR in Figure 8.2.1) were obtained by the procedure described in the
Headphone Compensation Filter Generation paragraph above.
\- Bit-rates for all contents are the same as described above.
### 8.2.11 Attributes
Participants were asked to consider all perceptual differences between the
systems under test and the reference signal when scoring the _Basic Audio
Quality_.
### 8.2.12 Presentation of results

## 8.3 Qualcomm test results on Test 3
### 8.3.1 Introduction and experimental design
Consumption of Virtual Reality content is typically done over headphones with
head tracking. As the binaural renderer plays a large role in the audio
immersive experience, it is desired to have a test that can assess the
performance of the Reference Renderer of a VR audio profile. The test
described in 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6 fulfils this need. Results of the
Rendering Comparison Test against the Common Informative Binaural Renderer
described in 3GPP TS 26.118 [9] clause 4.5 are reported.
In the Renderer Comparison Test, the assessors compare a Test Condition
against Anchor Conditions on four audio quality Attributes. The presentation
of the Test and Anchor Conditions is binaural using head-tracking. For each
trial, the Test Condition is compared to one of the Anchor Conditions as an A
v. B comparison. To control for possible presentation order biases, the test
Conditions are presented to the assessors as sample A in exactly half of the
trials. The test was conducted with 12 Test Materials and two Anchors (CIBR
1st order and CIBR 3rd order) for a total of 24 trials.
The test was divided in two sessions. The first session compared the Reference
Renderer against the first Anchor and the second session compared the
Reference Renderer against the second Anchor.
Because the Reference Renderer chosen for the spAACe audio profile is the CIBR
3rd order, the result of the comparison to the second Anchor is trivial (see
results clause 8.3.12).
### 8.3.2 Selection of assessors
The selection of Assessors was consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6.3.
Participants were all members of Qualcomm Advanced Tech R&D group and familiar
with critical listening and audio quality evaluation. 13 assessors were
selected following pre- and post-screening processes.
### 8.3.3 Test materials
The test materials included twenty different signals covering a range of audio
content typical of Virtual Reality such as vocals, orchestra music, nature
sounds, etc. Each of the three different bit rates was tested with each of the
twenty different signals.
### 8.3.4 Presentation interface
A custom interface in Max/MSP was developed for the purposes of this
experiment as depicted in Figure 8.3.1.

### 8.3.5 Listening environment
The listening environment noise floor was compliant to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2]
clause 6.6.
### 8.3.6 Listening system
Compliant to 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6.7, the listening system was
headphone-based using a SennheiserÂ® HD 800^TM^ headphone equalized for the
Neumann KU100 (same head simulator used for the HRTF database).
### 8.3.7 Headphone impulse response measurement
A custom MATLAB script for the acquisition of acoustic impulse responses was
used to measure the two SennheiserÂ® HD 800^TM^ headphone drivers with the
internal microphones of a Neumann KU100 HATS. A 2.25-second-long logarithmic
sine sweep ranging from 20 Hz to 22 kHz was used to make the measurements.
Each driver\'s impulse response was measured as the time averaged response
over five repeated measurements. To mitigate intra-subject variability, the
headphones were removed and replaced between repetitions. After averaging, the
impulse response for each driver was truncated to 16 384 samples and windowed
by a Tukey window with a taper ratio of 0.7 (generated with the MATLAB

normalized to have a maximum absolute sample value of 1 and saved as a WAV
file.
### 8.3.8 Headphone compensation filter generation

800^TM^ reference headphones were generated using the impulse responses
described in clause 8.3.7. The filter design procedure was accomplished in
MATLAB, leveraging the AKregulatedInversion method in the AKTools MATLAB

to WAV files for future use.
### 8.3.9 Listening level
The listening level was adjusted according to the requirements in 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 6.8. It was observed that the CIBR 1st order had a level on
average 1dB louder than the CIBR 3rd order. Therefore, a 1dB level attenuation
was applied to the CIBR 1st order.
### 8.3.10 Generation of anchor/reference and test conditions
Generation of the test and reference conditions was consistent with 3GPP TS
26.259 [2] clause 6.9.
### 8.3.11 Attributes
Four attributes, _Timbre, Spatial, Artefacts_ and _Basic Audio Quality_ were
evaluated, consistent with 3GPP TS 26.259 [2] clause 6.11. In addition, a
_Loudness_ scale was also provided.
### 8.3.12 Presentation of results

###### ### Annex A: Proposed ESD conversion matrices
# A.1 Summary
As described in 3GPP TS.26.118 [9] clause 4.5.1.2, the Common Informative
Binaural Renderer (CIBR), includes a conversion of a set of audio signals from
the Equivalent Spatial Domain (ESD) to the Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA)
domain. Configuration files have been created for the AmbiX Decoder plugin
with the conversion matrices in ACN/SN3D format and are documented in the
present annex for information.
# A.2 Processing description
The conversion matrices were computed based on the definition of the ESD
described in 3GPP TS 26.260 [15] clause 4.1.1.1.
Two configuration files are documented to facilitate the implementation of the
Common Informative Binaural Renderer for Test 2 and Test 3:
\- ESD-to-N1.config provides to convert the 1st order ESD to 1st Order
Ambisonics.
\- ESD-to-N3.config provides to convert the 3rd order ESD to 3rd Order
Ambisonics.
Source code of the configuration files is listed in the following clauses of
this Annex.
