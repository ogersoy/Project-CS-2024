Summary based on the input provided by Vodafone in SP-180883.
The 5G requirements have been defined in terms of new services and markets by
SA1, under the \"SMARTER\" work item. These are defined mostly in TS 22.261
[1], which describes different types of requirements for different 5G usage:
**\- Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB):** the new requirements -higher than for
4G- are specified for data-rates, traffic/connection density, user mobility,
etc. Various deployment and coverage scenarios are considered, addressing
different service areas (e.g., indoor/outdoor, urban and rural areas, office
and home, local and wide areas connectivity), and special deployments (e.g.,
massive gatherings, broadcast, residential, and high-speed vehicles). The
scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.1-1 of TS
22.261 [1]. For instance, for the downlink, data rate of up to 50 Mbps are
expected when outdoor and 1 Gbps when indoor (5GLAN), and half of these values
for the uplink. For services to an airplane, a bitrate of 1,2 Gbps is expected
per plane.
**\- Critical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency
Communications (URLLC)** : Several scenarios require the support of very low
latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by
the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency
depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G
system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data
processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself,
whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections
between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for
example, to allow local hosting of the services. The scenarios and their
performance requirements can be found in table 7.2.2-1 of TS 22.261 [1]. For
instance, in the context of remote control for process automation, a
reliability of 99,9999% is expected, with a user experienced data rate up to
100 Mbps and an end-to-end latency of 50 ms. This is provided in particular
through the Edge Computing capability described below.
**\- Massive Internet of Things (mIoT)**. Several scenarios require the 5G
system to support very high traffic densities of devices. The Massive Internet
of Things requirements include the operational aspects that apply to the wide
range of IoT devices and services anticipated in the 5G timeframe.
**\- Flexible network operations**. These are a set of specificities offered
by the 5G system, as detailed in the following sections. It covers aspects
such as network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse
mobility, security, efficient content delivery, and migration and
interworking.
This diversity of requirements, associated to the different categories of
usage described above, enables the use of the 5GS by different sectors of the
industry, referred to as \"verticals\". Some of these verticals are mentioned
in the annexes of TS 22.261 [1]:
\- Automotive and other transport (trains, maritime communications),
\- Transport, logistics, IoT,
\- Discrete automation,
\- Electricity distribution,
\- Public Safety,
\- Health and wellness,
\- Smart cities,
\- Media and entertainment.
Some of these aspects are further described in corresponding clauses of this
document: e.g. Railways, eV2X and its associated requirements as defined in TS
22.186 [10], etc.
As for the migration path, the 5G system supports, in addition to the new
5G-specific services, all the former EPS (4G) capabilities that were defined
in TS 22.278 [2] and in TSs 22.011 [3], 22.101 [4], 22.185 [5], 22.071 [6],
22.115 [7], 22.153 [8], 22.173 [9]. There are some exceptions, i.e. some 4G
services are not supported in 5G: they relate to the interworking with legacy
systems, as specified in clause 5.1.2.2 of TS 22.261. Finally, mobility
between a 5G core network and an EPC (4G) is supported, with minimum impact to
the user experience.
NOTE: In this document, EPS and all the other concepts related to LTE, such as
\"LTE Advanced Pro\", will be referred to as \"4G\", although this is not an
official 3GPP terminology.

## 5.3 Overview of the 5GS architecture

Summary based on the inputs provided by China Mobile, Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei
in SP-180595, by Vodafone in SP-180883 and by NTT DOCOMO, INC. in RP-181724.
### 5.3.1 Introduction
As seen above, 5G is designed to support diverse services with different data
traffic profiles (e.g., high throughput, low latency and massive connections)
and models (e.g., IP data traffic, non-IP data traffic, short data bursts and
high throughput data transmissions). Various PDU session types are supported
including IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet and Unstructured.
The 5G\'s main characteristic is the introduction of a new radio interface,
the New Radio (NR), which offers the flexibility needed to support these very
different types of services.
Another key characteristic of 5G is that the 5G Access Network can connect not
only to a new 5G Core Network but also to the 4G (LTE) Core Network. This is
known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called
the SA architecture.
On the Core Network side, the 5G System offers also a wide array of new
characteristics, such as a deeper use of Network Slicing, Mobile Edge
Computing or Network Capability Exposure. All these concepts are presented
below.
### 5.3.2 The NSA versus SA architecture
Two deployment options are defined for 5G:
\- the \"Non-Stand Alone\" (NSA) architecture, where the 5G Radio Access
Network (AN) and its New Radio (NR) interface is used in conjunction with the
existing LTE and EPC infrastructure Core Network (respectively 4G Radio and 4G
Core), thus making the NR technology available without network replacement. In
this configuration, only the 4G services are supported, but enjoying the
capacities offered by the 5G New Radio (lower latency, etc). The NSA is also
known as \"E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC)\" or \"Architecture Option 3\".
See also the clause on EDCE5.
\- the \"Stand-Alone\" (SA) architecture, where the NR is connected to the 5G
CN. Only in this configuration, the full set of 5G Phase 1 services are
supported.
The NSA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.
{width="4.709027777777778in" height="2.6305555555555555in"}
Figure 5.3.2-1: The NSA Architecture
The NSA architecture can be seen as a temporary step towards \"full 5G\"
deployment, where the 5G Access Network is connected to the 4G Core Network.
In the NSA architecture, the (5G) NR base station (logical node \"en-gNB\")
connects to the (4G) LTE base station (logical node \"eNB\") via the X2
interface. The X2 interface was introduced prior to Release 15 to connect two
eNBs. In Release 15, it also supports connecting an eNB and en-gNB as to
provide NSA.
The NSA offers dual connectivity, via both the 4G AN (E-UTRA) and the 5G AN
(NR). It is thus also called \"EN-DC\", for \"E-UTRAN and NR Dual
Connectivity\".
In EN-DC, the 4G\'s eNB is the Master Node (MN) while the 5G\'s en-gNB is the
Secondary Node (SN).
This is explained in detail on the dedicated section on NSA of this present
document.
The SA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.
{width="3.9451388888888888in" height="1.7819444444444446in"}
Figure 5.3.3-1: The SA Architecture
The SA architecture can be seen as the \"full 5G deployment\", not needing any
part of a 4G network to operate.
The NR base station (logical node \"gNB\") connects with each other via the Xn
interface, and the Access Network (called the \"NG-RAN for SA architecture\")
connects to the 5GC network using the NG interface.
The continuation of this section refers to the SA architecture, the NSA being
addressed in a subsequent, dedicated, section.
### 5.3.3 Overview of the Core Network
In the SA deployment option, the 5G System (5GS) is composed of the User
Equipment, the Access Network (including the \"New Radio\" or NR) and the Core
Network (5GC or 5GCN).
The service requirements, as presented in the previous clause, were used as a
basis to define the architecture. The architecture specification (a.k.a. Stage
2) started with a preliminary study in TR 23.799 [4], also called \"NextGen
TR\", before being fully specified in TS 23.501 [1], TS 23.502 [2] and TS
23.503 [3].
The 5GC architecture relies on a so-called \"Service-Based Architecture\"
(SBA) framework, where the architecture elements are defined in terms of
\"Network Functions\" (NFs) rather than by \"traditional\" Network Entities.
Via interfaces of a common framework, any given NF offers its services to all
the other authorized NFs and/or to any \"consumers\" that are permitted to
make use of these provided services. Such an SBA approach offers modularity
and reusability.
The basic (SA, non-roaming) 5G System architecture is shown below (figure
introduced by the editor):
{width="3.6533497375328086in" height="2.234186351706037in"}
Figure 5.3.3-1: Overview of the 5G System architecture
At this stage, only the following essential Network Functions and elements are
highlighted here:
\- The User Equipment (UE);
\- The (Radio) Access Network [(R)AN];
\- The User Plane Function (UPF), handling the user data;
\- The (external) Data Network (DN);
\- Some remarkable Network Functions (NFs):
\- The Application Function (AF), handling the application(s);
\- The Access and Mobility management Function (AMF), that accesses the UE and
the (R)AN;
\- The Session Management Function (SMF), that accesses the UPF.
The other NFs are introduced later.
The SBA approach enables a virtualized deployment. Indeed, a Network Function
instance can be deployed as fully distributed, fully redundant, stateless
and/or fully scalable. Several Network Function instances can be present
within a same NF set. Conversely, the services can be provided from several
locations.
In other words, when the services of a specific NF are invoked, this
virtualization enables to route the UE\'s messages to any capable entity
(within a pre-defined set of equivalent NFs).
This provides resiliency: any specific instance of the NF can e.g. be turned
off for planned maintenance, and there will be auto-recovery without any
service disruption.
### 5.3.4 Overview of the Access Network
As a first approach, the architecture of the 5G AN is extremely simple since
it consists in one single entity, the gNB, which connects to the 5G CN via the
NG interface. It may also connect to another gNB via the Xn interface and/or
to the 4G\'s eNB via the X2 interface, as shown below in the editor-proposed
picture inspired from TS 38.401 [5] and TS 38.420 [6]. It also connects to the
UE via the NR interface, not shown on the figure. Note that this AN
architecture is rather similar in its principle to what was developed for LTE
with the eNB, as can be seen in TS 36.401 [7].

### 5.5.1 Functional split between Radio and Core
Further to the overall architecture provided above, this clause goes deeper in
the functionalities provided by the Core Network (AMF, SMF, etc.) and the ones
in the Access Network, i.e. provided by the gNB.
Figure 2-1 of TS 23.501 [1] shows some of the different NFs:
Figure 5.5.1-1: The 5G System architecture
Some NFs are specific to some network aspects and will be presented below,
such as the Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF), the Authentication Server
Function (AUSF) or the Policy Control Function (PCF). The security-related
NFs, i.e. SEAF, AUSF, ARPF, SEPP, are (also) presented in the section on 5G
Security.
The NFs exchanging information on the AN/CN interface are, on the Core Network
side, the AMF, UPF and SMF, and, on the Access Network side, the gNB. These
NFs are shown in the figure below in yellow boxes while the white boxes depict
the main tasks they perform.
Figure 5.5.1-2: Functional Split between NG-RAN and 5GC
On the Core Network side, the AMF (\"Access and Mobility management
Function\") oversees all the signalling which is not specific to User Data,
such as mobility or security. The SMF (\"Session Management Function\"), takes
care of the signalling related to User Data traffic, such as session
establishment. Finally, The UPF (\"User Plane Function\") represents the
handling of user data.
On the Access Network side, the gNB (5G Node B) performs all the main AN-
related tasks, including Radio Resource Management: Radio Bearer Control,
Radio Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic allocation of
resources to UEs, etc.
### 5.5.2 The 5G Core Network
#### 5.5.2.1 Main NFs
The AMF (Access and Mobility management Function) support UEs with different
mobility management needs. It performs the following main tasks:
\- The Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signalling termination;
\- The NAS signalling security;
\- The Access Stratum (AS) Security control;
\- Inter CN node signalling for mobility between 3GPP access networks;
\- Idle mode UE Reachability (including control and execution of paging
retransmission);
\- Registration Area management;
\- Support of intra-system and inter-system mobility;
\- Access Authentication;
\- Access Authorization including check of roaming rights;
\- Mobility management control (subscription and policies);
\- Support of Network Slicing;
\- SMF selection.
The SMF (Session Management Function) can support, together with the AMF,
customized mobility management schemes such as \"Mobile Initiated Connection
Only\" (MICO) or RAN enhancements like \"RRC Inactive\" state. It performs the
following main tasks:
\- Session Management;
\- UE IP address allocation and management;
\- Selection and control of UPF;
\- Configures traffic steering at UPF to route traffic to proper destination;
\- Control part of policy enforcement and QoS;
\- Downlink Data Notification.
The UPF (User Plane Function) performs the following main tasks:
\- Anchor point for Intra-/Inter-RAT mobility (when applicable);
\- External PDU session point of interconnect to Data Network;
\- Packet routing & forwarding;
\- Packet inspection and User plane part of Policy rule enforcement;
\- Traffic usage reporting;
\- Uplink classifier to support routing traffic flows to a data network;
\- Branching point to support multi-homed PDU session;
\- QoS handling for user plane, e.g. packet filtering, gating, UL/DL rate
enforcement;
\- Uplink Traffic verification (SDF to QoS flow mapping);
\- Downlink packet buffering and downlink data notification triggering.
The other main Network Functions are:
\- The \"Network Repository Function\" (NRF): it provides support for NF
services management including registration, deregistration, authorization and
discovery.
\- The \"Network Exposure Function\" (NEF): it provides external exposure of
the capabilities of the network functions. External exposure can be
categorized as Monitoring capability, Provisioning capability, Application
influence of traffic routing and Policy/Charging capability.
\- The \"Unified Data Management\" (UDM): the 5GC supports Data Storage
architecture for Compute and Storage separation. The Unified Data Repository
(UDR) is the master database. The Unstructured Data Storage Function (UDSF) is
introduced to store dynamic state data.
#### 5.5.2.2 Specificities of the 5G Core Network and associated NFs
##### 5.5.2.2.1 Local hosting of services and Edge Computing
As to support the very different types of services, 5G uses \"Service Hosting
Environment\", which is a service platform located inside of an operator\'s
network. It offers Hosted Services closer to the end user to meet specific
requirement like low latency, low bandwidth pressure. These Hosted Services
contain applications provided by operators and/or trusted third parties. It
also supports flexible user plane routing, so that user plane paths can be
selected or changed to improve the user experience or balance the network
load, when a UE or application changes location during an active
communication.
Local hosting of services is provided in particular through the Edge Computing
capability. Edge computing is the possibility for an operator and/or a 3rd
party to execute the services close to the UE\'s access point of attachment.
This reduces the end-to-end latency and the load on the transport network.
To enable this, the 5GCN selects a UPF close to the UE and executes the
traffic steering from the UPF to the local Data Network via a N6 interface.
Some of the Edge computing related features are:
\- Support concurrent (e.g. local and central) access to a data network, an
architectural enabler for low-latency services.
\- Application influence on traffic routing.
\- Support of URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low-Latency) services.
\- Support for different Session and Service Continuity modes.
\- Support of Local Area Data Network.
##### 5.5.2.2.2 Network slicing
A network slice is a (set of) element(s) of the network specialised in the
provisioning of a certain (type of) service(s). For example, there can be one
network slice for IoT, another one for supporting \"classic\" UEs and another
one for V2X. More generally, there can be different requirements on
functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), differences in performance
requirements (e.g., latency, mobility and data rates), or they can serve only
specific types of users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate
customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO). The different slices can be used
simultaneously.
End-to-end Network slicing is a major characteristic of the 5G System. It is
supported by every deployed PLMN to the extent necessary to interoperate with
other PLMNs, e.g. the IoT slice from operator A can interconnect directly with
the IoT slice of operator B. Based on business scenario, the operator can
decide how many network slices to deploy and what functions/features to share
across multiple slices.
The characteristics of each slice are defined in terms of QoS, bit rate,
latency, etc. For a given slice, these characteristics are either predefined
in the 3GPP Standard or are operator-defined. There are three types of
predefined slices: type 1 is dedicated to the support of eMBB, type 2 is for
URLLC and type 3 is for MIoT support. These predefinitions allow inter-PLMN
operation with reduced coordination effort between operators. As for the
operator-defined slices, they enable more differentiation among network
slices.
A dedicated NF is introduced for slices handling: the \"Network Slice
Selection Function\" (NSSF), which enables the selection of the appropriate
slice(s). The UEs may use multiple Network Slices simultaneously. The Network
Slice Selection policies in the UE links applications to Network slices.
Network slicing also supports roaming scenarios. Finally, Network Slicing
Interworking with EPS (with or without 4G\'s Dedicated Core Networks Selection
Mechanism (e)DECOR) is possible.
##### 5.5.2.2.3 Unified access control
When congestion occurs in the 5G System, different criteria are used to
determine which access attempt should be allowed or blocked. These criteria
depend on operator policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and
available services. The 5G system provides a single Unified Access Control,
where operators control access attempts based on these criteria associated
with the so-called \"Access Identities and Access Categories\".
The Unified Access Control allows for categorizing each UE access attempt into
one Access Category. The network can restrict the UE access on a per-access
category basis.
The 5GS also offers Mobility Management Congestion Control, DNN-based
Congestion Control and network slice-based Congestion Control.
##### 5.5.2.2.4 Support of 3GPP and non-3GPP access
The 5G system supports the 3GPP access technologies, including one or more of
5G\'s NR and 4G\'s E-UTRA. It can also support non-3GPP access technologies,
even non-trusted ones.
For optimization and resource efficiency, the 5G system can select the most
appropriate 3GPP or non-3GPP access technology for a service, potentially
allowing multiple access technologies to be used simultaneously for one or
more services active on a UE. Seamless mobility among different access is also
supported.
The NF called \"Authentication Server Function \"(AUSF) enables a unified
framework for 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses.
When it is registered via both 3GPP and non-3GPP access, the UE is identified
by a single 5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (5G-GUTI).
##### 5.5.2.2.5 Policy framework and QoS support
A policy framework is supported for Session, Access and Mobility control, QoS
and charging enforcement, as well as policy provisioning in the UE.
The UE uses two mechanisms linked to QoS and policy:
\- The UE Route Selection Policy (URSP), as to determine if a detected
application can be associated with an established PDU Session, can be
offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU Session, or can trigger the
establishment of a new PDU Session.
\- The Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP), to select non-3GPP
accesses.
URSP and ANDSP are delivered from the network\'s Policy Control Function (PCF)
to the UE through signalling.
In the network, the NF \"Network Data Analytics Function\" (NWDAF) is
introduced to provide data analytics support, i.e. to provide the load of each
network slice.
As for QoS, the system defines a flow-based QoS framework, with two basic
modes: with or without QoS-dedicated signalling. For the option without any
specific QoS signalling flows, the standardized packet marking is applied,
which informs the QoS enforcement functions what QoS to provide. The option
with QoS-dedicated negotiation offers more flexibility and QoS support for
finer granularity. Also, a new QoS type is introduced: \"Reflective QoS\",
where the UE requests for the uplink traffic the same QoS rules as the ones it
received for the downlink. In this mode, symmetric QoS differentiation over
downlink and uplink is supported with minimal control plane signalling.
##### 5.5.2.2.6 Network capability exposure
The Service Exposure and Enablement Support (SEES) and (enhanced) Flexible
Mobile Service Steering ((e)FMSS) features allow the operator to expose
network capabilities (e.g. QoS policy) to third party ISPs/ICPs.
In 5G, new network capabilities are exposed to the third-party e.g. to allow
the third-party to customize a dedicated network slice for diverse use cases;
to allow the third-party to manage a trusted third-party application in a
Service Hosting Environment to improve user experience, and efficiently
utilize backhaul and application resources.
About Network capability exposure, see also the clause on \"Northbound APIs\".
##### 5.5.2.2.7 Other specific services
The following services are also supported by 5GS:
\- Short Message Service (SMS). This is supported by \"SMS over NAS\"
(including over non-3GPP access).
\- IP-Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and its services, although, this might not be
available in all initial 5G deployments. If IMS services are invoked by a UE
connected to an IMS-less 5GS, this triggers a network-based handover towards
an appropriate RAT and related EPS. This applies also to the support of IMS
emergency services.
\- Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN), in which a RAN is shared by multiple
core networks.
\- Public Warning System (PWS). This is supported by either using Service-
based interfaces between the Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC) Function (CBCF) and
the AMF, or using an interworking function between the CBC and the AMF.
\- Multimedia Priority Services (MPS). They are supported by MPS-specific
exemptions for 5GS mobility management and 5GS session management.
\- Mission Critical Services (MCS). They are supported by having a
subscription in place for both 5G QoS profile and the necessary policies. Some
standardized QoS characteristics are defined for MCS.
\- PS Data Off. The 5G\'s \"PS data off\" functionality is backward-compatible
and provides Control Plane Load Control, Congestion and Overload control. This
includes AMF Load balancing, AMF Load-rebalancing, TNL (Transport Network
Layer between 5GC and 5G-AN) Load (re-)balancing, as well as AMF Overload
Control, SMF Overload Control.
It has to be noted that, in 5GS Phase 1, Location Services are optional and
restricted to regulatory (emergency) services.
##### 5.5.2.2.8 Other 5G specificities
Steering of roaming of UEs in a VPLMN allows the HPLMN to provide and update a
list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations to the UE when roaming
in a VPLMN. This is achieved using the configuration in the USIM or providing
it via NAS signalling.
Interworking between the 5GS and 4G is supported, where 4G is an E-UTRAN
connected to the EPC. This is enabled by evolved Packet Data Gateways (ePDGs)
connected to the EPC and the 5G System.
Security Edge Protection Proxies (SEPP) are used to secure and hide the
topology for inter-PLMN interconnection.

Summary based on the inputs provided by China Mobile, Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei
in SP-180595.
The services provided by 5G NFs are designed as a set of APIs based on the
following protocol stack:
\- the transport layer protocol is TCP as specified in IETF RFC 793;
\- transport layer security protection is supported with TLS;
\- the application layer protocol is HTTP/2 as specified in IETF RFC 7540;
\- the serialization protocol is JSON as specified in IETF RFC 8259;
\- the OpenAPI 3.0.0 is adopted as the Interface Definition Language.
Figure 5.4.6-1: Service Based Interface Protocol Stack
To reduce the coupling between clients and servers, the RESTful framework is
applied for the APIs design as follows:
1) the REST-style service operations implement the Level 2 of the Richardson
maturity model;
2) Level 3 (HATEOAS) of the Richardson maturity model is optional.
OAuth2 (as specified in IETF RFC 6749) is used for authorization of NF service
access, with the NRF acting as the Authorization Server.
The Service Based Interfaces also support procedures for overload control and
message prioritisation.
PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) is used over the N4 interface for
the separation of Control Plane and User Plane in the 5GC. This is the same
protocol as supported for CUPS in EPC, with a few extensions to support all
the 5GC requirements (e.g. Ethernet traffic, QoS flows).
GTPv2 is used over the N26 interface for mobility between EPC and the 5GC.
This is the same protocol as supported over S10 in EPC, with minimal
extensions to support 5GS requirements (e.g. 5GS TAI, gNB ID).
For 5G network interworking with external DNs (i.e. N6 interface), those
protocols specified in TS 29.061 (IP, non-IP, DHCP, RADIUS and Diameter
protocols) are still applicable between the SMF/UPF and the external DNs with
possible adaptation. In addition, the Ethernet traffic is also supported by
the SMF/UPF for interworking with external DN.

### 5.5.3 The 5G Access Network
#### 5.5.3.1 Introduction
The figure below, extracted from TS 38.401, shows the overall architecture of
the Access Network:
Figure 5.5.3.1-1: Overall NG-RAN architecture
The NG-RAN consists of a set of gNBs connected to the 5GC through the NG
interface, based on (and very similar to) the LTE\'s S1 interface.
The gNB (5G Node B) can be connected to another gNB through the Xn interface,
based on (and very similar to) the LTE\'s X2 interface. The gNB may be further
split into a gNB-Central Unit (gNB-CU) and one or more gNB- Distributed
Unit(s) (gNB-DU), linked by the F1 interface. One gNB-DU is connected to only
one gNB-CU. See also the section on the AN interfaces.
The gNB performs the following tasks:
\- Functions for Radio Resource Management: Radio Bearer Control, Radio
Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic allocation of
resources to UEs in both uplink and downlink (scheduling);
\- IP header compression, encryption and integrity protection of data;
\- Selection of an AMF at UE attachment when no routing to an AMF can be
determined from the information provided by the UE;
\- Routing of User Plane data towards UPF(s);
\- Routing of Control Plane information towards AMF;
\- Connection setup and release;
\- Scheduling and transmission of paging messages;
\- Scheduling and transmission of system broadcast information (originated
from the AMF or O&M);
\- Measurement and measurement reporting configuration for mobility and
scheduling;
\- Transport level packet marking in the uplink;
\- Session Management;
\- Support of Network Slicing;
\- QoS Flow management and mapping to data radio bearers;
\- Support of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state;
\- Distribution function for NAS messages;
\- Radio access network sharing;

#### 5.5.3.2 Overview of the AN Control Plane
The figure below shows the protocol stack for the control plane, where:
\- The PHY layer (physical layer) is described in clause 5.5.5. Its role is
the modulation and demodulation of the signal on the radio interface;
\- The PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers (terminated in gNB on the network side)
perform the services listed in the clause on \"Layer 2 related aspects\";
\- The RRC (terminated in gNB on the network side) performs the services
listed in the clause on \"RRC related aspects\";
\- The NAS (Non-Access Stratum) control protocol (terminated in AMF on the
network side) refers to all the aspects and protocols not linked to the Access
Network and transported \"transparently\" by the Access Network, i.e. without
interpretation. These are the services listed in TS 23.501 such as
authentication, mobility management and security control.

#### 5.5.3.5 The Access Network interfaces
##### 5.5.3.5.1 Overview
The different AN interfaces are depicted above. These are Xn, NG and F1.
Each interface includes its own management handling: setup, reset, error
indication, removal (for Xn only).
The other functions transiting on each interface are detailed below.
##### 5.5.3.5.2 The Xn and X2 interfaces
The 5G\'s Xn interface is strongly related to its equivalent 4G interface, the
X2 interface. The X2 is updated to include the following added functions:
\- The E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity function. This function allows the eNB to
request another en-gNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while
keeping responsibility for that UE.
\- Secondary RAT Data Usage Report function. This function allows eNB to get
the uplink and downlink data volumes for the Secondary RAT on a per E-RAB
basis.
The XnAP protocol provides the following functions:
\- Xn configuration data update function. This function allows two NG-RAN
nodes to update application level data at any time.
\- Handover preparation function. This function allows the exchange of
information between source and target NG-RAN nodes in order to initiate the
handover of a certain UE to the target.
\- Handover cancellation function. This function allows informing an already
prepared target NG-RAN node that a prepared handover will not take place. It
allows releasing the resources allocated during a preparation.
\- Retrieve UE Context function. The Retrieve UE context function is used for
a NG-RAN node to retrieve UE context from another one.
\- RAN Paging function. The RAN paging function allows a NG-RAN node to
initiate the paging for a UE in the inactive state.
\- Data Forwarding control function. The data forwarding control function
allows establishing and releasing transport bearers between source and target
NG-RAN nodes for data forwarding.
\- Energy saving function. This function enables decreasing energy consumption
by indication of cell activation/deactivation over the Xn interface.
##### 5.5.3.5.3 The NG and S1 interfaces
The 5G\'s NG interface is strongly related to its equivalent 4G interface, the
S1 interface. The S1 is updated to include the following added function: the
Report of Secondary RAT data volumes function. The functionality enables the
eNB to report Secondary RAT data usage information in case of EN-DC.
The NGAP protocol provides the following functions:
\- Paging function. The paging function supports the sending of paging
requests to the NG-RAN nodes involved in the paging area e.g. the NG-RAN nodes
of the TA(s) the UE is registered.
\- UE Context Management function. The UE Context management function allows
the AMF to establish, modify or release a UE Context in the AMF and the NG-RAN
node e.g. to support user individual signalling on NG.
\- Mobility Management function. The mobility function for UEs in ECM-
CONNECTED includes the intra-system handover function to support mobility
within NG-RAN and inter-system handover function to support mobility from/to
EPS system. It comprises the preparation, execution and completion of handover
via the NG interface.
\- PDU Session Management function. The PDU Session function is responsible
for establishing, modifying and releasing the involved PDU sessions NG-RAN
resources for user data transport once a UE context is available in the NG-RAN
node.
\- NAS Transport function. The NAS Signalling Transport function provides
means to transport or reroute a NAS message (e.g. for NAS mobility management)
for a specific UE over the NG interface.
\- NAS Node Selection function. The interconnection of NG-RAN nodes to
multiple AMFs is supported in the 5GS architecture. Therefore, a NAS node
selection function is located in the NG-RAN node to determine the AMF
association of the UE, based on the UE\'s temporary identifier, which was
assigned to the UE by the AMF. When the UE\'s temporary identifier has not
been yet assigned or is no longer valid the NG-RAN node may instead take into
account slicing information to determine the AMF. This functionality is
located in the NG-RAN node and enables proper routing via the NG interface. On
NG, no specific procedure corresponds to the NAS Node Selection Function.
\- Warning Message Transmission function. The warning message transmission
function provides means to transfer warning messages via NG interface or
cancel ongoing broadcast of warning messages. It also provides the capability
for the NG-RAN to inform the AMF that ongoing PWS operation has failed for one
or more areas, or that one or more areas may be reloaded by the CBC.
\- Configuration Transfer function. The Configuration Transfer function is a
generic mechanism that allows the request and transfer of RAN configuration
information (e.g. SON information) between two RAN nodes via the core network.
\- Trace function. Trace function provides means to control trace sessions in
the NG-RAN node.
\- AMF Management function. The AMF management function supports AMF planned
removal and AMF auto-recovery.
\- Multiple TNL Associations Support Function. When there are multiple TNL
associations between a NG-RAN node and an AMF, the NG-RAN node selects the TNL
association for NGAP signalling based on the usage and the weight factor of
each TNL association received from the AMF, and uses the TNL association. If
an AMF releases a TNL association, the NG-RAN node selects a new one
\- AMF Load Balancing function. The NG interface supports the indication by
the AMF of its relative capacity to the NG-RAN node in order to achieve load-
balanced AMFs within the pool area.
\- Location Reporting function. This function enables the AMF to request the
NG-RAN node to report the UE\'s current location, or the UE\'s last known
location with timestamp, or the UE\'s presence in a configured area of
interest.
\- AMF Re-allocation function. This function allows to redirect an initial
connection request issued by an NG-RAN node from an initial AMF towards a
target AMF selected by 5GC. In this case the NG-RAN node initiates an Initial
UE Message procedure over one NG interface instance and receives the first
downlink message to close the UE-associated logical connection over a
different NG interface instance.
##### 5.5.3.5.4 The F1 interface
The F1 interface is specified for the case where the en-gNB is further
subdivided into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU logical nodes. In this case, the gNB-CU
hosts the RRC and PDCP protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the RLC, MAC and PHY
functions.
The F1AP protocol provides the following functions:
\- System Information management function;
\- F1 UE context management function;
\- RRC message transfer function;
\- Paging function.
### 5.5.4 Radio Physical layer aspects
#### 5.5.4.1 Numerologies, waveform and frame structure
Similar to LTE, OFDM with Cyclic Prefix (CP) is used as the downlink (DL)
waveform for NR. In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink
(UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power
ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier
Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-
layer transmission only.
To cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier
frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in
the table below.
Table 5.5.4.1-1: NR channel bandwidth
Frequency range Frequency range Supported channel bandwidth [MHz]
* * *
FR1 410 MHz -- 7125 MHz 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 90, 100 FR2
24250 MHz -- 52600 MHz 50, 100, 200, 400
To allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with
different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the
centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are
(in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple
numerologies\".
A consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR
channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is
defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol
(time domain).
As for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting
in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.
{width="5.5064588801399825in" height="3.0687893700787403in"}
Figure 5.5.4.1-1: Frame structure in NR
In turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different
colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology. The figure shows the cases
of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the
full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15
kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS)
preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).
Table 5.5.4.1-2: Multiple numerologies in NR
Cyclic Prefix subcarrier spacing (SCS) [kHz] Number of subframes per radio
frame Number of slots per subframe Number of OFDM symbols per slot Applicable
frequency range
* * *
normal 15 10 1 14 FR1 normal 30 10 2 14 FR1 normal 60 10 4 14 FR1 and FR2
extended 60 10 4 12 FR1 and FR2 normal 120 10 8 14 FR2 normal 240 10 16 14 FR2
Note: Additional specific numerologies are defined for PRACH, as described in
Section 5.5.4.3.
Note that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is
approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells
having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM
symbols.
The OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS.
E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 Âµs and the
CP length is approximately 4.7 Âµs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the
OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz
SCS.
NR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the
case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol
in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either
downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change
dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.
Transmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases,
transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the
minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target
usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low
Latency) services.
#### 5.5.4.2 Physical Channels and Signals in NR

corresponding modulation and channel coding schemes.

(PAPR) of the UL transmission
The way these different channels are accessed and used is presented in the
following sections.
The different physical signals defined in NR are:

The way these different Reference Signals are used is also presented below.
#### 5.5.4.3 Initial access and mobility
The mobile phones synchronise to the mobile network by \"listening\" to the
Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), shown in
respectively blue and orange on the figure below (note that the figure shows
an \"NR-\" prefix which is omitted in the text). The vertical separations are
the Ressource Blocks (RB), as defined in the previous section, i.e. a group of
12 subcarriers. The horizontal separations are the OFDM symbols. Four OFDM
symbols together with 20 RBs form a so-called \"SS/PBCH (Synchronization
Signals/ Physical Broadcast Channel) block\".
{width="6.690972222222222in" height="1.3027777777777778in"}
Figure 5.5.4.3-1: a SS/PBCH block
The PSS and NSS are transmitted over 127 subcarriers, i.e. about 10.5 RBs.
(They are designed to carry the Physical Cell ID (PCID) selected from 1008
candidates.)
Once synchronised with the PSS and NSS, the mobiles can retrieve the full
SS/PBCH structure, and thus \"listen\" to the Physical Broadcast Channel
(PBCH) and its associated Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS).
The PBCH carries only the minimum system information necessary for initial
access, such as system frame number (SFN), initial configurations for PDCCH,
PDSCH and DM-RS, and information required to determine the frame timing such
as SS/PBCH block index and half-frame index. These are referred to as \"System
Information Block 1 (SIB1)\".
One or multiple SS/PBCH blocks can be transmitted by using transmission
beamforming within a half frame, with configurable periodicity from 5 ms to
160 ms. The maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks and the applicable subcarrier
spacing for SS/PBCH block transmission are dependent on the frequency range,
as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-1. They can be identical or different from the
subcarrier spacing used for other DL transmissions.

subcarrier spacing

SIB1 and other system information (SIB2 and onwards) are carried by PDSCH
which is scheduled by PDCCH. SIB1 contains necessary information to perform
random access procedure for initial access.
Note: PDCCH/PDSCH for SIB1 can be received by the UE before RRC connection
since they are based on default configuration (predefined and based on MIB).
Paging message is carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. Numerology
used for SIB1 transmission on a NR cell is indicated in master information
block (MIB) carried by PBCH and is commonly applied to transmissions for other
system information (SIB2 and onwards), Paging, Msg.2 (\"Message 2\", as
explained below) and Msg.4 transmissions on the same cell.
For random access in NR, a four-step procedure consisting of Msg.1, Msg.2,
Msg.3 and Msg.4 is defined. For Msg.1 i.e., PRACH transmission in random
access, NR supports two types of PRACH sequences as the preamble sequence:
\- one is based on long Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences of length 839 only
applicable to FR1 and
\- another is based on short ZC sequences of length 139 applicable to both FR1
and FR2.
Four different PRACH preamble formats based on the long ZC sequence are
defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format
as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-2.
In addition, nine different PRACH preamble formats based on the short ZC
sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH
preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-3.
Msg.2 and Msg.4 for random access are carried by PDSCH that are scheduled by
PDCCH.
Msg.3 for random access is carried by PUSCH which is scheduled by random
access response (RAR) in Msg.2 or PDCCH in case of retransmission.

For mobility measurement, SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized in NR.
SS/PBCH block based reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal
received quality (RSRQ) and signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) are
defined, and CSI-RS based RSRP, RSRQ and SINR are also defined. For radio link
monitoring (RLM), SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized as RLM reference
signal in NR. One or multiple SS/PBCH blocks and/or CSI-RS resources are
configured to be monitored to evaluate whether the radio link is in-sync
status (i.e., in good quality) or out-of-sync status.
#### 5.5.4.4 MIMO aspects
Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology to improve the
throughput. It uses multiple antenna both on the transmitter and on the
receiver sides, as to enable multi-layer data transmission. NR supports multi-
layer data transmission for a single UE (single-user MIMO) with a maximum of
eight transmission layers for DL and four for UL. NR also supports multi-layer
data transmission with multiple UEs on different layers (multi-user MIMO) with
a maximum of twelve transmission layers for DL and UL transmission.
Reference Signals (RSs) are specified assuming multi-layer transmissions. For
demodulation of date / control information for both uplink and downlink,
demodulation RS (DM-RS) is supported. For measurement of channel state
information of downlink, channel state information RS (CSI-RS) is supported.
CSI-RS is also used for mobility measurement, measurement of gNB transmission
beamforming, and frequency/time tracking. The CSI- RS used for the
frequency/time tracking is named as tracking RS (TRS). In high frequency
range, phase noise is a problem that degrades the transmission performance.
Phase tracking reference signal (PT-RS) is supported for PDSCH and PUSCH to
enable receiver to track the phase and mitigate the performance loss due to
the phase noise. For uplink channel sounding, sounding RS (SRS) is supported.
For UL multi-layer data transmission, both codebook based and non-codebook
based precoding is supported. In codebook based UL transmission, precoding
matrix applied for PUSCH transmission is selected by gNB. In non-codebook
based UL transmission, precoded multiple SRS are transmitted and then gNB
selects the desired transmission layers for PUSCH based on the reception of
the SRS.
Since NR supports multi beam operation where every signal/channel is
transmitted on directional beam, beamforming is an important technique for
achieving higher throughput and sufficient coverage especially in high
frequency range. For DL transmission beamforming, a gNB applies transmission
beamforming to SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS transmissions, and a UE measures
reference signal received power on physical layer (L1-RSRP) on the configured
SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS resource. The UE reports the SS/PBCH block or CSI-
RS resource with the maximum L1-RSRP value as a L1-RSRP beam reporting. The
gNB can decide gNB transmission beamforming for the UE based on the reported
L1-RSRP. For PDCCH/PDSCH transmission, gNB informs UE that gNB transmission
beamforming applied to a certain SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS resource is applied
to the PDCCH/PDSCH transmission so that UE can apply a reception beamforming
which fits into the gNB transmission beamforming. For UL transmission
beamforming, two mechanisms are supported. In one of the mechanisms, UE
transmits multiple SRS symbols with different UE transmission beamforming so
that gNB can measure them and can identify the best UE transmission
beamforming. In another mechanism, UE generates the UL transmission
beamforming which is same as the DL reception beamforming used for SS/PBCH
block or CSI-RS resource reception. In addition, beam failure recovery (BFR)
is supported to achieve quick recovery from the beam failure. UE can identify
the beam failure and informs gNB about the index of SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS
resource as new candidate beam.
For DL channel state information (CSI) acquisition, NR supports two precoding
matrix indicator (PMI) definitions, the type I and II codebooks providing
different levels of CSI granularity.
#### 5.5.4.5 PDCCH and PDSCH
PDCCH is used to carry Downlink Control Information (DCI), and following types
of DCI are supported in NR.
\- PDSCH assignments to convey TB(s) to a certain UE, including
time/frequency-domain resource information
\- PUSCH grants for a certain UE to transmit a TB, including time/frequency-
domain resource information
\- Slot format indication, where how each of symbols within a slot is
indicated
\- Pre-emption indication, which is used to inform UEs that there is no DL
transmissions on the informed time/frequency-domain resources
\- UL transmit power control (TPC)
Each device monitors a number of PDCCHs, typically once per slot although it
is possible to configure more frequent monitoring to support traffic requiring
very low latency. Upon detection of a valid PDCCH, the device follows downlink
control information contained in the PDCCH, e.g., the scheduling decision so
that the device receives PDSCH (or transmits PUSCH) accordingly.
The PDCCHs are transmitted in one or more control resource sets (CORESETs). A
CORESET spans overone, two or three OFDM symbol(s) in time domain and over a
configurable bandwidth in the frequency domain. This is needed in order to
handle devices with different bandwidth capabilities and also beneficial from
a forward-compatibility perspective. One control channel element (CCE) is
defined as 6 resource element groups (REGs), where 1 REG is composed of 12
resource elements (REs). In a CORESET, a PDCCH with DM-RS can be mapped on one
or more CCEs as shown in Figure 5.5.4.5-1. Different number of CCEs
(aggregation level) provides different coding rate for the control channels.
There are different formats for DCI transmitted on a PDCCH as shown in Table
5.5.4.5-1. A UE monitors one or more PDCCH candidates for DCI with CRC
scrambled by a certain RNTI in PDCCH common search space (CSS) set and/or UE-
specific search space (USS) set. DCI format is distinguished by the PDCCH
payload size and the RNTI scrambling the CRC.

PDSCH is used to transmit one or two transport blocks (TBs). A DCI in a PDCCH
can assign a PDSCH transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PDSCH is
decoded based on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-
domain resource, modulation, and layer. PDSCH transmissions are processed with
durations from 2 to 14 symbols. The number of layers for PDSCH transmissions
is 8. HARQ feedback/retransmission is supported for PDSCH transmissions as
mentioned in Section 5.5.4.7.
#### 5.5.4.6 PUCCH and PUSCH
PUCCH is used to carry Uplink Control Information (UCI), and following types
of UCI are supported in NR:
  * Hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK): > information to report whether the DL transmission of a TB is > successful or not
  * Scheduling request (SR): signal to request UL grant to gNB
  * Channel state information (CSI): information represents channel condition between gNB and UE
The UCI can be carried by PUCCH or PUSCH. The channel coding schemes for
different UCI sizes are shown in Table 5.5.4.2-2.
> Table 5.5.4.6-1: Channel coding for uplink control information (UCI)
UCI size including CRC, if present Channel code
* * *
1 Repetition code 2 Simplex code 3-11 Reed Muller code >11 Polar code
For HARQ-ACK feedback of PDSCH with corresponding DCI, PUCCH resource set(s)
containing one or more PUCCH resources are configured. One PUCCH resource is
determined based on the UCI payload size and the PUCCH resource indicator
field in the DL assignment. For HARQ-ACK feedback of PDSCH without
corresponding DCI, SR, and CSI report, a PUCCH resource is configured for
each. When multiple PUCCHs are overlapped fully or partially in time, the UCIs
are multiplexed in a PUCCH. When a PUCCH is overlapped with a PUSCH fully or
partially in time, the UCI is multiplexed (i.e. piggybacked) on the PUSCH.
Each PUCCH resource is configured with a PUCCH format. Various PUCCH formats
are specified as in Figure 5.5.4.6-1. Each PUCCH format supports either
durations of 1 to 2 symbols, or durations of 4 to 14 symbols. PUCCH formats
0/2 are called as short-PUCCH, which can deliver UCI by 1 or 2 symbols. PUCCH
formats 0/2 are beneficial to reduce latency. PUCCH formats 1/3/4 are called
as long-PUCCH, which can deliver UCI with any of 4 to 14 symbols. PUCCH
formats 1/3/4 are adopted to improve coverage. The frequency/time-domain
resources for PUCCH transmissions in NR are flexibly configurable. In PUCCH
format 0/1/4, multiple PUCCH resources can be CDMed on the same time/frequency
resource. A short-PUCCH can be TDMed with a long-PUCCH or a short PUCCH within
a slot.
{width="6.690972222222222in" height="3.127083333333333in"}
Figure 5.5.4.6-1: NR PUCCH formats
PUSCH is used to transmit one TB. A DCI in a PDCCH can schedule a PUSCH
transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PUSCH is transmitted based
on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-domain resource
including frequency-hopping, modulation, and layer. The number of layers for
PDSCH transmissions is 4. HARQ retransmission is supported for PUSCH
transmissions as mentioned in Section 5.5.4.7.
#### 5.5.4.7 Scheduling/HARQ
DCI formats 0_0/0_1 and 1_0/1_1 schedule PUSCH and PDSCH, respectively. For
each DCI format, frequency-domain and time-domain resource allocation fields
are included. For frequency-domain resource allocation, resource block group
(RBG)-level bit-map resource allocation (resource allocation Type 0) and
contiguous resource allocation (resource allocation Type1) are supported. A UE
can be configured with either or both of them. For time-domain resource
allocation, the time-domain resource allocation field in the DCI jointly
indicates scheduled slot, starting symbol, and the duration (number of
consecutive symbols to use for the channel).
For PUSCH and PDSCH, other than DCI-based scheduling, configured grant for
PUSCH and semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for PDSCH are supported. For
configured grant PUSCH, once PUSCH resource is configured and activated, the
UE can transmit a PUSCH without DCI format 0_0/0_1. There are two types of
configured grant PUSCH; with the configured grant Type1, UE can transmit PUSCH
on the configured grant resource once RRC configuration is available, while
with the configured grant Type2, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant
resource after a DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI activates the configured
grant resource. SPS for PDSCH also requires activation DCI with CRC scrambled
by CS-RNTI.
For NR, only asynchronous and adaptive HARQ is supported for both PDSCH and
PUSCH. A PDSCH or PUSCH can be re-transmitted at any timing and with any
transmission configuration. For re-transmission of a PDSCH or PUSCH, DCI
formats 0_0/0_1 or 1_0/1_1 is used. HARQ process number and redundancy version
are indicated in the DCI scheduling the re-transmission. Initial
transmission/retransmission of a TB and soft-buffer store/flush are controlled
per HARQ process number. Redundancy version is used to control redundancy of
channel coded bits.
UE reports HARQ-ACK feedback for a decoded PDSCH. UE can be configured with
reporting one HARQ-ACK bit for each transport block (TB), while if a UE is
configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the UE reports one HARQ-ACK bit
for each code block group (CBG). A CBG is a group of code-blocks consisting of
a TB, where channel coding is applied for each code block. If a UE is
configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the DCI scheduling PDSCH
includes CBG transmission information (CBGTI) field which indicates which
CBG(s) is/are re-transmitted, and the DCI can also include CBG flushing out
information (CBGFI) field, which indicates the CBGs being retransmitted can be
combined with the earlier received instances of the same CBGs. For PUSCH, CBG-
based transmission using CBGTI is also supported.
For reporting multiple HARQ-ACK bits at one time, two types of HARQ-ACK
codebook construction are supported; Type 1 HARQ-ACK codebook constructs the
codebook based on semi-static configuration only, where HARQ-ACK bits
corresponding to all of the possible PDSCHs based on the configuration are
contained. Type 2 HARQ-ACK codebook constructs the codebook based on both
semi-static configuration and DCI field named downlink assignment index (DAI),
where HARQ-ACK bits corresponding to PDSCHs assumed to be assigned are
contained.
#### 5.5.4.8 Carrier Aggregation, Bandwidth Parts, and LTE/NR dual
connectivity
In NR, the maximum bandwidth of a NR carrier is 100MHz for FR1 and 400MHz for
FR2, respectively. In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation
(CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency
band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are
supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies,
e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.
NR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured
with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has
its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the
BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported
maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth
capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple
BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier
to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be
narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power
saving is achieved. In addition, BWP adaptation based on switching between
BWPs having different bandwidths and/or numerologies is supported.
For EN-DC operation, simultaneous UL transmissions across LTE and NR are
supported. However, for some band combinations, e.g., band combinations where
simultaneous UL transmissions are difficult due to inter-modulation issue, an
operation based on single UL transmission i.e., either LTE or NR UL
transmission at a time is supported.
#### 5.5.4.9 NR-LTE co-existence
NR is designed to support flexible operation taking co-existence with legacy
RAT especially LTE into account. Since some NR frequency bands in FR1 have
been used for LTE carriers, mechanisms for NR-LTE coexistence, e.g., NR DL/UL
transmission within the bandwidth of an LTE carrier without impact on the
legacy LTE devices, are supported. For the design of NR-LTE coexistence
mechanisms, following two scenarios are considered.
  * For both DL and UL, NR carrier and LTE carrier coexist in the same bandwidth
  * Only for UL, NR carrier and LTE carrier coexist in the same bandwidth
To achieve NR-LTE coexistence in the same bandwidth, higher-layer signalling
is supported in NR to configure reserved resources to be used by LTE. It
enables not only the coexistence between NR and normal LTE but also the
coexistence between NR and LTE for machine type communication (MTC) and/or
narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT).
In NR, DL and UL subcarrier positions are aligned while they are different in
LTE. For the coexistence between NR UL and LTE UL in the same bandwidth, it is
possible to configure a 7.5 kHz shift for NR UL subcarrier positions so that
LTE and NR UL subcarriers are aligned to avoid interference due to non-
orthogonal subcarriers between NR and LTE.
#### 5.5.4.10 Supplementary Downlink
Similar as within LTE the concept of supplementary downlink (SDL) is supported
wherein a carrier is pure DL carrier without any associated UL carrier. An SDL
carrier can be aggregated with CA together with another DL and UL carrier.
#### 5.5.4.11 Supplementary Uplink
The UE can be configured with 2 ULs as normal uplink and supplementary uplink
(SUL) for one DL of the same cell. Uplink transmissions on those two ULs are
controlled by the network to avoid overlapping PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions in
time. Overlapping transmissions on PUSCH are avoided through scheduling while
overlapping transmissions on PUCCH are avoided through configuration (PUCCH
can only be configured for only one of the 2 ULs of the cell). In addition,
initial access is supported in each of the uplink, i.e., random access can be
performed on either normal uplink or SUL.
#### 5.5.4.12 UL TPC
NR UL transmit power control (TPC) is designed to allow dynamic power
adjustment for PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, and PRACH. The UE calculates the path loss
value based on the RSRP then determines UL transmission power based on several
parameters configured by gNB. The reference signal for path loss calculation
can be SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS. For PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission, multiple
parameter sets can be configured and multiple power control adjustment states
can be managed for beam switching purpose. For PRACH, only one parameter set
is configured. A parameter set consists of target received power and path loss
coefficient. The UE can be configured the linkage between an SRS resource and
several parameters about reference signal for path loss calculation, a power
control parameter set, and a power control adjustment state. When the linkage
is configured, the UE determines UL TPC parameters according to an SRS
resource index indicated by DCI. In addition, for FR1 LTE-NR dual connectivity
including both EN-DC and NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity (NE-DC), power sharing
mechanism between RATs was introduced. When UE supports dynamic power sharing,
power allocation for NR is dynamically adjusted on condition that the total
transmission power never exceeds allowed value. Dynamic power sharing
mechanism is shown in Figure 5.5.4.12-1. When UE does not support dynamic
power sharing, the total power is semi-statically split for the two RATs by
gNB configuration in order not to exceed the total transmission power,
otherwise the UE does not expect to transmit in a slot on the NR when a
corresponding subframe on the LTE is an UL subframe.

### 5.5.5 Frequency aspects
While the physical and higher layers are designed as frequency agnostic, two
separate radio performance requirements are specified for two frequency ranges
(FRs), namely FR1 and FR2. FR1 is below the 7 GHz range (450 - 7125 MHz) and
FR2 is millimetres-wave range (24250 - 52600 MHz).
The RF and RRM requirements are defined for each FR. One big difference
between the requirements in FR1 and FR2 is testing methodology. Both so-called
\"conducted\" and \"over-the-air (OTA)\" methodologies can be utilized in FR1,
but only OTA methodology can be utilized in FR2. \"Conducted\" is a passive
method, useable when antenna connectors are still accessible, whereas \"OTA\"
is the be used when the antenna connectors are not accessible, such as in a
massive MIMO context.
Four types of bands are specified for NR (note that all the NR bands are
defined with a prefix \"n\" to distinguish them from the bands for the other
RATs):
1) LTE \"refarming\" band: The bands have the corresponding LTE bands. For
example, NR band n7 corresponds to LTE band 7. Hence, the bands would be
likely to be used by \"refarming\" (i.e. re-using) the exiting LTE bands.
2) NR new bands in FR1: Completely new frequency bands for NR in FR1 whose
corresponding LTE bands do not exist.
3) NR new bands in FR2: new frequency band for NR in FR2.
4) Supplemental uplink (SUL) / downlink (SDL) band: these bands have only
uplink/downlink frequency, and they can be deployed with other type of NR
bands.
NOTE: The ranges {65 - 256} and {257 - 512} are reserved as band number for NR
new bands in FR1 and FR2, respectively. A band number will be assigned to a
new frequency range on a \"first come first served\" basis from the reserved
frequency range. During Release 15 definition time frame, 3 bands in FR1 and 4
bands in FR2 were defined as NR new bands considering the spectrum allocation
plan in each region/country as shown in figure 5.5.5-1. In addition, some LTE
bands were defined as LTE refarming band, and uplink frequencies of some LTE
bands were defined as SUL/SDL band. All NR bands specified in this WI are
summarized in Table 5.5.5-1. Especially for above new NR bands which have
wider bandwidth than LTE, wider channel bandwidths, i.e. 100MHz in FR1 and
400MHz in FR2 at maximum, were defined to improve the spectrum efficiency and
reduce the number of component carriers in case of NR CA operation. In
addition, the RF requirements for NR bands and band combinations of NR CA were
developed based on the market demands.

## 5.6 Other 5G aspects
### 5.6.1 5G AN connected to 4G AN: NSA and EDCE5
#### 5.6.1.1 Overview
In addition of being connectable to the 5G Core Network, the 5G Access Network
has been designed so that it can connect also to a 4G (LTE) Core Network, as
seen earlier in the NSA-SA presentation.
While section 5.4 focusses on the 5G CN with 5G AN (the SA solution), this
section deals with the 5G AN connected to the 4G CN (the NSA solution).
Although limited, the impacts on 4G CN to make it support a 5G AN are not
null. These have been studied and covered in the EDCE5 work item, \"EPC
enhancements to support 5G New Radio via Dual Connectivity\".
The NSA is described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 37.340 on \" NR; Multi-
connectivity; Overall description; Stage-2\".
Since the 5G AN is deployed in addition to the (already-deployed) LTE system,
both 4G and 5G connectivity are available, so NSA is also referred to as \"EN-
DC\", standing for \"4G and 5G Dual Connectivity\" (more precisely: \"E\" for
4G (from eNB, the 4G AN node), \"N\" for 5G (from NR, the 5G radio) and \"DC\"
for Dual Connectivity).
NSA is also referred to as \"Architecture option 3\" for \"historical
reasons\": this was the 3^rd^ option when a longer list of different options
were discussed for 5G architecture.

EDCE5 SA2 SP-170583 Chris Pudney, Vodafone Group
Summary based on the input provided by Vodafone in SP-190217.
This section describes the System aspects of the Non-StandAlone option that
uses Dual Connectivity with the Evolved Packet Core. The architecture and
radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.
{width="4.636903980752406in" height="2.6666666666666665in"}
Figure 5.6.1.2-1: The NSA Architecture
The eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).
The E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN
configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for
that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to
use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether
or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA
Access Network.
For example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the
\"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and
to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G
\"robust coverage layer\" aspect.
The following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the
context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG)
respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these
configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no
concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor
what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.

architecture option 3\")

Figure 5.6.1.2-3: SCG split bearer in use for one EPS bearer of one UE (aka
\"architecture option 3x\")
Note that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15
EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to
support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.
Several features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC
for use with NR:
a) Support is provided for the HSS or the MME to instruct the RAN to not give
access to \"NR as a secondary RAT\" for that UE.
b) UE core network capability signalling allows the MME (via its DNS) to
select the SGW and PGWs that are appropriate for the UE's high data rate.
Additional signalling allows the SGW-C and PGW-C to take the UE's NR
capability into account when selecting the SGW-U and PGW-U.
c) Storage of very large UE Radio Access Capability Information Elements in
the MME is specified (and associated RAN requirements).
d) Higher AMBR (maximum bit rate) values were specified and a new QCI 80 added
for e.g. low latency Mobile BroadBand, Two other new QCIs (82, 83) were added
for low latency GBR services in which the Packet Error Loss Rate calculation
includes those packets that are not delivered within the Packet Delay Budget.
e) The amount of data sent on the Secondary NR RAT can be counted by the RAN
and sent to the EPC for inclusion in the SGW CDRs and, optionally, in the PGW-
CDRs
Within SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that
enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling
confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.
#### 5.6.1.3 AN impacts: NSA radio protocol architecture
Summary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO on the Radio interface.
##### 5.6.1.3.1 Control Plane
In EN-DC, the UE has a single RRC state, based on the Master Node (MN) RRC and
a single Control plane (C-plane) connection towards the Core Network. Figure
5.6.1.3.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for EN-DC. Each radio
node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR
version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the
UE. RRC PDUs generated by the Secondary Node (SN) can be transported via the
MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via the
Master Cell Group (MCG) Signalling Radio Bearers (SRB), a.k.a. SRB1, but
subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via the MN or the SN. When
transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration
provided by the SN.
MeNB= Master eNodeB; SgNB = secondary gNode B
Figure 5.6.1.3.1-1: Control plane architecture for EN-DC (NSA architecture)
##### 5.6.1.3.2 User Plane
In EN-DC, from a UE perspective, three bearer types exist: MCG bearer,
Secondary Cell Group (SCG) bearer and split bearer. These three bearer types
are depicted in Figure 5.6.1.3.2-1. For EN-DC, the network can configure
either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP for MCG bearers while NR PDCP is always used for
SCG and split bearers.

750072 **LTE connectivity to 5G-CN** LTE_5GCN_connect R2 RP-171432 Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-180862.
LTE connectivity to 5G-CN does not only allow RAN level interworking but
provides a migration path where the core network is 5G-CN whereas the radio
remains LTE. This enables utilization of new functionalities provided by the
5G-CN such as QoS, mobility enhancements and slicing even when using the LTE
radio interface.
The feature \"LTE connectivity to 5G-CN\", or the E-UTRA connected to 5GC, is
supported as part of NG-RAN. The E-UTRA can be connected to both EPC and 5GC.
The overall architecture of E-UTRA connected to 5GC as part of NG-RAN is
described in TS 38.300, where the term \"ng-eNB\" is used for E-UTRA connected
to 5GC. However, here, the term \"eNB\" is used for both cases unless there is
a specific need to disambiguate between eNB and ng-eNB.
The LTE connectivity to 5G-CN feature includes the following key
functionalities:
\- 5G NAS message transport
\- 5G security framework, except that data integrity protection is not
supported;
\- Unified Access Control
\- Flow-based QoS
\- Network slicing
\- SDAP
\- NR PDCP
\- Support of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state.
Generally, the above functionalities are introduced based on similar
functionalities as in NR.
For the user plane, the protocol stack is shown in Figure 5.6.2-1, where SDAP
and NR PDCP sublayers perform the functions listed in TS 38.300, and RLC and
MAC sublayers perform the functions listed in TS 36.300.

750016 **Security aspects of 5G System - Phase 1** 5GS_Ph1-SEC S3 SP-170881
NTT DOCOMO, Alf Zugenmaier
Summary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO in SP-180861.
This work item defines the security aspects of the 5G system. The base
requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.
**Non-Standalone NR Security**
The NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the
new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access
technology with User Equipment\'s (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for
capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the
specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for
EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.
**Evolution of the trust model**
Moving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the
trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing
the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G
security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.
The trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains,
the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM)
resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM
together form the UE.
The network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in
the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple
layers, like in an onion.
The Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or
gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB,
as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as
it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working
Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access
Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.
In the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as
termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in
the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity
Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the
visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof
fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility
function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system
architecture.
{width="4.7756944444444445in" height="2.5881944444444445in"}
Figure 5.6.3-1: Trust model of non-roaming scenario
The AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after
authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different
access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access
networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).
Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the
authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the
client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified
Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription
data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various
functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user
identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface,
both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user
plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent
identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.
In the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected
through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the
internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the
number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing
attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in
signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the
internetwork interconnect.

**5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)**
5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points
are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in
TS 33.501 [1].
{width="4.963888888888889in" height="4.666666666666667in"}
Figure 5.6.3-3: 5G Phase 1 security enhancements
**Primary authentication:** Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is
based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few
differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing
the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given
network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two
mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA)
and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA\', i.e. EAP-AKA\'.
Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G -
for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is
radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology
such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.
**Secondary authentication:** Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for
authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this
purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials
can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is
integrated in the 5G architecture.
**Inter-operator security:** Several security issues exist in the inter-
operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier
generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase
1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.
**Privacy:** Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and
earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed
that protects the user\'s subscription permanent identifier against active
attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity
privacy.
**Service based architecture (SBA):** The 5G core network is based on a
service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier
generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.
**Central Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU):** In 5G the base-station is
logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security
is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but
in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment
options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which
are deployed at the very edge of the network, don\'t have access to any user
data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split,
the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in
the radio access network.
**Key hierarchy:** The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall
architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key
separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for
integrity protection of the user plane.
**Mobility:** Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G
is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be
separated from the security anchor.

## 6.2 Highly Reliable Low Latency Communication for LTE
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur

750061 **Highly Reliable Low Latency Communication for LTE** LTE_HRLLC R1
RP-171489 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-180693 revised in
RP-181869.
The LTE_HRLLC work item provides solutions to support ultra-reliable and low
latency communication for LTE. The solutions that have been specified include:
\- Semi-static CFI configuration
\- PDSCH repetition
\- UL SPS repetition
\- PDCP packet duplication
\- Granular time reference provision.
These solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and
have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame
Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE
TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as
existing LTE latency reduction techniques.
An overview of the specified solutions is provided in the following.
**Semi-static CFI**
Control Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for
the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained
by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure
that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink
reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced
in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different
Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured
for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI
values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately
for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN
subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a
given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.
**PDSCH repetition**
To improve the reliability of the DL data channel, PDSCH (Physical Downlink
Shared Channel) repetition can be configured to a UE for a given TTI length.
If configured, the PDSCH DCI format 1A or 7-1x monitored by the UE on the user
specific search space indicates K consecutive PDSCH transmissions with the
same Resource Block (RB) allocation, Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and
HARQ process, where K takes a value in {1, 2, 3, 4 or 6}. Thus, the number of
PDSCH transmissions for a given transport block is changed dynamically as
shown in the figure below. The HARQ-ACK feedback for the transport block is
sent only once with the timing given by the Kth PDSCH transmission. Only the
Redundancy Version (RV) can be different within the window of K transmissions,
if configured accordingly. A maximum rank of 2 is supported with slot/subslot
PDSCH repetition and DMRS sharing cannot be used with subslot PDSCH
repetition.
{width="5.20625in" height="1.8604166666666666in"}
NOTE: The figure does not intend to capture the exact resource mapping of DCI
and rate-matching rules of PDSCH).
Figure 6.2-1: Illustration of PDSCH repetition and dynamic signalling of the
number of PDSCH transmissions
As one method to increase the probability of successful decoding of the DL
assignment, further DL assignments can be transmitted in the (s)TTIs following
the (s)TTI where a DL assignment for K PDSCH transmissions has been
transmitted. The specification clarifies the UE behaviour for this case. The
UE discards any further DL assignment scrambled with C-RNTI in a (s)TTI where
a PDSCH that is part of a window of K transmissions is being received.
The specification defines how subframes/slots/subslots are counted as part of
the K PDSCH transmissions in case consecutive PDSCH transmissions are not
possible. The specification also clarifies rate-matching rules around SPDCCH
resources for the last K-1 slot/subslot PDSCH transmissions of a transmission
window.
RRC configuration enables to set fixed values to some bits in the DCI,
enabling thereby the possibility to reduce the false alarm probability.
**UL SPS (uplink Semi-Persistent Scheduling) repetition**
In addition to PDSCH repetition, the specifications support UL SPS repetition
where K >1 UL transmissions of the same transport block can be configured as
part of the SPS configuration for subframe/slot/subslot PUSCH (Physical Uplink
Shared Channel). The number of UL transmissions, K, is to be chosen so that
the aggregated time of K UL transmissions does not exceed the configured SPS
periodicity, P. The initial transmission of the transport block can only occur
on the first transmission occasion of the transmission window. This guarantees
that K transmissions are performed for a given transport block. There is only
one exception. In case a dynamic UL grant is sent for a PUSCH transmission in
a subframe/slot/subslot where a SPS PUSCH transmission part of a repetition
was prepared, the colliding PUSCH SPS transmission may be dropped. The exact
dropping rules for such collision cases were defined following the principles
applied for UL SPS without repetition. If dropped, only the colliding SPS
PUSCH transmission is dropped, while the remaining PUSCH transmissions within
the transmission window are performed.

Figure 6.2-2: UL SPS repetition on one SPS configuration
In case of new data arrival, a UE has to wait for the next first (s)TTI of the
transmission window before being able to transmit new data (as depicted in
Figure 2). With a single UL SPS configuration, this induces a maximum delay of
P (s)TTIs. To shorten this delay, the specifications allow multiple SPS
configurations for the same TTI length to be activated on the same serving
cell. By appropriate setting of P, K and the number of SPS configurations for
a given TTI length, it is possible to reduce the maximum delay for the UE to
be able to transmit UL data to 1 (s)TTI. Different HARQ processes are
associated with different SPS configurations for a given (s)TTI length and the
cyclic shift for the UL Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) can be configured
independently for each SPS configuration.

**PDCP packet duplication**
In case of Carrier Aggregation (CA) or in case of Dual Connectivity (DC), PDCP
(Packet Data Convergence Protocol) packet duplication can be applied to
improve the overall reliability for downlink and possibly for uplink depending
on UE power limitation. PDCP packet duplication is configured for a radio
bearer by RRC where two logical channels are configured for the radio bearer.
The two logical channels can either belong to the same MAC entity (CA case) or
different MAC entities (DC case). When activated, PDCP packet duplication
allows sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent
transmission paths: via the primary RLC entity and a secondary RLC entity,
thereby increasing reliability.
PDCP packet duplication is supported in the following cases:
\- for Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs) using RLC AM.
\- for Data Radio Bearers (DRBs) using RLC UM or AM.
For DRBs, PDCP packet duplication is first RRC configured and then activated
and deactivated by a MAC CE. In addition, for DRBs, PDCP packet duplication
can also be immediately activated upon configuration by RRC signalling. For
SRBs, once duplication is configured, it is always activated.
When PDCP packet duplication is activated, both the original logical channel
and the duplicated logical channel are RRC configured with a cell restriction
list. The data from one logical channel is not allowed to be sent on the cells
in the cell restriction list. The cell restriction lists associated with the
original and the duplicated logical channel are mutually-exclusive so that
duplicates are sent on different cells. The restriction is lifted when PDCP
packet duplication is deactivated.
At the receiver, PDCP enables reordering and duplication detection when PDCP
packet duplication is configured.
**Granular time reference provision**
The specifications support granular time reference provision from the network
to end user equipment. The time reference provided by the network to users has
a granularity of 0.25 us and uses the GPS/UTC time format (like in SIB16). In
addition, an inaccuracy indication of the time reference is optionally sent.
If the inaccuracy indication is absent, then the inaccuracy is not specified.
The time reference can be broadcasted (via SIB16) and be unicasted (via
dedicated RRC signalling). For broadcast solution, the time refers to the same
reference point in SIB16, i.e., the system frame number (SFN) boundary at or
immediately after the ending boundary of the system information (SI)-window in
which SystemInformationBlockType16 is transmitted. For unicast solution, the
time refers to the ending boundary of one system frame number whose value is
indicated in the RRC message.

Things (IoT)

750066 **Further NB-IoT enhancements** NB_IOTenh2 R1 RP-171428 Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180851 revised
in RP-181838.
This work item is a collection of additions and enhancements of
functionalities related to NB-IoT, primarily focusing on reducing UE power
consumption and on enhancing the parts of the Rel-13/14 NB-IoT air interface
and protocol layers to respond to feedback from early deployments.
Additional new features include support for small cells, extensions to NB-IoT
standalone operation mode, and TDD.
**Wake-up signalling for IDLE mode (FDD)**
When a UE is in DRX or eDRX, it has to regularly check if a paging message is
arriving from the core network. At most possible occasions for paging, no
message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been
saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a \'wake-up signal\' (WUS)
to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise
allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially
keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the
power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the
network allows for the UE to \'wake up\' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be
able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing
much of the UE\'s conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.
**Scheduling request (FDD)**
In Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer
procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL
resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more
resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be
configured by the eNB.
For a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH
resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic
has arrived in the UE\'s buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated
(\'released\') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.
A connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the
eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a
dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via
\'piggybacking\' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if
one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.
**Early data transmission (FDD)**
An idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access
procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by
eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to
connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller
than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set
of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to
transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to
reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.
**Quick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)**
A NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the
RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful
acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is
not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease
message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK.
This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.
**Relaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)**
This feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an
NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE
battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE
with a \'NRSRP delta\' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current
cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring
cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14
specifications.
**RLC UM (FDD and TDD)**
Rel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the
acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This
reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may
be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.
**Narrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)**
The narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving
cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel
(NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using
narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements
for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of
subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.
**NPRACH range enhancement (FDD)**
NB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km.
Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination
of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave
transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE\'s
range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz
and a cyclic prefix of 800 Î¼s, together with frequency hopping, which is
sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.
**Small cell support (FDD and TDD)**
eNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as
microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power
than macro eNBs.
**Reduced system acquisition time (FDD)**
In FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum
supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB
repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster
decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE\'s power consumption during cell access.
Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows
16 repetitions.
**UE differentiation (FDD and TDD)**
The network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE
and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE
according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it
tends to have traffic to transmit.
**Access barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)**
In Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific
basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so
that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their
transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive,
UEs.
**Mixed standalone operation (FDD)**
In Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be
configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows
configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-
anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone
non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used
as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated
to LTE spectrum.
**Power headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)**
In Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two
tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature
improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.
**TDD**
Support for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature
together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-
carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations
are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe
configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described
above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.
## 7.2 Further enhancements for Extended Coverage GSM for support of Cellular
Internet of Things
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
790053 **Further enhancements for Extended Coverage GSM for support of
Cellular Internet of Things** CIoT_EC_GSM_fenh R6 RP-180541 Nokia
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in RP-181976.
### 7.2.1 Introduction
Extended Coverage GSM for support of Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT) is an
evolution of EGPRS providing a streamlined protocol implementation, reducing
MS complexity while supporting energy efficient operation with extended
coverage compared to GPRS/EGPRS. EC-GSM-IoT improves the coverage performance
of Cellular IoT devices by 20 dB compared to EGPRS along and enables long
battery life time achieved by energy efficient methods over the radio
interface. The extended coverage is achieved by a high number of blind
physical layer transmissions along with modified channel coding schemes.
In Release 13, the base station supporting EC-GSM-IoT requires minimum 4
consecutive timeslot resources reserved for packet data operation to support
extended coverage operation. Furthermore, the coverage improvement for low
power EC-GSM-IoT devices with 23 dBm output power is limited to 10 dB in this
release.
In Release 14, as part of radio interface enhancements, EC operation with a
reduced number of 2 consecutive timeslot resources both on DL and UL
specified. In addition, a new uplink coverage class CC5 is added to improve
the MCL performance in uplink by 4 dB compared to Release 13, which can be
mapped both to 4 and 2 consecutive time slot resources.
In Release 15, as part of further enhancements, a paging indication channel
for EC operation is introduced as well as the deferred system information
acquisition procedure for EC operation both targeting the improvement of
energy consumption of the device in idle mode. The deferred system information
acquisition procedure was also specified for Power Efficient Operation (PEO)
devices that operate in normal coverage with increased power consumption
efficiency in idle mode due to adoption of Extended DRX and relaxed mobility
requirements.
### 7.2.2 Energy Efficient Paging Reception with EC Paging Indication channel
The network may configure an EC Paging Indication Channel (EC-PICH) for a
mobile station capable to receive EC-PICH in higher coverage class condition
(i.e. in extended coverage using CC3 or CC4) which occurs prior to the
corresponding paging block of the mobile station to optimise the energy
consumption for paging reception.
Separate EC-PICH blocks are used for paging indication for mobiles in coverage
class CC3 or CC4. An EC-PICH block for CC4 contains the paging indication for
single paging block of CC4 within four 51 multiframes (see Figure 7.2-1),
whereas an EC-PICH block for CC3 serves for indicating a page to one or two
CC3 mobile stations per two 51-multiframes (see Figure 7.2-2). The mobile
stations in CC3 or CC4 coverage condition checks the EC-PICH block
corresponding to its paging block whether containing a wake-up indication, and
if yes, listens to the paging block. If the EC-PICH block indicates that no
paging message is scheduled in its paging block, the mobile stations enters
into sleep mode until the next paging occasion after completion of current
(e)DRX cycle thus reducing energy consumption by up to around 15% due to
avoiding reading the long paging block for these higher coverage classes which
may or not contain a matching page, i.e. require the mobile station to send a
paging response. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2-1 and Figure7.2-2 below.
{width="6.230555555555555in" height="0.99375in"}
Figure 7.2-1: EC-PICH block in first 51 MF indicates whether mobile station
should wake up or sleep for CC4 paging block

Figure 7.2-2: EC-PICH block in first 51 MF indicates whether mobile station
should wake up or sleep for CC3 paging block
The message sent on EC-PICH to convey wake-up or sleep indications is designed
such that it can be received by legacy EC-GSM-IoT mobile stations in CC1
condition, expecting an EC-AGCH, without decoding failure, i.e. the legacy EC-
GSM-IoT mobile station detects an unknown message type.
### 7.2.3 Deferred System Information Acquisition in EC operation and for PEO
In order to reduce energy consumption in packet idle mode, the network may
broadcast information to assist the MS to apply deferred system information
acquisition.
To this purpose it reconfigures EC System Information type 2 for a cell to
include an Idle Mode Mobility cell group description comprising cells,
geographically adjacent or close to each other, with shared cell parameters
related to cell (re)selection, Routing Area assignment, paging monitoring, DL
Coverage class selection, mobility support and cell barring and assigns it a
broadcast frequency list containing BCCH carriers allocated in these cells. To
better match cell deployments, some cell parameters may deviate from the
common values and are separately indicated on a per cell basis.
To allow for different settings of shared cell parameters in geographic
adjacent areas, different Idle Mode Mobility cell groups are defined with an
identifier to distinguish one from the other, thus providing a spatially
definite assignment of cells to Idle Mode Mobility cell groups. Since values
of shared or non-shared cell parameters in a particular Idle Mode Mobility
cell group are subject to change in time, a change mark is assigned to the
Idle Mode Mobility cell group. An increment of the change mark for a
particular Idle Mode Mobility cell group hence indicates to the MS to acquire
the complete EC SI in the serving cell.
To enable fast detection if a cell is part of a specific Idle Mode Mobility
cell group or not, the MS identifies from EC-SCH reception the Idle Mode
Mobility cell group identifier and the related change mark. Thus, an MS
reselecting to a cell in the same IMM cell group as the last serving cell has
read the EC-SCH and decoded both the IMM cell group identifier and the IMM
cell group change mark. If both values match with those of the last serving
cell, it will not need to read the EC-BCCH for this cell prior to the decision
for cell reselection, neither after cell reselection to this cell for
subsequent cell reselections and for paging monitoring in packet idle mode.
Only in case a valid page is received, that requires to send a paging
response, or the MS needs to perform an uplink data transmission, or a timeout
since the last reading of the complete EC SI in a different than the current
serving cell is expired, the MS is required to read the complete EC System
Information in the current serving cell.
The network may choose to deactivate deferred SI acquisition in network
deployments for which EC System Information needs to be reconfigured more
frequently or for which adjacent cells\' idle mode mobility parameters differ
too much. The support of deferred system information acquisition is
broadcasted in EC System Information.
For PEO devices, that operate in normal coverage, a similar concept was
designed, that includes the PEO IMM Cell Group definition in the System
Information type 13 (SI 13) message and reuses cell parameters broadcasted in
SI 2 and SI 3. For fast detection if a neighbour cell belongs to the same PEO
IMM Cell Group or not, the MS monitors paging request and immediate assignment
messages on downlink CCCH, where the PEO IMM cell group identifier and the PEO
IMM change mark are sent and evaluates whether they are identical to those of
the current serving cell. In this case it defers reading of system information
for that cell, similar to a device in EC operation. Power savings up to around
20% related to the radio module power consumption of the device have been
estimated.

## 7.3 Even further enhanced MTC for LTE
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
750059 **Even further enhanced MTC for LTE** LTE_eMTC4 R1 RP-171427 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-181213 revised in
RP-181872, further revised in RP-182592.
This work item builds on the LTE features for Machine-Type Communications
(MTC) introduced in Rel-13 and Rel-14 (e.g., low-complexity UE categories M1
and M2, and Coverage Enhancement Modes A and B) by adding support for new use
cases and general improvements with respect to latency, power consumption,
spectral efficiency, and access control.
The following clauses describe the new MTC features for LTE in Rel-15. All
features are optional for the UE and can be supported by Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 and
by normal LTE UEs supporting CE mode unless otherwise stated. All features are
applicable to both CE modes (A and B) in all duplex modes (HD-FDD, FD-FDD, and
TDD) unless otherwise stated.
### 7.3.1 Support for new use cases
The MTC features introduced in LTE Rel-13 focused on applications with
relatively modest requirements in terms of data rates, latency, mobility, etc.
The range of use cases that can be addressed was extended in Rel-14 by
improving the support for higher data rates, multicast, positioning, VoLTE,
and mobility measurements. This work item introduces the following additional
enhancements for support of new use cases.
\- Support for higher UE velocity: To enable support of use cases associated
with potentially relatively high velocity (e.g. logistics), enhanced
performance requirements are introduced for CE mode A. These requirements are
defined for 200 Hz Doppler spread, corresponding to around 240 km/h at 1 GHz
and 120 km/h at 2 GHz.
\- Lower UE power class: To enable support of use cases associated with small
device form factor and low power consumption (e.g. wearables), a new lower UE
power class with a maximum transmission power of 14 dBm is introduced for
Cat-M1 and Cat-M2, together with signaling support for the lower maximum
transmit power with appropriate coverage relaxations.
\- New gaps for dense PRS configurations: Downlink transmission of dense
positioning reference signals (PRS) was introduced already in Rel-14, and this
work item introduces new gap patterns that will enable the UE to perform
measurements in connected mode when the duration of said PRS is longer than 6
subframes.
### 7.3.2 Reduced latency
Reduced latency is achieved by the improvements for reduced system acquisition
time listed in this section. Furthermore, note that the EDT feature and the
HARQ feedback feature listed in the next clause may also help reduce latency.
\- EARFCN pre-provisioning: Initial cell search can be speeded up by pre-
provisioning the UE with the E-UTRA absolute radio frequency channel number
(EARFCN) and the geographical area where the EARFCN pre-provisioning
configuration is applicable.
\- Resynchronization signal (RSS): When a UE needs to re-acquire time and
frequency synchronization towards a cell, it can save time and energy by using
the denser RSS instead of the legacy PSS/SSS (the latter is still used for
initial synchronization to new cells).
\- Improved MIB demodulation performance: Reduced MIB acquisition time is
enabled by enhanced CGI (i.e. cell global identity) reading delay requirements
based on accumulation of transmissions within two 40-ms MIB periods.
\- Improved SIB demodulation performance: Reduced SIB1/SIB2 acquisition time
is enabled by enhanced CGI reading delay requirements based on accumulation of
transmissions within one modification period.
\- SI update indication: A flag bit is introduced in MIB to let the UE know
whether the SIB information has been updated during the last N hours (where N
is the system information validity time, which is 3 or 24 hours). This
typically means that the UE can save time and energy since it does not need to
re-acquire SIB1 as often. The SI update indication is also replicated in RSS,
implying that the UE may also be able to re-acquire MIB less often.
### 7.3.3 Reduced UE power consumption
Reduced UE power consumption is achieved through reduced downlink monitoring,
reduced signalling and reduced uplink transmission by the features listed in
this section. Furthermore, note that the features for reduced system
acquisition time listed in the previous clause and the uplink sub-PRB
allocation feature mentioned in the next clause may also help reduce power
consumption.
\- Wake-up signals (WUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode is enabled
by the introduction of WUS, a compact signal transmitted a configurable time
before the paging occasion (PO) when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to
maximize its sleep time during periods when there is no paging. The
configurable time can be as large as 2 seconds, which facilitates UE
implementations with a wake-up receiver (WUR).
\- Early data transmission (EDT): For scenarios where the UE only needs to
transmit a small amount of data, the EDT feature enables the UE to transmit up
to (slightly more than) 100 bytes of data already in message 3 during the
random-access procedure, and to receive data already in message 4. In this
release, only mobile-originated (MO) EDT access is supported. If needed, eNB
can order fallback to legacy random-access procedure during the EDT procedure.
\- HARQ feedback for UL data: A possibility to carry a positive HARQ-ACK in an
UL DCI over MPDCCH is introduced. This allows eNB to indicate to a UE that UL
data has been successfully received and may enable early termination of
downlink (MPDCCH) monitoring or (in case of FD-FDD or TDD but not HD-FDD)
early termination of uplink (PUSCH) transmission.
\- Relaxed monitoring for cell reselection: When this feature is enabled and
the criteria for relaxed monitoring are fulfilled, the UE can reduce its
neighbor cell measurements to as seldom as every 24 hours. This can reduce the
power consumption substantially especially for stationary UEs in challenging
coverage conditions.
### 7.3.4 Increased spectral efficiency
Increased spectral efficiency is achieved through higher order modulation,
more efficient resource allocation and reduced inter-cell interference by the
features listed in this section. Furthermore, note that the EDT feature
described in the previous clause may also help increase spectral efficiency.
\- Downlink 64QAM support: Support for 64QAM modulation is introduced for
PDSCH unicast transmission without repetition in CE mode A to increase the
downlink spectral efficiency. The UE peak rate is not increased.
\- CQI table with large range: An alternative CQI table spanning a larger
range is introduced. Downlink 64QAM can only be used together with the new CQI
table, but the new CQI table can also be used by UEs not configured with 64QAM
support and even by UEs not supporting 64QAM. In the latter case, the large
range of the CQI table can help reduce the need for RRC reconfigurations when
the UE experiences varying channel conditions.
\- Uplink sub-PRB allocation: Uplink spectral efficiency is improved by the
introduction of PUSCH sub-PRB resource allocation in connected mode. New
allocation sizes are Â½ PRB (6 subcarriers) or Â¼ PRB (3 subcarriers). In the
latter case, a new Ï€/2-BPSK modulation using 1 at a time out of 2 of the 3
allocated subcarriers can be used to achieve near 0 dB baseband peak-to-
average power ratio (PAPR), which may be beneficial for uplink data coverage
and for UE power consumption.
\- Flexible starting PRB: To facilitate efficient scheduling of MTC-related
data transmissions side by side with other transmissions (e.g. MBB-related
PDSCH transmissions in downlink and PUCCH/PRACH in uplink), PDSCH/PUSCH
resource allocation with a more flexible starting PRB (not restricted by 6-PRB
narrowbands) is introduced for UEs that are configured in CE mode with max 1.4
MHz PDSCH/PUSCH channel bandwidth.
\- Frequency-domain CRS muting: Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 UEs can indicate support of
CRS muting outside their 6-PRB narrowband or 24-PRB wideband, respectively, so
that the network can take this information into account when deciding whether
and how to perform CRS muting to reduce downlink inter-cell interference in
the network.
### 7.3.5 Improved access control
The legacy access barring mechanisms (ACB and EAB) do not distinguish between
different coverage enhancement (CE) levels. In high load situations, it may be
desired to temporarily bar access e.g. to the highest CE levels, since UEs in
high CE levels may be associated with higher resource consumption due to
dozens, hundreds or even thousands of repetitions.
\- CE-level-based access barring: A new mechanism for CE-level-based access
barring is introduced, which enables eNB to bar access per CE level. Note that
if access is barred to a CE level, then access is also barred to all higher CE
levels. The legacy barring mechanisms (ACB and EAB) are not affected by the
new mechanism and they can be configured independently.

data packets between the UE and a service in the home network.
\- Integrity protection, and optionally confidentiality protection, for small
data packets between the UE and a service in the enterprise IT space.
\- Key agreement service between the UE and a service in the enterprise IT
space.
3GPP TS 33.863 [2] studied the security requirements for user data transfer in
battery constrained devices and concluded that a new protocol was needed for
end to middle security (E2M) (UE to Home Network) and for end to end (E2) (UE
to Enterprise application).
3GPP TS 33.163 (BEST) delivers a small, infrequent, user plane data security
model and an optimised protocol (EMSDP) that achieves telecom grade security
with a low overhead. Whilst initially specified for LTE, EMSDP is equally
applicable for all 3GPP technologies as re-uses 3GPP authentication and
includes support for integrity protection, confidentiality protection, replay
protection, end point authentication and E2E key distribution. EMSDP has been
designed with the flexibility to extend it with other security methods,
counter schemes and endpoints whilst being fully self-contained in the 3GPP
user plane traffic.
BEST is realised using a client in the UE and a new entity, the HPLMN Security
Endpoint (HSE) which is located in the home network core.

SungDuck, LG Electronics
Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in SP-180467.
Through the works done in Rel-14, 3GPP system starts to support various V2X
services by use of LTE technology. The target of Rel-14 work to support V2X
service is mostly to provide data transport service for basic road safety
service such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM), Decentralised
Environmental Notification Messages (DENM), Basic Safety Message (BSM) and so
on.
On top of the work done in Rel-14 to support V2X services based on LTE, the
Rel-15 work eV2X further specifies service requirements to enhance 3GPP
support for V2X scenarios. Requirements for the following areas are covered in
this work and specified in TS 22.186 [1]:
\- Vehicle Platooning: Vehicles platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically
form a group travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon receive
periodic data from the leading vehicle, in order to carry on platoon
operations. This information allows the distance between vehicles to become
extremely small, i.e., the gap distance translated to time can be very low
(sub second). Platooning applications may allow the vehicles following to be
autonomously driven.
\- Advanced Driving: Advanced Driving enables semi-automated or fully-
automated driving. Longer inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle
and/or RSU shares data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in
proximity, thus allowing vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or
manoeuvres. In addition, each vehicle shares its driving intention with
vehicles in proximity. The benefits of this use case group are safer
travelling, collision avoidance, and improved traffic efficiency.
\- Extended Sensors: Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed
data gathered through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, RSUs,
devices of pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles can enhance
the perception of their environment beyond what their own sensors can detect
and have a more holistic view of the local situation.
\- Remote Driving: Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application
to operate a remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive themselves
or a remote vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a case where
variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as public
transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used. In addition,
access to cloud-based back-end service platform can be considered for this use
case group.
\- General aspects

750062 **Enhancements on LTE-based V2X Services** LTE_eV2X R1 RP-171740 Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180858.
In Rel-14, TSG RAN completed the WI \"Support for V2V services based on LTE
sidelink\" and the WI \"LTE-based V2X services\". With these the completion of
these two WIs, TSG RAN had specified V2X communication in order to provide
basic safety services.
In Rel-15, the LTE_eV2X work item enhances the Cellular-based V2X services
(V2V, V2I/N, and V2P) to support advanced V2X services as identified in TR
22.886 in a holistic and complementary manner to Release 14 V2X. This work
item specifies 3GPP V2X Phase 2 to support advanced V2X services in a fully
backward compatible manner with Rel-14 V2X.
These studies concluded to specify and introduce the following key
functionalities:
\- Support of Carrier Aggregation (CA) for mode-4. CA was already supported
for mode-3 in Rel-14. In Rel-15, CA for mode-4 was specified. The resource
allocation procedure of Rel-14, which was based on sensing, was expanded to
support multi-carrier transmission, while relying on the same core principles.
Rules for power sharing, and to include priority were derived. A
synchronization procedure for multiple carriers was derived. It includes
priority rules for determining the synchronization resources. Sidelink packet
duplication was introduced in the case of CA to improve the transmission
reliability.
\- Support for 64-QAM. New transport block sizes and transport block size
scaling were introduced to support 64-QAM. In addition, transmission uses
rate-matching instead of the Rel-14 procedure where the last symbol was
punctured.
\- Reduction of the maximum time between packet arrival at Layer 1 and
resource selected for transmission. This value was reduced to 10ms, compared
to 20ms for Rel-14 V2X.
\- Radio resource pool sharing between mode-3 and mode-4 UEs. Changes in the
SCI content for mode-3 UEs were introduced to improve performance when
resource pools are shared. Sensing and reporting for mode-3 UEs is supported.
\- Transmit diversity. After studies, it was concluded that transmit diversity
was a valuable feature to have. The transmit diversity technique used is Small
Delay Cyclic Delay Diversity.
\- RF requirements for new CA scenarios, 64QAM and transmit diversity were
introduced in TS 36.101.
\- RRM requirements. The delay/interruption requirements due to V2X CC
addition/release and V2X synchronization reference source
selection/reselection requirements for V2X CA was introduced.
Finally, it can be noted that the introduction of a short Transmission Time
Interval (TTI) was studied but was not standardized in Rel-15.

750021 **Enhancements to MCPTT functional architecture and information flows**
enhMCPTT S6 SP-170248 Dom Lazara, Motorola Solutions
Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-181215.
For Release 15, the enhancements for the MCPTT feature were specified in two
work items: enhMCPTT for stage 2 and enhMCPTT-CT for stage 3. Those features
that have been completed are described below.
Enhancements to the MCPTT service impact the following areas of the
architecture and protocols: call control and media handling, configuration,
and security.
The following features have been introduced:
A) Remotely initiated MCPTT call request: This feature gives the ability for
an authorized MCPTT user to target another MCPTT user\'s client and have the
target client initiate an MCPTT call. The target MCPTT client can be
instructed to initiate a private call (to a single MCPTT user), or the target
MCPTT client can be instructed to initiate a group call (to a set of MCPTT
users). For the remotely initiated private call, the existing private call
authorizations for the target MCPTT client are used. For remotely initiated
group call, the existing group call authorizations for the target MCPTT client
(including affiliation) are used.
B) Location of current talker: This feature allows the initiator of a group
call transmission to share his current location with every transmission. Based
on privacy settings, the talker\'s location is delivered to the other
affiliated members of the group during the group call.
C) Entering or exiting an emergency alert area: This feature allows an
authorized MCPTT user to define a geographical area for the purposes of
causing the target MCPTT client to send an emergency alert when within this
geographic area. Upon leaving the geographic area the target MCPTT client
sends an emergency alert cancel. The MCPTT system keeps track of the MCPTT
user\'s location and sends an indication to the target MCPTT client upon
entering or exiting the emergency alert area.
D) Geographical affiliation and de-affiliation: This feature allows an
authorized MCPTT user to define a geographical area for the purposes of
causing the target MCPTT client to affiliate to a group when within this
geographic area. Upon leaving the geographic area the target MCPTT client is
sent an indication to de-affiliate. The MCPTT system keeps track of the target
MCPTT user\'s location and sends an indication to the MCPTT client upon
entering or exiting the geographic area.
E) Application group paging: This feature enables the MCPTT system to send an
application level message to the MCPTT clients affiliated to a group over an
MBMS application level signalling channel.
F) Subscription to group dynamic data: This feature enables the MCPTT system
to allow an authorized MCPTT user to subscribe to a set of dynamic data that
is associated with the group. This allows the MCPTT client to get real time
updates of changes to any of the elements of this dynamic data set. These
include affiliation status of individual members of the group, and group call
status (whether a call is ongoing or not). The subscription data can be sent
via unicast or multicast.
The architecture, protocol, and security aspects of the MCPTT service related
to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:
1\. The architecture (including information flows, procedures, and
configuration) is specified in TS 23.379 and TS 23.280;

## 9.2 Enhancements to MC Data
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
750022 **Enhancements to MC Data Functional architecture and information
flows** eMCData SP-170462 David Freeman, Home Office
Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-181216.
For Release 15, the enhancements for the MCData service were contained in two
work items: eMCData for stage 2 and eMCData-CT for stage 3. Those features
that have been completed are described in the following clause.
Enhancements to the MCData service impact the following areas of the
architecture and protocols: call control and media handling, configuration,
and security.
The following features have been introduced:
A) Accessing a list of deferred data communications: This feature enables the
MCData service to temporarily store data communications for the case where the
download of the data has been deferred by an MCData user. The MCData user may
request the list and retrieve the deferred data communications at a later
time. This is an on-network procedure.
B) Communication release with prior indication: This feature enables an
authorized MCData user to send a release indication to the MCData service to
terminate an ongoing MCData communication. This action can be accomplished for
an ongoing MCData communication over the media plane, or over HTTP. The
authorized MCData user may have been monitoring the ongoing MCData
communication. Prior to the communication release, the target MCData user is
given a notification that ongoing MCData communication release is pending. The
target MCData user may request an extension from the authorized MCData user
before release. If the extension is granted the MCData communication will
continue. If no extension is given, the MCData communication is released. This
is an on-network procedure.
C) Communication release without prior indication: This feature is similar to
the feature described in (B) above, except that no notification is given to
the target MCData user before the release which terminates the MCData
communication is executed by the MCData system. An authorized MCData user can
initiate the communication release. No extension can be requested or granted
in this case. This is an on-network procedure.
D) MCData server initiated release: This feature allows the MCData system to
release an ongoing MCData communication after some triggering criteria (e.g.
lack of bearer capacity, limit for the maximum amount of data or time that a
MCData participant may transmit in a single request is exceeded) has been met.
Similar to (B) and (C) above the release of MCData communication can be
preceded by a notification or not. This is an on-network procedure.
E) Enhanced status (on-network): This feature delivers the capability for an
MCData user to set, and for the MCData service to track, the current MCData
system defined status of the MCData user. The enhanced status captures a
status specific to the activities performed by the MCData users during their
normal course of operation (e.g. available, on site, in route to the site,
unavailable). The enhanced status can be shared by the MCData user with an
MCData group using the Short Data Service (SDS) capability.
F) Enhanced status (off-network): This feature extends the enhanced status
feature in (E) above for off-network SDS communication.
G) Extension of the MCData application identifier: The application identifier
field used in the MCData service has been extend to include an additional
formats: text and URI. This gives greater flexibility for configuration of the
application identifier within the MCData service.
The architecture, protocol, and security aspects of the MCData service related
to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:
1\. The architecture (including information flows, procedures, and
configuration) is specified in TS 23.282 and TS 23.280;
2\. The security aspects are specified in TS 33.180;
3\. The protocol aspects for call control and media plane are specified in TS
24.282 and TS 24.582 respectively;
4\. The protocol aspects for group configuration, identity management, and
general configuration are specified in TS 24.481, TS 24.482, TS 24.483, and TS
24.484 respectively;
5\. The protocol aspects for policy and charging control are specified in TS
29.213 and TS 29.214;
6\. The protocol aspects for data management related to MC service user
profile are specified in TS 29.283;
7\. The stage 2 aspects of the Proximity-based services (ProSe) enabler are
specified in TS 23.303.

### 9.4.2 MBMS usage for MC communication services
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur

750023 **MBMS usage for MC communication services** MBMS_Mcservices S6
SP-170686 Magnus TrÃ¤nk, Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-190198.
For Release 15, the MBMS usage for MC services was enhanced by the
introduction of further features or the enhancement of existing features.
The following features have been completed in Release 15 for the MBMS usage
for MC services:
A) Multi-server bearer coordination: To avoid allocating duplicate bearers for
an MBMS service area, a single MC service server may manage all the MBMS media
transmission for all groups and users within a particular MBMS service area.
For that, two procedures have been introduced. The first one is the MBMS
bearer coordination independent on broadcasted media procedure to be used when
there are multiple MC service servers serving users in one specific area
covered with one MBMS bearer, but the servers broadcast media independent of
each other. The second procedure is the MBMS bearer coordination within one
group call. This one is used when multiple MC service servers of the same kind
participate in the same group communication. The MC service servers could be
different MC service servers assigned the participating role within one MC
system. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280.
B) MBMS bearer event notification: This feature includes an activation of an
MBMS bearer and different types of events that may occur during the lifetime
of the MBMS bearer. The different events notified to the MC service server
include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell successfully
allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells fail to allocate
MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status of the MBMS
bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios. This feature is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.468, 3GPP TS 23.246 and 3GPP TS 36.300.
C) Use of FEC to protect MBMS transmissions: Application layer FEC (Forward
Error Correction) has been introduced as an optional feature to recover the
packet losses when delivering a MC service over MBMS. Hence, the required
level of QoS can be reached. For that, two procedures on how FEC can be
applied for MBMS usage were introduced. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS
23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS
23.468 and 3GPP TS 23.246.
D) Header compression over MBMS with ROHC: Header compression can decrease the
required bandwidth for service communications. Therefore, the support of ROHC
(RObust Header Compression) over MBMS has been introduced as an optional
feature for the MC service servers and MC service clients. If header
compression and FEC are both applied to a communication over MBMS, the header
compression has to be performed after the FEC encoding. For that, two
procedures on how ROHC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. Further
required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 24.380, 3GPP TS
23.246, 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 36.300.

# 10 Features related to WLAN and unlicensed spectrum
## 10.1 WLAN direct discovery
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
750010 **Inclusion of WLAN direct discovery technologies as an alternative for
ProSe direct discovery** ProSe_WLAN_DD SP-160957 Intel Corporation; Ana Lucia
Pinheiro
Summary based on the input provided by Intel in SP-180227.
3GPP has defined the Proximity Services (ProSe) framework in TS 23.303 [1].
While the overall ProSe framework is largely independent from the actual
technology used on the direct UE-to-UE interface (i.e. on PC5), up to and
including Rel-14 the ProSe Direct Discovery could only be performed using PC5
interface based on the E-UTRA technology.
To extend the reach of the ProSe framework to a larger consumer population,
and given that WLAN support is already available in devices, this feature
proposes to integrate selected WLAN direct discovery technologies as an
alternative technology for ProSe Direct Discovery. An example of WLAN
technologies is the Wi-Fi Neighbour Awareness Networking (NAN) [2] that
provides a low-power consumption discovery alternative for discovery of
adjacent devices.
Stage 2 work (TS 23.303 [1]) focused on the following:
\- Clarification of scope, PC5 definition and ProSe Direct Discovery
definition to include WLAN-based PC5.
\- Changes to authorisation and provisioning for ProSe to include WLAN-based
PC5 and to clarify that some existing provisioning information is only
relevant for E-UTRA based PC5.
\- Addition of Informative Annex(es) describing how specific WLAN technologies
are used for transport of the ProSe Protocol message and/or information
elements. In this release of the specification the only WLAN technology that
has been specified for use with ProSe Direct Discovery is Wi-Fi NAN (Neighbour
Awareness Networking) [2].
The procedural impact on PC5 (UE to UE) and PC3 (UE to ProSe function)
interfaces defined in TS 24.334 [3] has been kept to the minimum. Where
necessary, a new parameter PC5_tech has been introduced indicating whether
ProSe Direct Discovery is performed via E-UTRA-based PC5 or WLAN-based PC5 or
both.
Stage 3 aspects of WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery are defined in TS 24.334
[3] (addition of PC5_tech in PC3 procedures), TS 24.333 [4] (addition of a new
branch to the ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO), TS 29.345 [5] (addition
of PC5_tech in PC6/PC7 procedures), TS 29.230 [6] (new AVP due to PC5_tech)
and TS 23.008 [7] (storage of PC5_tech).
Charging aspects of WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery are defined in TS 32.277
[8] (enhancement to charging description), TS 32.298 [9] (enhancement to the
Charging Data Record (CDR), and TS 32.299 [10] (enhancement to the Diameter

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-18xxxx.
USOS enables a network operator to identify and charge for traffic transported
over unlicensed access separately to traffic transported over licensed access.
In Release 14, service requirements were agreed for differentiating traffic
transported over licensed and unlicensed spectrum for charging and analysis
purposes. As part of Release 15, the following procedures have been agreed to
enable the core network to instruct the RAN on how & when to track data volume
for traffic transported on unlicensed spectrum:
\- Initiation of data counting at eNB on UE context initiation based on
Subscriber information, local MME policy, and/or per PLMN basis:
\- This ensures that traffic volumes are recorded per operator policy from the
earliest opportunity.
\- Enforcement of Secondary RAT Restriction for use of unlicensed spectrum:
\- This ensures that operator policy on the use of any of LWA/LWIP/LAA is
enforced at the eNB.
\- Reporting of data volume to the SGW via the MME during S1-release.
\- Reporting of data volume to the SGW via the MME during S1-based handover.
\- Reporting of data volume to the SGW via the MME during X2-based handover:
\- These procedures ensure that reporting to the SGW is done when the context
is released for any reason.
\- Optional reporting of data volume from SGW to PGW.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in RP-180948.
This work item enhanced UL support for LAA SCell operation in unlicensed
spectrum further by specifying support for multiple UL starting and ending
point in a subframe, and support for autonomous UL transmission, including
channel access mechanisms, core and RF requirements for base stations and UEs,
and RRM requirements [1], [2]. Channel access related aspects including
physical layer procedures, as well as UE and eNodeB requirements and
conformance test are captured into newly introduced specifications TS 37.213,
TS 37.106, and TS 37.107, respectively, while changes triggered by other
aspects of the work item are captured into TS 36-series specifications [6],
[7].
The work item used the Rel-13 study and work items on licensed-assisted access
to unlicensed spectrum [3], [4], as well as Rel-14 WI Enhanced LAA for LTE [5]
as the basis of the work. This work item was needed to enable more efficient
use of UL resources on unlicensed spectrum.
The key functionalities introduced in this work item include the following:
\- Additional starting and ending point for PUSCH transmissions on an LAA
SCell
\- Starting the PUSCH transmissions at the slot boundary.
\- Ending the PUSCH transmission after symbol #3, or at the slot boundary.
\- Selecting by the UE the starting point for PUSCH transmission at the
subframe or slot boundary depending on e.g. successful channel access.
\- Autonomous UL Access (AUL)
\- A UE can be RRC configured with a set of subframes and HARQ processes that
it may use for autonomous PUSCH transmissions.
\- AUL operation is activated and released with DCI format 0A (TM1) or 4A
(TM2).
\- A UE skips an AUL allocation if there is no data in UL buffers.
\- PRB allocation, MCS, as well as DMRS cyclic shift and orthogonal cover code
are indicated to the UE with AUL activation DCI.
\- The UE indicates to the eNodeB along with each AUL transmission the
selected HARQ-process ID, new data indicator, redundancy version, UE ID, PUSCH
starting and ending points, as well as whether the UE-acquired channel
occupancy time (COT) can be shared with the eNodeB.
\- The eNodeB may provide to the UE HARQ feedback for AUL-enabled HARQ
processes, transmit power command, and transmit PMI.

* * *
750007 **Mobile Communication System for Railways** MONASTERY SP-170163
Merkel, Juergen, Nokia
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-180854.
This work item introduces a first set of requirements to support the specific
communication needs of railways within the MCX specification set.
This work item made two additions to the Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT)
and the Mission Critical Core (MCCore) functionality. MCCore now supports a
limited functional alias functionality, a role based addressing for railways.
MCPTT now supports multi user talker control, an additional way of floor
control allowing a defined number of talkers talking at the same time in a
group communication rather than just one talker at a time.
This work initially started off in 2014 in the International Railway Union
(UIC) by an activity to collect the user scenarios to be supported by a Future
Railway Communication System (FRMCS). As those user scenarios could not be
mapped easily onto use cases in 3GPP based on the input of the UIC a Technical
Report (TR22.889) was written summarising 3GPP style use cases, to come up
with requirements for introduction in normative specifications.
The term FRMCS is used in UIC still and includes more than just the Mobile
Communication System for Railways standardised by 3GPP, see figure below, the
light gray dotted boxes are in scope of 3GPP. The darker gray cross hatched
boxes are also taken care of by 3GPP in maintaining the GSM legacy.

Figure 11.1-1: High-level relation of the Mobile Communication System for
Railways / FRMCS and legacy systems
The work item to introduce the findings of TR 22.889 into normative is called
\"Mobile Communication System for Railways\" (MONASTERY) an adapts 3GPP to
provide communication to railway users. The Mobile Communication System for
Railways eventually will resemble GSM-R and other legacy system in use
nowadays and will additionally provide communication capabilities beyond what
those systems support. It will provide higher data rates, lower data
latencies, multimedia communication, and improved communication reliability.
To facilitate smooth migration from legacy communication systems to the Mobile
Communication System for Railways, interworking requirements between legacy
communication systems and the Mobile Communication System for Railways are
provided.
Amongst others, Mobile Communication System for Railways provides emergency
group communication, low latency and high reliable data and video service in
high speed train environment. Amongst others it has the following important
features:
\- Prioritized emergency group communication, train control data and video
service
\- Seamless connectivity in high speed railway moving environments
\- Low latency and high reliable data and video service
\- Real time train monitoring and management for safe train operation
\- Reliable location tracking including tunnel condition
\- Legacy railway communication interworking to GSM-R system
\- Specialised forms of addressing used for railway communication
Basically, railway communication services can be categorized into:
\- Train control services
\- Maintenance services
\- Railway specific services (such as Railway Emergency Call, functional
addressing, and location-based addressing)
\- Other services (providing train crews or train Drivers with information of
train operation and interworking with the existing railway communication
systems)
In Rel-15 only two additions have been introduced to the Mission Critical Push
To Talk (MCPTT) and the Mission Critical Core (MCCore) functionality. MCCore
now supports a limited functional alias functionality, a role based addressing
for railways. MCPTT now supports multi user talker control, an additional way
of floor control allowing a defined number of talkers talking at the same time
in a group communication rather than just one talker at a time.
## 11.2 Northbound APIs related features
### 11.2.1 Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
770049 **Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs** CAPIF S6 SP-170798
Suresh Chitturi, Samsung
Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in SP-180862.
In 3GPP, there is a growing interest in the specification of northbound APIs
for service exposure of underlying 3GPP functions. This will enable broader
range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple
northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service
Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the
interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).
For API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a
consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API
specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework
(CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication,
authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which
allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the
API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the
3GPP northbound APIs.
TR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API
frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions
to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including
recommendations for the normative work.
TS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model,
procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines
for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in
3GPP.
TS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols
needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.
The CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model
describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e.
API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management
function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions
and the API invoker/consumer.
Figure 11.2-1: Functional model for the CAPIF
The functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-
level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including
onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs,
discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing,
monitoring, and topology hiding.
It further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF
deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF
relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and
5GS).
The detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model
is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions
over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function
services and 1 API exposing function service):
1\. CAPIF_Discover_Service_API - for an API invoker to discover APIs published
on the CAPIF core function.
2\. CAPIF_Publish_Service_API - for an API publishing function to publish and
manage published APIs on CAPIF core function.
3\. CAPIF_Events_API - for API invoker and API provider domain functions to
subscribe and get notified of CAPIF core function events.
4\. CAPIF_API_Invoker_Management_API - for an API invoker to on-board to or
off-board from a CAPIF core function.
5\. CAPIF_Security_API - for API invoker and API provider domain functions to
manage authentication and authorizations of an API invoker for CAPIF core
function and service APIs.
6\. CAPIF_Logging_API_Invocation_API - for an API exposing function to log
service API invocations on CAPIF core function.
7\. CAPIF_Auditing_API - for an API management function to retrieve service
API invocation logs stored on CAPIF core function
8\. CAPIF_Access_Control_Policy_API - for an API exposing function to retrieve
access control policies stored on CAPIF core function.
9\. AEF_Authentication_API - for an API invoker to intiate authentication by
triggering retrieval of authentication credentials from the CAPIF core
function by the API exposing function

* * *
760035 **Northbound Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for SCEF -- SCS/AS
Interworking** NAPS S6 SP-170240 Vaidya, Maulik, Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-171032.
Starting from Rel-13, 3GPP defined the Service Capabilities Exposure Function
(SCEF) framework for exposure of those 3GPP network capabilities to the
application domain. However, up until Rel-15, 3GPP specified neither the SCEF
functional architecture nor its interactions with Service Capability Servers
or Application Servers (SCS/AS), i.e. with the application domain. 3GPP was
relying on other standardization fora such as OMA or oneM2M.
Triggered by interactions with oneM2M, 3GPP started with Rel-15 to specify the
northbound APIs from SCEF to support oneM2M specifications to facilitate a
useable end-to-end M2M architecture.
The services and capabilities offered by SCEF to Service Capability Servers or
Application Servers (application domain) include:
\- Group Message Delivery using MBMS, SCS/AS deliver a payload to a group of
UEs
\- Monitoring events, for monitoring of specific events in 3GPP system and
making such monitoring events information available to SCS/AS,
\- High latency communication, handle mobile terminated (MT) communication
with UEs being unreachable while using power saving functions like Power Save
mode (PSM) or extended idle mode DRX (eDRX), e.g. SCS/AS is notified when the
UE becomes available after a Data transmission failure.
\- Informing about potential network issues, SCS/AS request to be notified
about the network status, e.g. congestion or not, in a geographical area.
\- Resource management of background data transfer, SCS/AS requests a time
window and related conditions for background data transfer to a set of UEs.
\- E-UTRAN network resource optimizations based on communication patterns
provided to the MME, the SCS/AS provide the predictable communication patterns
(CP) of a UE to the network.
\- Support of setting up an AS session with required QoS, SCS/AS request a
data session is set up with a specific QoS (e.g. low latency or jitter) and
priority handling.
\- Change the chargeable party at session set-up or during the session, SCS/AS
request to start or stop sponsoring a data session for a UE.
\- Non-IP Data Delivery (including the Reliable Data Service and Group Message
Delivery via unicast MT NIDD), handle mobile originated (MO) and mobile
terminated (MT) communication with UEs, where the data used for the
communication is considered unstructured from the EPS standpoint.
\- Packet Flow Description management, SCS/AS request to create, update or
remove PFDs in the PFDF.
\- Enhanced Coverage restriction control, SCS/AS provides the Enhanced
Coverage Restriction Control per individual UEs.
\- Network Parameter Configuration, SCS/AS issue network parameter
configuration requests to suggest parameter values used for Maximum Latency,
Maximum Response Time and Suggested Number of Downlink Packets.
\- Accessing MTC-IWF Functionality via T8, including Device triggering and
MSISDN-less MO-SMS.
The interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS is referred to as \"T8\"
interface. This feature specifies the architectural description (including
message flows, and parameters) of the T8 interface.
The T8 interface supports offline and online charging. The charging
architecture and scenarios specific to Northbound API, as well as the mapping
of the common 3GPP charging architecture onto the Northbound API, are
specified in TS 32.240 [2].
The Northbound API charging architecture, charging principles and scenarios,
definition of charging information and content of the CDRs for offline
charging are specified in TS 32.254 [3].
The corresponding AVPs and ASN.1 are specified in TS 32.298 [4] and TS 32.299
[5].

### 12.1.1 Separation of CP and UP for Split Option 2 of NR
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur

780071 **Separation of CP and UP for Split Option 2 of NR** NR_CPUP_Split R3
RP-172831 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-181149.
The WI specified a new interface, namely E1, that enables interconnecting a
gNB-CU-CP (control plane part of the gNB central unit) and a gNB-CU-UP (user
plane part of the gNB central unit) [1]. The split of control plane and user
plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit)
and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the
possibility of:
(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment
scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing,
(3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.
In the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The
gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts
the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected
via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by
enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP
hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane,
while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol
serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the
E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane
part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-
DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB
architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is
illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.
The architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios
[2]:
\- Centralized gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP: The gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP are
deployed in a centralized location, either as one or separate entities. The
gNB-CU-CP coordinates the operation of several gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU-UP provides
a central termination point for UP traffic in dual-connectivity (DC)
configurations.
\- Distributed gNB-CU-CP and centralized gNB-CU-UP: The gNB-CU-CP is deployed
in a distributed manner and co-located with the gNB-DU. The gNB-CU-CP
supervises the operation of a single gNB-DU or of a local cluster of gNB-DUs.
The gNB-CU-UP is centralized to provide a central termination point for UP
traffic in DC configurations. In this scenario, the latency of the control
signalling toward the UE is reduced as the gNB-CU-CP is co-located with the
gNB-DU.
\- Centralized gNB-CU-CP and distributed gNB-CU-UP: The gNB-CU-CP is
centralized to coordinate the operation of several gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU-UP is
distributed and co-located with a single gNB-DU or with a local cluster of
gNB-DUs and provides low UP latency to support latency-critical services.
Figure 12.1-1: Architecture with gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP split
The call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface
(e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are
captured in TS 38.401 [3]. The E1 functions and procedures are described in TS
38.460 [4]. The E1 physical layer and the signalling transport, which is based
on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described respectively in TS 38.461 [5] and
TS 38.462 [6]. The E1 application protocol (E1AP) is specified in TS 38.463
[7] and includes the description of: (1) the E1 interface management
procedures, which allow to setup the E1 interface and to exchange the relevant
configuration data between a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP; (2) the bearer context
management procedures, which allow to setup and configure user plane resources
to serve UEs.

services in E-UTRAN** LTE_QMC_Streaming R2 RP-170786 China Unicom
Summary based on the input provided by China Unicom, Huawei, China Telecom in
RP-172192 revised in RP-181821.
The benefit of understanding customers\' experience, e.g. throughput, data
loss, latency, for streaming services has attracted operators\' attention.
ITU-T P.NATS has released the standards on the model and evaluation of MOS
models for streaming services in December 2016. SA4 has specified information
about Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, DASH, services to be collected
from the DASH application on the UE and agreed to support MDT enhancement
option for both QoE metrics configuration and QoE metrics reporting [1].A WI
on QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services in UTRAN was approved at
RAN#73 and a \'container based solution\' has been specified [2]. SA5 has
studied the management solution for collection of QoE information and proposed
use cases, potential requirements and possible solutions. A WI was approved to
specify the function Management of QoE measurement collection [3].
Based on the work above, the operators can collect and utilize the QoE
measurement information of streaming services to better understand the user
experience and optimize their network in E-UTRAN. This work item specified the
core requirement for Quality of Experience (QoE) Measurement Collection for
streaming services in E-UTRAN [4].
This feature enables the network to collect QoE measurement information from
the UE. The feature is activated by Trace Function from the MDT framework.
Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For
the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards
a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism; for the management based
case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area
(without targeting a specific UE).
The QoE measurement configuration from OAM or CN in E-UTRAN is included in a
container of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message and forwarded to the UE
similar to in UTRAN. For transferring the QoE measurement report, a new SRB4
and a new uplink RRC message \"application layer measurement report\" are
introduced. SRB4 is configured via RRCConnectionReconfiguration meassage. A
container in the new message is defined to send the QoE measurement report.
The QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting are supported in
RRC_CONNECTED state only. E-UTRAN can release the QoE measurement
configuration towards the UE at any time. If not explicitly released by the
eNB, QoE measurement will be continued in case of intra-eNB HO and inter-eNB
HO and both source and target cell belong to defined same measurement
reporting area.

Stockhammer, Qualcomm
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-171006.
This summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished
during the course of the HDR work item [1]. Primarily, the TV Video Profile
specification in TS.26.116 [2] was updated to support High Dynamic Range (HDR)
video. In addition, the media capabilities are enabled in PSS and MBMS by
updates of the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively.
HDR is one of the biggest movements in mobile devices recently. It\'s
following a trend that\'s been tearing through the TV industry over the past
few years. While it is still early days for this emerging technology, it is
also making a difference for mobile video and it requires consistent
standardized technologies. HDR stands for high dynamic range and it\'s been a
buzzword in TV for the past couple of years. HDR is often assigned to display
capabilities, i.e. that the display is able to produce a wider range of
colours, bringing greater authenticity, but also about brightness and
contrast. In order to feed such new display technologies, consistent and
efficient delivery formats have been established in the TV world. The work
item supports the move of such experience to mobile devices to create the same
stunning experience: richer colors, better contrast and brighter highlights.
The work item addresses the definition of consistent and efficient HDR video
signals and receiver capabilities for TV centric services in 3GPP. To this
end, the experiences and technologies in the TV centric markets have been
reviewed and adapted to 3GPP Video. The work item defines the relevant
extensions to support High Dynamic Range in 3GPP TV Video Profiles.
Specifically, an HDR video profile based on the Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) is
defined, following the recommendations in ITU-R BT.2100. This includes the use
of H.265 (HEVC) for compression, the definition of transfer functions and
color primaries, the definition of relevant metadata as well as the
integration into PSS and MBMS services. The completion of the work brings the
3GPP TV Video Profile specification on par with other TV Video standards, e.g.
the ones defined for example by DVB and ATSC.

770025 **Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media** VRStream S4 SP-170612
Thomas Stockhammer, Qualcomm
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-180746.
This summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished
during the course of the VRStream work item [1]. Primarily, the \"Virtual
Reality Profiles for Streaming Media\" specification in TS.26.118 [2] was
developed to support Virtual Reality (VR) in streaming applications. In
addition, the media capabilities are enabled in Packet Switched Streaming
(PSS) Services and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) by updates of
the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively. The
characterization results for audio media profile proponents are documented in
TR 26.818 [5].
Based on the findings in TR 26.918 [6], the work item developed the first set
of Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media. Virtual Reality (VR) is the
ability to be virtually present in a space created by the rendering of natural
and/or synthetic image and sound correlated by the movements of the immersed
user allowing interacting with that world. Virtual reality typically assumes a
user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the user\'s
field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear headphones, to
provide the user with the accompanying audio. In the first set of technologies
defined in TS 26.118, VR users are expected to be able to look around from a
single observation point in 3D space, also referred to as three degrees of
freedom (3DoF). It allows the user to (i) tilt side to side (Rolling), (ii)
tilt forward and backward (Pitching), and (iii) turning left and right
(Yawing). The specification defines a 3GPP 3DOF reference and coordinate
system as well as an end-to-end architecture. In the reference client, it is
assumed that pose information, i.e. the position derived by the head tracking
sensor expressed by (azimuth; elevation; tilt angle), is continuously
available to the VR renderer in order to render the viewport. Based on the
system model, video and audio technologies are defined including system
technologies (DASH and file format), suitable codecs and rendering
technologies.
Specifically on video, three operation points (combination of elementary
stream and rendering metadata) and three corresponding media profiles are
defined, namely:
\- Basic Video: Based on H.264/AVC High Profile Level 5.1 for mono only,
single stream, and reuse of single stream DASH streaming. This profile
addresses legacy service and devices. This profile allows reuse of existing
file format and DASH implementations also for VR Streaming.
\- Main Video: Based on H.265/HEVC High Profile Level 5.1 allowing mono and
stereo, single stream, but either a single or multiple independent Adaptation
Sets may be offered, such that a client can choose based on its current pose.
This profile allows reuse of existing file format and DASH implementations
also for VR Streaming.
\- Advanced Video: based on H.265/HEVC High Profile Level 5.1, but in addition
to the Main Video features, it permits to stream and combine multiple tiles at
the receiver for improved quality.
For PSS, all three profiles are added, the first one is mandatory (
\'shall\'), the second one recommended (\'should\') and the third one allowed
(\'may\'). For MBMS, the first two profiles are added, the first one is
mandatory ( \'shall\'), the second one is recommended ( \'should\') and
constrained to non-viewport adaptive streaming.
For audio, one solution was selected and is documented in TS 26.118, namely
MPEG-H 3D Audio Baseline profile. This technology enables the distribution of
channel, object and scene-based 3D audio. Additional interesting technologies
enabling the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio were
considered, and the characterization results of all proposed technologies are
documented in TR 26.818 [5].
In addition to media specific metadata, system metadata is added to TS 26.118
to support rendering of 360 experiences on 2D screens, including the aspects
of rendering without pose information. Basic requirements for a full audio-
visual experience are documented under the umbrella of VR Presentations.
The completion of the work item provides a set of consistent technologies for
Virtual Reality in Rel-15 for 5G Phase 1. It is providing a response to the
demand identified during the successful joint 3GPP/VR-IF Workshop on Virtual
Reality that took place in December 2017 [7], which was an integral part of
the development of 3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Applications.

Summary based on the input provided by Sony Mobile Communications in
SP-180460.
This work item developed requirements and test method for receive loudness
rating RLR in the presence of background noise. The work was initiated
following a liaison statement [3] concerning acoustic safety limits,
expressing a need for a test that covers not only silent lab conditions but
also noisy scenarios.
The new test described in a change request [2] to TS 26.132 uses:
\- background noise playback in a lab environment, reusing methods which are
already specified for other 3GPP test cases
\- speech playback in the receive (downlink) direction, using standardized
signals
\- synchronization mechanisms enabling repeatable stimuli to the UE
\- artificial ear recordings using a head and torso simulator
\- cancelation of noise components for accurate measurement of the UE output
signal, despite the noisy measurement situation
The requirements described in a change request [2] to TS 26.131 specify a
limit for the receive loudness rating RLR in the presence of background noise,
for the maximum setting of the volume control, in handset and headset modes
for all speech bandwidths (narrowband, wideband and super-wideband/fullband).
The limit is the same as already specified for the case where no background
noise is applied.

MPEG has developed a set of technologies under the name Server and Network
assisted DASH (ISO/IEC 23009-5) [SAND]. MPEG SAND defines message formats and
interfaces among server, client, edge proxy and network elements toward
enhancing streaming quality of experience (QoE). During Rel-14, 3GPP SA4
conducted the study item FS_SAND toward identifying enhancements offered by
MPEG SAND in the 3GPP environment, and recommend necessary modifications to
the 3GPP specifications including DASH to enable these enhancements. Relevant
architectures, use cases, gap analysis and potential solutions pertaining to
3GPP enhancements based on MPEG SAND have been documented in TR 26.957.
Aligned with the conclusions of the FS_SAND study item documented in clause 11
of TR 26.957, the Rel-15 work item on SAND was conducted and the following
functionality based on MPEG SAND in ISO/IEC 23009-5 was introduced into 3GPP
DASH:
\- Streaming enhancements via intelligent caching, processing and delivery
optimizations on the server and/or network side, based on feedback from
clients on anticipated DASH Segments, accepted alternative DASH
Representations and Adaptation Sets, client buffer level and requested
bandwidth.
\- Improved adaptation on the client side, based on network/server-side
information such as cached Segments, alternative Segment availability,
recommended media rate and network throughput/QoS.
In particular, normative work on TS 26.247 was completed to introduce SAND
support with the definition of three SAND modes, namely \'Proxy Caching\',
\'Network Assistance\' and \'Consistent QoE/QoS\'. SAND messages and protocols
to use with 3GPP DASH were defined for each of these SAND modes, and normative
behaviours for SAND message handling for the 3GP DASH client and DASH-aware
network element (DANE) were specified. Procedures for DANE discovery have also
been described in TS 26.247. In addition, use of SAND functionality for
enabling network assistance, proxy caching and consistent QoE/QoS have been
described in detail in TS 26.247, with the specification of relevant SAND
message usage and extensions where necessary, and the inclusion of example
workflows. Finally, TS 26.233 has also been updated to describe SAND support
in PSS and the impacts on related system architecture functions. The related
agreed CRs can be found in Tdocs S4-170404 (CR26233-0013) and S4-170732

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-180521.
This summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished
during the course of the SAND4M work item [1]. Primarily, a SAND mode was
defined in TS 26.247 [2] to support SAND for multiple network access (SAND4M).
In addition, consistent support of hybrid MBMS services in TS 26.346 [3] was
added, supporting also unicast-supplemented services. The interface/API
between MBMS client and DASH client in TS 26.347 [4] was updated to add the
SAND4M mode to the MBMS client and DASH client. The now outdated MBMS User
Service Guidelines in TR 26.946 [5] are updated as well.
For the operation of the DASH client on top of an MBMS client, in particular
for the case of MBMS Operation on Demand (MooD) and for MBMS/unicast service
continuity, a need was identified to have API level communication between the
MBMS client and the DASH client. Based on the 3GPP requirements, initially
documented in TR 26.946 [5], MPEG initiated and completed the work on Server
and Network Assisted DASH (SAND) in ISO/IEC 23009-5, which provides enablers
for a consistent network assistance for DASH. With completion of the work in
MPEG, the guidelines in TR26.946 are migrated to normative specification in
3GP-DASH in TS 26.247 [2] and TS 26.347 [4] to support of MBMS Operation on
Demand (MooD) and for MBMS/unicast service continuity.
In addition, unicast-supplemented service offerings in MBMS, for which certain
resources are only available on unicast and these resources provide an
additional user experience, are added in addition to the already existing
unicast fallback mode to support consistent support for these services. This
for example permits to offer an MBMS service for which a second language is
only available over unicast and therefore needs to be made available to the
DASH client even if the DASH client is in broadcast coverage.
In order to provide a consistent support for the above features a SAND mode
for multiple network support is defined in TS 26.247 [2] and the relevant
enablers for the MBMS client and the interface between DASH client and the
MBMS client are defined. In addition, consistent support of hybrid MBMS
services in TS 26.346 [3] was added, supporting also unicast-supplemented
services.

Summary based on the input provided by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. in
SP-180535.
The FLUS Work Item [1] introduces a new framework that can be used to receive
live captured streams from UEs, potentially connected to external camera
systems. FLUS can be realized as an extension to the existing MTSI service,
allowing the live streaming of immersive media such as 360 video.
Alternatively, FLUS can be accessed through a RESTful API that allows UEs to
identify a receiver for their live streams during a live streaming session.
The Framework for Live Uplink Streaming is a framework that offers the
following functionalities to the UE:
\- A definition of typical source (capture) systems and their metadata.
\- An extension to MTSI to enable integration of live captured streams, such
as VR streams, as part of a video call.
\- A flexible framework that can be used to realize live streaming sessions
offering:
\- A RESTful-based Control Plane to select an end point for the live stream,
negotiate session parameters, and establish and terminate a session.
\- A flexible user plane that allows users of the FLUS framework to deploy
their preferred instantiation with full control of the protocols and media
formats.
\- A documentation of a selected set of instantiations as part of TR 26.939
[2] that is based on fragmented MP4 files.
The FLUS framework comes with placeholders for descriptions of any following
processing and distribution of the received live streams. This can for
instance indicate that content is to be stitched into a 360 VR video and then
distributed through PSS DASH.
The following figure summarizes the key functions of the FLUS Framework:

Summary based on the input provided by CMCC in RP-172381 revised in RP-181747.
This work item specifies enhancements for long backhaul latency reduction for
video.
In this WI, UE assisted local cache is introduced.
UE assisted local cache is a solution to address long backhaul latency issue.
The UE is allowed to transmit assistance information bit to eNB to enable the
eNB to identify whether an uplink data needs to be transferred to the local
cache entity, which may be co-sited with eNB or has direct connection with
eNB, by operator implementation.
UE can report to the network its capability of supporting UE assistance
information for local cache. If supported, the UE assisted local cache
function can be activated by the eNB. After that, the UE may indicate the
assistance information in the uplink PDCP PDU. Whether the UE includes this
assistance information is based on for instance the service from the
application layer the UE requests that support local cache handling.

After the investigation of the reproducibility of the method regarding
different measurement rooms, a change request [6] with final performance
requirements and objectives to Rel-15 of TS 26.131 was agreed.
In addition, another change request [7] to TS 26.132 regarding the assessment
method was agreed within this work item. In Rel-14 of TS 26.132, the two
prediction models (A and B) according to ETSI TS 103 281 were used. Due to a
pending commercially available implementation of model B, the measurement
procedure was modified to use only model A.

Antenna System (AAS)** AASenh_BS_LTE_UTRA R4 RP-161668 Huawei 770034 **Self-
Organizing Networks (SON) for Active Antenna System (AAS) deployment

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP -172345 (long version),
revised in RP-182112 (shorter version, more in line with the rest of this
present document).
The WI added a full set of OTA requirements to the AAS BS specification for
MSR, single RAT UTRA and single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS with no conducted interface.
The OTA AAS BS is a system which contains multiple transceiver (i.e. â‰¥8 for
E-UTRA and MSR, or â‰¥4 for UTRA) units and a composite antenna. Since a single
OTA AAS BS is comparable to a non-AAS BS with multiple transceivers, the eAAS
requirements aim to ensure that the same protection and performance is
provided as a non-AAS BS with 8 transceivers for E-UTRA and MSR and with 4
transceivers for UTRA.
The previous AAS WI produced an AAS BS specification for an AAS BS which
provided access to a conducted interface. Requirements were applied at both
the conducted interface (the Transceiver Array Boundary) and the radiated
interface. An AAS BS conforming to the release 13/14 AAS BS requirements is
now referred to as a hybrid AAS BS in the release 15 specification. To enable
AAS BS with larger number of transceiver units and higher frequencies, where
maintaining a conducted interface may limit implementation, all OTA
requirements have been developed enabling the OTA AAS BS to be treated as a
black box that is tested externally using radiated test signals.
### 12.6.1 Architecture and interfaces
The OTA AAS BS architecture is similar to the hybrid AAS BS architecture with
the removal of the conducted interface (the transceiver array boundary).

Figure 12.6.1-1: Radiated points of reference of _OTA AAS BS_
The Radiated Interface Boundary (RIB) is an interface at which the OTA
requirements can be specified. As an OTA AAS BS is expected to have a large
number of transceiver units, the minimum number of transceiver units is
restricted to 8 for E-UTRA and MSR and to transceiver 4 for UTRA.
### 12.6.2 OTA requirements
**Transmitter requirements**
Transmitter requirements can be classified into 3 types:
1\. Directional requirements
Directional requirements are specified over the OTA peak directions set (for
power accuracy requirement) or the OTA coverage range (for signal quality
requirements). Multiple OTA peak directions sets may be declared by the BS
manufacturer for the widest and narrowest possible beam widths along with the
associated EIRP values. There is only a single OTA coverage range declared,
all the OTA peak directional sets have to be within the OTA coverage range.
Examples of the directional requirements are: EIRP accuracy, power dynamics,
control signal power accuracy, signal quality (EVM, frequency accuracy, TAE).
2\. TRP emissions
Emissions limits are specified as TRP as in the dynamic cellular environment
where UE\'s can be considered as randomly located it is the Total Radiated
Power (TRP) which dominated the average level of interference to adjacent
networks rather than the instantaneous peak power.
Examples of the TRP requirements are: Wanted signal power, unwanted emissions
(ACLR, UEM, SEM) and Tx spurious emissions.
3\. Co-location requirements
Co-location requirements are a new type of OTA requirements introduced in
Rel-15 RAN4 BS specifications, which specify performance in co-location
scenarios. OTA co-location requirements define the BS co-location scenario and
specify power levels into and out of a Co-location Reference Antenna (CRA)
placed next to the AAS BS.
Examples of co-location requirements are: Tx OFF power, protection of RX, co-
location emissions, TX IMD.
**Receiver requirements**
With the exception of the receiver spurious emissions (which is TRP like the
transmitter spurious emissions) all the receiver requirements are based on
receiving a wanted signal at a specified power level, either on its own or in
the presence of an interferer.
The OTA receiver requirements have 2 types of OTA sensitivity defined:
1\. OTA sensitivity - highest gain assumed hence lowest EIS.
The Rel-13/14 specification included OTA sensitivity requirement which was
based on a declared range of angle of arrivals (RoAoA) for the UL signal. The
OTA sensitivity requirement is by BS manufacturer declaration and was intended
to capture the effects of the antenna (such as scan loss). Multiple
declarations can be made with different EIS values and RoAoA\'s. One of the
declarations will be based on the maximum antenna gain and hence will
represent the best case EIS, this value is defined as OTA minimum sensitivity.
2\. OTA reference sensitivity - lowest gain assumed hence highest interferer
levels.
The OTA reference sensitivity is the minimum level of sensitivity to be
achieved over the OTA REFSEN RoAoA which is defined as the RoAoA determined by
the contour defined by the points at which the achieved EIS is 3dB higher than
the achieved EIS in the reference direction. It is equivalent to the
sensitivity a passive system would achieve over the same RoAoA. The level is
also used to specify the maximum interferers to be seen by each receiver unit
input.
Each of the interference requirements are specified with respect to:
\- the OTA sensitivity, or
\- the OTA reference sensitivity, or
\- Both, depending on the nature of the requirement.
For in-band interference requirements (i.e. dynamic range, ACS ICS, in-band
blocking, RX IMD) wanted and interferer signal are specified as having the
same angle of arrival. The relative difference between the wanted signal and
the interferer is the same as the conducted requirement in all cases.
Out of band blocking requirement is specified as field strength (in V/m) and
is the same for all frequencies. The wanted signal is an offset from
EIS~minSENS~.
For co-location blocking tests a radiated wanted signal, based on an offset
from EIS~minSENS~, is specified in the same way as the other interference
requirements. The interferer is applied via CRA, the level of the interferer
is specified at the conducted input to the CRA.
**EMC requirements**
EMC radiated emission requirements are already OTA and are hence merged into
the RF radiated spurious emission requirements. As the RF requirements are
dominant, the OTA emissions are captured in the BS RF specification and this
is referenced from the RAN4 BS EMC specification.
The EMC radiated immunity requirements generate much higher interferer levels
than the RF blocking requirements and hence the two aspects have to be
separated. As the OTA AAS BS has an intentional radiator and its wanted
performance is specified by the declared RoAoA, these 2 types of RAN4
requirements are separated by a spatial mask (i.e. so called spatial
exclusion) with radiated immunity requirement only specified outside the
declared RoAoA.

### 12.8.1 Simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
760082 **Simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS** UTRA_simple_HSSCCH R6 RP-171443
Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-172306.
The HS-SCCH is a downlink control channel used for scheduling HS-DSCH
transmissions as well as for instructing the UE to perform specific actions
via HS-SCCH orders. The HS-SCCH is monitored by the UE at all path-loss
conditions within the cell, and according to current observations the HS-SCCH
can become limiting and costly in bad radio conditions since the power
invested in the HS-SCCH limits the available power for the HS-PDSCH.
The decoding of the HS-SCCH is performed by testing against all the codewords
that can be carried over the HS-SCCH, since any of those codewords could have
been transmitted in downlink. Nonetheless under bad radio conditions only a
small subset of those codewords can occur in practice. In addition, the
detection/decoding of the HS-SCCH part I (slot 0) needs to succeed before
proceeding to decode the HS-SCCH part II (slot 1 & 2), meaning that the
detection and decoding of slot 0 is a key aspect of the performance of the HS-
SCCH.
Accounting for the above technical aspects, and the investigations performed
during the study item phase, it was concluded that the simplification on the
HS-SCCH type 1 should consist of making \"known in advance\" the bits
corresponding to the \"Modulation Scheme\" and the \"Number of codes\" (code
group indicator bits).
The simplification of the HS-SCCH type 1 brings benefits in terms of BLER, an
improved false detection, an improved miss detection, power savings in
downlink (could be translated to coverage improvements), and backward
compatibility.
The Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation enables the UE to determine when to
expect HS-SCCH type 1 transmissions indicating one HS-PDSCH code and QPSK
modulation scheme.
The legacy CQI reports are used as triggering mechanism when low CQI values
(from 1 to 6) are reported from the UE to the network. In addition to the CQI
based triggering mechanism, HS-SCCH orders can be used to create an interval
where the HS-SCCH type 1 is received carrying one HS-PDSCH code and QPSK
modulation scheme to extend the usage of the simplified HS-SCCH type 1
transmission independently of the radio conditions.
For both triggering mechanisms, once the UE has transmitted a CQI report over
the HS-DPCCH, the UE may expect a HS-SCCH type 1 transmission carrying control
information corresponding to one HS-PDSCH code and QPSK modulation scheme in
the first available HS-SCCH subframe, once four sub-frames have passed after
the end of the sub-frame where the HS-DPCCH was transmitted.
When the network has transmitted a HS-SCCH order for stopping the transmission
interval created by the HS-SCCH orders, a fall back to the CQI based
triggering mechanism occurs.
The Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation is applicable for Cell_DCH state.
The UE indicates its capability support for Simplified HS-SCCH type 1
operation to the network. The network signals its support in RRC messages to
the UE.

### 12.8.2 Increased number of E-UTRAN data bearers
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
780070 **Increased number of E-UTRAN data bearers** INOBEARRAN R2 RP-180569
Samsung
Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in RP-181619.
The maximum number of LTE / EPS data bearers has been limited to 8 in LTE
Rel-8. Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in
principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8
data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new
services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio
bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without
this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour
that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It
also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or
5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging
differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and
scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.
In response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a
new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number
of supported data radio bearers.
LTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never
revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network
signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has
logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.
RAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to
64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported
data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control
elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it
was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to
minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN
signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio
bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE
requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.
As for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can
support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist
procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as
many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no
changes were introduced in RAN WG3.
Finally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the
number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can
be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture
options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected
to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services
irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.

790035 **Increasing the number of EPS bearers** INOBEAR S2 SP-171044
Andy.Bennett, Samsung
Summary based on the input provided by Samsung R&D Institute UK in SP-181196.
This Work Item, in conjunction with the changes made for INOBEARRAN, allows
for 8 or 15 bearers when attached to WB-E_UTRAN access. (This applies also for
dual connectivity using E-UTRAN access.)
As mentioned in the summary for INOBEARRAN, the maximum number of EPS bearers
has previously been limited to 8 since Rel-8 but it has become apparent that
more than 8 radio bearers are needed to simultaneously support all the
services that operators have been introducing. TSG SA agreed to work on a
Rel-15 Work Item [1], which is a counterpart of INOBEARRAN, to ensure that 15
EPS bearers can be supported by the core network.
E-UTRAN idle mode mobility and handover procedures are updated to support the
additional EPS bearers. In networks that are only partly upgraded, mobility
procedures to target nodes that do not support 15 EPS bearers result in
bearers being released based on existing error handling procedures. Bearers
will also be released if a UE that supports 15 bearers moves to UTRAN or
GERAN, as GPRS core network and Radio Access networks do not support 15 PDP
contexts.
To minimize the impact of releasing bearers as a result of mobility to non-
supporting target nodes the MME should be able to allocate EPS bearer IDs in
such way that the bearers with higher operator preference will be preserved in
case of mobility involving legacy target nodes.
It is necessary for all PDN GWs in a PLMN to support 15 EPS bearers, and
MME\'s can be configured to take into account whether the HPLMN supports 15
EPS bearers when selecting a PDN GW for a supporting UE. Inter-PLMN handover
is also based on MME configuration.

Summary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO in SP-180858.
Requirements for background data transfer were enhanced in order to avoid
\"bill shock\" in the 3rd party and to handle the dynamic change of transfer
policies.
An indication from the 3rd party server to the 3GPP system was introduced, so
that the 3rd party server can indicate that background data transfer when that
happens beyond agreed conditions is to be stopped. A capability was introduced
that allows the 3GPP system to respond to the 3rd party server in one
coordinated response, which reflects congestion level over a certain
geographic area. Stage 1 work only was done. Stage 2 work for EPC was not
initiated. Stage 2 work for 5GC is taking into account these requirements; the
details are found in TS 23.503.

780046 **Enhanced VoLTE performance** eVoLP S2 SP-170935 Xiaobo Wu, Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-19xxxx.
Voice services over LTE (VoLTE) may require better LTE RSRP (Reference Signal
Receiving Power) compared to data service, which means the LTE radio signal
may be good enough for pure data session, but may not be good enough for
VoLTE. LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data
services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers
in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner,
i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared
to UEs with only data bearers.
As in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS
(MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile,
there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with
initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate
and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice
Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher
robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.
Based on the above provided background and depending on network dimensioning,
which typically targets at data services, the VoLTE coverage may be a function
of the selected codec and its configuration, its rate adaptation, and
potentially the applied application layer redundancy, as well as the required
QoS of the VoLTE bearer. It is adopted that a new QoS parameter Maximum Packet
Loss Rate in UL and DL directions is defined and sent from PCRF to eNB. At
reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured
through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL
based on the IMS service information e.g. codec and sends it to PCEF along
with the PCC rule for the voice media. This parameter is transferred to the
eNB to support it for handover threshold decision.
Based on the analysis/evaluation of this eVoLP WID, the existing 3GPP 4G
specifications TS 23.401, 23.203 and 5G specifications TS 23.501, 23.502,
23.503 have been modified according to it.

Qualcomm
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in RP-171135.
This feature introduces new RRC (DL) signaling for indicating adjacent channel
interference.
The indication, from the network to the UE, about potential DL adjacent
channel interference, can be beneficial for optimizing DL performance, e.g. UE
could try to filter out the interference signal(s).
The feature is applicable to FDD only, and has been standardized starting from
Rel-14.
With the feature DL interference mitigation [2, 3], the UE can receive
indication about a possible DL adjacent channel interference level (due to
GSM). The new signalling indication is conveyed in existing broadcast messages
(SIB 5/6). UEs could use such indication to mitigate the DL interference, e.g.
using optimized Rx filtering.
The new RRC/SIB signalling indication is as follows (new IE [1]):
+---------------+----------+---------------+---------------+---------+ | IE name | Presence | Type/Value | Description | Release | +---------------+----------+---------------+---------------+---------+ | Adjacent | Optional | Enumerated\ | Only for FDD. | REL-14 | | channel | | (MODERATE, | | | | interference | | HIGH) | This IE | | | level | | | indicates the | | | | | | level of | | | | | | external | | | | | | adjacent | | | | | | channel | | | | | | interference. | | +---------------+----------+---------------+---------------+---------+
Below is the stage-3 description of the UE behaviour (RRC SIB5/6 handling),
[1].
1> for FDD, if the IE \"Adjacent Channel Interference level\" is included and
UE supports DL interference mitigation:
2> configure the lower layers with the IE \"Adjacent Channel Interference
level\", which may be used to mitigate the DL interference, e.g. to apply an
optimized Rx filtering.
Further details are left to implementation.

760012 **Enhanced Calling Name Service** eCNAM SP-160548 Hala Mowafy, Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson, sent by e-mail.
TS 22.173 V15.1.0 introduced the service description of Enhanced Calling Name
(eCNAM), and subsequently, TS 24.196 V15.0.0 specified the stage three
(protocol description) of this terminating service. eCNAM provides the
subscriber with the following:
1\. An untruncated name (not limited to 15-characters), and
2\. Metadata.
Delivery of an untruncated name plus metadata about the originating party
assists subscribers in better managing their incoming calls and empowers them
to protect themselves against potential scams. The untruncated name and some
of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the
terminating service provider.
**Description**
Figure 12.8.7-1: eCNAM Environment and Functionality
eCNAM does not deliver messages from the originator across multiple networks
to the terminating user. eCNAM is a service that resides in the terminating
service provider\'s (SP) network, most likely in the Telephony Application
Server (TAS). However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP
signalling.
1) STIR/SHAKEN attestation takes place in the originating network.
2) Incoming SIP Invite.
3) Terminating network verifies the STIR certificate.
4) If verification is successful, eCNAM service commences. Name and metadata
are retrieved from authoritative sources using an E.164 TN as that searchkey.
5) It is expected that terminating SPs will employ an assessment of the
incoming call through analytics. Some of the call information will be used as
input to the analytics (analytics is not part of eCNAM)
6) The eCNAM service logic (in the TAS) assembles the data and formats it to
be delivered for display on the UE.
The untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the
From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating
Application Server sends to the terminating UE.
The metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The
eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements
(subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location
of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may
include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the
subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with
analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g.,
known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the
form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM
Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the
changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary.
eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info
header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to
modify existing standards frequently.

Deutsche Telekom AG
Summary based on the input provided by T-Mobile Austria GmbH in SP-180686.
\"PS Data Off Services\" (PS_DATA_OFF) was a new feature in 3GPP Rel-14 which,
when configured by the HPLMN and activated by the user, prevents transport via
PDN connections in 3GPP access of all IP packets except IP packets required by
3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. In Phase 2, for the new work item
\"PS_DATA_OFF2\", the HPLMN may configure up to two sets of 3GPP PS Data Off
Exempt Services for its subscribers: one is used when in HPLMN and another
when roaming.
Stage 1 made changes into TS 22.011 to update the requirements and the list of
PS Data Off Exempt Services. It is now possible that the HPLMN configures up
to two sets of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for its subscribers (one is
used when in HPLMN and one when roaming).
Stage 2 is based on Rel-14 Study Item FS_PS_DATA_OFF approved at SA#72 (June
2016) - TR 23.702, taking into account also the changed requirements from
stage 1 in TS 22.011. SA2 has completed the Work Item PS_DATA_OFF2 with CRs to
update TS 23.060, TS 23.203, TS 23.221, TS 23.228, and TS 23.401 for the
normative work. The scope is to provide architecture enhancements to update
3GPP PS Data Off feature in the stage 2 specifications based on the stage 1
requirements defined in TS 22.011:
\- Making the UE aware of the list of services configured to be part of the
3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services to allow appropriate policy enforcement in
the UE for uplink traffic. In Rel-15 up to two lists are possible, one to be
used for HPLMN and one to be used when roaming, for all VPLMNs.
Stage 3 is covered by Work Item PS_DATA_OFF2-CT:
\- CT1 with CRs to update TS 24.424, TS 24.301, TS 24.229, TS 24.368, TS

# 13 LTE improvements
## 13.1 Further enhancements to Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) Operation for
LTE
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
750060 **Further enhancements to Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) Operation for
LTE** feCOMP_LTE R1 RP-171031 Intel
Summary based on the input provided by Intel Corporation, ZTE in RP-180318.
Based on the conclusions from the study item on \"further enhancements to
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) operation for LTE\", captured in TR 36.741 [1],
this work item (WI) aims for providing specification support for non-coherent
joint transmission scheme [2], where the transmission of the multiple MIMO
layers is performed from two transmission points (TPs) without adaptive
precoding across the TPs.
The following new functionalities have been specified as part of the work
item:
\- Support of a new quasi co-location assumption for DM-RS antenna ports at
the UE:
\- New quasi co-location (QCL) assumption of Type C was specified for the UE
supporting transmission mode 10 (TM10). The new QCL assumption allows network
implementation with simultaneous transmission of two DM-RS antenna port groups
and associated two sets of MIMO layers from two TPs without joint precoding
across the TPs.
\- Support of control signalling enhancements to assist QCL and PDSCH REs
mapping:
\- For non-coherent joint transmission, due to difference in the propagation
environment or practical impairments, the received MIMO layers at the UE from
different TPs may have different time and frequency offset characteristics. To
facilitate proper time and frequency offset tracking and consistent channel
estimation at the UE for the MIMO layer(s) transmitted by different TPs, the
control signalling has been enhanced to support indication of up to two
reference signals set (one per each set of MIMO layers) that can be used by
the UE to obtain the correct reference for synchronization. Similarly, due to
different reference signals configurations (e.g. CRS) at the TPs, physical
downlink shared channel (PDSCH) resources may not be the same for two sets of
MIMO layers. The control signalling enhancement also specifies mechanism to
indicate for the UE up to two sets of physical resource elements for PDSCH
reception (one per each set of MIMO layers).
\- Support of CSI feedback enhancement:
\- To facilitate accurate link adaption in non-coherent joint transmission,
enhancement to channel state information (CSI) reporting was introduced. The
CSI enhancement facilitates reporting information on the preferred number of
the MIMO layers, precoding information and channel quality information per
each TPs under assumption of non-coherent joint transmission. The CSI
enhancement for NC-JT also supports fall back CSI reporting assuming
conventional transmission of PDSCH from a single TP.

750064 **Enhancements for high capacity stationary wireless link and
introduction of 1024 QAM for LTE DL** LTE_1024QAM_DL R1 RP-171067 Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180854.
In many scenarios with high capacity wireless connections, the distinctive
wireless channel characteristics can be utilized to improve network
efficiency. One scenario is a small cell setting with higher SINR, where LTE
eNB communicate with stationary laptop or docked smartphone. Another scenario
is that LTE eNB communicate with an outdoor above-rooftop or indoor customer
premises equipment (CPE) which then delivers traffic to indoor users via other
links.
This work item [1] specifies enhancements for unicast physical channels and
related procedures and signalling to exploit the characteristics of stationary
wireless links, specifically the support of 1024QAM and DMRS overhead
reduction [2]. In addition, new UE categories are also specified supporting DL
1024QAM.
1024QAM for DL channels.
To further improve spectral efficiency, 1024QAM can be configured for PDSCH to
DL 1024QAM capable UEs. The constellation mapping is extended as following for
bits${ b_{i},\ldots,b_{i + 9}}$.
$x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{682}}\left( 1 - 2b_{i} \right)\left\lbrack 16 - \left( 1 -
2b_{i + 2} \right)\left\lbrack 8 - \left( 1 - 2b_{i + 4} \right)\left\lbrack 4
- \left( 1 - 2b_{i + 6} \right)\left\lbrack 2 - \left( 1 - 2b_{i + 8} \right)
\right\rbrack \right\rbrack \right\rbrack \right\rbrack$
$+ \ j\frac{1}{\sqrt{682}}\left( 1 - 2b_{i + 1} \right)\left\lbrack 16 -
\left( 1 - 2b_{i + 3} \right)\left\lbrack 8 - \left( 1 - 2b_{i + 5}
\right)\left\lbrack 4 - \left( 1 - 2b_{i + 7} \right)\left\lbrack 2 - \left( 1
- 2b_{i + 9} \right) \right\rbrack \right\rbrack \right\rbrack \right\rbrack$
New TBS indexes 34A, 35, 36, 37 and 37A and new MCS table corresponding to
1024QAM have been specified. When configured, the UE will monitor DL DCI
assignments with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SPS-C-RNTI of DCI formats other
than 1A and 1C to use the newly introduced MCS table and TBS indexes to
support 1024QAM. New CQI table has also been introduced with entries
supporting 1024QAM. This allows configured UEs to feedback CQI with spectral
efficiency supported by 1024QAM. In addition, UE capability for support of
1024QAM is reported per band/band combination.
RF EVM for DL 1024QAM
To achieve the benefits of high order modulation, the EVM requirement needs to
be fulfilled at eNB side. EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) is a measure of the
difference between the ideal symbols and the transmitted symbols after
equalization, which is critical to the performance of data channels. The
required EVM at LTE eNB is 2.5% for 1024QAM.
DMRS overhead reduction
The DMRS overhead for TM9/10 is reduced by using OCC4 for DL SU-MIMO rank 3 or
4. With the introduced DMRS overhead reduction, the DMRS overhead is reduced
by a half and the spectral efficiency is increased. New entries are added to
the DMRS table (the table for Antenna port(s), scrambling identity and number
of layers indication) to support the scheduling of PDSCH with reduced DMRS.
Rel-15 UE DL Categories
DL UE category 20 is updated to support DL 1024QAM. New DL UE categories have
been specified with support of 1024QAM as below:
\- DL Category 22 with peak data rate 2.3-2.5Gbps
\- DL Category 23 with peak data rate 2.7-2.8Gbps
\- DL Category 24 with peak data rate 2.9-3Gbps
\- DL Category 25 with peak data rate 3.1-3.3Gbps
\- DL Category 26 with peak data rate 3.4-3.5Gbps

761001 **UE requirements for network-based CRS interference mitigation for
LTE** LTE_NW_CRS_IM R4 RP-171408 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by LTE Ericsson LM in RP-181864.
This Work Item implements the E-UTRA network and UE operation with reduced CRS
bandwidth in LTE whenever UEs do not perform any DL or UL operation requiring
CRS, and allows to achieve in practice the gains with CRS reduction which were
suggested by, e.g., the Rel-12 Study Item on Small Cell Enhancements for
E-UTRA and E-UTRAN - Physical-layer aspects and the Rel-13 Work Item on
Licensed-Assisted Access using LTE which enabled the operation in CRS free DL
SCells in unlicensed spectrum.
Right from the start in Rel-8, LTE has been designed to rely on Cell-specific
Reference Signals (CRS), which are transmitted over full system bandwidth and
in all DL subframes of an LTE radio frame and used by UE for many important
purposes, e.g., cell search/mobility, time/frequency synchronization, channel
estimation, and radio resource management.
The Work Item on UE requirements for network-based CRS interference enabled a
cell to transmit over a reduced bandwidth (6 centre PRBs) when there is no
need for its CRS or the network load is not high, which allows to adapt the
CRS bandwidth in cells, e.g., to:
\- reduce the interference floor in LTE networks,
\- facilitate using higher-order modulation schemes (e.g., 256QAM or above)
over larger parts of the radio network coverage,
\- save energy in BS,
\- save energy in UE capable of network-based CRS interference mitigation
which can optimize their DRX operation according to the scenarios specified in
TS 36.133, Clause 3.6.1.1.
If network-based CRS interference mitigation is enabled in a cell, then the UE
capable of network-based CRS interference mitigation can assume that:
\- CRS is transmitted over full bandwidth of the cell during active time
periods (T1), during which the UE is performing a DL or UL requiring full-
bandwidth CRS, and over at least 6 central resource blocks of the cell during
the inactive time periods (T2) when the full-bandwidth CRS is not required,
and
\- CRS is transmitted over full bandwidth of the cell during at least N1
number of non-MBSFN DL subframes immediately before the T1 time period, and
\- CRS is transmitted over full bandwidth of the cell during at least N2
number of DL subframes after the T1 time period when UE receives the downlink
physical channel during the T1 time period.
The feature concept is illustrated in Figure 1 below for a single UE
configured with DRX cycles and performing a DL operation requiring full-
bandwidth CRS during periods T1, each of which is preceded with N1 warm-up
subframes (e.g., for channel estimation or time tracking) and succeeded by N2
cool-down subframes (e.g., for channel estimation) associated with this DL
operation.

770067 **UL data compression in LTE** LTE_UDC R2 RP-172076 CATT
Summary based on the input provided by CATT in RP -180912 revised in
RP-181769.
This work item specifies Uplink Data Compression (UDC) in LTE, i.e. uplink
data can be compressed at the UE and can be decompressed at the eNB.
In this WI, DEFLATE based UDC solution is introduced.
DEFLATE based UDC solution could achieve high compression efficiency which
would save more uplink resources and reduce the transmission latency. The eNB
can configure the UE to use UDC or not. If UDC is configured for a DRB, ROHC
is not used for that DRB. One byte UDC header is introduced to indicate
whether the PDCP PDU is compressed by UDC or not, whether the compression
buffer is reset or not, and 4 validation bits of checksum to check whether the
compression and decompression buffers are synchronous. For each DRB, at most
8192 bytes compression buffer is used. If there are some errors or failure due
to buffer mismatching, the eNB can send an error notification control PDU to
the UE, the UE may reset the compression buffer.
To improve compression efficiency of the first few packets, two types of pre-
defined dictionary can be used for UDC. One is standard dictionary for SIP and
SDP signalling as defined in RFC 3485, and another is operator defined
dictionary. The eNB could configure whether or which dictionary is used for a
UDC DRB.
UDC related capabilities are also defined in UE capability. There are three
capabilities: supporting basic UDC function; supporting standard dictionary
and supporting operator defined capability. If the UE supporting operator
defined capability, it should also report the version of the dictionary and
the associated PLMN ID to assist the eNB to identify the dictionary stored by
the UE. The eNB should configure UDC according to UE capabilities.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180959.
In 8Rx WI, operating bands and CA combinations are introduced to support 8Rx
antennas, and to define the UE requirement for single carrier and CA scenario.
This enables utilization of 8 layers on a single carrier to increase the
spectrum efficiency, or enhance the coverage for the cell edge users.
8Rx WI introduce Band41, Band42 and Band43 to support 8Rx antennas considering
implementation feasibility and the market requirement. CA_41A-42A is
introduced as the band combination to support 8Rx feature, B41 and B42 can
support 8Rx at the same time.
Since UE category 18 and 19 which needs 8 layers on a single carrier in DL is
introduced from Rel-13, 8Rx is applied with release independent manner to
start from Rel-13.
The REFSENS exceptions for 2Rx and 4Rx is reused for 8Rx, when no exception is
allowed, the 8Rx REFSENS is tightened with the same value as single carrier.

## 13.8 Shortened TTI and processing time for LTE
Unique_ID Name Acronym WG WID WI Rapporteur
* * *
720091 **Shortened TTI and processing time for LTE** LTE_sTTIandPT RP-161299
Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-181008 revised to
RP-181870.
The transmission time interval (TTI) in LTE has since the first release of the
specifications been 1 ms for the transport channels associated with PDSCH,
PDCCH, PUSCH and PUCCH.
Also, the minimum timing from DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to
UL transmission has been fixed occurring three subframes later than where the
control information was sent in the DL.
These are the two main aspects that have been improved by this work item,
i.e.:
\- A reduced processing time for 1 ms TTI operation
\- A shortening of the 1 ms TTI operation combined with a reduced processing
time
### 13.8.1 Short processing time for 1 ms TTI
With a reduced processing time for 1 ms TTI, the processing time from DL
assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission is reduced from
the currently assumed n+4 timing (meaning three subframe processing time) to
n+3.
The reduction in the specifications are referred to short processing time and
applies to all frame structure types, i.e. FS1, FS2 and FS3.
The short processing time is illustrated in Figure 13.8-1 for FS1.
Figure 13.8-1: Short processing time for FS1
Also for FS2, the minimum processing time is reduced, although restrictions on
the DL/UL configuration limits the processing time reduction achievable.
For scheduling, only PDCCH based scheduling is supported, i.e. SPS is not
supported with n+3 timing for UL and DL. A fallback operation to the legacy
timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space
(CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the
user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision
between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different
UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink
collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the
two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL
subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE
behaviour.
Short processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and
applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL
transmission.
Short processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the
UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based
scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ
processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there
is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous
(n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist
of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the
same time.
Similar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE
configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a
reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to
3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the
CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy
value -1).
SRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a
trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first
available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being
configured for SRS transmission.
When the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a
proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE.
A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured
with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.
### 13.8.2 Short TTI
In addition to reducing the processing time, the WI also included the work to
reduce the TTI from 1 ms to what is referred to as either a subslot, or slot
transmission, also referred to as short TTI, sTTI. A slot transmission is
simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a
subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission
duration.
The subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies
depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in
Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot
operation is not defined for l~DataStart~=4.
Figure 13.8-2: DL and UL subslot subframe division (subslot number 0,..,5)
The slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is
only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.
The combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table
1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily
allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.
In a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per
component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI
configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH.
However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells
across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL
only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the
same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for
sTTI.
Table 13.8-2: DL/UL combinations of subslot/slot operation
FS DL UL
* * *
1 or 2 Slot Slot 1 Subslot Subslot 1 Subslot Slot
The physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table
13.8-3.
Table 13.8-3: Physical channels for slot and subslot operation
SPDCCH
* * *
PDSCH SPUCCH PUSCH
As can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels
(PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they
are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the
transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific
reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels
have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have
been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical
channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration
(including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has
either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each
subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated
in Figure 13.8-3.
A fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot
operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe
basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control.
Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe
transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE
behaviour.
Figure 13.8-3: 1 os SPDCCH illustration for subslot operation
Both CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case
of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either
over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case
of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-
based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3
symbols).
To efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a
re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data,
illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is
specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal
re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).
Figure 13.8-4: SPDCCH re-use for PDSCH
To further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two
consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in
subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS
can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and
position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS
in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.
Figure 13.8-5: UL sharing of DMRS
The specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in
the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based
DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to
share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining
orthogonality between UEs.
Figure 13.8-6: UL multiplexing of DMRS
As with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are
associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time
compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also
reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the
UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline
sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control
channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-
based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance
is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline
set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for
Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC
(depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).
Table 13.8-4: Processing timelines for slot and subslot operation with
associated maximum timing advance

The number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot
operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms
operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords
limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial
transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).
A new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for
slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI
formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and
therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.
Additional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific
aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI
reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for
the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.
Also, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar
functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is
allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA
combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.

## 13.9 Enhanced LTE Support for Aerial Vehicles

* * *
780069 **Enhanced LTE Support for Aerial Vehicles** LTE_Aerial R2 RP-172826
Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-181045 revised in
RP-181644.
Enhancements according to those identified in TR 36.777 [1] to support aerial
UE functions in LTE were introduced in this WI [2].
An aerial UE which is flying has a higher likelihood of having line-of-sight
to eNBs which terrestrial UEs normally do not have line-of-sight to. This
could result in interference and issues with mobility. This WI aimed to
address such issues. Below is a description of the enhancements introduced as
part of this WI.
TS 36.331 was extended with two reporting events H1 and H2. With these two new
events, the UE triggers a height report when the UE\'s altitude is above(H1)
or below(H2) of an eNB-configured threshold. Further, the RRM measurement
framework was extended such that the UE can be configured to trigger a
measurement report if an event condition is met for a configurable number of
cells. Events applicable for this enhancement are A3, A4 and A5. These
enhancements help the eNB to determine that a UE is flying and/or allow to
detect that the UE may be causing or experiencing interference.
To improve mobility performance, RRC signalling was added to allow the UE to
indicate to the eNB the planned flight path. More specifically, the UE can
indicate where the UE is planned to be in the future which could be taken into
account by the eNB for mobility purposes, e.g. the eNB may be able to use this
information to know in advance which cell would be suitable for the UE to be
handed over to and if a new X2 connection is beneficial to be established.
In some countries it may not be allowed to fly drones which are connected to
LTE network without authorization. In order for the network to know if the
user of the UE has a suitable subscription, a signalling from the CN to the
eNB was introduced with information about whether the subscription supports
Aerial UE function. How the eNB uses this information was left for
implementation.
To reduce possible uplink interference, UL power control enhancements were
specified allowing for UE-specific fractional pathloss compensation factor,
and the range of the UE specific P0 parameter was also extended.

[4-5].

750071 **Enhancing LTE CA Utilization** LTE_euCA R2 RP-170805 Nokia
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in RP-181596.
The LTE work item on enhancing CA utilization specifies enhancements to reduce
delays in SCell set-up, including shorter Scell configuration delay after UE
moves from idle to connected. This is addressed by IDLE mode measurements for
CA, allowing SCell state configuration by RRC, allowing separate CQI reporting
configuration, introducing a dormant Scell state for faster Scell state
transitions and allowing common Scell configuration to reduce signalling
overhead. Changes triggered by the work item are captured into TS 36-series
specifications in [3][4][5][6]
The key functionalities introduced in this work item include the following:
\- UE measurements during IDLE mode: the eNB may assign UE to do measurements
during IDLE that the network can use for when the UE enters CONNECTED mode.
\- This may include limitations on which cells are measured, how long the
measurements are done and in which cells the measurements are applicable.
\- UE indicates the availability of the measurements at connection setup, and
network decides whether to query them via RRC reporting.
\- Dormant Scell state: A new Scell state called dormant state is introduced.
While in dormant state, UE measures and reports CQI/RRM measurements but
doesn\'t decode PDCCH.
\- New MAC CE is introduced to control the dormant state transitions.
\- Direct Scell state configuration: The Scell state may be configured to be
activated or dormant via RRC.
\- This means e.g. that the SCell state may be indicated in handover or at
reconfiguration, allowing the SCell to be used
\- Short CQI reporting: After Scell activation, UE may be configured to have
an alternative (short) CQI reporting cycle to allow UEs to indicate faster
when Scell is activated.
\- After a fixed period of time, UE switches back to using the regular CQI
configuration.
\- Common Scell configuration: A common configuration applying to multiple
SCells may be provided to UE to allow signalling optimizations.
\- This is done via SCell configuration groups that allow to define common
Scell parameters specific to all Scells belonging to the group. SCell
dedicated configuration can be used to override the common parameters in the
group configuration to allow changing some parameters only to some SCells.

**Management and orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing**
The basic concepts for Management Services (defined in TS 28.533) are:
\- A management service combines elements of management service component type
A, B and C. Where
\- component type A is a group of management operations and/or notifications
agnostic of managed entities.
\- component type B is the management information represented by information
model of managed entities (e.g. NRM).
\- component type C is performance information of the managed entity and fault
information of the managed entity.
\- A management service offers management capabilities. These management
capabilities are accessed by management service consumers via standardized
service interface composed of individually specified management service
components.
\- The management services can be consumed by another entity, which may in
turn produce (expose) the service to other entities.
\- Interactions between management service producer and management service
consumer use following paradigms:
\- \"Request-response\": A management service producer is requested by a
management service consumer to invoke an operation, which either performs an
action or provides information or both. The management service producer
provides response based on the request by management service consumer.
\- \"Subscribe-notify\": A management service consumer requests a management
service producer to establish a subscription to receive network events via
notifications, under the filter constraint specified in this operation.
The generic management services concept, defined in TS 28.530, follows the
management service concepts as defined in TS 28.533. The specification
includes the following information:
\- Generic provisioning management service (operations and notifications),
\- Generic fault supervision management service (operations and
notifications).
\- Generic performance assurance management service (operations and
notifications),
\- RESTful HTTP-based solution set of provisioning.
\- RESTful HTTP-based solution set of fault supervision.
**Provisioning of 5G networks and network slicing**
The following functionalities related to provisioning are defined in TS
28.531, TS 28.532 and TS 28.541:
\- Provisioning procedures for networks and network slicing.
\- Protocol-independent information model of network slice and network slice
subnet.
\- Management services for provisioning of networks and network slicing.
\- RESTful HTTP-based solution set of provisioning.
\- The stage 3 NRM solution sets (XML, JSON, YANG) for network slicing.
**Fault Supervision for 5G networks and network slicing**
Fault Supervision is one of the fundamental functions for the management of a
5G network and its communication services. This work item specifies the
following aspects of fault supervision for 5G networks and network slicing:
1) Fault Supervision (FS); Stage 1, which includes:
\- The definitions of fault supervision related management services
\- The use cases and requirements for fault supervision of 5G networks and
network slicing.
2) Fault Supervision (FS); Stage 2 and stage 3, which includes:
\- The definition of interfaces of the fault supervision related management
services; (Stage 2)
\- The definition of notifications; (Stage 2)
\- The definition of alarm related information models (e.g. alarmInformation,
alarmList, etc.); (Stage 2)
\- The definition of solution set(s) (e.g. RESTful HTTP-based solution set for
Fault Supervision); (Stage 3)
The stage 1 part is documented in TS 28.545 [13] and the stage 2 and stage 3
parts are documented in clause 6 and clause 9 of TS 28.532 [10].
**Performance assurance for 5G networks including network slicing**
The performance assurance of 5G networks and network slicing relies on a set
of management services with the relevant management data (e.g. performance
measurements and KPIs).
The management services in terms of performance assurance include the
measurement job control service, performance data file reporting service,
performance data streaming service, and management data analytics service
(MDAS). The performance data includes performance measurements and KPIs for
NFs, NSSIs and NSIs. The performance data of NSSI are generated based on the
aggregation and calculation of performance data of NFs, and the performance
data of NSIs are produced based on the aggregation and calculation of
performance of data of NSSIs and NFs.
The performance assurance related management services are defined in TS 28.550
[14].
The performance measurements and KPIs for 5G networks are defined in TS 28.552
[15] and TS 28.554 [16] respectively.
**Network Resource Model (NRM) for 5G networks and network slicing**
To support management and orchestration of 5G network and network slicing,
several Network Resource Model (NRM) related specifications were added or
enhanced including TS 28.540 [17], TS 28.541 [18], TS 28.622 [19], TS 28.623
[20], TS 28.626 [21] and TS 28.658 [22]. The specifications include the
following information:
\- 5G Network Resource Model use cases and requirements
\- Generic NRM information service and solution set
\- 5G RAN NRM information service and solution set
\- 5G Core NRM information service and solution set
\- Network Slice NRM information service and solution set
**5G Trace management**
The work item introduced 5G system (including both NG-RAN and 5GC) Trace in
following aspects:
\- 5G Trace use case and requirements in TS 32.421 [23].
\- 5G Trace session activation and deactivation mechanism (including both
management based and signalling based Trace activation and deactivation) in TS
32.422 [24].
\- 5G Trace control and configuration parameter definitions in TS 32.422 [24].
\- 5G Trace record data definitions in TS 32.423 [25].
The objective of this WI is to enhance the interactions between 3GPP
management system and supporting external management systems (e.g., ETSI NFV
MANO) to support the management of 5GC and NG-RAN where a gNB is split into a
CU (Centralized Unit) that can be implemented as VNF, and a DU (Distributed
Unit) that can be implemented as PNF, with the F1 interface between CU and DU.

###### ### Annex B: Process to get further information
# B.1 General
Since the present document is limited to provide an overview of each Feature,
this chapter explains how to get additional information, in particular how to
retrieve all the Specifications (TSs) and Reports (TRs) as well as all the CRs
which relate to a given Work Item.
The Unique Identifier (UID) is the key to get additional information on a
given Work Item. It can be found in the table located just below the clause\'s
header. The table has the following format:
Table B-1: table format
* * *
Unique Identifier (UID) Name Acronym Outline Level (1=Feature, 2=Building
Block, 3=Work Task) Responsible Working Group Work Item Description
* * *
For readability reasons, the table headers are omitted in the continuation of
the present document.
For instance, for the \"Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment\",
the table has to be understood as:
Table B-2: Example of table at the introduction of each Feature
Unique Identifier (UID) Name Acronym Outline Level Responsible Working Group
Work Item Description
* * *
700029 **Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment** MCImp-MCPTTR 2
S1 SP-150821
Thus, the UID for this Work Item is 700029.
Two methods are now possible to retrieve more information on a given feature:
the \"Step by step method\" and the \"Direct method\". The \"direct method\"
is faster but implies to know the hierarchical structure of the Work Items.
The \"step by step method\" is slower but is easier to use, in particular when
the hierarchical structure is unknown.
For instance, for retrieving all the CRs that relate to \"Enhancements for
Mission Critical Push To Talk\", the search has to be done on UID 740022 but
also potentially on its children Work Items (UID 720056, 740023 and 740024).
Table B-3: Example of a hierarchical structure and its consequences on the
search procedure
740022 **Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk** MCImp-eMCPTT
SP-160490
* * *
720056 Stage 2 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk MCImp-eMCPTT
S6 SP-160490 740023 Stage 3 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk
MCImp-eMCPTT-CT CT CP-160824 740024 CT1 aspects of Enhancements for Mission
Critical Push To Talk MCImp-eMCPTT-CT C1 CP-160824
These two methods are described in the following clauses.
# B.2 Direct method
The links below lead to the pages containing respectively all the
Specifications and all the Change Requests (CRs) linked to a given Feature:
https://portal.3gpp.org/Specifications.aspx?q=1&WiUid=[UID]
https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=[UID]
where \"[UID]\" has to be preplaced by the UID value.
Using the example provided in the table 4.1-3, the specification linked to
\"Stage 2 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk\" can be found in:
https://portal.3gpp.org/Specifications.aspx?q=1&WiUid=720056
And all the related Change Requests are listed in:
https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=720056
# B.3 Step by step method
This method is to be used when the hierarchical structure is not known or when
the \"direct method\" above does not show the expected results.
In this case, the 3GPP Ultimate web site has to be used:
https://portal.3gpp.org
As a preliminary step, it is essential that the \"Customized Selection\" is
set to \"All TSGs\" (otherwise, a filter would be applied).
{width="4.563888888888889in" height="2.957638888888889in"}
Figure B.3-1: Selecting \"All TSGs\" in \"Customized Selection\" as to remove
any potential filter on the Search
Then select the \"Work Plan\" tab (upper red arrow in the figure below).
{width="5.242361111111111in" height="2.9451388888888888in"}
Figure B.3-2: Using the 3GU Portal to retrieve more information on a given
Feature
Then the search might be performed by either typing the Acronym (as shown by
the left red arrow on the figure above, using the example \"MCPTT\"), or by
the name or UID (right box) then by clicking on the \"Search\" button. Watch
the \"Granularity (Level)\" field, which is a filter to return only the Items
which level is specified here.
In the results, the icon depicting some binoculars has to be hit (lower right
red arrow on the figure above).
This will lead to the page shown in the figure below:
{width="3.6in" height="3.1881944444444446in"}
Figure B.3-3: Window resulting from a \"Search\"
On this window, the \"Related\" tab has to be clicked, as pointed by the red
arrow in the figure above. This will lead to the window depicted in the figure
below.
{width="3.6180555555555554in" height="3.2in"}
Figure B.3-4: \"Related\" tab in a Work Item search, with links to all related
Specifications and Change Requests
The two links pointed by the red arrows in the figure above lead to the pages
containing respectively all the Specifications and all the Change Requests
(CRs) linked to this Feature.
