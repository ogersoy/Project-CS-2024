# 4 Introduction
Mission critical users currently employ a wide range of LMR mission critical
Push To Talk services, and associated data capabilities where available.
The present document describes the architecture to support the interworking
between the MC system and the LMR system to satisfy interworking requirements
specified in 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] and 3GPP TS 22.282 [4]. Other LMR technologies
may interwork as long as they conform to the present document.
The IWF, along with its LMR system, will appear as a peer interconnected MC
system. This is meant as an approach for defining interactions on the IWF
interface but is not intended to specify the functionality of the IWF nor
meant to mandate a deployment model.
# 5 Assumptions and architectural requirements
## 5.1 Key management
Interworking requirements for key management for encrypted interworking
include:
a) a mechanism to securely (i.e. authenticity, integrity, confidentiality)
share an LMR E2EE traffic key for a private call sessions between a party in
an MCPTT system and a party in the LMR system;
b) a mechanism to securely convey to group members, the LMR E2EE key or set of
LMR E2EE keys associated with an MC service group or set of MC service groups,
to be used for encryption of interworking group calls spanning the multiple
systems;
c) a mechanism to securely share with temporary group members in MC systems,
the LMR E2EE key(s) associated with a temporary MC service group to be used in
interworking group calls spanning the multiple systems;
d) key management solutions shall not preclude the ability of an IWF to allow
one or more individual Mission Critical Organizations from having sole control
over and sole access to LMR E2EE traffic keys used for the entity\'s media
traffic and users\' key encryption keys (UKEKs or KEKs);
e) key management solutions shall support the ability of the IWF to
decrypt/reencrypt the media traffic for zero or more groups; and,
f) for deployments where Mission Critical Organizations wish to use LMR E2EE
mechanisms when interworking with LMR users:
i) a mechanism to securely provision an MC service client with the user\'s
UKEK or KEK; and,
ii) a mechanism to convey LMR OTAR or OTAK message contents.
## 5.2 Packet format
Each LMR technology defines its own packet format for voice media
transmission. For interworking sessions, there might be cases where LMR
formatted media is required to be transferred between the IWF and LMR aware
MCPTT clients. An example of such a case is where E2EE is used and thus the
IWF is not able to decrypt the media. In such cases, media that is sent over
the IWF-1 interface needs to be routed within MCPTT systems to/from LMR aware
MCPTT clients using methods described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Requirements for media transmission across the IWF-1 interface include:
a) media transmission to carry the LMR formatted media between the IWF and LMR
aware MCPTT clients; and
b) the MCPTT system, along with the IWF, may choose to encrypt the LMR
formatted media using 3GPP mechanisms.
NOTE: The contents of the LMR formatted media is out of scope of the present
document.

# 7 Functional model
## 7.1 General
## 7.2 Functional model description
Figure 7.2‑1 shows the functional model for the application plane for
interworking between MC systems and LMR systems. Functional entities and
interfaces depicted on the right-hand side of the IWF‑x interfaces are defined
in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [6].
Figure 7.2-1: Functional model for application plane for interworking
## 7.3 Functional entities description
### 7.3.1 IWF
The IWF supports most of the functionality of peer MCPTT and MCData systems,
with some differences, as specified in the present document. The IWF supports
any necessary protocol translation and identity mapping between the MC systems
and the IWF. The internal function of the IWF is out of scope of the present
document.
## 7.4 Reference points
### 7.4.1 Reference point IWF‑1 (between the IWF and the MCPTT server)
The IWF‑1 reference point, which exists between the IWF and the MCPTT server,
provides peer to peer interconnection between an LMR system and the MCPTT
system. IWF‑1 supports a subset of MCPTT‑3 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7],
with some differences, as specified in the present document. The IWF‑1
interface is supported by the same signalling plane protocol(s) as defined for
MCPTT‑3 except as specified in the present document.
### 7.4.2 Reference point IWF‑2 (between the IWF and the MCData server)
The IWF‑2 reference point, which exists between the IWF and the MCData server,
provides SDS interconnection between an LMR system and the MCData system.
IWF‑2 supports a subset of the functionality of MCData‑SDS‑1 and MCData‑SDS‑2,
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [6] with some differences, as specified in the
present document. The IWF‑2 interface is supported by the same signalling
plane protocol(s) as defined for MCData‑3 except as specified in the present
document.
### 7.4.3 Reference point IWF‑3 (between the IWF and the group management
server)
The IWF‑3 reference point, which exists between the IWF and the group
management server, provides group management interconnection between an LMR
system and the MC service system. IWF‑3 is based upon CSC‑16, as defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with some differences, as specified in the present
document.
# 8 Identities
## 8.1 Identity mapping
The IWF provides centralised support for interworking between an MCPTT or
MCData system and an LMR system.
In MCPTT systems, the identity of an LMR user is provided as an MCPTT ID, and
the identity of an LMR group is provided as an MCPTT group ID, which can be
used by the IWF to derive the corresponding identities used in an LMR system.
Similarly, in MCData systems, the identity of an LMR user is provided as an
MCData ID, and the identity of an LMR group is provided as an MCData group ID,
which can be used by the IWF to derive the corresponding identities used in an
LMR system.
Identities provided on IWF-x reference points are described in clause 8 of
3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
The IWF can perform the identity mapping between an MCPTT or MCData system and
an LMR system during exchange of signalling and media messages.
# 9 Application of functional model to deployments

### 10.1.2 Affiliation procedures
#### 10.1.2.1 General
When an interworking group is defined in the MCPTT system, the LMR system (via
the IWF) informs the MCPTT system of group affiliations in one of the
following ways:
\- Every group affiliation in the LMR system results in an affiliation sent to
the MCPTT system, which contains the identity (with appropriate translation by
the IWF) of the affiliating group member; or
\- A group affiliation is sent on behalf of the LMR system (via the IWF) to
the MCPTT system when the first group member affiliates to the designated
group in the LMR system, and a group de-affiliation is sent on behalf of the
LMR system (via the IWF) to the MCPTT system when the last group member de-
affiliates, and no other group affiliation signalling is sent.
The first and second options may be used at the same time, such that some
group members may explicitly affiliate while the IWF may affiliate on behalf
of other group members.
In the second option, when the IWF is configured to affiliate on behalf of
some group members in the LMR system then:
a) the group list in the MCPTT system contains the IWF\'s MCPTT ID. This ID is
recognized (through configuration) as having the ability to affiliate on
behalf of the users associated with this IWF;
b) the IWF affiliates with its MCPTT ID to the group defined in the MCPTT
system;
c) the MCPTT system recognizes the affiliation as being from an IWF on behalf
of the LMR users;
d) when the IWF has affiliated to the group, the MCPTT system:
i) considers any LMR user associated with the IWF to be affiliated to the
group on which the IWF has affiliated. The IWF\'s users need not be listed
ahead of time in the group list for this group in the MCPTT system;
ii) allows requests such as call setup or floor request, from MCPTT IDs
representing LMR users associated with the IWF for actions on the group to
which the IWF has affiliated;
iii) does not carry out an additional affiliation on behalf of LMR users when
those users make call requests, and therefore does not send additional
messages to those users (e.g. release messages to both the IWF affiliated
identity and the LMR user identity performing the action), via the IWF, during
call processing;
iv) recognizes which LMR users are associated with the IWF because their MCPTT
IDs belong to the same system as the IWF; and,
v) uses special rules for the IWF for limits such as \"Limitation of number of
affiliations per user (N2)\".
e) requests from LMR users to the MCPTT system are identified with their
individual MCPTT IDs (as translated by the IWF):
i) a user in the LMR system can affiliate on its own (via the IWF) as long as
the user is a group member (i.e. in the group list), even if the IWF has
affiliated to the group.
f) the IWF may make requests on behalf of LMR users using the IWF MCPTT ID
like a normal group member;
g) the IWF is not allowed to affiliate to a group that is not configured with
the IWF\'s MCPTT ID in the group member list; and,
h) if the IWF has not affiliated to an MCPTT group, then call requests to this
group from LMR users on the system associated with the IWF, can only be
accepted if the LMR user\'s MCPTT ID is in the group list, and has already
affiliated.
#### 10.1.2.2 Group affiliation to a group defined in the MC system
The LMR system may affiliate its group members to an interworking group
defined in the MC system via the IWF.
For group regroup, the affiliated group members are automatically affiliated
to the temporary group.
The signalling procedure of interworking group affiliation is described in
figure 10.1.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group to be affiliated to is defined in the MC system.
2\. The IWF is connected to and is authorized to interwork with the MC system.
3\. The interworking group information is available at the IWF.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MC system
and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.1.2.2-1: Group affiliation to a group defined in the MC system
1\. The IWF sends an IWF group affiliation request to the MC service server on
behalf of the LMR system.
2a. The MC service server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If the
group policy is not locally cached on the MC service server then the MC
service server requests the group policy from the group management server.
2b. The MC service server receives the group policy from the group management
server.
3\. Based on the group policy and user subscription, the MC service server
affiliates the IWF to the group. If a separate affiliation for each LMR user
is expected, the status of the affiliating user is stored by the MC service
server as the status associated with an MC service ID provided by the IWF that
corresponds to the identity of that LMR user. If a separate affiliation for
each LMR user is not expected, an affiliation status for the group using the
MC service ID provided by the IWF is stored.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the group affiliation status update message to the
group management server, the group management server stores and updates the
group affiliation status.
5\. The MC service server returns an IWF group affiliation response to the
IWF.
NOTE 2: How the LMR user(s) affiliates to a group is outside the scope of the
present document.
#### 10.1.2.3 Group de-affiliation from a group defined in the MC system
The signalling procedure of interworking group de-affiliation from a group
defined in the MC system is described in figure 10.1.2.3-1.
The LMR system manages the individual de-affiliation requests from the LMR
users. The LMR system can de-affiliate its group members from the interworking
group via the IWF.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
2\. The affiliation procedure described in subclause 10.1.2.2 was previously
performed.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.1.2.3-1: Group de-affiliation from group defined in the MC system
1\. The IWF sends an IWF group de-affiliation request to the MC service server
on behalf of the LMR system.
2\. If a separate de-affiliation from each LMR user is expected and based on
the group policy and user subscription, the MC service server may de-affiliate
the LMR group member from the group. Further, the MC service server may store
the affiliation status of the user(s) for the requested MC service group(s).
If a separate de-affiliation from each LMR user is not expected, the de-
affiliation signalling de-affiliates the IWF and therefore the entire LMR
system from the group.
3\. The MC service server sends the group de-affiliation status update message
to the group management server, the group management server stores and updates
the group affiliation status.
4\. The MC service server returns an IWF group de-affiliation response to the
IWF.
NOTE 2: How the LMR user(s) de-affiliate from a group is outside the scope of
the present document.
#### 10.1.2.4 Group affiliation to group defined in the LMR system
The MC service system may affiliate its group members to an interworking group
defined in the LMR system via the IWF.
The signalling procedure of group affiliation via the IWF is described in
figure 10.1.2.4‑1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group to be affiliated to is defined in the LMR system.
2\. The IWF is connected to and is authorized to work with the MC system.
3\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 1: For all signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.1.2.4-1: Group affiliation to group defined in the LMR system
> 1\. The MC service client sends a MC service group affiliation request,
> including the MC service group ID(s), to the MC service server.
2\. The MC service server checks if the MC service group ID(s) is an
interworking group defined in the LMR system.
3\. The MC service server sends an IWF group affiliation request to the IWF.
NOTE 2: The IWF can forward the request to the LMR system that could check
whether the MC service client is authorized to affiliate to this interworking
group.
NOTE 3: The IWF can reject the affiliation if the MC service group ID is
either unknown to the IWF or not mapped to an LMR group identity in the IWF
configuration.
4\. The IWF returns an IWF group affiliation response to the MC service
server, informing the successful affiliation to the LMR group.
5\. The MC service server stores the group affiliation status of the MC
service client for the requested interworking group.
6\. The MC service server sends an MC service group affiliation response to
the MC service client.
NOTE 4: How the affiliation is conducted on the LMR system is outside the
scope of the present document.
#### 10.1.2.5 Group de-affiliation from a group defined in the LMR system
The signalling procedure of interworking group de-affiliation from a group
defined in the LMR system is described in figure 10.1.2.5-1.
The MC system manages the individual de-affiliation requests from the MC
service users. The MC service system may de-affiliate its group members from
the interworking group via the IWF.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
service system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
2\. The affiliation procedure described in subclause 10.1.2.4 was previously
performed.
NOTE: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.1.2.5-1: Group de-affiliation from a group defined in the LMR system
1\. The MC service client of the MC service user sends an MC service group de-
affiliation request to the MC service server. The MC service client shall
provide the initiating MC service ID and the MC service group ID(s) being de-
affiliated from.
2\. Based on the user subscription and stored group policy, the MC service
server checks if the user of the MC service client is affiliated to the
requested MC service group(s). The MC service server checks if the MC service
group(s) is an interworking group.
3a. If the MC service group(s) is an interworking group, the MC service server
sends an IWF group de-affiliation request to the IWF.
3b. The IWF returns an IWF group de-affiliation response to the MC service
server.
4\. If the user of the MC service client is authorized to de-affiliate from
the requested MC service group(s), the MC service server removes the
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s).
5\. The MC service server returns an MC service group de-affiliation response
to the MC service client.

### 10.2.2 Group regrouping
#### 10.2.2.1 General
The procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] are followed, but with changes required
for interworking. The IWF will behave on the interface as if it is a peer MC
service server with a peer group management client and peer group management
server.
Exceptions to the 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] procedures are detailed in the subclauses
below.
#### 10.2.2.2 MC system initiates the group regroup
The MC system can initiate a group regroup that includes groups defined at the
IWF. The IWF is informed and may reject the regroup if conditions do not allow
it to support the regroup. This is described in figure 10.2.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the
groups to be regrouped.
2\. At least one MC service group has been defined in the MC system.
3\. At least one MC service group has been defined in the IWF.
Figure 10.2.2.2-1: Group regrouping to an IWF
1\. The group management client of the MC service user (e.g. dispatcher)
requests group regroup operation to the group management server (which is the
group management server of one of the MC service groups to be regrouped). The
identities of the groups being combined shall be included in this message. The
group management client may indicate the security level required for the
temporary group. The group management client may indicate the priority level
required for the temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorised MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server checks whether the group is a temporary group. If the group
is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise
the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server forwards the IWF group regroup request to the
IWF with the information about the IWF\'s groups.
4\. The IWF provides an IWF group regroup response. Due to security aspects
concerning sharing information among different MC systems, the IWF does not
share the users\' information of the groups under its management to the group
management server. The IWF may reject the IWF group regroup response. (e.g. if
one of its constituent groups is in the emergency state or is already in a
regroup, if the IWF does not support temporary groups or the IWF does not
support group regrouping)
5\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, off-network
information, and the MC service IDs of the groups being combined, the priority
level of the temporary group, and the security level of the temporary group.
If the authorised MC service user does not specify the security level and the
priority level, the group management server shall set the lower security level
and the higher priority of the constituent groups.
6\. The group management server notifies the IWF about its group regroup
operation.
NOTE: How the IWF uses the MC service group ID that identifies the temporary
group is outside the scope of the present document.
7\. The IWF acknowledges the group management server.
8\. The group management server notifies the MC service server of the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups.
9\. The MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server.
10\. The group management server notifies the MC service group members of the
constituent MC service groups of the group management server, possibly with an
indication of lower security level.
11\. The group management server provides a group regroup response to the
group management client of the authorised MC service user (e.g. dispatcher).
#### 10.2.2.3 IWF initiates the group regroup
The procedure in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] is followed, except for steps 1 and 2. The
IWF will behave on the interface as if it is a peer MC service server with a
peer group management server. This is described in figure 10.2.2.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. At least one MC service group has been defined in the MC system.
2\. At least one MC service group has been defined in the IWF.
Figure 10.2.2.3-1: Group regrouping from an IWF
1\. The IWF sends an IWF group regroup request to the group management server.
2\. The group management server checks whether the group can be included in a
temporary group.
3\. The group management server provides an IWF group regroup response.
NOTE: Due to security aspects concerning sharing information among different
systems, the group management server does not share the users\' information of
the groups under its management to the IWF.
4\. The IWF notifies the group management server regarding the temporary group
creation with information of the constituent groups.
5\. The group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups.
6\. The MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server. The MC service server may reject the IWF group regroup,
e.g. if one of its constituent groups is already in a regroup.
7\. The group management server acknowledges the notification from the IWF.
8\. The group management server notifies the MC service group members of the
constituent MC service groups of the group management server, possibly with an
indication of a lower security level.
#### 10.2.2.4 Ownership of the group regroup
The group management server that performs the group regroup operation owns the
temporary group created by the regroup, as implied in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
#### 10.2.2.5 Simultaneous group regroup requests from each side of the IWF-1
interface
To prevent routing issues and complexity that could result from regrouping the
same users from both sides of the interface, the following rules can be
applied:
\- If group regrouping signalling using temporary groups is used on the MC
system, the IWF must prevent the regroup signalling from propagating to the
LMR system if the LMR system does not support regrouping;
\- the IWF must handle the translation between temporary group identities on
the MC system and the original interworking group identities used on the LMR
system; and
\- the regrouping rules in subclause 10.2.4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] also
apply.
#### 10.2.2.6 Resolution of vocoder and encryption mode for the group regroup
If one of the LMR groups to be included in a group regroup requires the use of
LMR E2EE the preferred voice codecs for an MCPTT temporary group should be LMR
codecs. If any of the mission critical users to be included in this MCPTT
temporary group do not support LMR E2EE or the preferred LMR codecs, voice
calls using LMR E2EE will fail for those users.
NOTE 1: How the MC system determines that the temporary group needs to support
LMR E2EE is outside the scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: How the MC system determines that the temporary group needs to support
an LMR codec is outside the scope of the present document.
### 10.2.3 Group configuration for interworking
#### 10.2.3.1 Overview
The procedures in the following subclauses describe the process for sharing
group configuration from an MC system to an IWF where the IWF needs to make
use of the MC service group and from an IWF to an MC system where the MC
system\'s clients need to make use of the group. The procedures in this
subclause are based upon subclause 10.2.7 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
#### 10.2.3.2 MC system provides group configuration to the IWF
Figure 10.2.3.2-1 below illustrates the case where the MC system provides the

## 10.3 Group call
### 10.3.1 General
The following subclauses define information flows and signaling procedures for
group calls and broadcast group calls.
Where the group is defined in the MCPTT system and where the IWF has
affiliated to an MCPTT group with a single affiliation on behalf of all LMR
group members, only a single IWF group call request / IWF group call release
request message is sent to the IWF at the commencement / release of a group
call. Where the group is defined in the MCPTT system and where the IWF has
passed through individual affiliations for each group member in the LMR
system, the MCPTT system shall send individual IWF group call request / IWF
group call release request messages to the IWF for all affiliated group
members in the LMR system in accordance with primary and partner MCPTT system
behaviour. In both cases, the distribution of the messages to group members in
the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.
Where the group is defined in the LMR system, the IWF shall send individual
IWF group call request / IWF group call release request messages to the IWF
for all affiliated MCPTT group members in accordance with primary and partner
MCPTT system behaviour.
### 10.3.2 Information flows for group call over interworking group

between the MCPTT system and the LMR system on an interworking group defined
in the LMR system. The subclause 10.3.3.7 describes the late entry procedures
and subclause 10.3.3.8 describes the group call release procedures. Group
calls can use MC media encryption between the IWF and the MCPTT clients as
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [8]. A call that uses an LMR vocoder may use LMR
E2EE if the calling and called parties have previously been provisioned with
the appropriate LMR E2EE keys.
NOTE: MC media encryption is independent of LMR E2EE techniques. MC media
encryption can be applied in addition to LMR E2EE.
#### 10.3.3.2 Group call setup initiated by MCPTT user on an interworking
group defined in MCPTT system
In this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating a group call on an interworking
group defined in the MCPTT system. The signalling procedure is described in
figure 10.3.3.2-1.
This subclause is based upon subclause for pre-arranged group call setup in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group information is known at the MCPTT server and the
IWF by configuration or group creation. The interworking group has been
defined in the MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are registered and their respective
users are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service.
3\. The users in this interworking group have been affiliated to the group.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.3.3.2-1: Group call setup initiated by MCPTT user on an interworking
group defined in MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a group call for the selected
interworking group identified by MCPTT group ID.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request to the MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to
initiate a group call on the selected interworking group.
4\. MCPTT server proceeds group call setup procedures towards the affiliated
MCPTT system users as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
5\. MCPTT server sends IWF group call request(s) towards the IWF. If the IWF
has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR users, only one IWF
group call request message is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT server has
received individual affiliations from the group\'s LMR users, an individual
IWF group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each affiliated LMR user.
NOTE 2: How the LMR users are called is outside the scope of the present
document.
NOTE 3: Steps 4 and 5 can occur in any order.
6\. The IWF returns IWF group call response(s) to the MCPTT server. If E2EE is
specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR users shall use the same codec. If
E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and the LMR users can use different
codecs and transcoding is needed at the IWF.
7\. The MCPTT server sends group call response to the MCPTT client 1 about
successful call establishment.
8\. The group call on the interworking group has successfully established
media plane for communication and any user can transmit media. The MCPTT
system where the interworking group is defined is the controlling system of
the group call and manages the floor control.
#### 10.3.3.3 Group call setup initiated by LMR user on an interworking group
defined in MCPTT system.
In this procedure, an LMR user is initiating a group call on an interworking
group defined in the MCPTT system. The signalling procedure is described in
figure 10.3.3.3-1.

defined in MCPTT system
1\. The IWF sends an IWF group call request to the MCPTT server for call
establishment. If floor control is requested by the calling LMR user, an
indication of implicit floor request is included.
2\. MCPTT server calls the affiliated users from MCPTT system as described in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7]. If E2EE is specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR
users shall use the same codec. If E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and
the LMR users can use different codecs and transcoding is needed at the IWF.
3\. If the group has other affiliated LMR users than the calling party and the
MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from those LMR users, an
individual IWF group call request is sent to the IWF for each affiliated LMR
user.
NOTE 2: Steps 2 and 3 can occur in any order.
NOTE 3: How the LMR users from the LMR system are being called is outside the
scope of the present document.
4\. The IWF returns IWF group call response(s) to the MCPTT server.
5\. The MCPTT server confirms the successful establishment of the group call
by sending an IWF Group call response to the IWF.
NOTE 4: How the group call response is returned to the initiating LMR user is
outside the scope of the present document.

#### 10.3.3.6 Encrypted group call with transcoding
Pre-conditions:
1\. An MCPTT session is established between an MCPTT client, the interworked
LMR system (represented by the IWF), and the MCPTT server.
2\. There is an ongoing media transmission.
3\. An SDP negotiation has occurred between the IWF and MCPTT Server to
establish both the vocoder and the security parameters for the call.
4\. The IWF is configured to perform transcoding of voice media and has
obtained key material from the MCPTT system using the procedures in 3GPP TS
33.180 [8].
Figure 10.3.3.6-1: Encrypted group call with transcoding
1\. The MCPTT client has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.
2\. The MCPTT client encodes audio using a codec defined for the MCPTT group,
encrypts the encoded voice using procedures in 3GPP TS 33.180 [8], and
forwards the encrypted voice media to the MCPTT server.
3\. The MCPTT server forwards the encrypted voice media to other participants
in the group call including the IWF.
4\. The IWF decrypts the voice media from the MCPTT client using the
procedures in 3GPP TS 33.180 [8]. The IWF transcodes the voice to a LMR codec.
If needed, the IWF re-encrypts the transcoded voice media using LMR security
procedures (these are out-of-scope of this specification), and forwards the
voice media to the LMR system.
NOTE: Where transcoding occurs is outside the scope of this specification. In
this procedure, it is assumed to take place internal to the IWF.
5\. Sometime later the floor becomes idle.
6\. The LMR system (represented by the IWF in figure 10.3.3.6‑1) requests and
is granted the floor.
7\. The IWF has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.
8\. The IWF receives voice media from the LMR system. If the voice media is
encrypted, the IWF decrypts the voice media using LMR security procedures
(these are out-of-scope of this specification). The IWF transcodes the voice
to the group\'s MCPTT codec. The IWF re-encrypts the transcoded voice using
the procedures in 3GPP TS 33.180 [8].
9\. The IWF forwards the voice media to the MCPTT server.
10\. The MCPTT server forwards the voice media to other participants in the
group call.
#### 10.3.3.7 Late Entry
##### 10.3.3.7.1 General
Late Entry for an ongoing interworking group call is triggered by a successful
group affiliation procedure from the participating system.
##### 10.3.3.7.2 Group call late entry on an interworking group defined in the

### 10.3.4 Group broadcast
#### 10.3.4.1 General
A broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating user
expects no response from the receiving users so that when the transmission is
complete, so is the call. The initiating user can be an MCPTT user or can be
an LMR user.
The group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not a set of users.
The user that originates the group-broadcast group call is the only one
transmitting media during this call.
The group-broadcast group is defined with a hierarchy. For example, groups A
and B may be subordinate to a group-broadcast group. All subordinate groups
belonging to a group-broadcast group are defined either in the MCPTT system or
the LMR system.
#### 10.3.4.2 Group-broadcast group call procedure with an interworking group
where the group-broadcast group is defined in the MCPTT system
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.5.2.1 describes the procedure for a
group-broadcast group call within a single MCPTT system. The present procedure
describes a group-broadcast group call that includes the IWF.
In this procedure, the MCPTT server is initiating the broadcast and is the
owner of the group-broadcast group.
The procedure shows the case where the call is initiated by a MCPTT user.
However, if the override feature is enabled, then the call originator may be
overridden.
Figure 10.3.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
establishment (the group-broadcast group is defined in the MCPTT system).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 2 and the IWF are members is a
subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast
group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).
2\. The group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT group call that is not
an MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The call initiator of the group-broadcast group is a member of another
group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a subordinate group of the group-
broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group X as a
subordinate group).
4\. The group-broadcast group and its subordinate groups are defined in the
same group management server and served by the same MCPTT server.
Figure 10.3.4.2-1: Group-broadcast group call involving IWF (group-broadcast
group is defined in the MCPTT system)
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. The MCPTT server needs to resolve the group-broadcast group ID into its
subordinate groups in order to contact the affiliated MCPTT users of those
subordinate groups.
4\. The MCPTT server then needs to consider any on-going group calls on those
subordinate groups because this may affect the behaviour for what happens
next. In this case a group call exists on a subordinate group. Thus, the MCPTT
users involved in the group call on this subordinate group.
5\. The MCPTT server performs group call release procedures of groups defined
in the MCPTT system as described in subclause 10.3.3.8.2.
6\. A group-broadcast group call request is sent to MCPTT client 2 and an IWF
group-broadcast group call request to the IWF. If the IWF has affiliated to
this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR users, only one IWF group-broadcast
group call request is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT server has received
individual affiliations from the group\'s LMR users, an individual IWF group-
broadcast group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each affiliated LMR
user.
NOTE 1: How the group-broadcast group call request(s) is(are) forwarded to the
LMR system is out of scope of the present document.
7\. MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming group-broadcast group call.
NOTE 2: How LMR user(s) is(are) notified of the incoming group-broadcast group
call is outside the scope of the present document.
8\. MCPTT client 2 and the IWF respond to the IWF group-broadcast group call
request by sending an IWF group-broadcast group call response. If the IWF has
affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR users, only one IWF
group-broadcast group call response is sent to the MCPTT server. If the MCPTT
server has received individual affiliations from the group\'s LMR users, an
individual IWF group-broadcast group call response is sent (to the MCPTT
server) for each affiliated LMR user.
9\. The MCPTT server responds to MCPTT client 1 (the call initiator) that the
group-broadcast group call has been established by sending a group-broadcast
group call response.
10\. The MCPTT client 1 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting
using the group-broadcast group call resources.
Once the user of MCPTT cleint 1 completes transmitting, the group-broadcast
group call is released.
#### 10.3.4.3 Group-broadcast group call procedure with an interworking group
where the group-broadcast group is defined in the LMR system
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.5.2.1 describes the procedure for a
group-broadcast group call within a single MCPTT system. The present procedure
describes a group-broadcast group call that includes the IWF.
In this procedure, the IWF is the owner of the group-broadcast group and is
initiating the group-broadcast group call.
The procedure only shows the case where the call is initiated by a MCPTT user.
However, if the override feature is enabled, then the call originator may be
overridden.
Figure 10.3.4.3-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
establishment (the group-broadcast group is defined in the LMR system).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 2 is a member is a subordinate
group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was
defined with group A as a subordinate group).
2\. The group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT group call that is not
an MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The call initiator, MCPTT client 1, of the group-broadcast group is a
member of another group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a subordinate
group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was
defined with group X as a subordinate group).
4\. The group-broadcast group and its subordinate groups are defined in the
IWF.
Figure 10.3.4.3-1: Group-broadcast group call involving IWF (group-broadcast
group defined in the LMR system)
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. As the group-broadcast group is defined in the LMR system the MCPTT server
sends an IWF group-broadcast group call setup request to the IWF.
4\. The IWF performs group call release procedures of groups defined in the
LMR system as described in subclause 10.3.3.8.3.
5\. The IWF issues a group-broadcast group call setup request to establish the
group-broadcast call.
6\. The MCPTT user of MCPTT client 2 is notified.
NOTE: How LMR user(s) is(are) notified of the incoming group-broadcast group
call is outside the scope of the present document.
7\. Optionally, MCPTT client 2 respond with a group-broadcast group call
response to the MCPTT server and then to the IWF.
8\. Optionally, the MCPTT server responds to MCPTT client 1 (the call
initiator) that the group-broadcast group call has been established by sending
a group-broadcast group call response.
9\. The MCPTT client 1 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting
using the group-broadcast group call resources.
Once the user of MCPTT client 1 completes transmitting, the group-broadcast
group call is released.
#### 10.3.4.4 Group-broadcast group call release with an interworking group
procedure where the group-broadcast group is defined in the MCPTT system
When the call originator has completed transmitting, the group-broadcast group
call is ended and the resources are released.
Figure 10.3.4.4-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
release (the group-broadcast group is defined in the MCPTT system).
Pre-conditions:
1\. An on-going group-broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT
client 2 and the IWF exists.
Figure 10.3.4.4-1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended (group-
broadcast group is defined in the MCPTT system)
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 finished transmitting.
2\. A group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the MCPTT server
of the group-broadcast group.
3\. The MCPTT users of MCPTT client 2 and the IWF of the group-broadcast
group\'s subordinate groups are sent a group-broadcast group call release
request. If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR
users, only one IWF group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the
IWF. If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the
group\'s LMR users, an individual IWF group-broadcast group call request is
sent (to the IWF) for each affiliated LMR user.
4\. MCPTT client 2 and the IWF notify their users that the group-broadcast
group call has ended.
NOTE: How LMR user(s) is(are) notified that the group-broadcast group call has
ended is outside the scope of the present document.
5\. MCPTT client 2 and the IWF respond to confirm the release of the group-
broadcast group call by sending a group-broadcast group call release response.
If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR users,
only one IWF group-broadcast group call release response is sent to the MCPTT
server. If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the
group\'s LMR users, an individual IWF group-broadcast group call response is
sent (to the MCPTT server) for each affiliated LMR user.
6\. The MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response
indicating to the initiator that the call is now ended.
#### 10.3.4.5 Group-broadcast group call release with an interworking group
procedure where the group-broadcast group is defined in the LMR system
When the call originator has completed transmitting, the group-broadcast group
call is ended and the resources are released.
Figure 10.3.4.5-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
release (the group-broadcast group defined in the LMR system).
Pre-conditions:
1\. An on-going group-broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT
client 2 and the IWF exists.
Figure 10.3.4.5-1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended (group-
broadcast group defined in the LMR system)
1\. The MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 finished transmitting.
2\. A group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the MCPTT server.
3\. As the group-broadcast group is defined in the LMR system the MCPTT server
sends an IWF group-broadcast group call release request to the IWF.
4\. The IWF sends an IWF group-broadcast group call release request to the
MCPTT server hosting client 2. The MCPTT server sends the group-broadcast
group call release request to MCPTT client 2.
5\. MCPTT client 2 is notified that the group-broadcast group call has ended.
NOTE: How LMR user(s) is(are) notified that the group-broadcast group call has
ended is outside the scope of the present document.
6\. MCPTT client 2 responds to confirm the release of the group-broadcast
group call by sending a group-broadcast group call release response.
7\. The MCPTT server sends an IWF group-broadcast group call release response
to the IWF. The IWF becomes aware that MCPTT client 2 has confirmed the group-
broadcast group call release and replies with another IWF group-broadcast
group call release response back to the MCPTT server to trigger step 8.
8\. The MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response
indicating to the initiator that the group-broadcast group call is now ended.
### 10.3.5 Chat group call
#### 10.3.5.1 General
This subclause is based upon subclause for chat group call in 3GPP TS 23.379
[7], subclause 10.6.2.3.1.2. For LMR systems that do not support the concept
of chat groups, the IWF might still adapt its calls to the MCPTT chat model.
#### 10.3.5.2 MCPTT user initiated chat group call in an interworking group
defined in LMR system
In this procedure, an MCPTT user initiates a chat group call in an
interworking group defined in the LMR system. The signalling procedure is
described in figure 10.3.5.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group information is known at the MCPTT server and the
IWF by configuration or group creation. The interworking group has been
defined in the LMR system.
2\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.3.5.2-1: MCPTT user initiated chat group call in an interworking
group defined in the LMR system
1\. MCPTT user of the MCPTT client indicates to join the group communication
for the group. This may include a request to transmit. The MCPTT client joins
the group by sending a group join request to the MCPTT server. If there is a
request to transmit, then the group join request contains an indication of an
implicit floor request.
2\. The MCPTT server notices that the interworking group is defined in the LMR
system and forwards the group join request as an IWF group join request to the
IWF.
3\. The IWF replies with an IWF group join response indicating the acceptance
of the group join request and also returns the IWF selected media parameters
for the chat group call in the IWF group join response.
4\. The MCPTT server forwards the IWF group join response to the MCPTT client
as a group join response.
5\. If the MCPTT client requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the
media plane (if not already established) for the call.
6\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with the MCPTT client and the IWF for the duration of the call.
Media plane signalling using floor control will be used for subsequent calls
for the group as long as one or more users are affiliated.
#### 10.3.5.3 LMR user initiated chat group call in an interworking group
defined in MCPTT system
In this procedure, an LMR user initiates a chat group call in an interworking
group defined in the MCPTT system. The signalling procedure is described in
figure 10.3.5.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group information is known at the IWF by configuration.
The interworking group has been defined in the MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT user 1 and MCPTT user 2 have previously joined (affiliated) to the
group.
3\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
4\. LMR user initiates a join to the group.
NOTE: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.3.5.3-1: LMR user initiated chat group call in an interworking group
defined in the MCPTT system
1\. The IWF sends an IWF group join request to the MCPTT server. If there is a
request to transmit, then the IWF group join request contains an indication of
an implicit floor request.
2\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT ID is authorized to affiliate to
the group. MCPTT server generates an implicit affiliation if the MCPTT ID is
not already affiliated to the group.
3\. The MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCPTT server
selected media parameters for the chat group call in the IWF group join
response.
4\. If the IWF requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the media
plane (if not already established) for the call.
5\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and the IWF for the duration of
the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used for
subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are affiliated.
#### 10.3.5.4 Release chat group call on an interworking group defined in the
LMR system
This procedure describes the case where the LMR system releases an ongoing
MCPTT chat group call on an interworking group defined in the LMR system, for
all the participants of that group call. The signalling procedure is described
in figure 10.3.5.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A chat group call is ongoing involving an MCPTT client and the IWF.
2\. The LMR system initiates release of the chat group call.
Figure 10.3.5.4-1: Release chat group call on an interworking group defined in
the LMR system
1\. The IWF sends an IWF group call release request to the MCPTT server. An
individual IWF group call release request is sent for each MCPTT user in the
call.
2\. MCPTT server forwards the release request(s) to the group\'s MCPTT users,
as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
3\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
4\. Optionally, the MCPTT client confirms the group call release request
received in step 2 with a group call release response to the MCPTT server.
5\. The MCPTT server forwards the group call release response to the IWF as an
IWF group call release response.
6\. The MCPTT client and the IWF release the floor control and media plane
resources associated with the chat group call that is released. Successful
release of the chat group call does not affect the status of affiliation of
any of the clients.
#### 10.3.5.5 Release chat group call on an interworking group defined in the
MCPTT system
This procedure describes the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing
MCPTT chat group call, on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system,
for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the
conditions for release are met e.g. due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or the number of
affiliated MCPTT group members is below the minimum number permitted.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 10.3.5.5-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A chat group call is ongoing involving MCPTT clients 1, 2 and the IWF.
Figure 10.3.5.5-1: Release chat group call on an interworking group defined in
the MCPTT system

ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
2\. The MCPTT server sends an IWF group call release request to the IWF to
release the ongoing session. If the IWF has joined itself to this group on
behalf of all the group\'s LMR users, only one IWF group call release request
message is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT server has received individual joins
from the group\'s LMR users, an individual IWF group call release request is
sent to the IWF for each joined LMR user.
3\. The MCPTT server sends a group call release request towards each MCPTT
participant of the ongoing group call.
4\. The MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. The IWF confirms the IWF group call release request(s) received in step 2
by IWF group call release response(s) to the MCPTT server.
6\. Optionally, the MCPTT client(s) receiving a group call release request may
send a group call release response to the MCPTT server.
7\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and the IWF release the floor control and media
plane resources associated with the chat group call that is released.
Successful release of the chat group call does not affect the status of
affiliation of any of the clients.

### 10.4.2 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
#### 10.4.2.1 MCPTT user initiating an MCPTT private call
In this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT private call
(automatic commencement mode) for communicating with a user in an LMR system,
with or without floor control enabled.
This subclause is based on the procedure for private call setup in automatic
commencement mode -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems described in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.7.2.3.1.
In figure 10.4.2.1-1, an MCPTT client initiates establishment of an MCPTT
private call with an LMR user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call;
2\. The MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in
subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Figure 10.4.2.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode,
initiated by an MCPTT user
1\. The MCPTT user at the MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT private call. The
MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT server. The
MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID corresponding to the LMR
called user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The following
parameters are also included that describe the MCPTT client\'s choices:
\- the encryption algorithm;
\- the encryption mode (encrypted or not)
\- an indication of whether the MCPTT client is requesting the floor;
\- requested commencement mode (automatic in this case); and
\- an indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to
establish floor control).
2\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is
authorized to initiate the private call. Because the IWF private call request
is requesting automatic commencement mode, the MCPTT server also checks
whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate a call in
automatic commencement mode.
3\. If authorized, the MCPTT server sends the IWF private call request towards
the IWF, including the original parameters and offering the same media types
or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as
per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
NOTE: How the IWF private call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out
of scope of the present document.
4\. The IWF sends an IWF private call response to the MCPTT server, indicating
that the IWF does support one of the requested media types. The response
indicates success or failure. If the indication is failure, the response may
include one or more alternatives to the parameter values contained in step 3.
5\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT
client. If the result parameter indicates success, then the MCPTT client
proceeds to step 6. Otherwise, if the parameters returned in the MCPTT private
call response are acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the MCPTT client can
send a new MCPTT private call request with the new parameters and behaves
according to those parameters. The calling MCPTT user may be notified of the
change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor
control. The MCPTT user can choose to end the call rather than continue with
the new parameters. If the parameters returned are not acceptable to the MCPTT
client, then the call fails.
6\. The MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for
communication to the IWF and either end can transmit media. The MCPTT system
initiating the call is responsible of granting the floor, solving competing
floor requests and issuing floor revoked indications.
#### 10.4.2.2 LMR user initiating a private call with MCPTT user
In this procedure, an LMR user is initiating a private call (in automatic
commencement mode) for communicating with a user in MCPTT system, with or
without floor control enabled.
This subclause is based on the procedure for private call setup in automatic
commencement mode -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems described in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.7.2.3.1.
In figure 10.4.2.2-1, an LMR user initiates establishment of a private call
with an MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling LMR user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call;
2\. The MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in
subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
3\. The LMR user at the LMR system has initiated a private call towards an
MCPTT user.
NOTE 1: Private call operation between the LMR user and the IWF are out of
scope of the present document.
Figure 10.4.2.2-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode,
initiated by an LMR user
1\. The IWF sends an IWF private call request towards the MCPTT server. The
IWF private call request contains the MCPTT ID corresponding to the LMR
calling user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The
following parameters are also included that describe the MCPTT client\'s
choices:
\- the encryption algorithm;
\- the encryption mode (encrypted or not)
\- an indication of whether the LMR user is requesting the floor;
\- requested commencement mode (automatic in this case); and
\- an indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to
establish floor control).
2\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is
authorized and able to receive the private call. Because the IWF private call
request is requesting automatic commencement mode, the MCPTT server also
checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to receive a
call in automatic commencement mode.
3\. If authorized, the MCPTT server sends the MCPTT private call request
towards the MCPTT client, including the original parameters and offering the
same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial
received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
4\. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server
indicating that the MCPTT client does support one of the requested media
types. The response indicates success or failure. If the indication is
failure, the response may also include one or more alternatives to the
parameter values contained in step 3.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the IWF private call response to the IWF offering
the same media type as that sent in step 4. If the parameters returned are not
acceptable to the IWF, then the call fails. If the parameters returned in the
IWF private call response are different but acceptable to the IWF, then the
IWF can send a new IWF private call request with the new parameters starting
with step 1, which is to essentially restart the call. If there is no change
of parameter, then the call proceeds to step 6.
NOTE 2: The calling LMR user may be notified of the change in parameters, for
example, that the call is to be without floor control.
6\. The MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for
communication to the IWF and either end can transmit media. The LMR system
initiating the call is responsible of granting the floor, solving competing
floor requests and issuing floor revoked indications.
### 10.4.3 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
#### 10.4.3.1 MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT private call
In this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT private call (manual
commencement mode) for communicating with an LMR user via an IWF, with or
without floor control enabled.
This subclause is based on the procedure for private call setup in manual
commencement mode -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems described in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.7.2.3.2.
In figure 10.4.3.1-1, an MCPTT client initiates establishment of an MCPTT
private call with an LMR user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode for the call.
2\. The MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in
subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Figure 10.4.3.1-1: Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- initiated
by an MCPTT user
1\. The MCPTT user at the MCPTT client would like to initiate an MCPTT private
call. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server. The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID corresponding to
the called LMR user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The
following parameters are also included that describe the MCPTT client\'s
choices:
\- the encryption algorithm;
\- the encryption mode (encrypted or not)
\- an indication of whether the MCPTT client is requesting the floor;
\- requested commencement mode (manual in this case); and
\- an indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to
establish floor control).
2\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is
authorized to initiate the private call. Because the IWF private call request
is requesting manual commencement mode, the MCPTT server also checks whether
the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate a call in manual
commencement mode.
3\. If authorized, the MCPTT server sends the IWF private call request towards
the IWF, including the original parameters and offering the same media types
or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as
per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
NOTE: How the IWF private call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out
of scope of the present document.
4\. The IWF may report failure with an IWF private call response to the MCPTT
server. The response may include one or more alternatives to the parameter
values contained in step 3. If the IWF does not report failure, the process
proceeds with step 6.
5\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT
client. If the result parameter indicates failure, the MCPTT client may
abandon the call. If the parameters in the MCPTT private call response are
acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the MCPTT client can send a new MCPTT
private call request with the new parameters to the MCPTT server and behaves
according to those parameters. The calling user may be notified of the change
in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor control. The
calling user may choose to end the call rather than continue with the new
parameters.
6\. The receiving IWF sends an IWF ringing to the MCPTT server while waiting
for the call to be accepted.
7\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT client. The MCPTT
client may indicate to the MCPTT user that the LMR user has been notified,
e.g. by producing ringback audio.
8\. Once the call has been accepted by the called user, the IWF sends an IWF
private call response to the MCPTT server. The IWF private call response
indicates that the IWF does support one of the requested media types.
9\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT
client. The MCPTT client may indicate to the MCPTT user that the call is
connected, e.g. by stopping the ringback audio.
10\. The MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for
communication to the IWF. The MCPTT system initiating the call is responsible
of granting the floor and solving the competing floor requests, and floor
revoked indications.
#### 10.4.3.2 LMR user initiating a private call with MCPTT user
In this procedure, an LMR user is initiating a private call (in manual
commencement mode) for communicating with an MCPTT user via an IWF, with or
without floor control enabled.
This subclause is based on the procedure for private call setup in manual
commencement mode -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems described in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.7.2.3.2.
In figure 10.4.3.2-1, an LMR user initiates establishment of a private call
with an MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling LMR user has selected manual commencement mode for the call.
2\. The MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in
subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
3\. The LMR user at the LMR system has initiated a private call towards an
MCPTT user.
NOTE 1: Private call operation between the LMR user and the IWF are out of
scope of the present document.
Figure 10.4.3.2-1: Private call setup in manual commencement mode, initiated
by an LMR user
1\. The IWF sends an IWF private call request towards the MCPTT server. The
IWF private call request contains the MCPTT ID corresponding to the calling
LMR user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The following
parameters are also included that describe the IWF\'s choices:
\- the encryption algorithm;
\- the encryption mode (encrypted or not)
\- an indication of whether the LMR user is requesting the floor;
\- requested commencement mode (manual in this case); and
\- an indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to
establish floor control).
2\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is
authorized and able to receive the private call. Because the IWF private call
request is requesting manual commencement mode, the MCPTT server also checks
whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to receive a call in
manual commencement mode.
3\. If authorized, the MCPTT server sends the MCPTT private call request
towards the MCPTT client, including the original parameters and offering the
same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial
received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
NOTE 2: How the IWF private call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out
of scope of the present document.
4\. The MCPTT client may report failure with an MCPTT private call response to
the MCPTT server. The response may include one or more alternatives to the
parameter values contained in step 3. If the MCPTT client does not report
failure, the process proceeds with step 6.
5\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the IWF. If
the result parameter indicates failure, the IWF may abandon the call. If the
parameters in the IWF private call response are acceptable to the IWF, then
the IWF can send a new IWF private call request with the new parameters to the
MCPTT server and behaves according to those parameters. The IWF may choose to
end the call rather than continue with the new parameters.
6\. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT server while waiting
for the call to be accepted by the MCPTT user.
7\. The MCPTT server sends an IWF ringing to IWF the while waiting for the
call to be accepted.
8\. Once the call has been accepted by the called user, the MCPTT client sends
an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. The IWF private call
response indicates that the IWF does support one of the requested media types.
9\. The MCPTT sends the IWF private call response to the IWF.
10\. The MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for
communication to the IWF. The LMR system initiating the call is responsible of
granting the floor, solving competing floor requests and issuing floor revoked
indications.
### 10.4.4 Private call release
#### 10.4.4.1 MCPTT client initiated
The procedure describes the case where an MCPTT client requests release of an
ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) that was
established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic).
This subclause is based upon the subclauses for MCPTT private call release in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclauses 10.7.2.2.3.1 and 10.7.2.3.3.
Procedures in figure 10.4.4.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating the release of an ongoing
interworked private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT user on the MCPTT client is already registered for receiving
MCPTT service and is involved in a private call with an LMR user via the IWF
with or without floor control and established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode, as described in subclause 10.4.2 and subclause 10.4.3.
Figure 10.4.4.1-1: Private call release -- client initiated
1\. The user at the MCPTT client would like to release an ongoing interworked
private call with the LMR user.
2\. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call end request towards the MCPTT
server (via SIP core) for tearing down the private call with the other client.
3\. The MCPTT server sends the corresponding IWF call end request towards the
IWF, addressed to the MCPTT client ID specified in the original MCPTT private
call end request.
NOTE: The LMR user is also notified about the release of the private call. How
the LMR user is notified is outside the scope of the present document.
4\. The IWF acknowledges the IWF call end request with an IWF call end
response sent towards the MCPTT server.
5\. After receiving the MCPTT private call end request acknowledgement from
the IWF, the MCPTT server generates an acknowledgement for the MCPTT client\'s
MCPTT private call end request.
6\. The MCPTT client and the IWF release all the media plane resources used
for the private call. Further, if the private call was established with floor
control, floor control resources are released and the MCPTT client cannot make
further requests for floor control or send media.
#### 10.4.4.2 MCPTT server initiated
The procedure describes the case where an MCPTT server terminates an ongoing
interworked private call (with or without floor control) that was established
in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic). The conditions
causing the MCPTT server to terminate the call could include expiry of the
MCPTT administrator configured maximum duration for MCPTT private calls or
expiry of the maximum time permitted for an MCPTT private call without
transmission/reception. This subclause is based upon the subclauses for MCPTT
private call release in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclauses 10.7.2.2.3.2 and
10.7.2.3.3.
Procedures in figure 10.4.4.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing
interworked private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT user on the MCPTT client is already registered for receiving
MCPTT service and is involved in a private call with an LMR user via the IWF
with or without floor control and established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode, as described in subclause 10.4.2 and subclause 10.4.3.
Figure 10.4.4.2-1: End private call -- server initiated
1\. Upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured
maximum duration for MCPTT private calls expiry or time out due to MCPTT
private call without transmission/reception, the MCPTT server decides to
initiate termination of an ongoing interworking private call between the MCPTT
client and the LMR user.
2a. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call end request towards the MCPTT
client (via SIP core) for tearing down the private call.
2b. The MCPTT server sends a corresponding IWF call end request towards the
MCPTT client identity associated with the LMR user
3\. The MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is notified about the termination of
the private call.
NOTE: The LMR user is also notified about the termination of the private call.
How the LMR user is notified is outside the scope of the present document.
4\. The MCPTT client and the IWF acknowledge the request.
5\. The MCPTT client and the IWF release all the media plane resources used
for the private call. Further, if the private call was established with floor
control, floor control resources are released and the MCPTT client cannot make
further requests for floor control or send media.
#### 10.4.4.3 LMR user initiated
The procedure describes the case where either an LMR user or the LMR system is
requesting to release an ongoing interworked private call (with or without
floor control) and the call established in either of the two commencement
modes (manual or automatic). This subclause is based upon the subclauses for
MCPTT private call release in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclauses 10.7.2.2.3.1 and
10.7.2.3.3.
Procedures in figure 10.4.4.3-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the LMR user, via the IWF, initiating the release of an ongoing
interworked private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT user on the MCPTT client is already registered for receiving
MCPTT service and is involved in a private call with an LMR user via the IWF
with or without floor control and established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode, as described in subclause 10.4.2 and subclause 10.4.3.
Figure 10.4.4.3-1: Private call release -- IWF initiated
1\. The LMR system would like to release an ongoing interworked private call
with the MCPTT user.
2\. The IWF sends an IWF call end request towards the MCPTT server for tearing
down the private call with the MCPTT client.
3\. The MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call end request
towards the MCPTT client specified in the original IWF call end request.
4\. The MCPTT user is notified about the release of the private call.
5\. The MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT private call end request.
6\. After receiving the MCPTT private call end request acknowledgement from
the MCPTT client, the MCPTT server generates an acknowledgement for the IWF\'s
IWF call end request.
7\. The MCPTT client and the IWF release all the media plane resources used
for the private call. Further, if the private call was established with floor
control, floor control resources are released and the MCPTT client cannot make
further requests for floor control or send media.
### 10.4.5 Encryption of private calls
Private calls can use MC media encryption (see 3GPP TS 33.180 [8]) between the
IWF and the MCPTT client. A private call that uses an LMR vocoder may use LMR
E2EE if the calling and called parties have previously been provisioned with
the appropriate LMR E2EE keys.
NOTE: MC media encryption is independent of LMR E2EE techniques. MC media
encryption can be applied in addition to LMR E2EE.
## 10.5 Floor control
### 10.5.1 General
Floor control involving a single MCPTT server is described in 3GPP TS 23.379
[7]. Floor control involving multiple MCPTT servers is also described in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [7] in that a primary MCPTT server is interconnected to a partner
MCPTT server. Subclause 10.5.2 describes how the floor control procedures for
interconnection also apply to interworking. Subclause 10.5.3 describes a
special case of floor control that can occur on an interworking group.
Subclauses 10.5.4/10.5.6 and 10.5.5/10.5.7 describe general cases of floor
control on an interworking group defined in the LMR system and in the MCPTT
system respectively, where the partner system has been configured to apply/not
apply local filtering of floor control requests before communicating with the
primary system.
### 10.5.2 Information flows for floor control
#### 10.5.2.1 General

### 10.5.3 Interworking floor control
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.9.1.4.1 describes floor control involving
groups in multiple MCPTT systems where floor control arbitration resides with
the primary MCPTT server and all floor control messages are routed to that
primary MCPTT server. The group is homed on the primary MCPTT server.
An interworking group can be homed on the MCPTT server or on the LMR system.
When the group is homed on the MCPTT server the floor control server is on
this MCPTT server. When the group is homed on the LMR system the floor control
server is represented by the IWF.
The primary MCPTT system of an MCPTT group is defined by configuration and
identified by the MC service group ID.
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.9.1.4.2 describes floor control involving
groups in multiple MCPTT systems where the partner MCPTT system filters its
MCPTT users\' floor requests before communicating with the floor control
server of the primary MCPTT system. When an MCPTT system is interworking with
an IWF, depending on where the group is homed the MCPTT server, or the IWF can
filter floor control requests in the same way as an interconnected MCPTT
system.
### 10.5.4 Floor override without using floor revoked on an interworking group
This procedure describes the case where a transmitting radio cannot be
signalled that the floor has been taken or revoked. Within the context of
interworking between MCPTT and LMR systems, this condition can occur due to
both MCPTT and LMR users obtaining the floor simultaneously, or the floor
granted to an LMR user is taken by an MCPTT user.
Figure 10.5.4‑1 shows the high-level procedure where an MCPTT session is
already established between the floor participants (with floor granted to an
LMR user represented by the IWF) and the floor control server (with an
override based on priority and configured to permit the transmission of
overridden floor participant from the IWF). The group is defined in the MCPTT
system and the MCPTT Server is the floor control server. Only two UEs involved
in the session are shown for simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT floor control server has been configured to support override.
2\. The override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor
participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.
3\. An MCPTT session is established between an MCPTT client, the interworked
system, and MCPTT server.
4\. Session is ongoing.
Figure 10.5.4‑1: Floor override (overridden continues to transmit) during an
interworking session
1\. It is assumed that the floor participant B (represented by the IWF in
figure 10.5.4‑1) has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.
2\. Floor participant A, having a floor priority which is relatively higher
than that of floor participant B, wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor
priority information that is received in the floor request message.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor
participants (via the IWF). Floor participant B continues transmitting the
(overridden) voice media transmission.
NOTE 1: All other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group
call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn
who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.
6a. The floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.
6b. Floor participant B cannot be notified of the status because it is unable
to receive the message and continues transmitting.
7\. Floor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the
session established beforehand.
NOTE 2: Floor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of
floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both
transmissions is based on configuration.
NOTE 3: When floor participant A stops transmitting, if floor participant B is
still sending voice, then the floor is granted back to floor participant B and
audio is routed to all current floor participants.
### 10.5.5 Floor control on an interworking group homed in the LMR system
Figure 10.5.5‑1 shows the procedure for floor control on an interworking group
homed in the LMR system. Simultaneous floor requests are included to show
various aspects of interworking floor control.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group is homed in the LMR system.
2\. The MCPTT server is configured to locally filter competing floor control
requests before communicating with the IWF.
3\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and LMR users (represented by the IWF) are
affiliated to that group.
4\. An interworking group call is ongoing involving MCPTT users and LMR users
(represented by the IWF). The floor is currently idle.
Figure 10.5.5-1: Floor control on a group homed in the LMR system
1\. The users of MCPTT Client 1 and MCPTT Client 2 both want to send voice
media over the session.
2\. MCPTT Clients 1 and 2 send floor request messages to the floor control
server.
3\. The MCPTT floor control server determines to accept the floor request from
MCPTT Client 1 based on local arbitration results (e.g., according to priority
information versus the competing request from MCPTT client 2).
4\. The user of MCPTT client 2 is notified that their floor request was
rejected.
5\. Since the group is homed in the LMR system the MCPTT floor control server
forwards the floor request to the IWF for final floor control determination.
The IWF performs floor arbitration in conjunction with the LMR system (not
shown). The IWF determines that the floor can be granted to the MCPTT user.
6\. The IWF sends a floor granted message to the MCPTT floor control server.
7\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a floor granted message to MCPTT
client 1.
8\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a floor taken message to MCPTT client
2 to notify the user of who is granted the floor.
9\. MCPTT Client 1 notifies the user that he/she has been granted the floor
and may begin speaking.
10\. MCPTT Client 1 begins sending voice media over the established session.
The media is distributed to affiliated group members including the IWF.
### 10.5.6 Floor control on an interworking group homed in the MCPTT system
Figure 10.5.6‑1 shows the procedure for floor control on an interworking group
homed in the MCPTT system, and the LMR system is configured for local floor
control request filtering. Simultaneous floor requests are included to show
various aspects of interworking floor control.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group is homed in the MCPTT system.
2\. The interworking group is previously defined on the group management
server.
3\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and LMR users (represented by the IWF) are
affiliated to that group.
4\. An interworking group call is ongoing involving MCPTT users and LMR users
(represented by the IWF). The floor is currently idle.
Figure 10.5.6-1: Floor control on a group homed in the MCPTT system
1\. The user of MCPTT Client 1 wants to send voice media over the session. At
the same time a user in the LMR system (represented by the IWF) wants to also
send voice media over the session.
2\. MCPTT Client 1 sends a floor request message to the MCPTT floor control
server.
3\. The IWF sends a floor request message to the MCPTT floor control server.
NOTE: If multiple LMR users want to speak, it is assumed that the LMR system
has arbitrated these requests based on local policies and only presents one
floor request to the MCPTT system.
4\. Since the group is homed in the MCPTT system the MCPTT floor control
server performs final floor control determination. In this case the MCPTT
floor control server determines to accept the floor request from MCPTT Client
1 based on local policy and arbitration results (e.g., according to time of
arrival of the request versus the competing request from the IWF).
5\. The IWF is notified that its floor request was rejected.
6\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a floor granted message to MCPTT
client 1.
7\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a floor taken message to both MCPTT
client 2 and the IWF to inform them of who is granted the floor.
8\. MCPTT Client 1 notifies the user that he/she has been granted the floor
and may begin speaking.
9\. MCPTT Client 1 begins sending voice media over the established session.
The media is distributed to affiliated group members including the IWF.
### 10.5.7 Floor control without local filtering on an interworking group
defined in the LMR system
Figure 10.5.7‑1 shows the procedure for floor control on an interworking group
defined in the LMR system where local filtering is not performed by the MCPTT
server. Simultaneous floor requests are included to show various aspects of
interworking floor control.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group is defined in the LMR system.
2\. The MCPTT system is configured to send competing floor control requests to
the LMR system (represented by the IWF) for floor control arbitration.
3\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and LMR users are affiliated to that
group.
4\. An interworking group call is ongoing involving MCPTT users and LMR users.
The floor is currently idle.
Figure 10.5.7-1: Floor control without local filtering on a group defined in
the LMR system
1\. The users of MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 both want to send voice
media over the session.
2\. MCPTT clients 1 and 2 send floor request messages to the MCPTT floor
control server.
3\. Since the group is defined in the LMR system the MCPTT floor control
server forwards these floor requests to the IWF for final floor control
determination. The IWF performs floor arbitration in conjunction with the LMR
system (not shown). The IWF determines that the floor can be granted to MCPTT
client 1.
4\. The IWF sends an IWF floor granted message for MCPTT client 1, an IWF
floor rejected message for MCPTT client 2, and an IWF floor taken message for
MCPTT client 2 to the MCPTT floor control server.
NOTE: If other MCPTT clients are affiliated to this group, the IWF sends an
IWF floor taken message to the MCPTT floor control server for each one of
them.
5\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a Floor rejected message to MCPTT
client 2 to notify the user that his/her floor request was rejected.
6\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a Floor granted message to MCPTT
client 1.
7\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a Floor taken message to MCPTT client
2 to notify the user of who is granted the floor.
8\. MCPTT client 1 notifies the user that he/she has been granted the floor
and may begin speaking.
9\. MCPTT client 1 begins sending voice media over the established session.
The media is distributed to affiliated group members including the IWF.
### 10.5.8 Floor control without local filtering on an interworking group
defined in the MCPTT system
Figure 10.5.8‑1 shows the procedure for floor control on an interworking group
defined in the MCPTT system where local filtering is not performed by the LMR
system. Simultaneous floor requests are included to show various aspects of
interworking floor control.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group is defined in the MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and LMR users are affiliated to that
group.
3\. The LMR system (represented by the IWF) is configured to send all
competing floor control requests to the MCPTT system for floor control
arbitration.
4\. The IWF is not affiliating on behalf of LMR users. All LMR group
affiliations are passed through the IWF to the MCPTT server.
5\. An interworking group call is ongoing involving MCPTT users and LMR users.
The floor is currently idle.
Figure 10.5.8-1: Floor control without local filtering on a group defined in
the MCPTT system
1\. The user of MCPTT client 1 wants to send voice media over the session. At
the same time multiple users in the LMR system (represented by the IWF) want
to also send voice media over the session.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a floor request message to the MCPTT floor control
server.
3\. The IWF sends floor request messages to the MCPTT floor control server for
each LMR user requesting the floor. In this case two LMR users are requesting
the floor. These floor requests contain the MCPTT ID of the LMR user
(converted by the IWF).
4\. Since the group is defined in the MCPTT system the MCPTT floor control
server performs final floor control determination. In this case the MCPTT
floor control server determines to accept the floor request from MCPTT client
1 based on local policy and arbitration results (e.g., according to priority
of the request versus the competing requests from the IWF).
5\. The IWF is notified that its floor requests were rejected. The MCPTT floor
control server sends an IWF floor rejected message to the IWF for each floor
request.
6\. The MCPTT floor control server sends a floor granted message to MCPTT
client 1.
7\. The MCPTT floor control server sends floor taken messages to MCPTT client
2 and the IWF to inform them of who is granted the floor. In this case a floor
taken message is sent to the IWF corresponding to each affiliated LMR user.
NOTE: If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR
users, only one IWF floor taken message is sent to the IWF.
8\. MCPTT client 1 notifies the user that he/she has been granted the floor
and may begin speaking.
9\. MCPTT client 1 begins sending voice media over the established session.
The media is distributed to affiliated group members including the LMR users.

### 10.6.2 Emergency calls
#### 10.6.2.1 General
This subclause addresses various aspects of emergency call interworking.
Where the group is defined in the MCPTT system and where the IWF has
affiliated to an MCPTT group with a single affiliation on behalf of all LMR
group members, only a single IWF emergency group call request / IWF in-
progress emergency group state cancel request message is sent to the IWF at
the commencement / release of an emergency group call. Where the group is
defined in the MCPTT system and where the IWF has passed through individual
affiliations for each group member in the LMR system, the MCPTT system shall
send individual IWF emergency group call request / IWF in-progress emergency
group state cancel request messages to the IWF for all affiliated group
members in the LMR system in accordance with primary and partner MCPTT system
behaviour. In both cases, the distribution of the messages to group members in
the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.
Where the group is defined in the LMR system, the IWF shall send individual
IWF emergency group call request / IWF in-progress emergency group state
cancel request messages to the IWF for all affiliated MCPTT group members in
accordance with primary and partner MCPTT system behaviour.
#### 10.6.2.2 Emergency group call
##### 10.6.2.2.1 Emergency group call setup initiated by a user in the LMR
system on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system
Figure 10.6.2.2.1‑1 shows the procedure for an emergency group call setup
initiated by a user in the LMR system. The figure is based upon the figure for
emergency calls in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1. This scenario
assumes that the group is an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: The emergency interworking call procedures reuse the information flows
defined 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system
2\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are affiliated to that MCPTT group.
3\. The IWF is connected to and is authorized to interwork with the MCPTT
system.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
5\. LMR user initiates an emergency group call.
Figure 10.6.2.2.1-1: Emergency group call setup, initiated by LMR user on an
interworking group defined in the MCPTT system
1\. The IWF sends an IWF emergency group call request including a MCPTT group
ID to the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT
emergency. The IWF may indicate in its request that an MCPTT emergency alert
is to be sent when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call. The request may
contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
2\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT ID of the LMR user to the
MCPTT emergency group if the user is not already affiliated. If the IWF is
configured to affiliate on behalf of all of its group members in a single
affiliation step, the MC service server affiliates the IWF instead of an
individual MC service ID.
3\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT ID of the LMR user is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group. If
authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status.
4\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
MCPTT participants in the MCPTT group. All successive calls during the MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency state will receive the adjusted bearer
priority.
5\. The MCPTT server records the emergency state of the group. Once an MCPTT
emergency call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is in an in-progress
emergency state until that state is cancelled.
NOTE 3: The IWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present document.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members as defined in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
7\. If the group has other affiliated LMR users than the calling party and the
MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from those LMR users, an
individual IWF emergency group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each
affiliated LMR user.
8\. The IWF returns IWF emergency group call response(s) to the MCPTT server.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the IWF emergency group call response to the IWF
(as a response to the request received in step 1) to inform of the successful
MCPTT emergency group call establishment.
NOTE 4: How the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is out
scope of the present document.
NOTE 5: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, but at the latest
following step 8 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
10\. The LMR users via the IWF and the affiliated MCPTTs have successfully
established media plane for communication. The MCPTT system where the
interworking group is defined is the controlling system of the group call.
##### 10.6.2.2.2 Emergency group call setup initiated by a user in the MCPTT
system on an interworking group defined in MCPTT system
Figure 10.6.2.2.2‑1 shows the procedure for an emergency group call setup
initiated by a user in the MCPTT system. The figure is based upon the figure
for emergency group call in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1. This
scenario assumes that the MCPTT group is an interworking group defined in the
MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: The emergency interworking group call procedures reuse the information
flows defined 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT client 2 is affiliated to the MCPTT group.
3\. The IWF is connected to and is authorized to interwork with the MCPTT
system.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
5\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with the MCPTT group
that has been designated via provisioning as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 3: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 10.6.2.2.2-1: Emergency group call setup, initiated by MCPTT user on an
interworking group defined in the MCPTT system
1\. An MCPTT user initiates an emergency group call. MCPTT client 1 sets its
MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until explicitly
cancelled.
2\. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT emergency group call request to the MCPTT
server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The MCPTT
client may indicate in its request that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be sent
when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call. The request may contain an
indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of the MCPTT client 1 is
authorized for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated
interworking group. If authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine
the members of that MCPTT group and their affiliation status.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 4: Successive calls during the group\'s in-progress emergency state will
all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. The MCPTT server records the in-progress emergency state of the group. The
MCPTT server also records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the
MCPTT emergency group call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. Once an
MCPTT emergency group call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is considered
to be in an in-progress emergency state until that state is cancelled.
7\. The MCPTT server sends an IWF emergency group call request to IWF. If the
IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR users, only one
IWF emergency group call request message is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT
server has received individual affiliations from the group\'s LMR users, an
individual IWF emergency group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each
affiliated LMR user.
8\. IWF responds with the IWF emergency group call response(s) to MCPTT server
to inform of the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.
NOTE 5: How the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is out of
scope of the present document.
NOTE 6: Steps 7 to 8 can occur at any time between steps 5 and 10.
NOTE 7: IWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present document.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members as defined in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
10\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT client to inform of the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.
NOTE 8: Step 10 can occur at any time following step 8, but at the latest
following step 9, depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
11\. The LMR users via the IWF and the affiliated MCPTT clients have
successfully established media plane for communication. The MCPTT system where
the interworking group is defined is the controlling system of the group call.

NOTE 5: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
#### 10.6.2.4 Losing audio
For LMR systems where a user cannot be pre-empted, the IWF identifies the
audio as losing audio to the system. Subclause 10.5 is applicable to losing
audio during emergency calls as well as non-emergency calls.
#### 10.6.2.5 Default emergency group
In MCPTT, the user\'s profile determines whether an emergency is raised on the
user\'s currently selected group or on a configured default emergency group.
It\'s up to the IWF and the LMR system to which it is connected to determine
what group the emergency is raised on and whether an alert is also sent when
the emergency is raised. From the perspective of the MCPTT system, all
emergency behavior by the IWF on behalf of its users mapped to MCPTT shall
comply with behaviors defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]. The implementation shall
ensure that emergency related parameters of a group or private call are
adhered to. For example, an MC service group must be configured in the MC
sevice group managment system for emergency alerts in order for an emergency
alert to be sent on it. This can be enforced through proper configuration of
both LMR and MCPTT systems or can be enforced at run time by the IWF.
#### 10.6.2.6 Emergency private call
An emergency private call to an LMR user will have emergency priority for the
portion of the call transported in the MCPTT system and the LTE EPS but will
not receive priority on the LMR system in LMR systems that do not support
emergency treatment for private calls.
#### 10.6.2.7 LMR systems that do not track group emergencies
The MCPTT system tracks the emergency state of every group. In interworked LMR
systems that do not track the emergency state of groups, only a UE in
emergency state will be given emergency priority on the LMR system when
talking. For any user talking on an emergency group, the portion of the call
transported by the MCPTT system will receive emergency priority.
### 10.6.3 Imminent peril calls
#### 10.6.3.1 General
This subclause addresses various aspects of imminent peril call interworking.
LMR systems do not support imminent peril. Imminent peril calls can be
propagated into the LMR system by the IWF as normal group calls or emergency
group calls. The decision of the LMR group call type is outside the scope of
the present document.
Where the group is defined in the MCPTT system and where the IWF has
affiliated to an MCPTT group with a single affiliation on behalf of all LMR
group members, only a single IWF imminent peril group call request / IWF
imminent peril cancel request message is sent to the IWF at the commencement /
cancel of an imminent peril group call. Where the group is defined in the
MCPTT system and where the IWF has passed through individual affiliations for
each group member in the LMR system, the MCPTT system shall send individual
IWF imminent peril group call request / IWF imminent peril cancel request
messages to the IWF for all affiliated group members in the LMR system in
accordance with primary and partner MCPTT system behaviour. In both cases, the
distribution of the messages to group members in the LMR system is out of
scope of the present document.
Where the group is defined in the LMR system, the IWF shall send individual
IWF imminent peril group call request / IWF imminent peril cancel request
messages to the MCPTT server for all affiliated MCPTT group members in
accordance with primary and partner MCPTT system behaviour.
#### 10.6.3.2 Imminent peril group call initiated by an MCPTT user on an
interworking group
Figure 10.6.3.2‑1 shows the procedure for an imminent peril group call
initiated by a user in the MCPTT system. The figure is based upon the figure
for imminent peril group call in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.2.1.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: The imminent peril interworking group call procedures reuse the
information flows defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Pre-conditions:
1\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril
communications
2\. The MCPTT group is an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system.
3\. MCPTT client 2 is affiliated to the MCPTT group.
4\. The IWF is connected to, and is authorized to, interwork with the MCPTT
system.
5\. At least one LMR user has affiliated to the MCPTT group.
6\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 3: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.6.3.2-1: Imminent peril group call initiated by a MCPTT user to an
interworking group defined in the MCPTT system
1\. An MCPTT user initiates an imminent peril group call.
2\. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT imminent peril group call request to the
MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the in-progress imminent
peril. The request may also contain an indication of an implicit floor
request.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the imminent
peril group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is
authorized for initiation of imminent peril group calls on the indicated
interworking group defined in the MCPTT system. If authorized, it resolves the
MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that MCPTT group and their
affiliation status.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 4: Successive calls during the in-progress imminent peril state will all
receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. The MCPTT server records the imminent peril state of the group. The MCPTT
server also records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the imminent
peril group call until the in-progress imminent peril state is cancelled. Once
an imminent peril group call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is considered
to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until that state is cancelled.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the IWF imminent peril group call request(s) to the
IWF. If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR
users, only one IWF imminent peril group call request message is sent to the
IWF. If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the
group\'s LMR users, an individual IWF imminent peril group call request is
sent to the IWF for each affiliated LMR user.
8\. The IWF responds with the IWF imminent peril group call response(s) to
MCPTT server to inform of the successful MCPTT imminent peril call
establishment.
NOTE 5: The IWF can reject the request if it does not support imminent peril
group calls. IWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present
document.
NOTE 6: How the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is out of
scope of the present document.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the imminent peril group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress imminent peril. MCPTT users are
notified of the incoming imminent peril call. The MCPTT clients acknowledge
the imminent peril call request as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
10\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to
the MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful imminent peril call establishment.
NOTE 7: Step 10 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 11
depending on the conditions to proceed with the imminent peril call.
11\. The LMR users via the IWF and the affiliated MCPTT clients have
successfully established the media plane for communication. The MCPTT system,
where the interworking group is defined, is the controlling system of the
group call.
#### 10.6.3.3 Group call initiated by a user in the LMR system on an
interworking group in imminent peril state
Figure 10.6.3.3‑1 shows the procedure for a group call initiated by an LMR
user (represented by the IWF) on an interworking group where the group is
currently in imminent peril state within the MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: The imminent peril interworking group call procedures reuse the
information flows defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and LMR users (represented by the IWF)
affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. The IWF is connected to, and is authorized to interwork with, the MCPTT
system.
3\. The interworking group information is available at the IWF.
4\. The interworking group is currently in imminent peril state within the
MCPTT system.
5\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
6\. LMR user initiates a group call.
NOTE 3: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.6.3.3-1: Group call initiated by a user in the LMR system on an
interworking group in imminent peril state
1\. The IWF does not track the imminent peril state of the group and sends an
IWF group call request including an MCPTT group ID to the MCPTT server for
call establishment. If floor control is requested by the calling LMR user, an
indication of implicit floor request is included.
2\. The MCPTT server determines that the MCPTT group is currently in imminent
peril state.
3\. The MCPTT server converts the request and sends an MCPTT imminent peril
group call request to all of the affiliated MCPTT clients.
3a. If the group has other affiliated LMR users than the calling party and the
MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from those LMR users, an
individual IWF imminent peril group call request is sent to the IWF for each
affiliated LMR user.
4\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT imminent peril group
call request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
4a. The IWF returns IWF imminent peril group call response(s) to the MCPTT
server.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the IWF imminent peril group call response message
to the IWF.
6\. The LMR users (via the IWF) and the affiliated MCPTT clients have
successfully established the media plane for communication. The MCPTT system
where the interworking group is defined is the controlling system of the group
call.
The IWF, MCPTT client 1, and MCPTT client 2 continue with the MCPTT group
call, which receives adjusted bearer priority within the MCPTT system due to
the MCPTT group being in imminent peril state.
NOTE 4: IWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present document.
#### 10.6.3.4 In-progress imminent peril state cancel on an interworking group
This procedure describes the case where an authorized MCPTT user cancels an
interworking group\'s in-progress imminent peril state.
Figure 10.6.3.4‑1 shows the procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an
interworking group\'s in-progress imminent peril state.
NOTE 1: The end of an imminent peril call does not cancel the MCPTT group\'s
in-progress imminent peril state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized
user.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: The in-progress imminent peril interworking group state cancel
procedures reuse the information flows defined 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and LMR users (represented by the IWF)
affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. The IWF is connected to, and is authorized to interwork with, the MCPTT
system.
3\. The interworking group information is available at the IWF.
4\. The interworking group is currently in in-progress imminent peril state
within the MCPTT system and has prioritized bearer support.
5\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 4: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
6\. MCPTT client 1 previously initiated the imminent peril group call.
Figure 10.6.3.4-1: In-progress imminent peril group state cancel on an
interworking group
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an in-progress imminent peril
state cancel.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel request to the MCPTT server.
3\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user 1 at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to cancel the in-progress imminent peril group state.
4\. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the in-progress imminent peril group
state.
5\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required.
6\. The MCPTT server sends an IWF in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel request(s) to the IWF. If the IWF has affiliated to this group on
behalf of the group\'s LMR users, only one IWF in-progress imminent peril
group state cancel request is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT server has
received individual affiliations from the group\'s LMR users, an individual
IWF in-progress imminent peril group state cancel request is sent (to the IWF)
for each affiliated LMR user.
7\. The IWF sends the IWF in-progress imminent peril group state cancel
response(s) to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 5: The IWF responds even if it does not support imminent peril group
calls. IWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present document.
8\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel request to the MCPTT group members.
NOTE 6: Steps 6 and 8 can occur in any order following step 5.
9\. MCPTT group members are notified of the in-progress imminent peril group
state cancel.
10\. MCPTT client 2 sends the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the in-progress MCPTT in-
progress imminent peril group state cancel request. For a multicast scenario,
this acknowledgement is not sent.
11\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel response to the MCPTT client 1 to confirm the MCPTT in-progress
imminent peril group state cancel request.
NOTE 7: Step 11 can occur at any time following step 5.
### 10.6.4 Emergency alerts
#### 10.6.4.1 Emergency alert initiated by LMR user
In this procedure, an LMR user is initiating an emergency alert via the IWF.
Figure 10.6.4.1-1 shows the procedure for an emergency alert initiated by a
user in the LMR system. This subclause is based upon subclause for MCPTT
emergency alerts in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group is previously defined on the group management server
with MC service client 1 and MC service client 2 affiliated to that MC service
group.
2\. The IWF is connected to and is authorized to interwork with the MC service
system.
3\. The MC service group information is available at the IWF, including
information that the MC service group is an interworking group (defined in the
LMR system or MC the system).
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
service system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
5\. The IWF may or may not have carried out an explicit affiliation procedure
with the MC service group.
6\. An emergency alert is requested on the LMR system.
NOTE 1: For all signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
service system and the LMR system, the IWF performs identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 10.6.4.1-1 MC service emergency alert initiated by LMR user
1\. The LMR user initiates an emergency alert.
NOTE 2: How the IWF determines the emergency condition from the LMR system is
out of scope of the present document.
2\. The IWF sends an IWF emergency alert request to the designated MC service
server. If the location of the LMR user is not available to the IWF, the IWF
emergency alert request shall contain an indication that location is not
available.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user ID that represents
the LMR user is authorized for initiation of MC service emergency alerts for
the indicated MC service group. The MC service server determines the
affiliation status of the group members.
4\. The MC service server sends an IWF emergency alert response to the IWF to
confirm the IWF emergency alert request.
NOTE 3: Sending the IWF emergency alert request without making a request to
also start an emergency call does not put the group into an ongoing emergency
condition.
5\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request towards
the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members.
The MC service emergency alert request message shall contain the following
information: Location, MC service ID and MC service group ID (i.e., MC service
user\'s selected MC service group or dedicated MC service emergency group, as
per MC service group configuration) and the MC service user\'s mission
critical organization name.
6\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency.
7\. The receiving MC service clients send an MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert request.
8\. If the group is an interworking group defined in the MC system, the MC
service server implicitly affiliates the individual MC service ID of the LMR
user to the emergency group if not already affiliated. If the IWF is
configured to affiliate on behalf of all of its group members in a single
affiliation step, the MC service server affiliates the IWF ID instead of an
individual MC service ID.
NOTE 4: Step 8 can be performed any time after step 3 but at the latest
immediately after step 7.
NOTE 5: MC service group calls made to this MC service group will be
established as emergency calls if this MC service group has an ongoing
emergency condition.
NOTE 6: Sending the emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
#### 10.6.4.2 Emergency alert initiated by MC service user
In this procedure, an MC service user is initiating an emergency alert that is
delivered to the LMR system via the IWF. Figure 10.6.4.2-1 shows the procedure
for an emergency alert initiated by a user in the MC service system. This
subclause is based upon subclause for MCPTT emergency alerts in 3GPP TS 23.379
[7], subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group is previously defined on the group management server
with MC service client 1 and MC service client 2 affiliated to that MC service
group.
2\. The IWF is connected to and is authorized to interwork with the MC service
system.
3\. The MC service group information is available at the IWF, including
information that the MC service group is an interworking group (defined in the
LMR system or the MC system).
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 1: For all signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
system and the LMR system, the IWF performs identity conversion and protocol
translation.
Figure 10.6.4.2-1 MC service emergency alert initiated by MC service user
1\. The MC service user 1 initiates an emergency alert.
2\. MC service client 1 sends an MC service emergency alert request to the MC
service server.
3\. The MC service server resolves the group ID, determines the affiliation
status of the group members and checks whether the IWF should be informed. In
this scenario, the group has affiliated members that are homed on the IWF,
thus the IWF shall be involved. MC service server also checks whether the MC
service user ID is authorized to initiate MC service emergency alerts for the
indicated MC service group.
4\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert response to the
MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert request.
NOTE 2: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into an ongoing emergency condition.
5\. MC service server sends an IWF emergency alert request to the IWF. If the
location of the MC service client 1 is not available, the IWF emergency alert
request shall contain an indication that location is not available. If the IWF
has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR users, only one IWF
emergency alert request is sent to the IWF. If the IWF has sent individual
affiliations for each of its LMR users, the MC service server sends an IWF
emergency alert request via the IWF to each affiliated LMR group member.
6\. The IWF sends an IWF service emergency alert response to the MC service
server to confirm the IWF emergency alert request(s).
7\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request towards
the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members.
The MC service emergency alert request message shall contain the following
information: Location, MC service ID and MC service group ID (i.e., MC service
user\'s selected MC service group or dedicated MC service emergency group, as
per MC service group configuration) and the MC service user\'s mission
critical organization name.
8\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency.
9\. The receiving MC service clients send an MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert.
10\. The MC service server implicitly affiliates the MC service client 1 to
the emergency group if it is not already affiliated.
NOTE 3: Step 10 can be performed any time after step 3. Steps 5 and 7 can be
performed in which ever order.
NOTE 4: MC service group calls made to this MC service group will be
established as emergency calls if the MC service group has an ongoing
emergency condition.
NOTE 5: Sending an emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
### 10.6.5 Emergency alert cancellation
#### 10.6.5.1 Emergency alert cancellation of an LMR user
In this procedure, an LMR user is cancelling the emergency alert. Figure
10.6.5.1-1 shows the procedure for emergency alert cancellation of a user in
the LMR system. This subclause is based upon subclause for MCPTT emergency
alert cancel in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.3.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group information is available at the IWF, including
information that the MC service group is an interworking group (defined in the
LMR system or the MC system).
2\. The LMR user had previously successfully initiated an emergency alert via
the IWF.
3\. The MC service client 1 and MC service client 2 are affiliated to the MC
service group.
4\. The MC service server may have carried out an explicit or implicit
affiliation procedure of the LMR user to the MC service group.
5\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
service system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
6\. The LMR user initiates an emergency alert cancel.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
service system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion
and protocol translation.

1\. The IWF sends an IWF emergency alert cancel request to the MC service
group to which the IWF had previously successfully sent the IWF emergency
alert request on behalf of the LMR user.
NOTE 2: The IWF emergency alert cancel request may carry an indication to also
request that the in-progress emergency state on the group is to be cancelled.
2\. The MC service server sends the IWF emergency alert cancel response to the
IWF to confirm the IWF emergency alert cancellation.
3\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request
to the MC service clients of the affiliated MC service group members.
4\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency alert
cancellation of the LMR user.
5\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert
cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service
emergency alert cancel request. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
6\. If the MC service server had implicitly affiliated the individual MC
service ID of the LMR user or the IWF to the MC service group when receiving
the IWF emergency alert request, the MC service server shall de-affiliate the
individual MC service ID of the LMR user or the IWF from the MC service group.
NOTE 3: Step 6 can be performed any time after step 2.
NOTE 4: Steps 2 and 3 can be performed in which ever order.
#### 10.6.5.2 Emergency alert cancellation of an MC service user
In this procedure, an MC service user is cancelling the emergency alert.
Figure 10.6.5.2-1 shows the procedure for emergency alert cancellation from a
user in the MC service system. This subclause is based upon subclause for
MCPTT emergency alerts in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.3.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group information is available at the IWF, including
information that the MC service group is an interworking group (defined in the
LMR system or the MC system).
2\. The MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MC
service emergency alert request.
3\. The MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.
4\. The MC service client 2 is affiliated to the MC service group.
5\. The MC service server may have carried out an explicit or implicit
affiliation procedure of the LMR user with the MC service group.
6\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC
service system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC
service system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion
and protocol translation.
Figure 10.6.5.2-1 MC service emergency alert cancellation of an MC service
user
1\. The user at the MC service client 1 initiates an emergency alert cancel.
NOTE 2: The MC service emergency alert cancel request may carry an indication
that the in-progress emergency state on the group is to be cancelled.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency alert cancel to the MC service group to which MC service client 1
had previously sent the emergency alert request. The MC service server
resolves the group ID, determines the affiliation status of the group members
and checks whether the IWF should be informed. In this scenario, the group has
affiliated members that are homed on the IWF, thus the IWF shall be involved.
3\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response
to the MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert cancel
request. MC service client 1 resets its emergency state.
4\. The MC service server sends an IWF emergency alert cancel request(s) to
the IWF. If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group\'s LMR
users, only one IWF emergency alert cancel request message is sent to the IWF.
If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the group\'s LMR
users, an individual IWF emergency alert cancel request message is sent to the
IWF for each affiliated LMR user.
5\. The IWF sends an IWF emergency alert cancel response(s) to the MC service
server to acknowledge the IWF emergency alert cancel request(s).
6\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request
towards the MC service clients of the affiliated MC service group members.
7\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency alert
cancellation of MC service client 1.
8\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert
cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service
emergency alert cancel request. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. If the MC service server had implicitly affiliated the MC service client 1
to the MC service emergency group when receiving the MC service emergency
alert request, the MC service server shall de-affiliate MC service client 1
from the MC service group.

### 10.7.2 IWF transcoding
The IWF can be used to transcode voice packets in transit between the LMR and
MCPTT systems. In this scenario, the MCPTT system can operate its own vocoder
type and the LMR system can operate its own vocoder type. The type of vocoder
used on the LMR side is outside the scope of the present document.
When operating in this mode, the IWF converts voice media formats between the
two sides. Vocoder negotiation is according to procedures in the present
document.
### 10.7.3 Codec negotiation by the LMR system
#### 10.7.3.1 Description
An MCPTT group may be configured to use an LMR speech codec, such that speech
can be carried end to end between all group members in both LMR and MCPTT
system without transcoding.
An LMR system can support more than one speech codec; for example P25 supports
both a full rate and a half rate speech codec. Circumstances within the LMR
system might require that the codec in use within a group is changed according
to the needs of the LMR system.
Figure 10.7.3.1-1 below illustrates a procedure which allows the LMR system to
change the speech codec within an MCPTT group that is connected to the LMR
system via the IWF.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Group members have affiliated to the MCPTT group in both the LMR system
and in the MCPTT system
2\. A permitted LMR codec has been negotiated for use by MCPTT group members
3\. MCPTT group members support the requested second LMR speech codec
NOTE 1: The exception condition created if the IWF does not support trancoding
and the MCPTT client does not support the requested LMR codec is outside the
scope of the present document.
4\. The LMR system requires a change to an alternative speech codec.
Figure 10.7.3.1-1: Codec reconciliation procedure
1\. The IWF sends a codec reconciliation request to the MCPTT server on behalf
of the LMR system.
2\. The MCPTT server checks that the requested codec is permitted for the
MCPTT group.
3\. The MCPTT server sends a codec reconciliation request to all of the
affilliated MCPTT client(s) to negotiate the use of the speech codec requested
by the LMR system.
4\. The MCPTT client replies with a codec reconciliation response to the MCPTT
server, indicating acceptance of the new speech codec.
5\. The MCPTT server sends a codec reconciliation response to the IWF.
6\. Further transmissions in the MCPTT group use the new codec in the media
plane.
NOTE 2: The time at which the new codec is first used by a transmitting party
is outside the scope of the present document.
## 10.8 MCData short data service
### 10.8.1 General
The present document specifies short data service (SDS) interworking between
LMR users and MCData clients using one-to-one standalone SDS messages and
group standalone SDS messages. The IWF behaves as a peer MCData server to
other MCData servers.
When an LMR user attempts to send an LMR message to the MCData service, the
IWF converts the LMR message into a request to send an MCData SDS. The method
by which the IWF converts the LMR message into a request to send an MCData SDS
is outside the scope of the present document.
When the IWF receives a request to send an MCData SDS to an LMR user or a
group of LMR users, the IWF converts the request into one or more LMR
messages. The method by which the IWF converts the MCData SDS request into an
LMR messages is outside the scope of the present document.
### 10.8.2 Information flows for the short data service
#### 10.8.2.1 General
The following subclauses define information flows for MCData SDS on the IWF-2
interface. MCData SDS related information flows on reference points other than
IWF-2 are defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [6], subclause 7.4.2.1. In each case, the
LMR users behind the IWF are represented by MCData IDs or a MCData group ID as
appropriate and so the MCData server shall be capable of routing messages
towards identities located behind the IWF.
#### 10.8.2.2 IWF MCData standalone data request

with the exception that MCData client 1 is located behind an IWF and one or
more of the MCData clients 2 to n can be behind IWFs that have affiliated to
the MCData group (see subclause 10.1.2 of the present document). The SDS is
addressed to the MCData group ID. The IWF behaves as a peer MCData server to
other MCData servers.
## 10.9 IWF as a security gateway
### 10.9.1 Support for transcoding with encrypted speech
In some cases when encryption of voice media is required in the MC system, the
MCPTT user(s) and the LMR user(s) can use different codecs. In these cases,
transcoding is needed and before transcoding can occur, encryption applied to
the voice media by the MC system needs to be removed. After transcoding, LMR
encryption can be applied (out-of-scope of the present document). An IWF can
perform these functions and be deployed as a security gateway between the
MCPTT system and the LMR system. When the IWF removes the encryption applied
by the MC system, the IWF must perform key management procedures defined in
3GPP TS 33.180 [8] to obtain the key material for the group.
## 10.10 Simultaneous interworked calls (on-network)
### 10.10.1 General
An IWF representing an LMR user may support simultaneous interworked calls for
the same LMR user. The LMR user can become involved in simultaneous
interworked calls when the IWF invites, joins or accepts more than one
interworked call on behalf of the LMR user, or when the IWF affilates the LMR
user to multiple groups. This subclause is based on the subclause for
simultaneous session for MCPTT calls in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.8.
NOTE: An LMR user affiliating to multiple interworked groups with active calls
via the IWF can result in the LMR user being invited simultaneously to
multiple interworked calls.
How the IWF accomodates simultaneous interworked calls to a single LMR user is
outside the scope of the present document.
## 10.11 Location
### 10.11.1 Location of current talker
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.7 describes a high-level procedure to
provide the location of the current talker to all the receiving MCPTT users.
### 10.11.2 Location of current talker (MCPTT server to IWF)
Figure 10.11.2-1 shows the high-level procedure to for MCPTT service to
provide the location information about the current talking user to all the
receiving MCPTT users and the IWF.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is on-going group call involving MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2
and the IWF.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is the current talking user.
3\. MCPTT server has obtained the location information of MCPTT client 1.
Figure 10.11.2-1: Providing location information of the current talker
1\. MCPTT client 1 gets the floor to transmit voice media.
2\. The MCPTT server checks the privacy policy (authorisation to provide
location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking, as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] Annex A.3) of the current talking MCPTT user to decide
if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other MCPTT
users on the call.
3\. The MCPTT server provides the location information of MCPTT client 1 to
MCPTT client 2 and the IWF. The procedures for this are described in 3GPP TS
23.380 [5] subclause 10.9.3.6.
### 10.11.3 Location of current talker (IWF to MCPTT server)
Figure 10.11.3‑1 shows the high-level procedure to for the IWF to provide the
location information about the current LMR talking user to all the receiving
MCPTT users.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is on-going group call involving MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2
and the IWF.
2\. An LMR user is the current talking user through the IWF.
NOTE: How the MCPTT server acquires the location of the LMR user is outside
the scope of the present document.
Figure 10.11.3-1: Providing location information of the current talker
1\. The IWF gets the floor to transmit voice media.
2\. The MCPTT server checks the privacy policy (authorisation to provide
location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking, as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] Annex A.3) of the current talking IWF user to decide if
the location information of the user on the IWF can be provided to other MCPTT
users on the call.
3\. The MCPTT server provides the location information of the IWF user to
MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2. The procedures for this are described in
3GPP TS 23.380 [5] subclause 10.9.3.6.
## 10.12 LMR security transport
### 10.12.1 Information flows for LMR security transport
#### 10.12.1.1 Non-3GPP security message request
Table 10.12.1.1-1 describes the information flow non-3GPP security message
request from the MC service server to the IWF, from the IWF to the MC service
server, from the MC service server to the MC service client and from the MC
service client to the MC service server.
