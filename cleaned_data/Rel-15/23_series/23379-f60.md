# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the mission critical push to talk (MCPTT)
service. The MCPTT service utilizes the common functional architecture to
support MC services over LTE including the common services core defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [16].Support for both MCPTT group calls and MCPTT private calls
operating in on-network and off-network modes of operation is specified.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [17].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCPTT voice service using
E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8].
Certain application functions of the MCPTT service such as dispatch and
administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks
but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The MCPTT service requires preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services e.g. in support of police or fire brigade including
the handling of prioritised MCPTT calls for emergency and imminent threats.
The MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
In the present document, MCPTT calls between MCPTT users on different MCPTT
systems are considered.

# 4 Introduction
The MCPTT service supports communication between several users (i.e. group
call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to
talk in an arbitrated manner. The MCPTT service also supports private calls
between two users.
The MCPTT architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services over LTE defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] and aspects
of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [9] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [6] to enable support of the MCPTT service.
The MCPTT UE primarily obtains access to the MCPTT service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8]. Certain application
functions of MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions can
be supported using either MCPTT UEs in E-UTRAN or using MCPTT UEs via non-3GPP
access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are
considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.
MCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the
functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the
non-3GPP access network.
The MCPTT system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Media routing requirements
The voice media flow for a private call shall be routed according to one of
the following two options:
a) Option 1:
1) Through the primary MCPTT system if both users in the call belong to the
same organisation; or
2) Through the primary MCPTT system of both users, if the users in the call do
not belong to the same organisation.
b) Option 2: The voice media flow may be routed locally, under the control of
the primary MCPTT system, through an entity allowing the duplication of the
media flow to the primary MCPTT system of each user.
The voice media flow for a group call shall be routed to the group home MCPTT
system.
The routing of media flow shall be end-to-end from transmitter to receiver(s),
except for the MCPTT control function.
## 5.2 Requirements for user identity management
To allow for confidentiality of user identities in various cases of business
relationship as defined in clause 6, the MCPTT application may provide public
user identities to the MCPTT UE, to be used by MCPTT UE for MCPTT services.
## 5.3 MCPTT group affiliation and MCPTT group de-affiliation
MCPTT group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [16]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCPTT service for MCPTT users affiliated to MCPTT groups:
\- MCPTT users receive notifications for MCPTT group call setup and
invitations for their affiliated MCPTT group(s).
\- MCPTT users receive media and events from their affiliated MCPTT group(s).
## 5.4 MCPTT call requirements
### 5.4.1 General
The on-network MCPTT service shall support the use of pre-established
sessions.
### 5.4.2 Group call requirements
The MCPTT service shall support the chat group (restricted) call model for
MCPTT group call.
The MCPTT service shall support the pre-arranged group call model for MCPTT
group call.
## 5.5 GCS AS requirements for the MCPTT service
The GCS AS architecture requirements for MC services are specified in 3GPP TS
23.280 [16].
## 5.6 Group selection
The following functionalities shall be supported by the MCPTT service.
a. The MCPTT user shall select an affiliated group to initiate a new group
call or transmit media in an existing group call.
b. An authorized MCPTT user (e.g., dispatcher) may remotely force or request
to change other on-network MCPTT users\' selected MCPTT group to a particular
affiliated group.
## 5.7 Bearer management
### 5.7.1 General
The MCPTT UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [16].
### 5.7.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[16] shall apply.
#### 5.7.2.1 Void
#### 5.7.2.2 Void
### 5.7.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCPTT
For an MCPTT call session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCPTT system shall request resources over Rx
to a PCRF. The dedicated bearer for voice and MCPTT-4 reference point
messaging shall utilise the QCI value of 65 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203
[4]). The request of resources over Rx shall include an application identifier
for MCPTT in order for the PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
The UE is required to support at minimum one UM bearer which is used for MCPTT
voice (see annex A in 3GPP TS 36.331 [12]).
Depending on operator policy:
\- the MCPTT system may be able to request modification of the priority (ARP)
of an existing bearer without the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer;
or
\- the EPS bearers for MCPTT call may enable pre-emption of lower priority EPS
bearers if the maximum number of UM bearers has been reached in favour of
MCPTT initiated EPS bearer, if the EPS bearer used for MCPTT call has higher
priority level (ARP) than the UM bearer(s) used for other application(s) and
if the bearers for non MCPTT application are pre-emptable. In this case, the
EPS bearer for MCPTT call pre-empts one of the existing EPS bearers when the
maximum number of bearers is established for other applications.
NOTE 1: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
The EPS bearer for MCPTT emergency call shall have highest priority level
among MCPTT call types. The EPS bearer for MCPTT imminent peril call shall
have higher priority level than one for MCPTT call.
To ensure that the MCPTT service always has access to a dedicated bearer for
MCPTT media, a pre-established session may be setup that includes a request
for resources at the first MCPTT group affiliation.
This means that the PCC may multiplex MCPTT media streams from multiple
concurrent MCPTT calls into one EPS bearer on one shared network priority
regardless of MCPTT call priority.
NOTE 2: A single UM bearer is used to multiplex the media streams from
multiple concurrent MCPTT calls.
NOTE 3: The sharing of a single GBR bearer for voice means that different QCI
and/or ARP values are not possible for different voice media streams.
NOTE 4: Multi-talker control may require additional bearer resources if
multiple audio streams are sent to the UE when the floor is granted to
additional participants during an established MCPTT group session.
### 5.7.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
## 5.8 MCPTT system interconnect requirements
The architecture for interconnect between MCPTT systems is specified, allowing
the affiliation of MCPTT users from an MCPTT system with MCPTT groups defined
in another MCPTT system. When both MCPTT systems are served by different
networks, interconnect of signalling and media is achieved using the
interfaces defined for interconnect between PLMNs.

## 7.4 Functional entities description
### 7.4.1 General
Each subclause is a description of a functional entity and does not imply a
physical entity.
### 7.4.2 Application plane of MCPTT service
#### 7.4.2.1 General
Entities within the application plane of MCPTT service provide application
control, media control and distribution functions.
#### 7.4.2.2 Common services core
The description of the common services core entities are contained in common
functional architecture to support MC services in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
#### 7.4.2.3 MCPTT application service
##### 7.4.2.3.1 MCPTT client
The MCPTT client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCPTT
application transactions. The client reports the information of where the
client is currently located.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 MCPTT server
The MCPTT server functional entity provides centralised support for MCPTT
services.
All the MCPTT clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCPTT server for that group. An MCPTT client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCPTT servers.
NOTE 1: Possible requirements for handling multiple distinct media on
different MCPTT servers are not covered in this version of the document.
The MCPTT server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the
GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications.
The MCPTT server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
By assuming the role of a GCS AS, the MCPTT server functional entity is
responsible for:
\- requesting the allocation of multicast resources utilizing the media
distribution function;
\- announcing the association of multicast resources to calls to MCPTT UEs;
\- determining for each MCPTT UE involved in a given call whether to use
unicast or multicast transport;
\- announcing the assignment of multicast transport for specific calls to
MCPTT UEs; and
\- informing the media distribution function of the media streams requiring
support for a given call.
The MCPTT server shall support the controlling role and the participating
role. The MCPTT server may perform the controlling role for private calls and
group calls. The MCPTT server performing the controlling role for a private
call or group call may also perform a participating role for the same private
call or group call. For each private call and group call, there shall be only
one MCPTT server assuming the controlling role, while one or more MCPTT
servers in participating role may be involved.
The MCPTT server performing the controlling roles is responsible for:
\- call control (e.g. policy enforcement for participation in the MCPTT group
calls) towards all the MCPTT users of the group call and private call;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCPTT server\'s served affiliated
users;
\- managing floor control entity in a group call and private call; and
\- managing media handling entity in call i.e. conferencing, transcoding.
The MCPTT server performing the functional alias controlling role is
responsible for:
\- interfacing with the functional alias management server for functional
alias policy;
\- functional alias activation, deactivation, take over and interrogation
support for MCPTT user.
The controlling roles for group call, private call and functional alias are
independent with each other.
The MCPTT server performing the participating roles is responsible for:
\- call control (e.g. authorization for participation in the MCPTT group
calls) to its MCPTT users for group call and private call;
\- group affiliation support for MCPTT user, including enforcement of maximum
N2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;
\- relaying the call control and floor control messages between the MCPTT
client and the MCPTT server performing the controlling role; and
\- media handling in call for its MCPTT users, i.e. transcoding, recording,
lawful interception for both unicast and multicast media.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT server in the controlling role and the MCPTT server in the
participating role can belong to the same MCPTT system or to different MCPTT
systems.
For group regrouping involving multiple groups from primary and partner MCPTT
systems,
\- the group host MCPTT server of the temporary group performs the controlling
role and is responsible for the centralized floor control, and for arbitration
according to the temporary group or user policies (e.g., priority);
\- the group host MCPTT server of the constituent MCPTT group is responsible
for providing call invitations to their group members, and for filtering
between constituent group members\' floor control requests according to the
constituent group or user policies (e.g., priority); and
\- the MCPTT server responsible for the constituent MCPTT group members
performs the participating role.
##### 7.4.2.3.3 Floor participant
The floor participant functional entity is responsible for floor requests.
This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-
network operations.
##### 7.4.2.3.4 Floor control server
This functional entity provides support for centralised floor control for on-
network and distributed floor control for off-network operation. It may
provide arbitration between floor control requests between different users,
grant the floor in response to successful requests, and provide queuing in
cases of contention. For on-network operation, this functional entity is
located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional
entity is located in the UE.
##### 7.4.2.3.5 Media distribution function
The media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media
to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server
(e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following
functionality:
\- provide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of
the MCPTT-7 reference point;
\- replicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using
unicast transport;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those
participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference
point;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport
of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and
\- provide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined
(e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the
MCPTT UE.
NOTE 1: If media mixing function occurs within the media distribution
function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.
NOTE 2: A media mixing function within the media distribution function is not
possible where the media is end to end encrypted.
Group configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker
control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: If media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to
minimize the feedback of the user\'s own voice from the mixed audio in order
to avoid echoes.
##### 7.4.2.3.6 Media mixer
This functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining
multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream
through the enforcement of media policy information. Group configuration data
determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the
media mixing function in the UE.
##### 7.4.2.3.7 MCPTT user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCPTT user profile
associated with an MCPTT ID that is held by the MCPTT service provider at the
application plane. The MCPTT user profile is determined by the mission
critical organization, the MCPTT service provider, and potentially the MCPTT
user.
##### 7.4.2.3.8 MC gateway server
The MC gateway server provides support for MCPTT interconnection services with
a partner MCPTT system in a different trust domain whilst providing topology
hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCPTT servers in the partner MCPTT
system without needing to expose the MCPTT servers in the primary MCPTT system
outside the trusted domain of the primary MCPTT system. It may be a role of
the MCPTT server described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 of the present document.
The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor
control signalling messages, and media between MCPTT servers within the MCPTT
system and the interconnected MCPTT system.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a
signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
### 7.4.3 Signalling control plane
The description of the signalling control plane is contained in the common
functional architecture to support MC services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16].
## 7.5 Reference points
### 7.5.1 General reference point principle
The protocols on any reference point that is exposed for MCPTT service
interoperability with other SIP core or other IMS entities in other systems
shall be compatible with the protocols defined for the corresponding reference
point defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
### 7.5.2 Application plane of MCPTT service
#### 7.5.2.1 General
The reference points for the application plane of MCPTT service are described
in the following subclauses.
#### 7.5.2.2 Reference point MCPTT-1 (between the MCPTT client and the MCPTT
server)
The MCPTT-1 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT client and the
MCPTT server, is used for MCPTT application signalling for establishing a
session in support of MCPTT. The MCPTT-1 reference point shall use the SIP-1
and SIP-2 reference points for transport and routing of SIP signalling. The
MCPTT-1 reference point may use the HTTP-1 and HTTP-2 reference points.
The TMGI is communicated between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT client using
the MCPTT-1 reference point.
Information that is reported to the MCPTT server from the MCPTT client shall
be configurable at the application layer. This interface may include the area
where a UE is currently located, described as ECGI of the serving and
neighbouring cell(s), MBMS SAIs, MBSFN Area ID. This information comes from
the broadcast by the local cell, e.g. from SIB1 and SIB15 (see 3GPP TS 36.331
[12]) as decoded by the UE.
NOTE: This reference point includes the GC1 reference point as described in
3GPP TS 23.468 [9]. It is assumed that the MCPTT server is performing the
function of GCS AS. While 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] does not specify GC1 it does
include high level descriptions of certain interactions on GC1, including
those relating to the availability of multicast delivery for the application
client. The MCPTT-1 reference point fulfils the requirements of the GC1
reference point for MCPTT.
Messages supported on this interface may also include the MCPTT server
providing the MCPTT client with information describing the mapping of
transport resources to specific group calls.
#### 7.5.2.3 Reference point MCPTT-2 (between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT
user database)
The MCPTT-2 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
MCPTT user database, is used by the MCPTT server to obtain information about a

and the EPS)
The MCPTT-5 reference point, which exists between the media distribution
function and the EPS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the media
distribution function of the MCPTT server to obtain unicast bearers with
appropriate QoS from the EPS. It utilises the Rx interface of the EPS
according to 3GPP TS 23.203 [4].
MCPTT-5 is not used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator do
not have an operational agreement for QoS control to be provided directly from
the MCPTT service provider domain.
MCPTT-5 may be used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator have
an operational agreement where QoS control is provided directly from the MCPTT
service provider domain.
NOTE: Any coordination between the P-CSCF use of Rx and the MCPTT server use
of Rx (via MCPTT-5) from the MCPTT service provider domain is not specified in
this release of this specification.

### 10.4.3 Authorized user remotely changes another MCPTT user\'s selected
MCPTT group -- mandatory mode
Procedure for an authorized user to change other MCPTT users\' selected MCPTT
group without requiring target user\'s approval is described in figure
10.4.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT client 1 has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically)
with the target MCPTT user\'s information and its group information, that the
selected MCPTT group of target MCPTT user 2 is allowed to be changed;
Figure 10.4.3-1: Remotely change MCPTT group selection -- mandatory mode
1\. When an authorized user changes other MCPTT users\' selected MCPTT group,
the MCPTT client 1 sends MCPTT group selection change request to the MCPTT
server. The information (i.e. target MCPTT ID(s), MCPTT group ID(s)) used to
set the requested MCPTT group as the selected MCPTT group of the target MCPTT
user shall be included.
2\. The MCPTT server shall check if the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to change
the target MCPTT user\'s selected MCPTT group. The MCPTT server shall perform
the affiliation relationship check based on the stored affiliation status.
3\. If the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to change the target MCPTT user\'s
selected MCPTT group, and if the target MCPTT user is not already affiliated
to the requested MCPTT group, the remotely change of affiliation procedures in
shall be performed (see subclause 10.8 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
4\. The MCPTT server then shall send the MCPTT group selection change
notification including the target user ID and the selected MCPTT group ID to
the MCPTT client 2.
5\. The group selection change response then returns to the MCPTT client 1.
6\. Target MCPTT client 2 are notified about the change of its selected MCPTT
group.
## 10.5 Pre-established session (on-network)
### 10.5.1 General
The MCPTT server may use one or more pre-established sessions as defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [16] for the following procedures for on-network:
\- Group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.3 and subclause 10.6.2.4);
\- Private calls (as specified in subclause 10.7.2.2 and subclause 10.7.2.3);
\- MCPTT emergency group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.1);
\- MCPTT imminent peril group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.2);
\- MCPTT emergency private calls (as specified in subclause 10.7.2.4); and
\- MCPTT emergency alerts (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.3).
For outgoing MCPTT call setup for a private call or a pre-arranged group call
using a pre-established session, an MCPTT UE uses SIP procedures to establish
the call.
For incoming MCPTT call setup for a pre-arranged group call using a pre-
established session, an MCPTT UE is notified of the start of the MCPTT call
using floor control messages.
For incoming MCPTT call setup for a private call using a pre-established
session, an MCPTT UE is notified of the start of the MCPTT call control using
SIP procedures in manual commencement mode and using floor control procedures
in automatic commencement mode.
An MCPTT UE can join an MCPTT chat group using a pre-established session by
sending a group join request using SIP procedures.
NOTE: A chat group call is started and notified using floor control messages
regardless of whether pre-established session is used.

#### 10.6.2.3 Group call within one MCPTT system
##### 10.6.2.3.1 Group call models
###### 10.6.2.3.1.1 Pre-arranged group call
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.1 General {#general-11 .H6}
A pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the group members. The
initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group
members being invited.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.2 Pre-arranged group call setup {#pre-arranged-group-call-
setup .H6}
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT
members of that group.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT group
call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCPTT users on client 1, client 2 and
client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the MCPTT group
management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A pre-arranged group is an MCPTT group that is pre-defined with MCPTT
group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the
group belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 are already registered for receiving MCPTT service and affiliated.
Optionally, they may have an activated functional alias to be used during the
group communication.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup
1\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT group call with a
selected group (identified by MCPTT group ID). The MC service user may select
a functional alias, which is displayed to other MC service users.
NOTE 1: MCPTT client 1 need not be aware of the affiliation status of other
MCPTT clients to the group while initiating the group call.
NOTE 2: The selected functional alias is not changed during the group call,
i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias until the group call is
released or the MCPTT client has left the group call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCPTT server via the
SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCPTT
group ID. The group call request also contains the MCPTT group ID and an SDP
offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters. If there is a floor
request to transmit, then the group call request contains an indication of an
implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MCPTT client 1 has selected
a functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional
alias.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to
initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized and the group call
is ongoing for that MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT server adds the requesting MCPTT
client 1 to the existing MCPTT group call and notifies the MCPTT client 1 that
the MCPTT group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCPTT server resolves
the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
NOTE 3: MCPTT server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration
data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally
cached on the MCPTT server then MCPTT server requests the user/group
configuration data from the MCPTT user database/group management server.
4\. MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters
contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group
call request via the SIP core towards the MCPTT clients of each of those
affiliated group members. MCPTT users are notified about the incoming group
call and the functional alias of the group call initiating user is displayed
if present. The MCPTT server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for
the call and the functional alias of the group call initiating MC service user
may be displayed.
5\. The receiving MCPTT clients accept the group call request, and a group
call response is sent to the group host MCPTT server. This response may
contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be
based on configuration. The response may also contain a functional alias of
the responding MC service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the
user) by the MCPTT server.
6\. MCPTT server sends the group call response including the selected media
parameters to the MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about
successful call establishment. The response may contain the functional alias,
which may be displayed
NOTE 4: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. If the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated
MCPTT group members, and the required MCPTT group members do not acknowledge
the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup
timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and
then notify the initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not
include all required members according to group policy. This notification may
be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during
the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT group call.
8\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media
plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor participant 2 and
floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g., MCPTT client 1
receives the floor granted information over the established media plane
assuming implicit floor control request from MCPTT client 1 while at the same
time floor participants at other MCPTT client\'s receive floor taken
information. MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is
available to send media, while the other MCPTT clients in the group call will
be receiving that media. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT
group, floor arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.
NOTE 5: The clients use the same functional alias within floor control
procedures as used during group call setup.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call {#release-pre-arranged-
group-call .H6}
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that
group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due
to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant
leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group
members are not present.
NOTE: The procedure for MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different
scenario and is not considered in this solution.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT
group call.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3
are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged
group call setup).
2\. MCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
3\. MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release ongoing session.
4\. MCPTT server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each
participant of the ongoing group call.
5\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
6\. MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards
the MCPTT server by sending a group call release response.
7\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor
control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is
terminated.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.4 Late entry pre-arranged group call {#late-entry-pre-
arranged-group-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server requesting a newly affiliated member or a
member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MCPTT system.
2\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on
an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional
aliases.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call
1\. MCPTT server determines that MCPTT client 1 which is newly affiliated or
coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group
call (late entry).
2\. MCPTT server generates group call request including the information such
as MCPTT service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request to
the MCPTT server), MCPTT group ID of the group invited to join, offer one or
more media types and sends towards the MCPTT client 1 via SIP core.
3\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is notified about the incoming group call.
4\. Upon MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 accepting the incoming group call
request, MCPTT client 1 sends the group call response including the selected
media types to the MCPTT server through the signalling path. If the incoming
group call request is rejected by the MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT server should
not resend the group call request. The group call response may also contain a
functional alias of MCPTT client 1.
5\. MCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT
users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT
client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may
be displayed.
6\. The floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to
MCPTT client1.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.5 Rejoining call {#rejoining-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client to rejoin an ongoing MCPTT group call (e.g.
coming back from out of coverage).
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on
an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional
aliases.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call
1\. MCPTT client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group
call, then the MCPTT client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including
the ongoing group call information. The group call rejoin request may contain
a functional alias of MCPTT client 1 as selected by the MC service user.
2\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT client 1 can rejoin the ongoing call
(e.g. based upon affiliation status) and checks the functional alias, if
present.
3\. MCPTT client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by
sending a group call rejoin response. If the ongoing group call is emergency
or imminent peril group call, the response shall contain emergency or imminent
peril indicator.
4\. MCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT
users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT
client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may
be displayed.
5\. The floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to
MCPTT client 1.
###### 10.6.2.3.1.2 Chat group call
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.1 General {#general-12 .H6}
In a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCPTT user individually joins a
group call without being invited. The establishment of a chat group
(restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client
initiating an MCPTT group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call
model. Restricted means that only users that have been configured as members
of the given group are allowed to join the group communications for the given
group.
Chat group join mechanism:
\- Each MCPTT client sends a group join request when the MCPTT user wants to
participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not
impact the MCPTT user\'s membership in the group; the MCPTT server will verify
that the MCPTT user is an authorized member of the group.)
\- The group join request may include a request to transmit. It is assumed
that the group join request will be delivered from MCPTT client to MCPTT
server using SIP.
\- The group join request is used to indicate to the MCPTT server that the
MCPTT user associated with the given MCPTT client wishes to participate (begin
to receive media) from the group.
\- The group join request shall cause the MCPTT server to generate an implicit
affiliation for the MCPTT user to the group, if the user is not already
affiliated to the group.
\- The group join request normally contains the information needed to
negotiate media parameters between MCPTT server and MCPTT client for the group
call. The group join request can take the form of a SIP invite.
\- A selected functional alias is not changed by a MCPTT client during the
whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCPTT client uses the
same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat
group call is released or the MCPTT client leaves the chat group call.
Subsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat
model:
\- Once an MCPTT client successfully joins a group call which is using the
chat model, the MCPTT client connects to the media plane for the call if the
call is currently ongoing.
\- If the MCPTT group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCPTT clients
on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between
floor control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCPTT client will
only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.
\- If the newly joined MCPTT user wishes to transmit media (start or re-start
the call) to the affiliated users of the group using the chat model, then the
MCPTT client using its associated floor control participant would follow a
normal floor control procedure for requesting the floor.
\- Since subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using floor
control signalling, additional SIP signalling messages may not be required for
subsequent call stop and start.
\- Each request to transmit from an MCPTT user could be viewed as a new
instance of a group call for the given group when the floor idle timer expires
and no media is present for an extended time.
\- The MCPTT server may tear down the media plane between successive group
calls using the chat model, or the MCPTT server may allow the media plane to
remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on
resources.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.2 Chat group call setup {#chat-group-call-setup .H6}
MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCPTT service
provider in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the
group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users
(MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to
use the MCPTT service.
2\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated
functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call
communication. No call is currently in progress for the group.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCPTT chat group call
1\. MCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group. This
may include a request to transmit.
1a. MCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the
desired group. It contains the MCPTT user\'s MCPTT ID, the MCPTT client media
parameters and optionally a functional alias. If there is a request to
transmit, then the group joint request contains an indication of an implicit
floor request.
1b. The MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates
an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the
group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group
by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.8.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16]).
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
1c. The MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCPTT server
selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.
2\. If MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the
media plane (if not already established) for the call. The associated floor
participants for MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 use the floor control
procedure to initiate the call. E.g., the floor participant for MCPTT client 1
receives the MCPTT floor grant. The corresponding floor participants for MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 receive the MCPTT floor taken. If present, the
functional alias of MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are
displayed where appropriate.
3\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the
duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used
for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are
affiliated. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT group, floor
arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat group call {#release-chat-group-call .H6}
The procedure describes the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing
MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least
one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to hang time expiry, last
participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or
the number of affiliated MCPTT group members is below the minimum number
permitted.
NOTE 1: The procedure for an MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different
procedure.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT server
initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT group call.
The following precondition applies:
\- A group call is ongoing between MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1: Release chat group call
1\. MCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
2\. MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release the ongoing session.
3\. MCPTT server sends a group call release request towards each participant
of the ongoing group call.
NOTE 2: The group call release request can also be sent over SIP signalling on
the signalling plane.
4\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. Optionally the MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, may
send a group call release response to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: The MCPTT client can send group call release response when the group
call release request is sent using a unicast bearer.
6\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 release the floor control and media
plane resources associated with the group call that is released. Successful
release of the group call does not affect the status of affiliation of any of
the clients.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.4 Late entry chat group call {#late-entry-chat-group-call
.H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.4-1 are those for the MCPTT server
requesting a group member that is newly affiliated or coming back from out of
coverage to join an ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT users using MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are in an ongoing call.
Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional aliases.

6\. Floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to MCPTT
client 1.
##### 10.6.2.3.2 Exiting group call due to de-affiliation
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT server requesting a newly de-affiliated member to leave an
ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call.

Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.1-1 illustrates the originating side group call involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems. It considers the scenario for group
hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group regroup. The protocol
followed may be SIP.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT user belongs to an MCPTT group hosted by the primary MCPTT
system.
3\. A temporary group is formed by authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher by the
group regroup procedure (subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]) and
identified via a temporary MCPTT group ID.
4\. The MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups belonging to the
temporary group are affiliated to participate in a group call for the
temporary group.
5\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group on the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers

Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.1-1: Group call setup involving temporary groups from
multiple MCPTT systems (originating)
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the group and is
where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group. If the
group call is for a temporary group formed by the group regroup procedure, the
MCPTT group ID will be a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information
(either from group management server or itself) including the constituent
MCPTT groups\' identities, accessible group members list of the constituent
groups, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates directly a call
request to the accessible group members using the detailed user information
and/or location information. The group members upon receipt of the call
request may accept or reject the call.
4\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group
members\' information of the constituent group belonging to the partner MCPTT
system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system
initiates a group call request message to the MCPTT server of the partner
MCPTT system with the target group\'s MCPTT group ID information.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system further initiates a call
request to the constituent group\'s members as described in step 3.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success or
failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the affiliated MCPTT user upon
receiving responses to the call requests sent to members of primary and
partner MCPTT systems. The group call response message will consist of the
success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a
failure.
NOTE: The group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions
to proceed with the call.
8\. Upon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the
group members from constituent groups of multiple MCPTT servers.
##### 10.6.2.4.1.1.2 Group call setup procedure -- terminating side {#group-
call-setup-procedure-terminating-side .H6}
The procedure in figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.2-1 illustrates the terminating side
group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems. It considers the
scenario for group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group regroup.
The protocol followed may be SIP.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.2-1: Group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems (terminating)
1\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system sends the group call request

the group call request message to the MCPTT client(s) based on the user
affiliation.
3\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system forwards the group call
request message to MCPTT client(s). The MCPTT server indicates whether
acknowledgement is required for the call.
4\. The MCPTT user is notified about the incoming MCPTT group call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client(s) accept the group call request and a group
call response message is sent to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system.
This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending
acknowledgement may be based on configuration.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system forwards the group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system (i.e. group
hosting MCPTT server for the group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems).
###### 10.6.2.4.1.2 Group call release
The procedure focuses on the case where the group host MCPTT server releases
an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems, since at least one of the
release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.
NOTE: The scenario of MCPTT user leaving the group call is not considered in
this procedure.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MCPTT server releasing
an ongoing MCPTT group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system is controlling the group call
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 belongs to group of the MCPTT server of the primary
MCPTT system and the MCPTT client 2 and client 3 belong to the groups of the
MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system.

of the ongoing group call and generates group call release message to release
ongoing session.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call
release request message via SIP core towards each accessible participant of
the ongoing group call (3a). The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may
not have access to group members\' information of the constituent group
belonging to a partner MCPTT system. For such group members, the MCPTT server
of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call release request message
(3b) to the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system(s) with the target
group\'s MCPTT group ID information. The MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT
system(s) further initiate group call release request messages (3c-1, 3c-2) to
its group\'s users.
4\. The MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. The MCPTT client(s) receiving the group call release request messages
provide group call release response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT
system. The MCPTT client(s) of the MCPTT users belonging to partner MCPTT
system(s) route their responses via the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT
system(s).
6\. The MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is
released.

identified via a temporary MCPTT group ID.
4\. The MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups belonging to the
temporary group are affiliated to participate in a group call for the
temporary group.
5\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group on the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers
of the partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.4.2-1: Group call involving temporary group formed by group
regroup from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call requestmessage with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the temporary
group formed by group regroup procedure, and is also where the authorized
MCPTT user/dispatcher has created the temporary group. The MCPTT group ID will
be a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information
(either from group management server or itself) including the constituent
MCPTT groups\' identities, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may interrogate the MCPTT
server of the partner MCPTT system for the affiliated group 2 members.
4\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system responds with a list of the
affiliated group members of group 2.
NOTE 1: Steps 3 and 4 do not occur if the constituent groups\' information is
available and up to date at primary MCPTT system due to the procedure for
temporary group formation as defined in subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16].
5\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system verifies the commencement
policies of the temporary group, and initiates a call invitation or call
notification to the affiliated members of groups 1 and 2.
6\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides group call response
message to the MCPTT UE of authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher upon receiving
responses to the call invitations sent to members of primary and partner MCPTT
systems. The group call response will consist of the success or failure result
and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. Upon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the
group members belonging to constituent groups of multiple MCPTT systems.
NOTE 2: MCPTT clients are generally aware that their (constituent) groups have
been regrouped (e.g., see subclause 10.1.5.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]); however,
if not, the partner MCPTT server of the constituent group can also respond to
a group call request with a redirection response, such as \"moved
temporarily\" that includes the group URI of the temporary group formed by
group regroup procedure.

#### 10.6.2.5 Broadcast group call
##### 10.6.2.5.1 General
A broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCPTT user
expects no response from the other MCPTT users, so that when his transmission
is complete, so is the call.
##### 10.6.2.5.2 Common broadcast group call procedure
The group-broadcast group and the regrouped group are similar in structure (a
collection of groups). Similarly the user-broadcast group and the pre-arranged
group (a collection of users) are similar in structure. Only the call
originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call and the
broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete, unless the
call originator is overridden.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2-1 illustrates the common procedure both for group-broadcast
group call and user-broadcast group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members of a group-broadcast
group/user-broadcast group.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2-1: Broadcast group call
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup
procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling
procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause
10.6.2 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call indicator.
NOTE 1: Broadcast group call applies to both pre-arranged and chat group call
model. In the chat group call model case, the broadcast group call setup
procedure is done by floor control signalling.
2\. MCPTT client 1 starts to transmit media.
NOTE 2: Only the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call, unless overridden.
NOTE 3: A broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has
priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A
broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over
group calls on its subordinate groups.
3\. If the media transmission from call originating MCPTT user is complete,
the broadcast group call is released.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.1 Group-broadcast group call procedure
The group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not a set of MCPTT
users. The group-broadcast group is also defined with a hierarchy. It is
expected that the MCPTT user that originates the group-broadcast group call is
the only one transmitting media during the group-broadcast group call and that
the group-broadcast group call is terminated when the transmission is
complete. However, if the override feature is enabled, then the call
originator may be overridden.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
establishment.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members
is a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast
group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).
2\. The group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT group call that is not
an MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The call initiator of the group-broadcast group is a member of another
group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a subordinate group of the group-
broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group X as a
subordinate group).
4\. The group-broadcast group and its subordinated groups are defined in the
same group management server and servered by the same MCPTT server.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.1-1: Group-broadcast group call
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 3 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. The MCPTT server needs to resolve the group-broadcast group ID into its
subordinate groups in order to contact the affiliated MCPTT users of those
subordinate groups.
4\. The MCPTT server then needs to consider any on-going group calls on those
subordinate groups because this may effect the behaviour for what happens
next. In this case a group call exists on a subordinate group. Thus the MCPTT
users involved in the group call on this subordinate group.
5\. Optionally the on-going group call on a subordinate group may be
terminated in which case the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 need to be sent
a Group call release request.
6\. The MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 then notify their users of the group
call release request.
7\. The MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group call release
request by sending a group call release response.
8\. A group-braodcast group call request is sent to both the MCPTT client 1
and the MCPTT client 2.
9\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users of the incoming
group-broadcast group call.
10\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group-broadcast group
call request by sending a group-broadcast group call response.
11\. The MCPTT server responds to MCPTT client 3 (the call initiator) that the
group-broadcast group call has been established by sending a group-broadcast
group call response.
12\. The MCPTT client 3 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting
using the group-broadcast group call resources.
Resources are now available for the transmission from MCPTT client 3 to MCPTT
client 1 and MCPTT client 2. Once the user of MCPTT cleint 3 completes
transmitting, the group-broadcast group call is releases as are the resources.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.2 Group-broadcast group call procedure when a subordinate
group has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call
The group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not MCPTT users. The
affiliated MCPTT group members of a subordinate group with an on-going MCPTT
emergency group call are not interrupted by a group-broadcast group call.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
when a subordinate group has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
members is a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-
broadcast group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).
2\. The group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The call initiator (user of MCPTT client 3) of the group-broadcast group
is a member of another group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a
subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast
group was defined with group X as a subordinate group).
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.2-1: Group-broadcast group call when an emergency group call
is on-going in one of the subordinate groups
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 3 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. The MCPTT server needs to resolve the group-broadcast group ID into its
subordinate groups in order to contact the affiliated MCPTT group members of
those subordinate groups.
4\. The MCPTT server then considers any on-going group calls on those
subordinate groups (e.g. A) because this may effect the behaviour for what
happens next. In this case an emergency group call exists on a subordinate
group.
NOTE: Not shown - The group-braodcast group call request is sent to the MCPTT
clients of the MCPTT users who are affiliated members of any other subordinate
groups of the group-broadcast group being set up
5\. The MCPTT server responds to the call initiator that the group-broadcast
group call has been established.
6\. The MCPTT client 3 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting
using the group-broadcast group call resources.
Resources are now available for the transmission from MCPTT client 3 to the
MCPTT clients (not shown) of other subordinate groups (i.e., not A). Once the
user of MCPTT cleint 3 completes transmitting, the group-broadcast group call
is releases as are the resources.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.3 Group-broadcast group call release procedure
When the call originator has completed transmitting, the group-broadcast group
call is terminated and resources releasaed.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
release.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An on-going group-broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2, and MCPTT client 3 exists.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.3-1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 3 finished transmitting.
2\. A group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the MCPTT server
of the group-broadcast group.
3\. The MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 of the group-
broadcast group\'s subordinate groups are sent a group-broadcast group call
release request
4\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notfy their users that the group-
broadcast group call has ended.
5\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to confirm the release of the
group-broadcast group call by sending a group-broadcast group call release
response.
6\. The MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response
indicating to the intitiator that the call is now terminated.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.4 Server-initiated broadcast group call release procedure
In a broadcast group call, when the call originator has completed
transmitting, the MCPTT client releases the floor. Upon receiving the floor
release message the MCPTT server then determines if the broadcast call should
be released.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for server-initiated broadcast
group call release.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An on-going broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2,
and MCPTT client 3 exists.
2\. MCPTT client 3 is transmitting.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.4-1: Server-initiated broadcast group call release
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 3 finished transmitting.
2\. MCPTT client 3 sends a Floor release message to the MCPTT server of the
group.
3\. The MCPTT Server determines that the group is a broadcast group and
decides that the call should be released.
NOTE 1: Whether the MCPTT server uses the Broadcast indicator in the
originating group call request message or uses the configured Group call hang
timer to determine whether the call should be released is left to
implementation.
4\. The MCPTT server sends a Group call release request to MCPTT clients 1, 2,
and 3.
5\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users that the group call
has ended.
6\. MCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3 respond to confirm the release of the group call
by sending a group call release response.
NOTE 2: If the group call release request is sent from the MCPTT server via
MBMS, no response is expected from the MCPTT clients.
##### 10.6.2.5.3 Temporary group -- broadcast group call procedure
NOTE: This procedure has no security solution in 3GPP TS 33.180 [19].
Figure 10.6.2.5.3-1 illustrates the procedure for temporary group-broadcast
group call procedure. The protocol used may be SIP.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MCPTT system.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system is where the authorized MCPTT
user/dispatcher created the temporary group.
4\. Other groups in the temporary group -- broadcast group may belong to
partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.5.3-1: Temporary group -- broadcast group call
1\. The MCPTT client of authorized user initiates a group call with multiple
groups from primary and partner MCPTT systems. A group call request message
with the MCPTT group IDs (group1\'s MCPTT group ID, group2\'s MCPTT group ID)
is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which is where the
authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forms the temporary group
with the groups\' information received. It resolves the MCPTT group IDs and
identifies the appropriate MCPTT server responsible for the groups. It further
triggers a temporary group -- broadcast group call via a group call request
message to the affiliated group members of group1\'s MCPTT group ID of the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: The temporary group information is not notified to the group members
of the constituent groups.
3\. A group call request message is further initiated with the MCPTT server of
the partner MCPTT system for group2\'s MCPTT group ID.
4\. Upon receiving the group call request message from the MCPTT server of the
primary MCPTT system, the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system initiates a
call invitation to their affiliated group members. The group members upon
receipt of the invitation may accept or reject the call. Alternatively, the
MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system notifies the group members via a
notification message containing the group call session identity information.
Upon receipt of the notification message, the group members may perform a late
call entry.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success
or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.
6\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the authorized MCPTT user upon
receiving response to the corresponding group call request with the MCPTT
server of the partner MCPTT system. The group call response will consist of
the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of
failure.
NOTE 2: The group call response message is triggered depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. Upon successful group call setup, a group call is established amongst the
multiple group members from primary and partner MCPTT systems. The call
originating MCPTT user starts transmitting media to other group call
participants.
NOTE 3: Only the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call.
NOTE 4: A broadcast group call transmitted on a temporary group-broadcast
group has priority over group calls on its subordinate groups.
8\. At the completion of the media transmission, the broadcast group call is
released, and the temporary group -- broadcast group is torn down.
#### 10.6.2.6 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 10.6.2.6.1 MCPTT emergency group call
###### 10.6.2.6.1.1 MCPTT emergency group call commencement
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
emergency group call with the affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. An
MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state gains elevated access privilege for
all of the MCPTT user\'s mission critical applications.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency
group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on
MCPTT group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated via provisioning as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1: MCPTT emergency group call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency group call.
MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT group call request towards the MCPTT server.
The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The MCPTT server
records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT emergency
group call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. Once an MCPTT emergency
call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress
emergency state until cancelled. If configured to send an MCPTT emergency
alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call, the request also contains
an indication that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be initiated. The request
may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and if
authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 3: Successive calls during the MCPTT group\'s in-progress emergency state
will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an
indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming MCPTT group call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency group call request. For
a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.
NOTE 4: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor
participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g.,
MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established
media plane, while the other MCPTT client\'s receive floor taken information.
MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send
media, while the other MCPTT clients in the MCPTT emergency group call will be
receiving that media. MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call
except those that are also in the MCPTT emergency state.
###### 10.6.2.6.1.2 MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group call
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
an MCPTT group call to an MCPTT emergency group call while the MCPTT group
call is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT
group to an MCPTT emergency group call.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. An MCPTT group call is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert when upgrading an MCPTT emergency group call.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1: MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group
call
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCPTT client
1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the MCPTT group to an
in-progress emergency state by sending an MCPTT emergency group call request.
If configured to send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency
upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be
initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all or
selected participants in the MCPTT group call that receive the communication
over unicast.
NOTE 2: The determination of the selected participants whose bearers have to
be upgraded is left to implementation.
4\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the
originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
5\. MCPTT users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT
group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT group emergency request. For a
multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.
NOTE 3: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT
group call, which has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency group call.
MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are
also in the MCPTT emergency state.
###### 10.6.2.6.1.3 MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
NOTE 1: In Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this
subclause is \"MCPTT emergency group call cancel\".
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client cancels an MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a
group.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: The end of the MCPTT emergency group call does not cancel the MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an
authorized user using this procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. MCPTT group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized
bearer support.
5\. MCPTT client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the
group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1: MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT in-progress emergency
group state cancel.
NOTE 3: An MCPTT user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCPTT group can also be authorised to cancel the MCPTT emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
request to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 4: When MCPTT emergency alerts are in effect together with an MCPTT in-
progress emergency group state on the same MCPTT group, the MCPTT emergency
alert can, under some circumstances be cancelled at the same time. In that
case, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request carries an
indication that the alert is also being cancelled.
3\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from
group management server.
4\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the emergency
in-progress state of the MCPTT group.
5\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
request to the MCPTT group members.
6\. MCPTT group members are notified of the MCPTT in-progress emergency group
state cancel.
7\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT in-progress emergency group
state cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT in-progress
emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
8\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
response to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT in-progress emergency group
state cancel. If the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request
(in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCPTT client 1 resets
its local emergency status.
NOTE 5: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
##### 10.6.2.6.2 MCPTT imminent peril group call
###### 10.6.2.6.2.1 MCPTT imminent peril group call commencement
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is initiating
an imminent peril group call for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT
members of that MCPTT group. This procedure will gain elevated access
privilege for the MCPTT client if it is not already in that state. The access
privilege for other applications will not necessarily be affected.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an imminent peril
group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on
MCPTT group management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril
communications.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for imminent
peril behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1: MCPTT imminent peril group call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an imminent peril group call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT imminent peril group call request towards
the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the in-progress
imminent peril. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that
initiated the imminent peril group call until the in-progress imminent peril
state is cancelled. Once an imminent peril group call has been initiated, the
MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the imminent
peril group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of imminent peril group calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and
if authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 2: Successive calls during the in-progress imminent peril state will all
receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the imminent peril group call request towards the MCPTT
clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request contains
an indication of the in-progress imminent peril.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming imminent peril call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the imminent peril call request.
For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful imminent peril call establishment.
NOTE 3: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the imminent peril call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor
participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g.,
MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established
media plane, while the other MCPTT clients receive floor taken information.
MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send
media, while the other MCPTT clients in the imminent peril call will be
receiving that media.
###### 10.6.2.6.2.2 Imminent peril group call upgrade
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
an MCPTT group call to an imminent peril group call while the MCPTT group call
is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT

request. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
4\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members.
5\. MCPTT users are notified of the in-progress imminent peril state of the
MCPTT group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT imminent peril group
call request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.
NOTE: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT
group call, which has been transformed into an imminent peril group call.
###### 10.6.2.6.2.3 MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state cancel
NOTE 1: In Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this
subclause is \"MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel\".
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user cancels an
MCPTT group\'s in-progress imminent peril state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT group\'s in-progress
imminent peril state.
NOTE 2: The end of the imminent peril call does not cancel the MCPTT group\'s
in-progress imminent peril state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized
user using this procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT
group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The MCPTT group is in an in-progress imminent peril state and has
prioritized bearer support.
4\. MCPTT group members have been notified about the MCPTT group\'s in-
progress imminent peril state.
5\. MCPTT client 1 previously initiated the in-progress imminent peril.
Figure 10.6.2.6.2.3-1: MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an in-progress imminent peril
group state cancel.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel request to the MCPTT server.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the in-
progress imminent peril group state.
4\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from
group management server.
5\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT imminent peril group state cancel request
to the MCPTT group members.
6\. MCPTT group members are notified of the in-progress imminent peril group
state cancel.
7\. The receiving MCPTT group members send the MCPTT in-progress imminent
peril group state cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT
in-progress imminent peril group state cancel request. For a multicast
scenario, these acknowledgements are not set.
8\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel response to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT in-progress imminent
peril group state cancel request.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
##### 10.6.2.6.3 MCPTT emergency alert
Editor\'s note: whether the following procedures for emergency alert
initiation and emergency alert cancel remain in this specification is FFS.
###### 10.6.2.6.3.1 MCPTT emergency alert initiation
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
emergency alert unicast signalling for communicating the alert with the
affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT
emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user\'s
mission critical applications. This procedure will place the MCPTT client in
the MCPTT emergency state if the MCPTT client is not already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.3.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group
management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 is affiliated with one or more MCPTT groups.
4\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the currently selected group.
5\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 may not have carried out an explicit
affiliation procedure with the MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency
group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.3.1-1 MCPTT emergency alert
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert. MCPTT
client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained
by the MCPTT client until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to send an MCPTT emergency alert
request to the MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency alerts for the indicated MCPTT group.
4\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency alert response to the MCPTT
user 1 to confirm the MCPTT emergency alert request. MCPTT group calls made to
this MCPTT group by the MCPTT client 1 will be sent as emergency calls until
the emergency state on the MCPTT client 1 is cancelled.
6\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency alert request towards the MCPTT
clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The MCPTT emergency
alert request message shall contain the following information: Location, MCPTT
ID and MCPTT group ID (i.e., MCPTT user\'s selected MCPTT group or dedicated
MCPTT emergency group, as per MCPTT group configuration) and the MCPTT user\'s
mission critical organization name. If in step 2, the MCPTT client 1 does not
include the location information in the MCPTT emergency alert request to the
MCPTT server, the MCPTT server acquires the location of user at the MCPTT
client 1 from the location management server. If the location is included in
step 2, then the MCPTT server acquires the location from MCPTT client 1.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency.
8\. For a unicast MCPTT emergency alert, the receiving MCPTT clients send the
MCPTT emergency alert response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT
emergency alert. For a multicast MCPTT emergency alert, these acknowledgements
are not sent unless the MCPTT clients have been configured to do so.
9\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency state.
NOTE 4: Sending the emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
NOTE 5: The MCPTT client 1 need not initiate a group call. For example, the
MCPTT client can be configured to only allow alerts or the MCPTT user can
choose not to make an MCPTT emergency group call.
###### 10.6.2.6.3.2 MCPTT emergency alert cancel
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client has initiated an MCPTT
emergency alert and entered the emergency state, and wishes to cancel the
alert, informing the MCPTT server and other group members of this
cancellation. By doing so, the MCPTT client may also request the cancellation
of the in-progress emergency state of the group.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group
management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MCPTT
emergency alert.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 is still in the emergency state.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has affiliated with the MCPTT group
designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.3.2-1 MCPTT emergency alert cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert cancel.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT emergency alert cancel request carries an indication to also
request that the in-progress emergency is to be cancelled. The MCPTT server
can accept or deny the request to cancel the in-progress emergency state of
the group as a whole, separately from accepting or denying the request to
cancel the emergency alert at MCPTT client 1. Additionally, an authorized user
can cancel either or both the in-progress emergency state of the group and the
initiator\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to send an MCPTT emergency alert
cancel to the MCPTT group to which MCPTT client 1 had previously sent the
emergency alert.
3\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency alert cancel response to the
MCPTT client 1 to confirm the MCPTT emergency alert cancel request. MCPTT
client 1 resets its emergency state.
5\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency alert cancel request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members.
6\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency alert cancellation of
MCPTT client 1.
7\. For a unicast MCPTT emergency alert cancel, the receiving MCPTT clients
send the MCPTT emergency alert cancel response to the MCPTT server to
acknowledge the MCPTT emergency alert cancel. For a multicast MCPTT emergency
alert cancel, these acknowledgements are not sent unless the MCPTT clients
have been configured to do so.
###### 10.6.2.6.3.3 Entering MCPTT emergency alert area
Editor\'s Note: MCPTT emergency alert triggered by MCPTT client locally which
stores the predefined area is another possible solution. How to define this
procedure and how to combine the two solutions is FFS.
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT service emergency alert to be
triggered when an MCPTT UE moves into a predefined area. This procedure will
place the MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state if the MCPTT client is not
already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.3.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server triggers an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group
management server.
NOTE: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. An area in which the MCPTT client should send emergency alert is pre-
defined in MCPTT server.
Figure 10.6.2.6.3.3-1 Entering MCPTT emergency alert area
1\. MCPTT server acquires the latest location information of user at MCPTT
client 1 from location management server as described in subclause 10.9.3.6 in
3GPP TS 23.280[16].
2\. MCPTT server checks whether MCPTT client 1 has moved into a predefined
area.
3\. If so, MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency alert area trigger to MCPTT
client 1 to notify that it has moved in to the area in potential danger.
4\. MCPTT client 1 notifies the MCPTT user about the MCPTT emergency alert
area.
5\. MCPTT client 1 initiates MCPTT emergency alert procedure as described in
10.6.2.6.3.1.
#### 10.6.2.7 Location of current talker
Figure 10.6.2.7-1 shows the high level procedure to for MCPTT service to
provide the location information about the current talking user to all the
receiving MCPTT users.
Precondition:
1\. There is on-going group call involving MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is the current talking user.
> 3\. MCPTT server has obtained the location information of MCPTT client 1
> according to subclause 10.9 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
Figure 10.6.2.7-1: Providing location information of the current talker
1\. MCPTT client 1 gets the floor to transmit voice media.
2\. MCPTT server checks the privacy policy (authorisation to provide location
information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking, as defined in Annex
A.3) of the current talking MCPTT user to decide if the location information
of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other MCPTT users on the call. MCPTT
server acquires the location of the current talker from the location
management server as described in subclause 10.9.3.6 in 3GPP TS 23.280[16].
Optionally, the MCPTT server acquires the location of the current talker
directly from the floor request received from MCPTT client 1 in step 1.
> 3\. MCPTT server provides the location information of MCPTT client 1 to
> MCPTT client 2. Optionally, the location information may be provided in the
> floor taken message sent to MCPTT client 2 according to subclause
> 10.9.1.3.1.

##### 10.6.2.8.2 Void
##### 10.6.2.8.3 Void
### 10.6.3 Off-network group call
#### 10.6.3.1 General
Off-network group calls can use pre-defined configuration information provided
to MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call or configuration
information that is transmitted to MCPTT clients during group call setup or
late entry procedures.
If off-network group configuration information is pre-defined (e.g. codec to
be used) and provided to the MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call
(e.g. as part of group metadata), the MCPTT client will be able to participate
in the off-network group call without needing to follow the group call setup
or late joining procedures as they will be able to receive the media and
signalling without the need for the announcement or invitation.
If off-network group configuration information is not pre-defined or provided,
call parameters need to be transmitted to MCPTT clients via group call
announcement or invitation.
NOTE: When the MCPTT client receives a message that is not addressed to either
its MCPTT ID or to any MCPTT group of which the MCPTT client is an affiliated
group member, the MCPTT client ignores the message.

#### 10.6.3.3 Group call setup
The flow in figure 10 6.3.3-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for
MCPTT group call establishment for off-network. The procedure describes how an
MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT group call with other MCPTT client within the
off-network radio coverage and how the group call is established.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that information for ProSe direct communications
corresponding to the mappings of MCPTT group ID and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
(see subclause 8.1.3.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]) are pre-configured;
\- It is assumed that a multicast IP address and port for the call setup
signalling are pre-configured;
\- All messages exchanged between the MCPTT clients for the MCPTT group
follows ProSe direct communications as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]; and
\- The MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1, 2 and 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.3.3-1: Off-network group call setup
1\. MCPTT client 1 as the group call originator sends group call announcement
message to the group. This message contains the following parameters such as
MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity, media type, media codec,
multicast port number for media, port number for floor control protocol,
period of group call announcement, and any encryption key for the media
encryption if needed, and optionally confirm mode indication.
NOTE 1: The group call announcement includes at least one common set of
parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will
not be prohibited for the better user experience.
NOTE 2: By using the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID mapping with the MCPTT group ID,
ProSe layer ensures that the messages sent for the corresponding MCPTT group
are only received by its group\'s members.
2\. MCPTT client 2, 3 join the group call. The MCPTT clients configure the
parameters for media delivery by making use of the received parameters in
group call announcement.
3\. MCPTT client 2, 3 may send the response message to the group when the
group call announcement from originator includes confirm mode indication. This
message contains MCPTT ID.
4\. MCPTT client 2, 3 recognize the group call originator through the group
call announcement and MCPTT client 1 checks the participants of the group call
through the received response message.
NOTE 3: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement
message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.
NOTE 4: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
group call announcement.
#### 10.6.3.4 Passive join to group call
Figure 10 6.3.4-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for the passive
MCPTT client to join the on-going MCPTT group call. The passive MCPTT client
does not initiate to establish an MCPTT group call, but receives the group
call announcement to be transferred periodically. When receiving the
announcement message with parameters for media transfer, the passive MCPTT
client configures the parameter to receive the voice and joins the announced
MCPTT group call.
This procedure happens after the MCPTT group call is established. The group
call announcement including the parameters for the media transfer has been
performed periodically, in order for the MCPTT client later to join the MCPTT
group call.
The MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the MCPTT group call lately.
Figure 10.6.3.4-1: Passive join to group call
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the group call announcement message. This message
contains parameters such as MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity,
media type, media codec, multicast port number for media, port number for
floor control protocol, any encryption key for the media encryption if needed,
and optionally confirm mode indication.
NOTE 1: The group call announcement includes at least one common set of
parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will
not be prohibited for the better user experience.
2\. MCPTT client 4 configures the parameters for media transfer by making use
of the received parameters in group call announcement.
3\. MCPTT client 4 may send the response message to the group when the
periodic group call announcement includes confirm mode indication. This
message contains the MCPTT ID.
4\. MCPTT client 1, 2, 3 check through the received response message that the
MCPTT client 4 joins the group call. The MCPTT client 2, as the floor control
arbitrator, may send a floor taken message.
NOTE 2: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement
message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.
NOTE 3: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
group call announcement.
#### 10.6.3.5 Join to ongoing group call when new entry member initiates the
call with on-going group call id
Figure 10 6.3.5-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client
to join an on-going MCPTT group call. When entering the coverage of on-going
group call, new MCPTT client may send group call setup announcement message
with on-going group call id. Upon receiving the group call setup announcement,
the MCPTT client as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call sends
parameters for media transfer to the newly entered MCPTT client (entrant) to
join the on-going MCPTT group call. When receiving the parameters for media
transfer of on-going MCPTT group call, the MCPTT client configures the
parameters to receive the voice and becomes the participant of the on-going
MCPTT group call.
Figure 10.6.3.5-1: Late entry join when receiving MCPTT group call
announcement with on-going MCPTT group ID
1\. MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.
2\. The new entry of MCPTT client 4 sends group call setup announcement with
MCPTT group call id.
3\. MCPTT client 1 as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call acknowledges
that on-going MCPTT group call exists with MCPTT group call id sent by MCPTT
client 4 and sends parameters for media transfer to MCPTT client 4.
4\. MCPTT client 4 may send a response message.
5\. MCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for media delivery in the on-going
MCPTT group call.
MCPTT client 4 joins and becomes participants of the on-going MCPTT group
call.
#### 10.6.3.6 Immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group call
Figure 10.6.3.6-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client
to immediately join an on-going MCPTT group call. Upon the detection of a new
entrant, the MCPTT client that is the current talker (floor arbitrator)
immediately sends the group call announcement. When receiving the group call
announcement message with parameters for media transfer, that MCPTT client
configures the parameters to receive the voice and joins the on-going MCPTT
group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is on-going group call. MCPTT client 1 is the current talker and
therefore the floor arbitrator.
Figure 10.6.3.6-1: Immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group
call
1\. MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.
2\. The entry of MCPTT client 4 is detected by the current participants.
3\. Since MCPTT client 1 is the current talker (floor arbitrator), MCPTT
client 1 immediately sends the group call announcement with the call
parameters to the group.
4\. MCPTT client 4 may send a response message.
5\. MCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for the group call.
6\. All participants are now considered part of the on-going group call.
#### 10.6.3.7 Group call release due to inactivity
If the on-going MCPTT group call is inactive for a specific duration, the
participating MCPTT clients release the MCPTT group call by themselves.
NOTE: Inactivity time can be set according to the policy of MCPTT service
provider.
#### 10.6.3.8 Broadcast group call
Group call on group-broadcast group and user-broadcast group are handled
without distinction in off-network.
Figure 10 6.3.8.1-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for broadcast
group call in off-network.
Figure 10.6.3.8.1-1: Broadcast group call in off-network
1\. An authorized MCPTT client 1 initiates broadcast group call setup as
described in subclause 10.6.3.3. The group call announcement message includes
the indication of broadcast group call.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 initiating broadcast group call starts to transmit
media.
NOTE: Other clients of group member are not allowed to transmit media in
broadcast group call.
3\. The broadcast group call is released as described in subclause 10.6.3.7.
#### 10.6.3.9 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 10.6.3.9.1 Emergency group call
The off-network emergency group call is a special case of off-network (non-
emergency) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3, 10.6.3.4,
10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to the
aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT emergency group calls:
\- As a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency call has previously
been provisioned with an MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
The MCPTT client initiates MCPTT emergency group calls on this group.
Alternatively, the MCPTT client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected MCPTT group.
\- The group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group
call is to be an MCPTT emergency call regardless of whether or not the MCPTT
client is in call. Group call participants learn of the MCPTT group\'s in-
progress emergency state from the indication.
\- Every call initiated by the MCPTT client will be an emergency call while
the MCPTT client is in MCPTT emergency state.
\- The MCPTT client enters the MCPTT emergency state when initiating an MCPTT
emergency call or MCPTT emergency alert. Only the MCPTT user of the MCPTT
client can clear the client\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
\- The MCPTT group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the call
ends.
\- The MCPTT user who initiated an emergency call, or upgraded a group call to
an emergency call, or an authorized user, may cancel the in-progress emergency
state with an MCPTT emergency group state cancel message. The message is sent
to the call participants.
\- When the MCPTT group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state, every
client returns its default value of Prose Per Packet Priority.
\- An MCPTT group call in-progress is upgraded to an emergency group call when
the periodic group call announcement contains the emergency indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency
state of MCPTT group call.
\- An MCPTT group call becoming an emergency group call does not affect the
state of other MCPTT call(s) in the client.
\- The MCPTT group remains in the in-progress emergency state until the
emergency group call ends or the in-progress emergency state is cancelled.
##### 10.6.3.9.2 MCPTT imminent peril
The off-network imminent peril group call is a special case of off-network
(non-imminent peril) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3,
10.6.3.4, 10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to
the aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT imminent peril calls:
\- As a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril call has
previously an MCPTT group to be used as the MCPTT imminent peril group. The
MCPTT client initiates MCPTT imminent peril group calls on this group.
\- The group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group
call is to be an MCPTT imminent peril call. Group call participants learn of
the MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril condition from the indication.
\- The MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled
when the call ends.
\- The originating MCPTT user of the in-progress imminent peril or an
authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an MCPTT
imminent peril group cancel. The message is sent to the call participants.
\- When the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril is no longer in the in-progress
imminent peril state, every MCPTT client returns its bearer to the priority it
had prior to the in-progress imminent peril state.
\- An MCPTT upgrade to imminent peril call is used to upgrade an MCPTT group
call already in progress. The message is sent to all call participants so that
they are aware of the in-progress imminent peril.
\- The bearer is upgraded by all participants for the MCPTT group call already
in progress when the MCPTT group call is upgraded to in-progress imminent
peril state.
\- An MCPTT imminent peril call puts the MCPTT group into the in-progress
imminent peril state.
##### 10.6.3.9.3 MCPTT emergency alert
Editor\'s note: whether the following procedures for emergency alert
initiation and emergency alert cancel remain in this specification is FFS.
###### 10.6.3.9.3.1 MCPTT emergency alert initiation
An MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT emergency alert to the members of an MCPTT
group. This procedure will place the MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state
if the MCPTT client is not already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.3.9.3.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The pre-conditions for off-network group calls as described in subclause
10.6.3.3 apply.
2\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, MCPTT client 1 could have been provisioned for
emergency behaviour on the currently selected group.
3\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 belong to and are ready for off-network
communications on the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.3.9.3.1-1: MCPTT emergency alert
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert by
sending an MCPTT emergency alert announcement to the other clients. MCPTT
client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained
by the MCPTT client until explicitly cancelled. Once MCPTT client1 is in the
MCPTT emergency state, any calls initiated by MCPTT client 1, group or
private, shall be initiated as emergency calls and receive priority treatment.
The MCPTT emergency alert announcement is sent periodically so that late
joining MCPTT group members are notified.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency alert announcement to the other
participants on the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 2: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
MCPTT emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency
state.
3\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency state of the originating
MCPTT user.
4\. The receiving MCPTT clients acknowledge the MCPTT emergency alert to the
originating MCPTT client.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency state.
NOTE 4: The MCPTT client 1 need not initiate a group call. For example, the
MCPTT client can be configured to only allow alerts or the MCPTT user can
choose not to make an MCPTT emergency group call.
NOTE 5: MCPTT clients receiving subsequent MCPTT emergency alert announcements
that are sent periodically need only respond to the first one that they
receive.
5\. The originating MCPTT client 1 checks the responses and may inform the
MCPTT user of the MCPTT group members whose MCPTTT clients responded.
###### 10.6.3.9.3.2 MCPTT emergency alert cancel
An MCPTT client has initiated an MCPTT emergency alert, has entered the MCPTT
emergency state and wishes to cancel the alert, informing the other MCPTT
group members of the cancellation. As part of this process, the MCPTT client
may also request the cancellation of the in-progress emergency state of the
group if authorized to do so.
Procedures in figure 10.6.3.9.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MCPTT
emergency alert.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 is still in the MCPTT emergency state.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT clients 2 and 3 are still in off-
network contact via the MCPTT group designated provisioned to MCPTT client 1
as the MCPTT emergency group.
Figure 10.6.3.9.3.2-1 MCPTT emergency alert cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert cancel.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency alert cancel announcement to the
MCPTT group to which MCPTT client 1 had previously sent the emergency alert.
3\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency alert cancellation by
MCPTT client 1.
4\. The receiving MCPTT clients acknowledge the MCPTT emergency alert cancel
to the originating MCPTT client.
NOTE: MCPTT clients that track the MCPTT emergency alerts of other MCPTT
users, e.g. consoles that fail to receive subsequent periodic MCPTT emergency
alert announcements after a configured timeout can consider the alert to be
cancelled.

#### 10.7.2.2 Private call within one MCPTT system
##### 10.7.2.2.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user, with or without floor
control enabled, in an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to automatic commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.2.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode-- MCPTT
users in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call for
the chosen MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor control is
to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228
[5] for MCPTT, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCPTT user. The
MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT id of invited user, an SDP offer
containing one or more media types. For a private call with floor control, the
MCPTT private call request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT
client 1 is requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a Requested
commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in
automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the
initiating user.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized
to initiate the private call, and that MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive the private call. If the MCPTT private call request
requested automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a private
call in automatic commencement mode.
5\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 9.
6\. If authorized, MCPTT server includes information that it communicates
using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested automatic
commencement mode by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called
MCPTT client and sends the corresponding MCPTT private call request towards
the MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID of the calling MCPTT user 1. If the
called MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs
and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the
incoming MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT
UE.
7\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCPTT private call response is sent to the MCPTT server (via SIP core).
9\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client
1 about successful call establishment.
10\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful
call establishment for private call with floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor
control server, giving it permission to transmit. At the same time floor
participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by the floor control server that
floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.2.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
###### 10.7.2.2.2.1 Description
Figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client
initiating an MCPTT private call that uses manual commencement mode. The flow
may use a floor request in the MCPTT private call request indicating that the
originator will be given the floor when the call starts and eliminates the
need for a separate initial floor request message during media plane
establishment. Alternatively the call initiation may be sent without the floor
request, which allows the called party to request the floor first.
###### 10.7.2.2.2.2 Procedure
Both clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure
10.7.2.2.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1: MCPTT private call in manual commencement mode-- MCPTT
users in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are both registered and their respective
users, MCPTT user 1 and MCPTT user 2, are authenticated and authorized to use
the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the selected MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established. For private call without floor control, both
users will have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request addressed to the MCPTT
ID of MCPTT user 2 using an MCPTT service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS
23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT
server). The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID of invited user
and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT private call
request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is
requesting the floor, for a private call with floor control. The MCPTT client
1 may include a requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to
be established in manual commencement mode if manual commencement mode is
requested by the initiating user.
4\. The MCPTT server confirms that both MCPTT users are authorized for the
private call. The MCPTT server checks the commencement mode setting of the
called MCPTT client and also checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1
is authorized to initiate a call in manual commencement mode.
5\. The MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private call request for
the call to MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID of the calling MCPTT user
1. If the called MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple
MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls,
then the incoming MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the
designated MCPTT UE.
6\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 7b.
7a. The MCPTT user is alerted. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the
MCPTT server.
7b. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating that
MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.
8\. MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e.,
has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. If MCPTT
user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCPTT client 2 sends a call
failure response to the MCPTT server without adding reason for call failure.
9\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted
media parameters.
10\. The media plane for communication is established. Either user can
transmit media individually when using floor control. For successful call
establishment for private call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the
floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor
initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client
2 is informed that the floor is taken. The meaning of the floor request (give
floor initially to originator [client 1], or give floor initially to target
[client 2]) may be configurable. For a private call without floor control both
users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.
##### 10.7.2.2.3 Private call release
###### 10.7.2.2.3.1 Client initiated
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is requesting to
release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the
call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic).
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT
private call.
Figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1: Private call release -- client initiated
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service and are involved in private
call with or without floor control established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode, as described in subclause 10.7.2.2.1 and subclause
10.7.2.2.2.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to release an ongoing MCPTT private call
with MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call end request towards the MCPTT
server (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call with the other
client.
4\. MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call end request
towards the MCPTT client specified in the original MCPTT private call end
request.
5\. MCPTT user is notified about the release of the private call.
6\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 acknowledges the MCPTT private call end
request with an MCPTT private call end response.
7\. After receiving the MCPTT private call end response from MCPTT client 2,
the MCPTT server generates an acknowledgement for the MCPTT client 1\'s MCPTT
private call end request.
8\. MCPTT clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor
control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests
for floor control or send media.
###### 10.7.2.2.3.2 Server initiated
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server is terminating an
ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the call
established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic),
upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured maximum
duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT private
call without transmission/reception.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT
private call.
Figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1: End private call -- server initiated
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service and are involved in private
call with or without floor control established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode.
2\. Upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured
maximum duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT
private call without transmission/reception, the MCPTT server decides to
initiate termination of an ongoing MCPTT private call between MCPTT client 1
and MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call end request towards the MCPTT
clients 1 and 2 (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call between
them.
4\. MCPTT users at client 1 and client 2 are notified about the termination of
the private call.
5\. The MCPTT private call end request receiving MCPTT clients 1 and 2
acknowledge the request with an MCPTT private call end response.
6\. MCPTT clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor
control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests
for floor control or send media.
#### 10.7.2.3 Private call within several MCPTT systems
##### 10.7.2.3.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode -- MCPTT
users in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call (automatic commencement mode) for communicating with MCPTT user
in another MCPTT system with or without floor control enabled.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.3.1-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of MCPTT private call with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to automatic commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.3.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode \--
users in multiple MCPTT systems
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service to their respective MCPTT
service provider, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the chosen MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the home MCPTT
server 1 (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS
23.228 [5] for MCPTT, for establishing private call with the MCPTT client 2
registered at MCPTT service provider 2. The MCPTT private call request
contains the MCPTT id of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more
media types. For a private call with floor control, the MCPTT private call
request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is
requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested commencement
mode that indicates that the call is to be established in automatic
commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the
initiating user.
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call. If the MCPTT private call request
requested automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in
automatic commencement mode.
5\. MCPTT server 1 may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 11.
6\. If authorized, MCPTT server 1 includes information that it communicates
using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes an automatic
commencement mode indication if automatic commencement mode was requested by
and authorised for the calling user and sends the corresponding MCPTT private
call request towards the MCPTT system (via SIP core) of the MCPTT client
specified in the original MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client 2) i.e.,
MCPTT server 2.
7\. MCPTT server 2 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive a private call.
8\. MCPTT server 2 includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request, includes a requested automatic commencement
mode indication based on a requested automatic commencement mode by the
calling user or based upon the setting of the called MCPTT client and sends
the received MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT client specified in
the received MCPTT private call request (i.e., MCPTT client 2). If the called
MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has
designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming
MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
9\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call.
10\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an acknowledgement is sent to the MCPTT server 1 (via SIP core and MCPTT
server 2).
11\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, MCPTT client 1 is informed about
successful call establishment.
12\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful
call establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from
MCPTT client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the
floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to
transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by
the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.3.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- MCPTT users
in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call (manual commencement mode) for communicating with MCPTT user in
another MCPTT system with or without floor control enabled.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.3.2-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of MCPTT private call with the selected MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.3.2-1: Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- users
in multiple MCPTT systems
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service to their respective MCPTT
service provider, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the selected MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the home MCPTT
server 1 (via SIP core), for establishing private call with the MCPTT client 2
registered at MCPTT service provider 2. For a private call with floor control,
the MCPTT private call request contains an element that indicates that MCPTT
client 1 is requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested
commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in manual
commencement mode if manual commencement mode is requested by the initiating
user.
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call. The MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in
manual commencement mode.
5\. If authorized, MCPTT server 1 sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
request towards the MCPTT system (via SIP core) of the MCPTT client specified
in the original MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client 2) i.e., MCPTT server
2.
6\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 10.
7\. The MCPTT server 2 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive a private call and also checks the commencement mode
setting of MCPTT client 2.
8\. The MCPTT server 2 offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private
call request towards the MCPTT client specified in the received MCPTT private
call request (i.e., MCPTT client 2). If the called MCPTT user has registered
to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE
for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call request
is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
9\. The MCPTT user is alerted. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the
MCPTT server 1 (via server 2).
10\. The MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating
that MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.
11\. MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e.
has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server 1 (via SIP
core and MCPTT server 2)
12\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, MCPTT client 1 is informed about
successful call establishment.
13\. MCPTT client 1 and client 2 have successfully established media plane for
communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call
establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor by the
floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to
transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by
the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.3.3 Private call release -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure in this subclause is for the case where an MCPTT client is
requesting to release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor
control) established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic), and the MCPTT users are in multiple MCPTT systems.
Procedures are similar to those described for private call release when MCPTT
users are in single MCPTT system as in subclause 10.7.2.2.3.1, with the
addition that the MCPTT call end request and the corresponding acknowledgement
are routed through the MCPTT server in partner MCPTT system.
#### 10.7.2.4 MCPTT emergency private call
##### 10.7.2.4.1 MCPTT emergency private call commencement
This procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is
initiating an MCPTT emergency private call with unicast signalling for
communicating with another MCPTT user. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency
state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user\'s mission
critical applications.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency private
call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the MCPTT private call belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert prior to initiating an MCPTT emergency private call.
Figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 MCPTT emergency private call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency private call.
MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The
MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT
emergency private call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. If the MCPTT
client is configured to send an MCPTT emergency alert when initiating an MCPTT
emergency private call, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT
emergency alert is to be initiated.
3\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
target MCPTT client. The request contains an indication of the in-progress
emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if
the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
4\. The MCPTT user on MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming MCPTT
emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency private call
request to the MCPTT server.
6\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.
7\. The MCPTT server informs MCPTT client 1 about the successful MCPTT
emergency private call establishment.
8\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 establish the media plane for
communication. The MCPTT client 1 can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT
client 2 is also in the MCPTT emergency state.
NOTE 1: The priority for the MCPTT emergency private call is retained until
cancelled according to system policy (e.g. timeout or call end) or cancelled
by an authorized MCPTT user.
NOTE 2: The initiating MCPTT user\'s MCPTT emergency state is retained by the
system until cancelled as in subclause 10.6.2.6.1.3. The initiating MCPTT
user\'s MCPTT emergency state is also retained locally by the MCPTT client
until explicitly cancelled by the MCPTT user.
##### 10.7.2.4.2 MCPTT private call emergency upgrade
This procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call while the private call is
already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.4.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the MCPTT
client upgrading a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the private call belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. A private call is already in progress.
Figure 10.7.2.4.2-1: MCPTT private call upgrade
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an emergency. MCPTT client 1
sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the private call to
in-progress emergency by sending an MCPTT emergency request. If configured to
send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency upgrade, the request
also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be initiated. The
request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency request towards the MCPTT client of
the other participant.
4\. The MCPTT user is notified of the in-progress emergency of the MCPTT
emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency request to the
MCPTT server.
6\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call
ends.
7\. The MCPTT server confirms the upgrade request to MCPTT client 1.
8\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 continue with the private call, which
has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency private call. The MCPTT client 1
can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT client 2 is also in the MCPTT
emergency state.

#### 10.7.3.2 Use of ProSe capability for private call
When an MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a
specific MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE by a ProSe mechanism, the MCPTT
client retrieves the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of the target
MCPTT user from the \"List of user(s) who can be called in private call\" in
the MCPTT user profile and requests the IP address of the MCPTT UE associated
with the target MCPTT user from the ProSe layer.
The MCPTT client enables the ProSe layer to determine IP address for the
target MCPTT UE by providing the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID (as
defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) of the target MCPTT user. This
may trigger the ProSe layer procedure (e.g. discovery). The user info ID of
the target MCPTT user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as
defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).
The ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCPTT
user\'s MCPTT ID to the MCPTT client.
NOTE: The ProSe procedures for one-to-one direct communications specified in
3GPP TS 23.303 [7] retrieves a layer-2 ID associated with the user info ID of
the target MCPTT user by the discovery procedure to establish direct
communications between ProSe users.
#### 10.7.3.3 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user when off-network using
an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.3.3-1 are the basic signalling procedures for the
MCPTT client initiating establishment of an off-network MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT user profile used for off-network operation mode is pre-provisioned
in the MCPTT UEs.
Figure 10.7.3.3-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate a private call to
the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 sends a call setup request towards the MCPTT client 2.
The call setup request contains an SDP offer, an automatic commencement mode
indication, and an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting
the floor.
3\. The MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the incoming private
call.
4\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and a
call setup response indicating the successful call establishment is sent to
MCPTT client 1. If MCPTT client 2 rejected the incoming call, the MCPTT client
2 sends a call setup response indicating the failure reason to the MCPTT
client 1.
NOTE: Step 4 can also occur prior to step 3.
5\. The MCPTT client 1 and the MCPTT client 2 have successfully established
the media plane for communication with floor control and the MCPTT client 1 is
automatically granted the floor.
#### 10.7.3.4 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user when off-network using
a manual commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.3.4-1 are the basic signalling procedures for the
MCPTT client initiating establishment of an off-network MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:

commencement mode indication, and an element that indicates that MCPTT client
1 is requesting the floor.
3\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the incoming
private call.
4\. The MCPTT client 2 sends MCPTT ringing message to the MCPTT client 1.
NOTE: Step 4 can also occur prior to step 3.
5\. The MCPTT user at the MCPTT client 2 has accepted the call using manual
commencement mode (i.e., has taken some action to accept via the user
interface). The MCPTT user may also reject or fail to answer the incoming
call.
6\. The MCPTT client 2 sends a call setup response indicating the successful
call establishment to MCPTT client 1. If the MCPTT client 2 rejected the call
or the MCPTT user 2 rejected or failed to answer the incoming call, the MCPTT
client 2 sends a call setup response indicating the failure reason to the
MCPTT client 1.
7\. The MCPTT client 1 and the MCPTT client 2 have successfully established
the media plane for communication with floor control and the MCPTT client 1 is
automatically granted the floor.
#### 10.7.3.5 Private call release
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is requesting to
release an ongoing MCPTT private call whether the call was established using
either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic), as described in
subclause 10.7.3.3 and subclause 10.7.3.4. Either MCPTT client can initiate
the call release procedure.
Procedures in figure 10.7.3.5-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for an MCPTT client initiating the release of an ongoing off-
network MCPTT private call.
Pre-conditions:

#### 10.7.3.6 MCPTT emergency private call
The off-network emergency private call is a special case of off-network
private call as defined in subclause 10.7.3. The following are modifications
to the aforementioned subclause to support MCPTT private calls:
\- The call setup contains an indication that the MCPTT private call is to be
an MCPTT emergency private call,
\- the bearers of both MCPTT private call participants are given MCPTT
emergency priority prior to media transfer,
\- either participant in an MCPTT private call may upgrade the call to the
MCPTT emergency state during the call by sending an MCPTT upgrade private
emergency request,
\- placing an MCPTT emergency private call places the MCPTT client in the
MCPTT emergency state,
\- the bearer priority of each participant is restored to the priority as it
was prior to the MCPTT emergency private call initiation, when the call ends
or when the MCPTT emergency priority is cancelled
\- an authorized user or the originator of the call may cancel the MCPTT
emergency priority of the call by sending an MCPTT cancel private emergency
request and
\- the MCPTT emergency priority of the MCPTT private call may be cancelled

authorized to initiate the MCPTT private call call‑back request.
4\. If authorized, MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
call‑back request towards the MCPTT client 2.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 stores the MCPTT user who initiated the MCPTT
private call call‑back request, the time the MCPTT private call call‑back
request was received, and the urgency indication for the MCPTT private call
call-back request.
6\. The MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user 2 that there is an MCPTT
private call call-back request awaiting his attention.
7\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT private call call‑back
response to the MCPTT server.
8\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call call-back response from MCPTT client
2, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful call-back
request.
#### 10.7.4.3 MCPTT private call call‑back cancel request within one MCPTT
system
Once an MCPTT private call call‑back request has been successfully made and
before the receiving MCPTT user has made an MCPTT private call to the calling
MCPTT user, the calling MCPTT user may cancel the outstanding MCPTT private
call request.
Procedures in figure 10.7.4.3-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT private call call-back cancel request
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A previously successfully made MCPTT private call call‑back request from
MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client 2.
Figure 10.7.4.3-1: MCPTT private call call‑back cancel request -- MCPTT users
in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 wants to cancel a previously created MCPTT
private call call‑back request to the MCPTT user 2 of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call call‑back cancel request
towards the MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user 1 at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to cancel the previous MCPTT private call call‑back request, if one
exists.
4\. If authorized, MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
call‑back cancel request towards the MCPTT client 2.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 removes all stored information about the
previous MCPTT private call call‑back request from the MCPTT user 1 on MCPTT
client 1.

response to the MCPTT server.
7\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call call‑back cancel response from MCPTT
client 2, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful
call‑back request cancelation.
#### 10.7.4.4 MCPTT private call call‑back request fulfillment within one
MCPTT system
Once an MCPTT private call call‑back request has been successfully made, it is
expected that the receiving MCPTT user will make an MCPTT private call to the
MCPTT user who sent the MCPTT private call call‑back request. The procedures
for establishing the MCPTT private call between the two users is the same as
an MCPTT private call (10.7.2.2.2).
Procedures in figure 10.7.4.4-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client returning an MCPTT private call to the MCPTT user who
initiated the MCPTT private call call‑back request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A previously successfully made MCPTT private call call‑back request from
MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client 2.
Figure 10.7.4.4-1: MCPTT private call‑back request fulfillment -- MCPTT users
in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 decides to initiate an MCPTT private call
based on the stored MCPTT private call call‑back request to the MCPTT user 1
on MCPTT client 1 using the MCPTT private call procedures of 10.7.2.2.2.
2\. Once a successful MCPTT private call has been made between the MCPTT user
1 on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT user 2, then the MCPTT client 2 removes the
stored call‑back request information.
## 10.8 Simultaneous session for MCPTT calls (on-network)
### 10.8.1 General
An MCPTT client and MCPTT server may use a simultaneous session as defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [16] for MCPTT calls. The MCPTT client becomes involved in a
simultaneous session for MCPTT calls by inviting, joining or accepting more
than one MCPTT call, or affiliating to a group.
NOTE: An MCPTT client affiliating to multiple MCPTT groups with active calls
will result in the MCPTT client being invited simultaneously to multiple MCPTT
calls.
The MCPTT client can also still handle multiple MCPTT calls in parallel at the
same time i.e. using multiple dialogs.
The simultaneous session is established during either an originating on-demand
call establishment or during pre-established session establishment or a
modification of an already established pre-established session or on-demand
call.
It is possible to change the prioritisation while the MCPTT client is engaged
in multiple MCPTT calls. The setting of the priority can be made at MCPTT call
setup or by performing a modification after the MCPTT call is established.
This may result in more than one media bearer.
## 10.9 Floor control
### 10.9.1 Floor control for on-network MCPTT service
#### 10.9.1.1 General
The procedure is for providing a floor control to MCPTT UE in an on-network
case and applies for both private call and group call. Floor control is
performed by using floor control information flows between the floor
participant and the floor control server.
#### 10.9.1.2 Information flows for floor control for on-network
##### 10.9.1.2.1 General
When the floor control server receives a floor request from the floor
participant, it decides whether to give a grant or not based on, e.g., the
session status (i.e., whether the grant is given to another user or not), user
profile, priority. The result is informed to the requesting floor participant.
When the floor participant receives a floor granted message, it can send voice
media over the uplink bearer established beforehand. The floor revoked message
can be used as part of override. The floor queue status request can be used to
know current position in the queue for floor.
Some floor control information flows can also piggyback call control
information flows to provide efficient call setup and clearing:
\- Call setup request is optionally carried in floor request (uplink) or floor
taken (downlink, can be broadcast); and
\- Call release request is optionally carried in floor release (uplink) or
floor idle (downlink, can be broadcast).
##### 10.9.1.2.2 Floor request
Table 10.9.1.2.2-1 describes the information flow floor request, from the
floor participant to the floor control server and from the floor control
server to the floor control server, which is used to request the floor for
media transfer. This information flow is sent in unicast to the floor control
server.

Table 10.9.1.2.3-1 describes the information flow floor granted, from the
floor control server to the floor participant and from the floor control
server to the floor control server, which is used to indicate that a request
for floor is granted and media transfer is possible. This information flow is
sent in unicast (to the granted floor participant).

##### 10.9.1.2.4 Floor rejected
Table 10.9.1.2.4-1 describes the information flow floor rejected, from the
floor control server to the floor participant, which is used to indicate that

taken during an MCPTT session
1\. Floor participant B is talking and is sending the voice media.
2\. Floor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server which includes the necessary information, e.g. floor priority.
4\. Based on applicable criteria (e.g. floor priority, participant type,
allowance to transmit, maximum number of simultaneous talkers) floor control
server determines what action (grant, deny, or queue) shall be applied to the
request. In this case, the floor request from floor participant A will be
accepted. Simultaneous floor requests to transmit are handled in a sequential
order. Based on the group configuration repository data, the floor control
server may limit the time a floor participant is allowed to talk.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant B.
5c. Floor control server sends a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant C.
5d. Floor control server may send a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant A.

participant A is located, to be notified.
6b. The multi-talker floor taken shall inform the user of UE B, that the
floors are granted to other floor participants, but the floor is not revoked.
6c. The multi-talker floor taken shall inform the user of UE C floor
participants list the floor are currently granted to.
7\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established beforehand, i.e. participants A and B receive and transmit voice
media; participant C only receives voice media.
NOTE: Floor control is independent from whether audio mixing is performed by
the MCPTT server or by the UE.
##### 10.9.1.3.2 Floor override
###### 10.9.1.3.2.1 Floor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected)
during an MCPTT session
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.1-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participant (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control
server (with an override based on priority). Only two UEs involved in the
session are shown for the simplicity.
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.1-1: Floor override using floor revoked (also floor
rejected) during an MCPTT session

priority information that is received in the floor request message.
12\. The floor control server responds with a floor rejected message to floor
participant B.
13\. Floor participant B may be notified that he is rejected.
###### 10.9.1.3.2.2 Floor override without using floor revoked during an MCPTT
session
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participants (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control
server (with an override based on priority and configured to permit the
transmission of the overridden floor participant B to continue). Only two UEs
involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions
\- The floor control server has been configured to support override.
\- The override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor
participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.

participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor
priority information that is received in the floor request message.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor
participants (including floor participant B). Floor participant B continues
transmitting the (overridden) voice media transmission.
NOTE 1: All other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group
call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn
who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.
6a. The floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.
6b. The user of floor participant B is notified of the status that the floor
is now taken by floor participant A.
7\. Floor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the
session established beforehand.
NOTE 2: Floor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of
floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both
transmissions is based on configuration.
##### 10.9.1.3.2.3 Floor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected)
during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-talker control
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.3-1 shows the high-level procedure that the floor control
allows several participants to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already
established between the floor participant (with floor granted to floor
participant B) and the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in the
session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control.
2\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B and
client C) and MCPTT server.
3\. The maximum number of simultaneous talkers is set to 2.

3\. Floor participant A wants to talk (i.e. send voice media) over the
session. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor
control server.
4\. Based on an arbitration result (e.g. per the priority information that is
received in the floor request message), the floor control server determines to
accept the floor request from floor participant A. The maximum number of
simultaneous talkers in the MCPTT group has been reached, the floor control
server decides to apply the override mechanism.
5\. The floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor
participant B stopping the voice media transmission of floor participant B.
6\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.
7\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant A, while sending a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant B and floor participant C including the information to whom the
floor has been granted.
8\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that the floor has been
granted to him. Similarly, the user of floor participant B and floor
participant C may be notified to whom the floor has been granted.
9\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established beforehand.
10\. Now floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.
11\. Floor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control server
that may include participant priority information.
12\. Based on arbitration result, e.g. per the priority information that is
received in the floor request message, and if the number of MCPTT Users has
already reached the maximum number of simultaneous talkers in the group, the
floor control server determines whether to accept or reject the floor request
from floor participant B. Due to lower priority of participant B and the
applicable limitation of simultaneous talkers, the floor control server
rejects the floor request.
13\. The floor control server responds with a floor rejected message to floor
participant B.
14\. Floor participant B may be notified about the floor rejection.
NOTE: Floor control procedure is independent from whether audio mixing is
performed by the MCPTT server or by the UE.
##### 10.9.1.3.2.4 Floor release during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-
talker control
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.4-1 shows the high-level procedure where the floor
controller allows a participant to release the floor while other participants
continue to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already established between

floor participant C.
4a. The users of floor participant B and floor participant C may be notified
that floor participant A has released the floor.
5\. Floor participants B and C continue sending voice media over the
established session.
NOTE: Floor control procedures are independent from whether audio mixing is
performed by the MCPTT server or by the UE.
##### 10.9.1.3.3 Queue position during an MCPTT session
Figure 10.9.1.3.3-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between MCPTT clients
(with floor granted to floor participant B) and server (with an override based
on priority at floor control server). Only two UEs involved in the session are
shown for the simplicity.
Figure 10.9.1.3.3-1: Queue status during an MCPTT session
1\. It is assumed that floor participant B has been given a floor granted and
is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participating A) requesting floor which get queued at the
floor control server.
2\. Floor participant A would like to know its current position in the floor
request queue.
3\. Floor participant A sends a queue position request message to the floor
control server.
4\. Floor control server determines the current queue position of floor
participant A from the floor request queue.
5\. Floor control server responds with the current position in queue position
info message.
6\. User at floor participant A is informed about the current queue position.
##### 10.9.1.3.4 Floor request cancellation from the floor request queue
###### 10.9.1.3.4.1 Floor request cancellation from the queue -- MCPTT user
initiated
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation
from the floor queue initiated by the MCPTT user. The MCPTT user may be an
authorized user who has rights to cancel the floor requests of other MCPTT
users, whose floor requests are in floor control queue.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that floor participant B has been granted the floor and is
transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participant A and floor participant C) requesting the floor
which have been queued at the floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by
MCPTT user
1\. The floor participant A wants to remove the floor request from the floor
request queue. If floor participant A is an authorized MCPTT user with the
rights to cancel another MCPTT user\'s floor request, the authorized MCPTT
user may request floor request cancellation for one or more floor
participants, whose floor request needs to be removed from the floor queue.
2\. The floor participant A sends a floor request cancel (initiating MCPTT ID)
message to the floor control server. If the floor participant A wants to
remove the floor request(s) of other participant(s), the target
participant(s)\' MCPTT ID should be included in this message.
3\. The floor control server shall check whether the requesting floor
participant has authorization to cancel the floor request(s). If authorized,
the floor request(s) will be removed from the floor request queue. When
current transmission is completed, floor control server will process the floor
request from the updated floor request queue.
4\. If the floor request cancel in step 3 is sent by an authorized user (e.g.,
dispatcher) to cancel the floor request(s) of other participant(s) from the
floor request queue, the floor request cancel notify message is sent to the
floor participant whose floor request was cancelled from the floor queue.
5\. The floor control server provides a floor request cancel response to the
floor participant A when the floor cancellation is completed. Optionally, the
new queue position information may be notified to the floor participants whose
floor requests are in the floor request queue (not shown in the figure).
###### 10.9.1.3.4.2 Floor request cancellation from the queue - floor control
server initiated
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation
from the queue initiated by the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in
the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that floor participant B has been granted the floor and is
transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participant A and participant C) requesting the floor which
have been queued at the floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by
floor control server
1\. The floor control server removes the floor request from the floor request
queue based on policy. e.g., expiration of a timer. In the case when floor
control server receives repeated floor requests from a floor participant while
the floor is occupied, the new floor request is accepted and added into the
floor queue and the existing/former floor request is removed from the floor
queue or the new floor request is rejected and the existing/former floor
request of this floor participant is retained in the floor request queue.
2\. The floor control server sends a floor request cancel notify to the floor
participant(s) whose floor request is removed from the floor request queue.
3\. Optionally, the newly queue position information is notified to the other
floor participants whose floor requests are queued.
#### 10.9.1.4 Floor control involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
##### 10.9.1.4.1 Partner MCPTT system routes all floor control messages to
primary MCPTT system\'s floor control server
The MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will
participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.)
in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group
regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from
different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the
primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The
MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor
control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In
this scenario, the partner MCPTT systems request the floor control for its
MCPTT user(s) from the floor control server of the primary MCPTT system. The
protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.
Figure 10.9.1.4.1-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups
from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share all information of their users\' to the primary MCPTT system (public
information would still need to be shared).
2\. The group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted
by the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The
floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor
participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control
server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs
to partner MCPTT system.
4\. The floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group
call. The floor control server 2 routes all floor control messages to and from
the floor participants 2 and 3 and then floor control server 1.
Figure 10.9.1.4.1-1: Floor control (partner MCPTT system forwarding) involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. An MCPTT group call involving group1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and
active.
2\. The MCPTT users want to talk.
3\. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control
server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not
occur at the same time).
4\. If only one floor request is received, or floor control server 2 handles
the floor request sequentially, there is no arbitration performed and the
corresponding floor request is forwarded to the floor control server 1. If the
floor control server 2 receives multiple floor requests at the same time or
during an interval, then it forwards the floor requests to the floor control
server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the floor participant
information shall not be exposed, the floor priority related information
or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1 should be
included in the forwarded request.
5\. The floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group
call and determines the floor request to be accepted.
6\. If the floor request from floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT system
is accepted, a floor granted is sent with permission to talk. The floor
control messages from floor control server 1 are routed to floor participant 2
via the floor control server 2.
7\. When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted, the
floor control server 2 sends a floor granted message on to floor participant
2.
8\. The floor granted shall cause the user of the UE where the floor
participant 2 is located to be notified.
9\. The primary floor control server 1 may (9a.1) send a floor rejected
message, or (9b.1) send a queue position info message for each non-granted
received floor requests forwarded from the floor control server 2 (partner).
When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor rejected message,
then the floor control server 2 (partner) (9a.2) sends a floor rejected
message to the appropriate floor participant. When the floor control server 2
(partner) receives the queue position info, then the floor control server 2
(partner) (9b.2) sends a queue position info message to the appropriate floor
participant.
10a.1 If floor control server 1 rejects the floor request from floor
participant 1, then a floor reject message is sent.
10a.2 Upon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is
located may be notified.
10b.1 If floor control server 1 supports floor queue, queue position info
message is sent to the floor participant 1.
10b.2 Upon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is
located may be notified.
NOTE 1: Steps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box
enclosing them. However if this box is implemented then either information
flow 10a or 10b would occur.
11\. Since the floor is granted to floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT
system, then a floor taken is sent to all other floor participants ((11a)
floor participant 1 and (11b.1) to floor control server 2 (partner) for
forwarding to (11b.2) floor participant 3.
12\. The receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the users of the UEs
where the floor participant entity 1 and floor participant 3 are located to be
notified.
13\. Upon successful floor granted, the group call media transmission occurs.
NOTE 2: The media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT
systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.
##### 10.9.1.4.2 Partner MCPTT system performs filtering of floor control
messages entering and leaving the partner MCPTT system
The MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will
participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.)
in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group
regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from
different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the
primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The
MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor
control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In
this scenario, the partner MCPTT system filters its MCPTT users\' floor
requests before communicating with the floor control server of the primary
MCPTT system. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like
RTCP.
Figure 10.9.1.4.2-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups
from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share all information of their users to the primary MCPTT system (public
information would still need to be shared).
2\. The group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted
by the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The
floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor
participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control
server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs
to partner MCPTT system.
4\. The floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group
call. The floor control server 2 does floor control filtering with its floor
participants 2 and 3 before communicating with the floor control server 1.
Figure 10.9.1.4.2-1: Floor control (filtering by partner MCPTT system)
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. An MCPTT group call involving group 1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and
active.
2\. The MCPTT users want to talk
3\. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control
server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not
occur at the same time).
4\. Floor control server 2 receives a floor request from floor participant 2
and from participant 3 at the same time or during an interval, then the floor
control server 2 (partner) performs filtering of the floor requests received
according to its local policy such as priority or order based on its own
users, and forwards the selected floor request (floor participant 2) to the
floor control server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the
floor participant information shall not be exposed, the priority related
information or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1
should be included in the forwarded request.
5\. The floor control server 2 (partner) may send a floor rejected towards the
floor participant 3, since its floor request was not chosen to be forwarded on
to the floor control server 1.
6\. The user on the UE where the floor participant 3 is located may be
notified of the rejection.
NOTE 1: Steps 5 and 6 can occur any time between step 4 and step 16.
7\. The floor control server 2 (partner) forwards the floor request of floor
participant 2 to the floor server 1.
8\. The floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group
call and determines the floor request to be accepted. The floor request
message from floor participant 2 of the partner system is accepted by the
floor control server 1 (arbitrator) and is determined that a floor granted is
sent with permission to talk.
9\. The floor granted message from floor control server 1 is routed to floor
participant 2 via the floor control server 2 (partner).
10\. Since floor participant 1 sent a floor request but was not granted,
10a.1 the primary floor control server may send a floor rejected message to
floor participant 1.
10a.2 The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified of the rejection.
10b.1 if floor control server supports floor queuing, send a queue position
info message to floor participant 1.
10b.2 The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified of the queue position.
NOTE 2: Steps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box
enclosing them. However if this box is implemented then either information
flow 10a or 10b would occur.
11\. A floor taken message is sent to floor participant 1.
12\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified.
NOTE 3: Step 10 through Step 12 can occur any time between step 8 and step 18.
13\. Since the floor control server 2 (partner) filters floor requests, when
the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted for floor
participant 2 from floor control server 1, the floor control server 2
(partner) needs to use the information received to generate the floor taken
which will be sent to all other floor participants (floor control participant
3).
14\. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor granted message to
floor participant 2.
15\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 2 is located is notified.
16\. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor taken message to all
other floor participants (floor participant 3).
17\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified.
18\. Upon successful floor grant, the group call media transmission occurs.
NOTE 4: The media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT
systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.
#### 10.9.1.5 Floor control for audio cut-in enabled group
Figure 10.9.1.5-1 shows the procedure for audio cut-in for the session already
established between the floor participants from same MCPTT service provider.
Floor participants may request the floor while Floor Participant B is
transmitting voice media. Floor control server grants floor immediately to the
floor request received.
Editor\'s note: Configuration parameter for queue depth is FFS.
Pre-conditions:
\- The floor control server has been configured to support audio cut-in.
\- It is assumed that the floor has been granted to floor participant B and
floor participant B is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor
participants (including floor participant A).
Figure 10.9.1.5-1: Floor control for audio cut-in enabled group in single
MCPTT system
1\. Floor participant B has been given floor and is transmitting voice media.
2\. Floor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server applies the audio cut-in policy with floor queue
disabled i.e., floor is immediately granted to the floor participant A, and
revoked from floor participant B.
5\. The floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor
participant B stopping the voice media transmission from floor participant B.
6\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.
7\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant A, and sends a floor taken message to floor participant B with
information of who is granted the floor. The floor control server may limit
the time a user talks (holds the floor).
8\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that he is granted the
floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant B may be notified who is
granted the floor.
9\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established.
10\. Now floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.
11\. Floor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control
server.
12\. The floor control server applies the audio cut-in policy with floor queue
disabled.
13\. The floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor
participant A stopping the voice media transmission from floor participant A.
14\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that the floor is
revoked.
15\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant B, and sends a floor taken message to floor participant A with
information of who is granted the floor. The floor control server may limit
the time a user talks (holds the floor).
16\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that he is granted the
floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant A may be notified who is
granted the floor.
17\. Floor participant B starts sending voice media over the session
established.
#### 10.9.1.6 Unicast media stop and resume requests
Figure 10.9.1.6-1 shows the procedure for a floor participant to indicate to
the floor control server that the unicast media flow of an active MCPTT group
call can be stopped.
Pre-condition:
1\. An MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server
for an MCPTT group call. Other participants to the call are not shown in the
figure for simplicity.
2\. The floor control is established between the floor participant and the
floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.6-1: Unicast media stop request during an MCPTT session
1\. Another floor participant has requested and has been granted the floor.
The floor control server sends a floor taken message to floor participant A.
The floor taken message may include an identifier of the associated media
flow.
2\. Floor control server sends the voice media flow to floor participant A
over unicast.
3\. Floor participant A gets the information, e.g. from the user, that media
for the call is not needed.
4\. Floor participant A sends a unicast media stop request to floor control
server, identifying the media flow to be stopped.
5\. Floor control server stops sending that unicast media flow to floor
participant A. Associated bearer resources may be de-allocated by the MCPTT
server.
Figure 10.9.1.6-2 shows the procedure for a floor participant to request from
the floor control server that the unicast media flow of an active MCPTT group
call be restarted.
Pre-condition:
1\. An MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server
for an MCPTT group call. Other participants to the call are not shown in the
figure for simplicity
2\. The floor control is established between the floor participant and the
floor control server.
3\. Floor participant A has previously indicated to the floor control server
that unicast media flow for that call should be stopped, using the procedure
described in Figure 10.9.1.6-1.
Figure 10.9.1.6-2: Unicast media resume request during an MCPTT session
1\. Another floor participant has requested and has been granted the floor.
The floor control server sends a floor taken message to floor participant A.
The floor taken message may include an identifier of the associated media
flow.
2\. Floor participant A gets the information, e.g. from the user, that media
for the call is needed again.
3\. Floor participant A sends a unicast media resume request to floor control
server, identifying the media flow to be re-started.
4\. Floor control server starts sending that unicast media flow to floor
participant A. This may need new bearer resources to be allocated.
NOTE 1: The identifier of the flow to be stopped or resumed is known by the
floor participant from the floor control information flows associated with
that MCPTT session.
NOTE 2: Stopping a media flow is not leaving the session and subsequent floor
control messages will still be sent by the floor control server to the floor
participant which has requested a unicast media stop.
NOTE 3: Both requests have no effect on a possible ongoing transmission of the
media flow over MBMS. In particular, they are not interpreted by the MCPTT
server as MBMS listening status reports.
### 10.9.2 Floor control for off-network MCPTT service
#### 10.9.2.1 General
The procedures defined in this subclause provide floor control to MCPTT UEs in
off-network operation. The procedures apply to both private calls and group
calls.
In off-network, floor control is performed by using floor control messages
among the MCPTT clients without centralized MCPTT server. The MCPTT client can
transmit voice packets once it is granted the right to speak, either locally
in the UE or by reception of a floor granted message from another MCPTT
client.
In off-network, the MCPTT client currently speaking performs the temporary
floor arbitrator during speaking since there is no centralized MCPTT floor
control server. The floor arbitrator controls the floor whether or not queue
is supported, and when floor is requested with override. If queue is
supported, the MCPTT client performing floor arbitrator grants the right to
speak to the next speaker and transfers the floor arbitrator role after
completing the voice transfer and releasing the floor. For group calls, the
floor arbitrator also transfers the floor control queue when granting the
floor. The next MCPTT client receiving the right to speak becomes the new
floor arbitrator and, for group calls, has the floor control queue.
For group calls, the floor control message is delivered in multicast based
communication and can be monitored by all the members within the MCPTT group.
The following information flows apply among MCPTT clients.
\- Floor request (from the floor participants to the floor arbitrator): used
to request a floor for voice transfer.
\- Floor release (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participants): used
to inform that the voice transfer is completed and the floor is released.
\- Floor granted (from the floor arbitrator to a floor participant): used to
indicate that the request for floor is granted, that voice transfer is
possible and the current queue list.
\- Queue position request (from the floor participant to the floor
arbitrator): used to request the position in the floor request queue.
\- Queue position info (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant):
used to indicate the floor request is queued and the current queue status.
\- Floor rejected (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used
to indicate that a request for the floor is rejected.
\- Floor taken (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to
indicate the floor is granted to another MCPTT user.
#### 10.9.2.2 Information flows for floor control for off-network
##### 10.9.2.2.1 General
For floor control for off-network, the information flows defined under
subclause 10.9.1.2 apply unless it is explicitly defined under this subclause.
##### 10.9.2.2.2 Floor granted
Table 10.9.2.2.2-1 describes the information flow floor granted, from the
floor participant to the floor participant, which is used to indicate that a
request for floor is granted and media transfer is possible.
Table 10.9.2.2.2-1: Floor granted
* * *
Information element Status Description MCPTT ID M Requester identity Duration
M The time for which the granted party is allowed to transmit Source
identifier O Identifies the communication, e.g. by identifying the media flow
within a media multiplex, present only in case of media multiplexing
Acknowledgement required O Indicates if acknowledgement from the floor
participant is required
* * *
#### 10.9.2.3 Floor control during silence
##### 10.9.2.3.1 Successful floor taken (No floor contention)
If a floor arbitrator still exists, the expected behaviour for floor requests
during periods of silence is described in subclauses 10.9.2.5 and 10.9.2.6
(with the exception that no media was being generated prior to the floor
request).
If a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.3.1-1 shows the successful
high level floor control procedure during periods **when there is no
detectable talker**.
NOTE 1: The description also applies to private calls.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group call had been established and all MCPTT clients have
the call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor
arbitrator is identified.
Figure 10.9.2.3.1-1: Successful floor taken flow (No floor contention)
1\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 does not detect any floor contention. Floor contention
occurs when multiple floor requests may exist simultaneously.
NOTE 2: The mechanism for detecting floor contention is out of scope of the
present document.
3\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.
4\. The user gets a notification that the floor request was successful (the
floor has been granted).
5\. The MCPTT client 1 begins voice transmission.
#### 10.9.2.4 Simultaneous floor requests
If a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.4.1-1 shows the expected
behaviour in case of simultaneous floor requests are generated **when there is
no detectable talker**.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group call is established and all MCPTT clients have the
call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor arbitrator
is identified.
2\. MCPTT client 1 has higher priority than MCPTT client 2.
Figure 10.9.2.4.1-1: Simultaneous floor requests
1a. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
1b. The MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
NOTE 1: Step 1a and 1b happen in parallel
2\. On receiving a floor request message, while waiting for a response to the
sent floor request message, the MCPTT client compares its floor priority with
the floor priority indicated in the received floor request message.
3\. On determining that it has higher floor priority than the received floor
request message(s), and no response to the sent floor request message is
received, the MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.
4\. The user at MCPTT client 1 gets notification that the floor request was
successful (the floor has been granted).
NOTE 2: If the floor priority in the received floor request message is same as
its own floor priority, the MCPTT client can use another scheme to decide who
gets the floor.
#### 10.9.2.5 Floor request during speaking with queue
Figure 10.9.2.5-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. In the case,
MCPTT clients should support queue function. The current speaking MCPTT client
acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request into the queue list when
receiving the floor request from other MCPTT clients. This procedure happens
while voice media is transmitting. In the flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the
voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as the floor arbitrator.
NOTE: The description only applies to group calls.
Figure 10.9.2.5-1: Floor request during speaking with queue
1\. MCPTT client 1 is transmitting voice media to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
3\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request of
MCPTT client 2 into the queue list.
4\. MCPTT client 1 sends the queue position info message with the queuing
status regarding the floor request of MCPTT client 2 in order to inform the
floor request is queued.
5\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group when
releasing the floor. The message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted to send
the voice media, and queue list, if any. MCPTT client 1 may include the
maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 transmits in the floor granted message.
6\. MCPTT client 2 sends the voice media when receiving the floor granted
message and being granted as next speaker in the floor granted message. In
addition, MCPTT client 2 becomes the floor arbitrator.
#### 10.9.2.6 Floor request during speaking without queue
Figure 10.9.2.6-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants. In the case, MCPTT clients do not support queue
function. The current speaking MCPTT client acting as the floor arbitrator
controls the floor request when receiving the floor request from other MCPTT
clients. This procedure happens while voice media is transmitting. In the
flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as
the floor arbitrator.
NOTE: The description also applies to private calls.
Figure 10.9.2.6-1: Floor request during speaking without queue
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator rejects the floor request
from MCPTT client 2 if no queue function is supported and sends the floor
rejected message to the MCPTT group.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor release message to the MCPTT group when
releasing the floor, in order to indicate that MCPTT client 1 finishes to send
the voice media and releases the floor.
When the floor release message is transmitted, there are no voice media in the
MCPTT group until an MCPTT client requests the floor as described in subclause
10.9.2.3.
#### 10.9.2.7 Override
Figure 10.9.2.7-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. When the
currently speaking MCPTT floor participant receives the floor request message
from another floor participant who is authorized to revoke the active
transmission (e.g. higher hierarchy), the current speaking MCPTT floor
participant immediately stops sending the audio media and then grants the
permission to that authorized floor participant.
NOTE: The description also applies to private calls.
Pre-condition:
\- MCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media
to the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.9.2.7-1: Floor request with override authorization
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message with override criteria
(e.g., priority level) to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator determines if the floor is
to be revoked based on override criteria. If this is the case, MCPTT client 1
revokes its right of the floor and stops sending the voice media immediately.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group. The
floor granted message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted, the floor and the
floor control queue (if supported). MCPTT client 1 may also include the
maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 can transmit voice in the floor granted
message.
MCPTT client2 who has revoked the floor is the new floor arbitrator and
transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.
#### 10.9.2.8 Floor queue status
Figure 10.9.2.8-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. If the floor
control queueing is supported by the floor control mechanism, the current
speaking MCPTT group member who is acting as the floor arbitrator collects the
information about the queue status based on the received request(s) from the
MCPTT group participant(s). The current speaker can then share information
about the queue status of the MCPTT floor participant upon request.
NOTE: The description only applies to group calls.
Pre-condition:
\- MCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media
to the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.9.2.8-1: Queue status request
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the queue position request message targeted to MCPTT
client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator by broadcasting the message to the MCPTT
group to get its queue status.
2\. Since the queue function is assumed to be supported in this call flow,
MCPTT client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator processes the queue position request
to find out the status of MCPTT client 1 in the queue.
3\. MCPTT client 1 constructs the queue position info message containing the
MCPTT client 2\'s queue status and sends it toward MCPTT client 2 by
broadcasting the message to the MCPTT group.
MCPTT client1 continues being the floor arbitrator and transmits the audio
media to the MCPTT group.

### 10.10.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBMS
bearers as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service shall use the
MCPTT-1, MCPTT-6, MCPTT‑8 and MCPTT-9 reference points for this procedure.
MCPTT may use pre-established MBMS bearer for the different types of MCPTT
group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use the
pre-established MBMS bearer for distributing the media. The MBMS bearer can be
used by any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the bearer
can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel.
Both the media packets as well as the floor control messages to the receiving
users are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be
used for the floor control messages, due to different bearer characteristic
requirements.
When using the pre-established procedure for MCPTT, the MCPTT server perform
the procedure of call connect and disconnect over MBMS as defined in subclause
10.10.4 at the group communication session establishment step.
### 10.10.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for using dynamic MBMS bearers
as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service shall use the MCPTT-1,
MCPTT-4, MCPTT-6, MCPTT‑7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTT-9 reference points for this
procedure.
MCPTT may use dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for the different types of
MCPTT group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use
the dynamic MBMS bearer for distributing the media.
Both the media packets as well as the floor control messages to the receiving
users are sent on the MBMS bearer.
When using the procedures for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for MCPTT, the
MCPTT server perform the procedure of call connect and disconnect over MBMS as
defined in subclause 10.10.4 at the group communication session establishment
step.
### 10.10.4 Call connect and disconnect over MBMS
#### 10.10.4.1 General
MBMS bearer can be used for MCPTT group calls. One MBMS bearer is not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBMS bearer, the MCPTT server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBMS bearer. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream within one MBMS bearer that is
used for the specific group call. When the group call over the MBMS bearer is
finished, this temporary association information of an MCPTT group call to
specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The procedure in figure
10.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the call start.
This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to continuously use a
unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBMS bearer is activated and announced to
the MCPTT clients.
#### 10.10.4.2 Procedure
##### 10.10.4.2.1 Call connect over MBMS
In figure 10.10.4.2.1-1 the MCPTT client 1 is the client that initiate an
MCPTT chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCPTT client 1 may,
but does not have to be in an MBMS service area. The MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 represents MCPTT clients receiving the MCPTT call over an MBMS
bearer. There may be other receiving clients both over unicast bearers and
over this or other MBMS bearer(s), however they are not illustrated in this
figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls. However that requires that the pre-arranged sessions are already
active. If a pre-arranged group session is initiated the use of pre-
established sessions are required.
Pre-conditions:
\- All users participating in the MCPTT group call are already affiliated to
the group.
\- All participating users have joined the group session.
Figure 10.10.4.2.1-1: Chat group call connect on MBMS bearer
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
NOTE 1: The procedure does not include the steps for MCPTT client location
reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.
2\. MCPTT client 1 initiate the MCPTT group call by sending an initial floor
request over a unicast bearer to the MCPTT server (reference point MCPTT-4).
3\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT
group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated
MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer
broadcasting the call. The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
NOTE 2: Step 3 can be deferred until step 5 and the MapGroupToBearer message
can then be included in the floor taken message.
4\. The MCPTT server grants the right to transmit for MCPTT client 1 and by
that sends a floor granted message to the MCPTT client 1. This message is sent
over a unicast bearer (reference point MCPTT-4).
5\. A floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to all receiving
users. This message includes the MCPTT ID of the transmitting MCPTT client as
well as the MCPTT group ID. The message is sent over a MBMS bearer to all
users that have previously been setup to receive calls over the MBMS bearer.
The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
6\. The media is sent from MCPTT client 1 to the MCPTT server over unicast
bearer and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 over
MBMS bearer.
NOTE 3: Additional floor request messages in the same call will not trigger
the MapGroupToBearer message to be sent.
##### 10.10.4.2.2 Call disconnect over MBMS
Figure 10.10.4.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to the MCPTT clients
to indicate that the MCPTT group call is being dissociated from the MBMS
bearer.
Figure 10.10.4.2.2-1: Chat group call disconnect on MBMS bearer
1\. An MCPTT group call is ongoing; the media is broadcasted over MBMS bearer
to MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3.
2\. MCPTT server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer
for the MCPTT clients
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to MCPTT
client 2, MCPTT client 3 and possibly to MCPTT client 1 (if in MBMS coverage
area) on MBMS bearer(s).
NOTE 4: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message can be sent as part of other
messages.
NOTE 5: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message and the MapGroupToBearer message can
be combined, to facilitate switching bearers in one signalling step, as
necessary.
### 10.10.5 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for switching from MBMS bearer
to unicast bearer as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service shall
use the MCPTT-1, MCPTT-4, MCPTT‑7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTT‑9 reference points for
this procedure.
### 10.10.6 Enhanced MCPTT group call setup procedure with MBMS bearer
#### 10.10.6.1 Description
When the MCPTT server initiates a new MCPTT call, the MCPTT server shall
decide to use unicast bearers or broadcast bearers for the downlink media. A
similar decision may also be made for other types of media communication e.g.
MCVideo. To decide to use broadcast or unicast involves a number of aspects.
The figure 10.10.6.1-1 specifies a procedural flow to perform such decision.
The flow described evaluates which bearer type to use for a new MCPTT group
call. It is assumed that if an MBMS bearer is active it is also announced to
the MCPTT client.
When using an MBMS bearer for application level control signalling, the
announcement of an already active MBMS bearer could be part of the MCPTT group
call setup, however that will have an impact on the call setup time.
Figure 10.10.6.1-1: MBMS bearer decision flow
On a high level the procedure outcome is to use unicast or broadcast bearers
for the new MCPTT group call. For an enhanced group call setup procedure, the
MBMS bearer may be used to trigger the use of a unicast bearer.
#### 10.10.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.10.6.2-1 can be used in the following scenarios:
\- Initiate a new call on unicast bearer
\- Transfer an ongoing call from broadcast bearer to unicast bearers
Pre-conditions:
\- There must be an active and announced MBMS bearer
Figure 10.10.6.2-1: Application Group paging over an MBMS bearer
1\. The MCPTT server initiates a new MCPTT group call on unicast or decides to
transfer an ongoing call to unicast.
2\. The MCPTT sends an application group paging message on the MBMS bearer to
inform the MCPTT client that the MCPTT server will initiate media transmission
over a unicast bearer.
NOTE: The group paging message is sent with the assumption that there are UEs
in idle mode. Furthermore, this message is an application level paging message
and does not replace the normal paging procedure executed by EPC and RAN.
3\. In the case that the UE is in idle mode the UE will initiate a service
request to transfer the UE to connected mode.
4\. The MCPTT server stops sending the media over an MBMS bearer. This step is
only performed if transferring an ongoing call.
5\. The MCPTT server initiates the media transmission over the unicast bearer.
Step 4-5 may be performed in parallel with step 2-3. Step 5 will trigger a
normal paging in EPC and RAN if the client is still in idle mode.

## 10.12 MCPTT media plane transmissions with partner MCPTT systems (on-
network)
The MCPTT user is able to receive MCPTT media services (e.g. group
communication, private calls) from partner MCPTT systems in normal and roaming
conditions. In this service delivery model, the media plane transmissions
between the MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT system can be achieved
directly or via the primary MCPTT system, selected by the PLMN operator\'s
policy. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.
Figure 10.12-1 provides the procedure for media related signalling.
Figure 10.12-2 provide the procedure for the media transmission (directly)
between MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT system.
Figure 10.12-3 provides the procedure for the media transmission (via the
primary MCPTT system) between MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT
system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is defined in the partner MCPTT system, where the MCPTT
client of user receives the MCPTT service.
2\. An MCPTT group call is set up and active.
3\. The partner MCPTT system is the group host MCPTT server that is hosting
the MCPTT group. The corresponding floor control server manages the media
corresponding to the group call.
4\. Protocol used for signalling of media plane is non-SIP, it can be protocol
like RTCP.
5\. Media related signalling is sent via the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The path for media between the MCPTT UE and partner MCPTT system has been
selected to be sent directly to the partner MCPTT system or via the primary
MCPTT system based on PLMN operator\'s policy.
Figure 10.12-1: Media related signalling communication
Figure 10.12-2: Media communication direct
Figure 10.12-3: Media communication via primary MCPTT system
For media related signalling communication:
1\. An MCPTT user wants to talk.
2\. The floor participant corresponding to the MCPTT user sends a floor
request message to floor control server (partner MCPTT system) to get the
authorization and/or permission to talk.
3\. The floor control server (partner MCPTT system) performs the authorization
and arbitrates between requests that are in contention (i.e., floor control).
4\. If the floor control server (partner MCPTT system) allows the floor
participant to talk, a floor granted is provided with permission granted to
talk.
For media communication:
5\. The MCPTT client can now send uplink media data to the media distribution
function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system).
6\. The media distribution function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system)
has downlink media data to transfer.
7\. The media distribution function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system)
transfers the downlink media to the MCPTT client of the MCPTT user.
## 10.13 Location information (on-network)
The MCPTT system makes use of all of the procedures for location management as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], utilising the CSC-14 reference point between
the location management client and location management server and the CSC‑15
reference point between the MCPTT server and location management server.
\- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;
\- The MC service server is the MCPTT server;
\- The MC service group is the MCPTT group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCPTT ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCPTT group ID.
## 10.14 Ambient listening call
### 10.14.1 General
The ambient listening call is a type of a private MCPTT call that only allows
a \"listened to\" user to transmit media to a \"listening\" user such that
there is no indication on the MCPTT UE of the \"listened to\" user about the
call and the media transmission.
NOTE 1: \"listened to\" user refers to the user who is transmitting media in
an ambient listening call.
NOTE 2: \"listening\" user refers to the user who is receiving media in an
ambient listening call.
There are two types of ambient listening call as below:
\- Remotely initiated ambient listening is initiated by the authorized user
(e.g., dispatcher) who wants to listen to another user. In this case, the
\"listened to\" user is the called party, and shall automatically accept the
call without causing any indication about the call and transmit the media to
the \"listening\" user.
\- Locally initiated ambient listening is initiated by an authorized user who
wants another user to listen to the MCPTT UE communication. In this case, the
\"listened to\" user is the calling party and shall automatically transmit the
media to the \"listening\" user without causing any indication about the call
processing and media transmission.

## 10.15 First-to-answer call setup
### 10.15.1 Description
Figure 10.15.3-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client initiating
MCPTT first-to-answer call. The flow may use a floor request in the MCPTT call
request indicating that the originator will be given the floor when the call
starts and eliminates the need for a separate initial floor request message
during media plane establishment. Alternatively the call initiation may be
sent without the floor request, which allows the called party to request the
floor first. For a MCPTT first-to-answer call without floor control, floor
control is not established.
### 10.15.2 Information flows for first-to-answer call
Editor\'s note: Information flows for first-to-answer call to be included.
### 10.15.3 Procedure
All clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure
10.15.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected first-to-answer call
2\. **MCPTT clients 1 to n are registered and their respective users, MCPTT
user 1 to MCPTT user n, are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT
service** , as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
Figure 10.15.3-1: MCPTT first-to-answer call -- MCPTT users in the same MCPTT
system
**1**. **MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to establish a MCPTT first-
to-answer call** indicating a set of potential target recipients**. For a
MCPTT first-to-answer call with floor control, floor control is to be
established. For first-to-answer call without floor control, both users will
have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.**
2\. **MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request including a
set of potential target recipients, using an MCPTT service identifier as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request
to the MCPTT server). The MCPTT first-to-answer call request contains the
MCPTT ID of originating user and an SDP offer containing one or more media
types. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request may also contain a data element
that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor, for a first-to-
answer call with floor control. The MCPTT client 1 includes a first-to-answer
call indication that the call is to be established only to the first answering
user.**
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the target recipients are pre-configured and
included by the MCPTT server.
3\. The MCPTT server confirms that MCPTT users are authorized for the call and
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a first-to-
answer call.
4\. The MCPTT server **determines the list of MCPTT users to send MCPTT first-
to-answer call request, based on a set of** potential target recipients
**obtained from the request from MCPTT client 1**
5a, 5b, 5c. **The MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using
MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types
contained in the initial received request and sends similar MCPTT first-to-
answer call request to each** potential target recipient**, including the
MCPTT ID of the calling MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1. If one or more called
MCPTT users have registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and
has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the calls, then the incoming MCPTT
first-to-answer call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
Otherwise MCPTT first-to-answer call request may be delivered to all the
registered MCPTT UEs.**
6a, 6b, 6c. The MCPTT users are alerted, regardless of the commencement mode.
7\. MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 accepted the call which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server.
NOTE: MCPTT server does not divert MCPTT first-to-answer call to voicemail if
MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 has not accepted the incoming call.
8\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-asnwer call response to MCPTT
client 1 indicating that MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 has accepted the
call, including the accepted media parameters.
9\. The media plane for communication is established. Either user can transmit
media individually when using floor control. For successful call establishment
for first-to-answer call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the floor
participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor initially. At
the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 2 is informed
that the floor is taken. For a first-to-answer call without floor control both
users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.
10\. **MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 has also accepted the call which causes
MCPTT client 3 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT
server.**
**11\. Since the MCPTT first-to-answer call response from MCPTT client 2 is
already accepted, the MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel
request to MCPTT client 3.**
12-13. **MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 may be notified that the MCPTT first-to-
answer call is released with a reason for call release and MCPTT client 3
sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel response.**
14\. **MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to all
other MCPTT first-to-answer call request receiving users from that call. This
step may happen immediately after Step 9.**
**15-16. MCPTT user at MCPTT client n may be notified that the MCPTT first-to-
answer call is cancelled with a reason for call cancel and MCPTT client n
sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel response.**
## 10.16 Remotely initiated MCPTT call
### 10.16.1 General
A remotely initiated MCPTT call allows an authorized user to cause a remote
MCPTT UE to initiate a call by itself, without its user explicitly initiating
the call.
#### 10.16.2 Information flows for remotely initiated MCPTT call
##### 10.16.2.1 Remotely initiated MCPTT call request
Table 10.16.2.1-1 describes the information flow remotely initiated MCPTT call
request from the MCPTT client to the MCPTT server and from the MCPTT server to

### 10.16.3 Procedure
#### 10.16.3.1 Remotely initiated MCPTT call request
The remotely initiated MCPTT call request procedure includes the initial
remotely initiated MCPTT call request from the MCPTT user to the remote UE and
either the MCPTT private call procedures or the MCPTT group call procedures
originating at the remote UE.
Procedures in figure 10.16.3.1-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating a remotely initiated MCPTT call request with
the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. If the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 wants the resulting remotely initiated
MCPTT call to be:
a. an MCPTT group call, then MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 is an affiliated
MCPTT group member of the MCPTT group that is the target of the remotely
initiated MCPTT call. Otherwise prior to these procedures the MCPTT user 1 on
MCPTT client 1 can use existing procedures (e.g., remotely change MCPTT group
affiliation (10.3.5.1.1), if authorized, to satisfy the necessary
preconditions for the MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 to initiated a MCPTT
group call from that MCPTT group.
b. an MPCTT private call, then the MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 is permitted
to initiate an MCPTT private call to the identified MCPTT user.
Figure 10.16.3.1-1: Remotely initiated MCPTT call request
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 initiates a remotely initiated MCPTT call
request to the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a remotely initiated MCPTT call request towards the
MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized
to initiate a remotely initiated MCPTT call request.
4\. If authorized, MCPTT server sends the corresponding remotely initiated
MCPTT call request towards the MCPTT client 2.
5\. Based on the received information the receiving MCPTT client 2 may notify
the user of the remotely initiated MCPTT call request.
6\. Optionally the receiving MCPTT client 2 sends a remotely initiated MCPTT
call response to the MCPTT server.
7\. After receiving the remotely initiated MCPTT call response from MCPTT
client 2, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful
remotely initiated MCPTT call request.
NOTE 1: Step 6 and step 7 might not be sent, since it could be determined that
the remotely initiated MCPTT call was successful by receiving the MCPTT call
initiated by MCPTT client 2.
8\. Based on the received information the MCPTT client 2 initiates an MCPTT
call (either an MCPTT group call or an MCPTT private call) using the normal
MCPTT call establishment procedures (10.6.2.3.1.1.2 or 10.7.2.2) with implicit
floor request.
NOTE 2: Step 6 and step 7 are received in this order. However, step 6 or step
7 or both might occur before or after step 8.
The result of these procedures is an on-going MCPTT (group or private) call
which includes MCPTT client 1.
## 10.17 Support for multiple devices
### 10.17.1 General
An MCPTT user may be authorized to use the MCPTT service from multiple MCPTT
UEs as per the procedure in subclause 10.2.
If an MCPTT server receives a service authorization request for an MCPTT user
who is previously MCPTT service authorized on another MCPTT UE, then the MCPTT
server shall process this service authorization request as described in
subclause 10.2. In the MCPTT service authorization response to the MCPTT user,
the MCPTT server shall also indicate that the MCPTT user is already MCPTT
service authorized from another MCPTT UE.
Editor\'s Note: How to log off remotely from MCPTT clients on one or more
other MCPTT UEs that the MCPTT user is already MCPTT service authorized from
is FFS.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MCPTT related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCPTT service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCPTT UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCPTT user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCPTT related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCPTT service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on‑network and off‑network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCPTT UE, MCPTT
group, MCPTT user and MCPTT service configuration data refers to the
information that will be stored against each MCPTT UE, MCPTT group, MCPTT user
and MCPTT service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and
off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration
category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data
category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.179
[2] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] or 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] or the corresponding
subclause from the present document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCPTT UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCPTT UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCPTT UE after MCPTT
authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-2 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCPTT service.
Table A.2-1: UE configuration data (on and off network)
* * *
Reference Parameter description [R-5. 4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] Maximum
number of simultaneous group calls (Nc4) [R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17]
Maximum number of transmissions (Nc5) in a group [R-5.5.2-007] of 3GPP TS
22.280 [17] Maximum number of private calls (N10)

3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) Subclause 5.2.7 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] Indication of
whether the UE shall use IPv4 or IPv6 for on-network MCPTT MCPTT server >
Server URI NOTE: When the value of the parameter Relay service is N, this
parameter and its child parameters are not needed.
* * *
# A.3 MCPTT user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT user profile configuration data is
stored in the MCPTT user database. The MCPTT server obtains the MCPTT user
profile configuration data from the MCPTT user database (MCPTT-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCPTT user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCPTT service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3 contain
the MCPTT user profile configuration required to support the use of off-
network MCPTT service. Data in table A.3-1 and A.3-3 can be configured offline
using the CSC-11 reference point.

# A.5 MCPTT service configuration data
The general aspects of MC service configuration are specified in 3GPP TS
23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service configuration data is stored in the MCPTT
server.
Tables A.5-1 and A.5-2 describe the configuration data required to support the
use of on-network MCPTT service. Tables A.5-1 and A.5-3 describe the
configuration data required to support the use of off-network MCPTT service.
Data in tables A.5-1and A.5-3 can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Local UE settings for MCPTT
# B.1 Local UE settings for MCPTT
Table B.1-1 details local UE settings for MCPTT that represent important
functionalities that may be required by MCPTT UEs, however these
functionalities do not require central configuration like the parameters in
annex A, so these are detailed in this annex for information to UE vendors
interested in producing MCPTT UEs. The various columns in the tables have the
following meanings:
\- Reference: Is the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS
22.179 [2].
\- Definition: A short definition of the local UE setting.
