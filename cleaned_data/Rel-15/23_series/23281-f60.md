# 4 Introduction
The MCVideo service supports video media communication between several users
(i.e. group call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the
permission to stream video in an arbitrated manner. The MCVideo service also
supports private calls between two users.
The MCVideo architecture is based on the functional architecture for mission
critical communication services defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Media routing requirements
The video media flow for a private call shall be routed according to one of
the following two options:
a) Option 1:
1) Through the primary MCVideo system if both users in the call belong to the
same organisation; or
2) Through the primary MCVideo system of each users, if the users in the call
do not belong to the same organisation.
b) Option 2: The video media flow may be routed locally, under the control of
the primary MCVideo system, through an entity allowing the duplication of the
media flow to the primary MCVideo system of each user.
The video media flow for a group call shall be routed to the group home
MCVideo system.
## 5.2 MCVideo group affiliation and MCVideo group de-affiliation
MCVideo group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCVideo service for MCVideo users affiliated to MCVideo groups:
\- MCVideo users receive notifications for MCVideo group call setup and
invitations for their affiliated MCVideo group(s).
\- MCVideo users select an affiliated MCVideo group to initiate a new group
MCVideo call or transmit media in an existing MCVideo group call.
\- MCVideo users receive media and events from their affiliated MCVideo
group(s).
## 5.3 Device inventory requirements
The MCVideo service shall provide device inventory capabilities for MCVideo
UEs. The device inventory capabilities shall include:
\- device information registration;
\- device information storage; and
\- device information query.
## 5.4 Device discovery requirements (off-network)
The MCVideo service shall provide device discovery for devices as requested by
the MCVideo user according to the MC service provider policy for off-network
operations.
## 5.5 Bearer management
### 5.5.1 General
The MCVideo UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6]. The MCVideo UE shall use the MC services APN as defined in
subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] for the SIP-1 reference point.
### 5.5.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[6] shall apply.
### 5.5.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCVideo
For an MCVideo call session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCVideo system shall request resources over
Rx to a PCRF. It is recommended that the dedicated bearer(s) for video media
and control of the video media (i.e. MCVideo‑4 and MCVideo‑7) utilise the QCI
values depending on the MCVideo mode of the MCVideo call/session, as per table
5.5.3-1. For transmission and reception control signalling, the QCI value of
69 is recommended as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [11]. The request of
resources over Rx shall include an application identifier for MCVideo in order
for the PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
Table 5.5.3-1: QCI values to use for EPS unicast bearers for each MCVideo mode
* * *
MCVideo mode QCI value utilised\ (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [11])
Urgent real-time mode 67
Non-urgent real-time mode 67
Non real-time mode 4
* * *
The MCVideo audio media and video media may transmit over separate EPS
bearers, in which case the priority for each bearer is determined by the
operator policy. Depending on operator policy, the MCVideo system may be able
to request modification of the priority (ARP) of an existing bearer without
the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer.
NOTE: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
When MCVideo audio media and video media are multiplexed into one EPS bearer,
then different QCI and/or ARP values are not possible for video and audio
media.
### 5.5.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
# 5A Involved business relationships
The description of the involved business relationships for the MCVideo service
is contained in clause 6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].

## 6.2 Functional entities description
### 6.2.1 General
Each subclause is a description of a functional entity and does not imply a
physical entity.
### 6.2.2 MCVideo service application plane
#### 6.2.2.1 General
Entities within the application plane of MCVideo service provide application
control, media transmission control and distribution functions.
#### 6.2.2.2 Common services core
The description of the common services core entities are contained in common
functional architecture for MC services over LTE in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
#### 6.2.2.3 MCVideo application service
##### 6.2.2.3.1 MCVideo client
The MCVideo client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCVideo
application transactions.
The MCVideo client is responsible for remote device control. This functional
entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-network operations.
##### 6.2.2.3.2 MCVideo server
The MCVideo server functional entity provides centralised support for MCVideo
services.
All the MCVideo clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCVideo server for that group. An MCVideo client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCVideo servers.
The MCVideo server is an instantiation of a MC service server in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
The MCVideo server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of
the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications.
The MCVideo server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client
and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
This MCVideo server provides support for centralised media transmission
control for on-network and distributed media transmission control for off-
network operation.
The MCVideo server is responsible for managing and providing the device
information that can participate in MCVideo communications. The device
information is further associated to MCVideo users to manage remote device
control authorization. The device information is provisioned to the MCVideo
server by the MCVideo service provider, mission critical organization and the
MCVideo user.
##### 6.2.2.3.3 Media distribution function
The media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media
to MCVideo clients. By means of information provided by the MCVideo server
(e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following
functionality:
\- provide for the reception of uplink MCVideo UE media transmission by means
of the MCVideo-7 reference point;
\- storing the received media stream as MCVideo content files;
\- replicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using
unicast transport;
\- distribute downlink media to MCVideo UEs by IP unicast transmission to
those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCVideo-7
reference point;
\- distribute downlink media to MCVideo UEs using multicast downlink transport
of media for the call by means of the MCVideo-8 reference point; and
\- provide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined
into a single media stream for transmission to the MCVideo UE.
NOTE 1: If media mixing function occurs within the media distribution
function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.
NOTE 2: A media mixing function within the media distribution function is not
possible where the media is end to end encrypted.
##### 6.2.2.3.4 Media mixer
This functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for sending and
receiving one or multiple media streams. It also provides support for
combining multiple media streams into one media stream through the enforcement
of media policy information. It supports the storing of a media stream as
MCVideo content files.
##### 6.2.2.3.5 MCVideo user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCVideo user profile
associated with an MCVideo ID that is held by the MCVideo service provider at
the application plane. The MCVideo user profile is determined by the mission
critical organization, the MCVideo service provider, and potentially the
MCVideo user.
The MCVideo ID is a MC service ID as described in clause 8 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[6]. The MCVideo user profile is a MC service user profile as described in
clause 10.1.4 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
The MCVideo user profile can be co-located with other MC service user profiles
and stored in a common MC service user database.
##### 6.2.2.3.6 Transmission control server
This functional entity provides support for centralised transmission control
for on-network and distributed transmission control for off-network operation.
It may schedule transmission requests according to uplink criteria from
different transmission control participants, send an notification to all
transmission control participants to allow them to receive the video according
to downlink criteria if the transmission request is granted, and provide
queuing in cases of contention. Transmission control applies to all MCVideo
communications including group call and private call. For on-network
operation, this functional entity is located with the MCVideo server. For off-
network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.
##### 6.2.2.3.7 Transmission control participant
The transmission control participant functional entity is responsible for
handling outgoing transmission requests and the incoming video stream
invitations and notifications. This functional entity is located in the UE for
both on-network and off-network operations.
##### 6.2.2.3.8 MC gateway server
The MC gateway server provides support for MCVideo interconnection services
with a partner MCVideo system in a different trust domain whilst providing
topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCVideo servers in the
partner MCVideo system without needing to expose the MCVideo servers in the
primary MCVideo system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCVideo
system. It may be a role of the MCVideo server described in subclause
6.2.2.3.2 of the present document.
The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor
control signalling messages, and media between MCVideo servers within the
MCVideo system and the interconnected MCVideo system.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a
signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [14]

#### 7.1.2.3 Group call within one MC system
##### 7.1.2.3.1 Group call models
###### 7.1.2.3.1.1 Pre-arranged group call
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.1 General {#general-5 .H6}
A pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the group members. The
initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group
members being invited.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.2 Pre-arranged group call setup {#pre-arranged-group-call-
setup .H6}
The procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo client is initiating an
MCVideo group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the
affiliated members of that group.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo group
call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCVideo users on client 1, client 2 and
client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the group management
server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A pre-arranged group is an MCVideo group that is pre-defined with MCVideo
group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the
group belong to the same MC system.
2\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and
MCVideo client 3 are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and
affiliated.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo group call with
a selected group (identified by MCVideo group ID).
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCVideo server via
the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by
MCVideo group ID. The group call request also contains the MCVideo group ID
and an SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters. If there is a
transmit media request, then the group call request contains an indication for
the implicit transmit media request.
3\. MCVideo server checks whether the user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized
to initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized and the group
call is ongoing for that MCVideo group ID, the MCVideo server adds the
requesting MCVideo client 1 to the existing MCVideo group call and notifies
the MCVideo client 1 that the MCVideo group call is already in progress.
Otherwise, MCVideo server resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the
members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information
from the group management server.
NOTE 1: MCVideo server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration
data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally
cached on the MCVideo server then MCVideo server requests the user/group
configuration data from the MCVideo user database/group management server.
4\. MCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo
service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters
contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group
call request via the SIP core towards the MCVideo clients of each of those
affiliated group members. MCVideo users are notified about the incoming group
call. The MCVideo server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the
call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo clients accept the group call request, and a group
call response is sent to the group host MCVideo server. This response may
contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be
based on configuration.
6\. MCVideo server sends the group call response including the selected media
parameters to the MCVideo client 1 through the signalling path to inform about
successful call establishment.
NOTE 2: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. If the initiating MCVideo user requires the acknowledgement from
affiliated MCVideo group members, and the required MCVideo group members do
not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged
call setup timeout\"), then the MCVideo server may proceed with or abandon the
call and then notify the initiating MCVideo user that the acknowledgements did
not include all required members according to group policy. This notification
may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than
once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo group call.
8\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established
media plane and transmission control for communication.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call {#release-pre-arranged-
group-call .H6}
The procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCVideo group call for all the participants of that
group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g.,
last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving,
or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.
NOTE: The procedure for MCVideo user leaving the group call is a different
scenario and is not considered in this solution.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo
group call.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client
3 are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-
arranged group call setup).
2\. MCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo group call which is
ongoing e.g., last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated group members are not present.
3\. MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release ongoing session.
4\. MCVideo server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards
each participant of the ongoing group call.
5\. MCVideo users are notified about the release of the group call.
6\. MCVideo client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge
towards the MCVideo server by sending a group call release response.
7\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
media transmission control and media plane resources associated with the group
call that is terminated.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.4 Late entry pre-arranged group call {#late-entry-pre-
arranged-group-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo server requesting a newly affiliated member or a
member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCVideo group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n
are on an ongoing call.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call
1\. MCVideo server determines that MCVideo client 1 which is newly affiliated
or coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group
call (late entry).
2\. MCVideo server generates group call request including the information such
as MCVideo service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request
to the MCVideo server), MC service group ID of the group invited to join,
offer one or more media types and sends towards the MCVideo client 1 via SIP
core.
3\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is notified about the incoming group
call.
4\. Upon MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 accepting the incoming group call
request, MCVideo client 1 sends the group call response including the selected
media types to the MCVideo server through the signalling path. If the incoming
group call request is rejected by the MCVideo client 1, the MCVideo server
should not resend the group call request
5\. MCVideo client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and
MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about
the MCVIDEO client 1 joining the group call.
6\. A notification with the information of media transmissions in the group
call is sent to MCVideo client1.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.5 Rejoining call {#rejoining-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client to rejoin an ongoing MCVideo group call
(e.g. coming back from out of coverage).
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n
are on an ongoing call.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call
1\. MCVideo client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group
call, then the MCVideo client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including
the ongoing group call information.
2\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo client 1 can rejoin the ongoing
call (e.g. based upon affiliation status).
3\. MCVideo client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by
sending a group call rejoin response.
4\. MCVideo client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and
MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about
the MCVideo client 1 joining the group call.
5\. A notification with the information of media transmissions in the group
call is sent to MCVideo client 1.
###### 7.1.2.3.1.2 Chat group call
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.1 General {#general-6 .H6}
In a chat group call model, the MCVideo user individually joins a group call
without being explicity invited by the MCVideo server. The establishment of a
chat group call does not result in other group members being invited.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCVideo client
initiating an MCVideo group call which uses the chat group call model. The
chat group call model can be used to realize the video conferencing service
where only users that have been configured as participants for the video
conferencing are allowed to join the group communications for the given group.
Chat group call join mechanism:
\- Each MCVideo client sends a group call join request when the MCVideo user
wants to participate in the group communication for the group. (This message
does not impact the MCVideo user\'s membership in the group; the MCVideo
server will verify that the MCVideo user is an authorized member of the
group.)
\- The group call join request may include a transmit media request. It is
assumed that the group call join request will be delivered from MCVideo client
to MCVideo server using SIP.
\- The group call join request is used to indicate to the MCVideo server that
the MCVideo user associated with the given MCVideo client wishes to
participate (begin to receive notifications for media transmissions) from the
group.
\- The group call join request may cause the MCVideo server to generate an
implicit affiliation for the MCVideo user to the group, if the user is not
already affiliated to the group.
\- The group call join request normally contains the information needed to
negotiate media parameters between MCVideo server and MCVideo client for the
group call. The group call join request can take the form of a SIP invite.
Subsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat
model:
\- Once an MCVideo client successfully joins a group call which is using the
chat model, the MCVideo client connects to the media plane for the media
transmission if the media transmission is currently ongoing.
\- If the MCVideo group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCVideo
clients on the group call are not sending or receiving media) then the newly
joined MCVideo client will only have pre-established its media parameters for
the call.
\- If the newly joined MCVideo user wishes to transmit media to the affiliated
users of the group using the chat model, then the MCVideo client using its
associated transmission control participant would follow a normal transmission
control procedure for transmitting the media.
\- Subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using transmission
control signalling.
\- The MCVideo server may tear down the media plane between successive group
calls using the chat model, or the MCVideo server may allow the media plane to
remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on
resources.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.2 Chat group call setup {#chat-group-call-setup .H6}
MCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCVideo
service provider in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo user 2 and MCVideo user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to
the group call. MCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and
all users (MCVideo user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and
authorized to use the MCVideo service.
2\. No call is currently in progress for the group.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCVideo chat group call
1\. MCVideo user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group.
This may include a transmit media request.
1a. MCVideo client 1 sends a group join request with the MCVideo group ID of
the desired group. It contains the MCVideo user\'s MCVideo ID and the MCVideo
client media parameters. If there is a request for media transmission, then
the group join request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media
request.
1b. The MCVideo server receives the group join request. MCVideo server
generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCVideo user is not already
affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCVideo user 1 is authorized to
affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure for MCVideo.
1c. The MCVideo server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCVideo server
selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.
2\. If MCVideo user 1 requests to transmit media by sending transmit media
request to MCVideo server, the MCVideo server establishes the media plane (if
not already established) for the call.
3\. Transmission control will continue to be used by the transmission control
participants associated with MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo
client 3 for the duration of the call.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat group call {#release-chat-group-call .H6}
The procedure describes the case where the MCVideo server releases an ongoing
MCVideo group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least
one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to chat duration expiry,
last participant leaving or initiator leaving.
NOTE 1: The procedure for an MCVideo user leaving the group call is a
different procedure.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCVideo server
initiating the release of an ongoing MCVideo group call.
The following precondition applies:
\- A group call is ongoing between MCVideo clients 1, 2 and 3
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.3-1: Release chat group call
1\. MCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo group call which is
ongoing e.g., due to chat duration expiry, last participant leaving, or
initiator leaving.
2\. MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release the ongoing session.
3\. MCVideo server sends a group call release request towards each participant
of the ongoing group call.
NOTE 2: The group call release request can also be sent over SIP signalling on
the signalling plane.
4\. MCVideo users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. Optionally the MCVideo client(s) receiving group call release request, may
send a group call release response to the MCVideo server.
NOTE 3: The MCVideo client can send group call release response when the group
call release request is sent using a unicast bearer.
6\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 release the transmission control
and media plane resources associated with the group call that is released.
Successful release of the group call does not affect the status of affiliation
of any of the clients.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.4 Rejoin a chat group call {#rejoin-a-chat-group-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.4-1 are for the MCVideo server rejoining a
MCVideo client coming back from out of coverage to rejoin an ongoing MCVideo
group call using chat group call model.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. MCVideo users using MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n are in an ongoing
MCVideo chat group call.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.4-1: Rejoin an on-going chat group call
1\. MCVideo server determines that MCVideo client 1 requires to rejoin an on-
going chat group call which has returned from being out of coverage.
2\. MCVideo server sends group call rejoin request to MCVideo client 1.
3\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is notified to rejoin an on-going chat
group call.
4\. Upon MCVideo client 1 accepting the group call rejoin request, MCVideo
client 1 sends a group call rejoin response to the MCVideo server.
5\. MCVideo client 1 is successfully rejoined the ongoing group call and
MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about
the MCVideo client 1 joining the group call.
6\. Notification with the information of the media transmissions in the group
call is sent to MCVideo client 1.
##### 7.1.2.3.2 Exiting group call due to de-affiliation
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo server requesting a newly de-affiliated member to leave an
ongoing MCVideo group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n are on an ongoing
call.
3\. MCVideo client 1 has been de-affiliated from the MCVideo group.
Figure 7.1.2.3.2-1: Exiting MCVideo group call due to de-affiliation
1\. MCVideo client 1 which has been de-affiliated is instructed to leave the
ongoing group call.
2\. MCVideo server sends a group call leave request to MCVideo client 1.
3\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is notified about leaving the group call.
4\. MCVideo client 1 sends the group call leave response and leaves the group
call.
5\. MCVideo client 1 is now removed from the ongoing group call and MCVideo
users at MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n may be notified that MCVideo
client 1 has left the group call.
#### 7.1.2.4 Broadcast group call
##### 7.1.2.4.1 General
A broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCVideo
user expects no response from the other MCVideo users, i.e. no response from
the recipients is required to start media transmission and the call ends when
the media transmission is complete.
##### 7.1.2.4.2 Common broadcast group call procedure
Only the call originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call
and the broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete.
Figure 7.1.2.4.2-1 illustrates the common procedure both for group-broadcast
group call and user-broadcast group call.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are members of a group-broadcast
group/user-broadcast group.
Figure 7.1.2.4.2-1: Broadcast group call
1\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup
procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling
procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause
7.1.2.3.1.1 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call
indicator.
2\. MCVideo client 1 starts to transmit media.
NOTE 1: Only the call originating MCVideo user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call.
NOTE 2: A broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has
priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A
broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over
group calls on its subordinate groups.
3\. If the media transmission from call originating MCVideo user is complete,
the broadcast group call is released.

The procedure describes the case where an MCVideo client is initiating an
MCVideo emergency group call with the affiliated MCVideo group members of that
MCVideo group. An MCVideo client in the MCVideo emergency state gains elevated
access privilege for all of the MCVideo user\'s mission critical applications.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo emergency group
call with an MCVideo group i.e., MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo
client 2 and MCVideo client 3 belong to the same MCVideo group which is
defined on group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user
home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.
3\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been provisioned with an MCVideo group
that has been designated via provisioning as the MCVideo emergency group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 7.1.2.5.1.1-1: MCVideo emergency group call
1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency group
call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency
state is retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo group call request towards the MCVideo
server. The request contains an indication of the MCVideo emergency. The
MCVideo server records the identity of the MCVideo user that initiated the
MCVideo emergency group call until the MCVideo emergency is cancelled. Once an
MCVideo emergency call has been initiated, the MCVideo group is considered to
be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled. If configured to send an
MCVideo emergency alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency group call, the
request also contains an indication that an MCVideo emergency alert is to be
initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit media
request.
3\. The MCVideo server implicitly affiliates MCVideo client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 is
authorized for initiation of MCVideo emergency calls on the indicated MCVideo
group, and if authorized, it resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the
members of that MCVideo group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
5\. The MCVideo server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCVideo group.
NOTE 3: Successive calls during the MCVideo group\'s in-progress emergency
state will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the
MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an
indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCVideo emergency alert.
7\. MCVideo users are notified of the incoming MCVideo group call.
8\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call
response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo emergency group call
request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the
MCVideo user 1 to inform the successful MCVideo emergency call establishment.
NOTE 4: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCVideo transmission control
participant 1, transmission control participant 2 and transmission control
participant 3 exchange transmission control information e.g., MCVideo client 1
receives the transmit media granted information over the established media
plane, while the other MCVideo client\'s receive media available notification
with forced reception information. MCVideo client 1 indicates to the MCVideo
user that the permission is granted to transmit media, while the other MCVideo
clients in the MCVideo emergency group call will be receiving that media.
MCVideo client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are
also in the MCVideo emergency state.
###### 7.1.2.5.1.2 MCVideo group call upgraded to an MCVideo emergency group
call
The procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is upgrading
an MCVideo group call to an MCVideo emergency group call while the MCVideo
group call is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client upgrading an MCVideo group call on an MCVideo group to
an MCVideo emergency group call.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user
home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.
3\. An MCVideo group call is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been configured to send an MCVideo
emergency alert when upgrading an MCVideo emergency group call.
Figure 7.1.2.5.1.2-1: MCVideo group call upgraded to an MCVideo emergency
group call
1\. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCVideo
client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCVideo client 1 requests the MCVideo server to upgrade the MCVideo group
to an in-progress emergency state by sending an MCVideo emergency group call
request. If configured to send an MCVideo alert when initiating an MCVideo
emergency upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo
alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit
transmit media request.
3\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all
participants in the MCVideo group.
4\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the
MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request
contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the
originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert.
5\. MCVideo users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the
MCVideo group.
6\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call
response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo group emergency
request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the
MCVideo user 1 to confirm the upgrade request. If the MCVideo emergency
request contained an implicit transmit media request, the OK message contains
the result of the implicit transmit media request.
NOTE 2: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 continue with the
MCVideo group call, which has been transformed into an MCVideo emergency group
call. MCVideo client 1 can override other clients in the call except those
that are also in the MCVideo emergency state.
###### 7.1.2.5.1.3 MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
NOTE 1: In Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this
subclause is \"MCVideo emergency group call cancel\".
The procedure describes the case where an MCVideo client cancels an MCVideo
group\'s in-progress emergency.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a group.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user
home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.
NOTE 3: The end of the MCVideo emergency group call does not cancel the
MCVideo group\'s in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an
authorized user using this procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.

1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo in-progress
emergency group state cancel.
NOTE 4: An MCVideo user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCVideo group can also be authorised to cancel the MCVideo emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCVideo emergency state.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
request to the MCVideo server.
NOTE 5: When MCVideo emergency alerts are in effect together with an MCVideo
in-progress emergency group state on the same MCVideo group, the MCVideo
emergency alert can, under some circumstances be cancelled at the same time.
In that case, the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state request carries an
indication that the alert is also being cancelled.
3\. MCVideo server resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of
that MCVideo group and their affiliation status, based upon the information
from group management server.
4\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCVideo server cancels/resets the
emergency in-progress state of the MCVideo group.
5\. The MCVideo server sends an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state
cancel request to the MCVideo group members.
6\. MCVideo group members are notified of the MCVideo in-progress emergency
group state cancel.
7\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo in-progress emergency group
state cancel response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo in-
progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
8\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state
cancel response to the MCVideo user 1 to confirm the MCVideo in-progress
emergency group state cancel. If the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state
cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCVideo
client 1 resets its local emergency status.

#### 7.1.3.3 Group communication setup
##### 7.1.3.3.1 General
A group communication setup is initiated by one member of a pre-configured
MCVideo group and ends up with an established MCVideo group between multiple
MCVideo clients ready for video sharing.
##### 7.1.3.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.1.3.3.2-1 describes procedures to establish a MCVideo group
communication with other MCVideo clients.
Once the MCVideo group communication is established the MCVideo clients send
Group communication announcement periodically.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo
client 1 to client N.
2\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are members of the same MCVideo
group.
3\. MCVideo user 1 has initiated MCVideo group communication.
Figure 7.1.3.3.2-1: MCVideo group communication setup
1\. MCVideo client 1 sends a Group communication announcement message to the
MCVideo group.
2\. Upon receiving the Group communication announcement message, all MCVideo
clients that are not part of an ongoing group communication for the MCVideo
group indicated in the Group communication announcement message set parameters
for the media plane as described in the Group communication announcement
message.
3\. The MCVideo clients send a group communication answer response to the
MCVideo group confirming the participation in the MCVideo group communication.
On receiving a group communication answer response message from at least one
MCVideo client, other MCVideo clients need not send a group communication
answer response message. If the Group communication announcement message
included a confirm mode indication, then the MCVideo clients should send a
group communication answer response message.
NOTE 1: MCVideo client 1 should wait for at least one group communication
answer response message before transmitting video to the MCVideo group.
4\. MCVideo client 1 checks the participants of the MCVideo group
communication through the received group communication answer response
messages.
NOTE 2: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group communication, the Group communication
announcement message, including parameters for media delivery, is periodically
sent.
NOTE 3: Group communication announcement may include user ID, group ID, media
type codec, control port for transmission video, video resolution and video
frame rate, video mode, last chage time of video mode etc.
5\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully
established the media plane and transmission control for communication.
#### 7.1.3.4 Passive join to group communication
##### 7.1.3.4.1 General
There is ongoing group communication between multiple MCVideo clients. Another
MCVideo client, after becoming aware of that group communication and after it
has received periodically sent communication parameters, joins the group with
or without sending an indication to other group members.
##### 7.1.3.4.2 Procedure
Figure 7.1.3.4.2-1 describes procedures to join a MCVideo group communication
passively.
The MCVideo client X passively waits for a Group communication announcement
message. Upon receiving a periodic Group communication announcement message,
MCVideo client X establishes media plane and joins the MCVideo group
communication.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo
client 1 to client N and client X.
2\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N and MCVideo client X are members of
the same MCVideo group.
3\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are part of an ongoing MCVideo group
communication.
Figure 7.1.3.4.2-1: Passive join to MCVideo group communication
1\. Another MCVideo client X enters in the communication range after the
MCVideo group communication establishment. The MCVideo client X does not do
anything and passively waits for a periodic Group communication announcement
message.
2\. An MCVideo client which is part of the ongoing MCVideo group communication
eventually sends a periodic Group communication announcement message.
3\. Upon receiving the periodic Group communication announcement message
MCVideo client X sets the parameters for media plane as described in the Group
communication announcement message.
4\. If the Group communication announcement message included a confirm mode
indication, MCVideo client X may sends a group communication answer response
towards MCVideo group to inform all MCVideo group members of its participation
the MCVideo group communication.
5\. MCVideo group communication continues with the MCVideo client X.
#### 7.1.3.5 Active join to group communication
##### 7.1.3.5.1 General
There is ongoing group communication between multiple MCVideo clients. Another
MCVideo client, after becoming aware of that group communication, sends a
request to get the required communication parameters and after feedback joins
the group with or without sending an indication to other group members.
##### 7.1.3.5.2 Procedure
Figure 7.1.3.5.2-1 describes procedures to join a MCVideo group communication
actively.
The MCVideo client X sends a Group communication announcement message towards
the MCVideo group.
Upon receiving a Group communication announcement message with new
communication parameters, such as communication identifier, a MCVideo client
participating in the on-going group communication for the MCVideo group sends
a Group communication announcement message.
The Group communication announcement message contains parameters for the on-
going MCVideo group communication. MCVideo client X upon receiving such a
Group communication announcement message establishes the media plane as
described in the message and joins the MCVideo group communication.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo
client 1 to client N and client X.
2\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N and MCVideo client X are members of
the same MCVideo group.
3\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are part of an ongoing MCVideo group
communication.

#### 7.1.3.8 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 7.1.3.8.1 Emergency group communication
The off-network emergency group communication is a special case of off-network
(non-emergency) group communication as defined in subclause 7.1.3.2, subclause
7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause 7.1.3.6 and subclause
7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to
support MCVideo emergency group communications:
\- As a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency communication has
previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group designated as the MCVideo
emergency group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo emergency group
communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client could have
been provisioned for emergency behaviour on the selected MCVideo group.
\- The group communication announcement contains an indication that the
MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo emergency communication
regardless of whether or not the MCVideo client is in communication. Group
communication participants learn of the MCVideo group\'s in-progress emergency
state from the indication.
\- Every communication initiated by the MCVideo client will be an emergency
communication while the MCVideo client is in MCVideo emergency state.
\- The MCVideo client enters the MCVideo emergency state when initiating an
MCVideo emergency communication or emergency alert. Only the MCVideo user of
the MCVideo client can clear the client\'s local MCVideo emergency state.
\- The MCVideo group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the
communication ends.
\- The MCVideo user who initiated the emergency communication, or upgraded the
group communication to emergency group communication, or an authorized user,
may cancel the in-progress emergency state with an MCVideo emergency group
communication cancel message. The message is sent to the MCVideo group.
\- When the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state,
every client returns the value of Prose Per Packet Priority to its default
value.
\- An in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an emergency
group communication when the periodic group communication announcement
contains the emergency indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency
state of MCVideo group communication.
\- An MCVideo group communication upgraded to emergency group communication
does not affect the state of other MCVideo communication(s) in the client.
\- The MCVideo group remains in the in-progress emergency state until the
emergency group communication ends or the in-progress emergency state is
cancelled.
##### 7.1.3.8.2 MCVideo imminent peril
The off-network imminent peril group communication is a special case of off-
network (non-imminent peril) group communication as defined in subclause
7.1.3.2, subclause 7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause
7.1.3.6 and subclause 7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the
aforementioned subclauses to support MCVideo imminent peril communications:
\- As a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril communication
has previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group to be used as the
MCVideo imminent peril group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo imminent
peril group communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client
could have been provisioned for imminent peril behaviour on the selected
MCVideo group.
\- The group communication announcement contains an indication that the
MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo imminent peril communication.
Group communication participants learn of the MCVideo group\'s in-progress
imminent peril condition from the indication.
\- The MCVideo group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled
when the communication ends.
\- The MCVideo user who initiated the in-progress imminent peril communication
or upgraded the group communication to imminent peril group communication, or
an authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an
MCVideo imminent peril group communication cancel message. The message is sent
to the communication participants.
\- When the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress imminent peril
state, every MCVideo client returns the value of Prose Per Packet Priority to
its default value.
\- An in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an imminent peril
group communication when the periodic group communication announcement
contains the imminent peril indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to imminent
peril state of MCVideo group communication.
\- The MCVideo group remains in the in-progress imminent peril state until the
imminent peril group communication ends or the in-progress imminent peril
state is cancelled.
#### 7.1.3.9 MCVideo emergency alert
##### 7.1.3.9.1 General
The MCVideo client use emergency alert initiation and emergency alert cancel
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6], with the following clarifications:

#### 7.2.2.3 Private call within one MC system
##### 7.2.2.3.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo user is initiating an
MCVideo private call for communicating with another MCVideo user, with or
without transmission control enabled, in an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of MCVideo private
call with the chosen MCVideo user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are already
registered for receiving MCVideo service.
2\. The calling MCVideo user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
3\. The called MCVideo client is set to automatic commencement mode.
Figure 7.2.2.3.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode--
MCVideo users in the same MC system
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo private call
for the chosen MCVideo user.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo private call request towards the MCVideo
server (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228
[5] for MCVideo, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCVideo user.
The MCVideo private call request contains the MCVideo ID of invited user, an
SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCVideo client 1 may include
a Requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be
established in automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is
requested by the initiating user.
3\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call, and that MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 2 is authorized to receive the private call. If the MCVideo private
call request requested automatic commencement mode then the MCVideo server
also checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to
initiate a private call in automatic commencement mode.
4\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 4 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8.
5\. If authorized, MCVideo server includes information that it communicates
using MCVideo service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested automatic
commencement mode by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called
MCVideo client and sends the corresponding MCVideo private call request
towards the MCVideo client 2, including the MC service ID of the calling
MCVideo user 1. If the called MCVideo user has registered to the MCVideo
service with multiple MCVideo UEs and has designated the MCVideo UE for
receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCVideo private call request is
delivered only to the designated MCVideo UE.
6\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming
private call.
7\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCVideo private call response is sent to the MCVideo server (via SIP core).
8\. Upon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCVideo server informs the MCVideo
client 1 about successful call establishment.
9\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media
plane and transmission control for communication and both users can transmit
media.
##### 7.2.2.3.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
###### 7.2.2.3.2.1 Description
Figure 7.2.2.3.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCVideo client
initiating an MCVideo private call that uses manual commencement mode. The
flow may use a transmit media request in the MCVideo private call request
indicating that the originator will be granted permission to transmit when the
call starts and eliminates the need for a separate initial transmit media
request message during media plane establishment. Alternatively the call
initiation may be sent without the transmit media request, which allows the
called party to transmit media request first.
###### 7.2.2.3.2.2 Procedure
Both clients are served by the primary MC service provider in figure
7.2.2.3.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are both registered and their
respective users, MCVideo user 1 and MCVideo user 2, are authenticated and
authorized to use the MCVideo service.
2\. The calling MCVideo user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
3\. The called MCVideo client is set to manual commencement mode.
Figure 7.2.2.3.2.2-1: MCVideo private call in manual commencement mode--
MCVideo users in the same MC system
1\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo private
call for the selected MCVideo user.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo private call request addressed to the MC
service ID of MCVideo user 2 using an MCVideo service identifier as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the
MCVideo server). The MCVideo private call request contains the MC service ID
of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The
MCVideo client 1 may include a requested commencement mode that indicates that
the call is to be established in manual commencement mode if manual
commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.
3\. The MCVideo server confirms that both MCVideo users are authorized for the
private call. The MCVideo server checks the commencement mode setting of the
called MCVideo client and also checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in manual commencement mode.
4\. The MCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request and sends an MCVideo private call request for
the call to MCVideo client 2, including the MC service ID of the calling
MCVideo user 1. If the called MCVideo user has registered to the MCVideo
service with multiple MCVideo UEs and has designated the MCVideo UE for
receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCVideo private call request is
delivered only to the designated MCVideo UE.
5\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 6b.
6a. The MCVideo user is alerted. MCVideo client 2 sends an MCVideo ringing to
the MCVideo server.
6b. The MCVideo server sends an MCVideo ringing to MCVideo client 1,
indicating that MCVideo client 2 is being alerted.
7\. MCVideo user 2 is notified and has accepted the call using manual
commencement mode (i.e., has taken some action to accept via the user
interface).
8\. The MCVideo client 2 sends an MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo
server. If MCVideo user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCVideo
client 2 sends a call failure response to the MCVideo server without adding
reason for call failure.
9\. The MCVideo server sends an MCVideo private call response to MCVideo
client 1 indicating that MCVideo user 2 has accepted the call, including the
accepted media parameters.
10\. The media plane and transmission control for communication is
established.
##### 7.2.2.3.3 Private call release
###### 7.2.2.3.3.1 Client initiated
The procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo client is requesting to
release an ongoing MCVideo private call (with or without transmission control)
and the call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic).
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.3.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating the release of an ongoing MCVideo
private call.
Pre-condition:
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2
are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and are involved in
private call as described in subclause 7.2.2.3.1 and subclause 7.2.2.3.2.
Figure 7.2.2.3.3.1-1: Private call release -- client initiated
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to release an ongoing MCVideo private
call with MCVideo client 2.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo
server (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call with the other
client.
3\. MCVideo server sends the corresponding MCVideo call end request towards
the MCVideo client specified in the original MCVideo call end request.
4\. MCVideo user is notified about the release of the private call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 acknowledges the MCVideo call end request
with a MCVideo call end response.
6\. After receiving the MCVideo call end response from MCVideo client 2, the
MCVideo server generates an MCVideo call end response for the MCVideo client
1\'s MCVideo call end request.
7\. MCVideo clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with transmission control,
transmission control resources are released.
###### 7.2.2.3.3.2 Server initiated
The procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo server is terminating an
ongoing MCVideo private call and the call established in either of the two
commencement modes (manual or automatic), upon conditions to terminate call
e.g., MCVideo administrator configured maximum duration for MCVideo private
calls has expired or timed out due to MCVideo private call without
transmission/reception.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.3.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo
private call.
Pre-condition:
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2
are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and are involved in
private call established either in manual or automatic commencement mode.

1\. Upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCVideo administrator configured
maximum duration for MCVideo private calls has expired or timed out due to
MCVideo private call without transmission/reception, the MCVideo server
decides to initiate termination of an ongoing MCVideo private call between
MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2.
2\. MCVideo server sends an MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo
clients 1 and 2 (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call between
them.
3\. MCVideo users at client 1 and client 2 are notified about the termination
of the private call.
4\. The MCVideo call end request receiving MCVideo clients 1 and 2 acknowledge
the request with MCVideo call end response.
5\. MCVideo clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with transmission control,
transmission control resources are released.
#### 7.2.2.4 MCVideo emergency private call
##### 7.2.2.4.1 MCVideo emergency private call commencement
This procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is
initiating an MCVideo emergency private call with unicast signalling for
communicating with another MCVideo user. An MCVideo client in the MCVideo
emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCVideo user\'s
mission critical applications.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.4.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo emergency
private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the MCVideo private call belong to the same MCVideo
system.
2\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been configured to send an MCVideo
emergency alert prior to initiating an MCVideo emergency private call.

1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency private
call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency
state is retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo emergency private call request towards
the MCVideo server. The request contains an indication of the MCVideo
emergency. The MCVideo server records the identity of the MCVideo user that
initiated the MCVideo emergency private call until the MCVideo emergency is
cancelled. If the MCVideo client is configured to send an MCVideo emergency
alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency private call, the request also
contains an indication that an MCVideo emergency alert is to be initiated.
3\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency private call request towards
the target MCVideo client. The request contains an indication of the in-
progress emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency
alert if the request from the originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert.
4\. The MCVideo user on MCVideo client 2 is notified of the incoming MCVideo
emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo client acknowledges the MCVideo emergency private
call request to the MCVideo server via a MCVideo emergency private call
response.
6\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.
7\. The MCVideo server informs MCVideo client 1 about the successful MCVideo
emergency private call establishment via a MCVideo emergency private call
response.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 establish the media plane and
transmission control for video communication.
NOTE 1: The priority for the MCVideo emergency private call is retained until
cancelled according to system policy (e.g. call end) or cancelled by an
authorized MCVideo user.
NOTE 2: The initiating MCVideo user\'s MCVideo emergency state is retained by
the system until cancelled as in subclause 7.1.2.6. The initiating MCVideo
user\'s MCVideo emergency state is also retained locally by the MCVideo client
until explicitly cancelled by the MCVideo user.
##### 7.2.2.4.2 MCVideo private call emergency upgrade
This procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is
upgrading a private call to an MCVideo emergency private call while the
private call is already in progress.

client upgrading a private call to an MCVideo emergency private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the private call belong to the same MCVideo system.
2\. A private call is already in progress.
Figure 7.2.2.4.2-1: MCVideo private call upgrade
1\. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an emergency. MCVideo
client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCVideo client 1 requests the MCVideo server to upgrade the private call
to in-progress emergency by sending an MCVideo emergency private call request.
If configured to send an MCVideo alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency
upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo alert is to
be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit
media request.
3\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency request towards the MCVideo
client of the other participant.
4\. The MCVideo user is notified of the in-progress emergency of the MCVideo
emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo client acknowledges the MCVideo emergency request to
the MCVideo server.
6\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call
ends.
7\. The MCVideo server confirms the upgrade request to MCVideo client 1. If
the MCVideo emergency request contained an implicit transmit media request,
the MCVideo emergency private call response message contains the result of the
implicit transmit media request.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 continue with the private call,
which has been transformed into an MCVideo emergency private call.

#### 7.2.3.3 Use of ProSe for off-network private communications
To enable an MCVideo user, using a ProSe-enabled UE, to communicate with
another MCVideo user, using ProSe-enabled UE, the MCVideo client retrieves the
ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of the target MCVideo user from the
\"List of user(s) who can be communicated privately\" in the MCVideo user
profile and requests the IP address of the MCVideo UE associated with the
target MCVideo user, from the ProSe layer.
The MCVideo client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the
target MCVideo UE by providing the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID
(as defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) of the target MCVideo user.
This may trigger the ProSe layer procedure (e.g. discovery). The user info ID
of the target MCVideo user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as
defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]). The ProSe layer can then provide
the IP address related to the target MCVideo user\'s MCVideo ID to the MCVideo
client.
#### 7.2.3.4 Automatic commencement private communication
##### 7.2.3.4.1 General
A private call request is sent by a MCVideo client directly to another MCVideo
client, which checks the request, establishes the MCVideo session without
further user interaction and notifies its user that the MCVideo session has
been established.

One-to-one video pull is a private call that only allows the called party to
transmit video to the calling party, and the private call ends when the video
transmission is completed.
##### 7.3.2.3.2 One-to-one video pull -- call setup
The procedure describes the case where an MCVideo user is initiating an
MCVideo private call to pull video from called MCVideo user in an automatic or
manual commencement mode. Only the called party is allowed to transmit video.
Procedures in figure 7.3.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of MCVideo private
call with the chosen MCVideo user for video pull.
Figure 7.3.2.3.2-1: One-to-one video pull
1\. MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 initiates video pull from MCVideo client
2, by sending a private call request to the MCVideo server using a service
identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] for MCVideo, for establishing a
private call with the chosen MCVideo user for video pull. The MCVideo private
call request contains MCVideo ID of invited user, an SDP offer containing one
or more media types and the video pull indication to indicate that invited
user is requested to transmit video to the requester.
2\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call for video pull, and that MCVideo user
at MCVideo client 2 is authorized to receive the private call for video pull.
3\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE 1: Step 3 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 6.
4\. If authorized, MCVideo server includes information that it communicates
using MCVideo service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested commencement mode
by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called MCVideo client and
sends the corresponding MCVideo private call request towards the MCVideo
client 2, including the MCVideo ID of the calling MCVideo user 1. If the
called MCVideo user has registered to the MCVideo service with multiple
MCVideo UEs and has designated the MCVideo UE for receiving the private calls,
then the incoming MCVideo private call request is delivered only to the
designated MCVideo UE.
5\. The MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private call for
video pull.
6\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call for video pull,
and sends an MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo server with an
implicit transmit media request.
7\. Upon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2
accepting the private call request for video pull, the MCVideo server informs
the MCVideo client 1 about successful call establishment via a private call
response message.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media
plane and transmission control for media communication.
NOTE 2: When the video transmission is completed, the private call is
released.
##### 7.3.2.3.3 One-to-one video pull -- call release

for one-to-one video pull call release.
  1. #### 7.3.2.4 One-from-server video pull
    1. ##### 7.3.2.4.1 General
One-from-server video pull is a private call between the calling party and the
MCVideo server that allows the calling party to request streaming of a video
from the server where it is stored in a file. The one-from-server video pull
ends typically when the end of the video file has been reached or when the
transmission is stopped by the calling user or by the MCVideo server.
NOTE: This procedure fulfills the requirements for the stage 1 replay of
stored video feature.
##### 7.3.2.4.2 Procedure

server and sends an MCVideo pull from server request to the MCVideo server.
The request contains the URL of the video file and an SDP offer with media
description..
2\. MCVideo server checks whether MCVideo client 1 is authorized to pull the
requested video from the server.
3\. MCVideo server accepts the pull from server request and sends an MCVideo
pull from server response. The response contains the SDP answer.
NOTE 1: The SDP may contain a media description that allows the receiving
party to remote control the stream (e.g. rewind, fast forward).
4\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo server have successfully established the
media plane and transmission control for the video stream.
5\. Video stream is transmitted from MCVideo server to MCVideo client 1. The
MCVideo client 1 may be able to remote control the video stream, subject to
SDP negotiation.
6\. MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 stops the video pull from the server and
sends an MCVideo pull from server complete request.
7\. MCVideo server acknowledges the end of the communication.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, based on internal criteria (e.g. maximum duration of
the video playback, end of the video file), the MCVideo server can end the
transmission.

transmit video to the called party, and the private call ends when the video
transmission is completed.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 One-to-one video push -- call setup
Procedures in figure 7.4.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of MCVideo private
call with the chosen MCVideo user for video push.
Pre-conditions:
This procedure is initiated either manually by the authorized MCVideo users at
MCVideo client 1, or automatically due to triggers set by authorized MCVideo
users at MCVideo client 1.
Figure 7.4.2.3.2-1: One-to-one video push
1\. MCVideo client 1 initiates push video to MCVideo client 2, and sends a
private call request to the MCVideo server using a service identifier as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] for MCVideo, for establishing a private call
with the chosen MCVideo user for video push. The MCVideo private call request
contains MCVideo ID of invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media
types and the video push indication to indicate that requestor is requesting
to transmit video to the called party.
2\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call for video push, and that MCVideo user
at MCVideo client 2 is authorized to receive the private call for video push.
3\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE 1: Step 3 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 6.
4\. If authorized, MCVideo server includes information that it communicates
using MCVideo service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested commencement mode
by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called MCVideo client and
sends the corresponding MCVideo private call request towards the MCVideo
client 2, including the MCVideo ID of the calling MCVideo user 1. If the
called MCVideo user has registered to the MCVideo service with multiple
MCVideo UEs and has designated the MCVideo UE for receiving the private calls,
then the incoming MCVideo private call request is delivered only to the
designated MCVideo UE.
5\. The MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private call for
video push.
6\. The MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call for video push, and sends an
MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo server.
7\. Upon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2
accepting the private call request for video push, the MCVideo server informs
the MCVideo client 1 about successful call establishment via a private call
response message.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media
plane and transmission control for media communication.
NOTE 2: When the video transmission is completed, the private call is
released.
##### 7.4.2.3.3 One-to-one video push -- call release
The private call release procedure specified in subclause 7.2.2.3.3 is used
for one-to-one video push call release.

## 7.6 Ambient viewing call
### 7.6.1 General
The ambient viewing call is a type of a private MCVideo call that only allows
a \"viewed to\" user to transmit media to a \"viewing\" user such that there
is no indication on the MCVideo UE of the \"viewed to\" user about the call
and the media transmission.
NOTE 1: \"viewed to\" user refers to the user who is transmitting media in an
ambient viewing call.
NOTE 2: \"viewing\" user refers to the user who is receiving media in an
ambient viewing call.
There are two types of ambient viewing call as below:
\- Remotely initiated ambient viewing is initiated by the authorized user
(e.g., dispatcher) who wants to view to another user. In this case, the
\"viewed to\" user is the called party, and shall automatically accept the
call without causing any indication about the call and transmit the media to
the \"viewing\" user.
\- Locally initiated ambient viewing is initiated by an authorized user who
wants another user to view to the MCVideo UE communication. In this case, the
\"viewed to\" user is the calling party and shall automatically transmit the
media to the \"viewing\" user without causing any indication about the call
processing and media transmission.

## 7.7 Transmission control
### 7.7.1 Transmission control for on-network MCVideo service
#### 7.7.1.1 General
The procedure is for providing a transmission control to MCVideo UE in an on-
network case and applies for both private call and group call. Transmission
control is performed by using transmission control information flows between
the transmission control participant and the transmission control server.
#### 7.7.1.2 Information flows for transmission control for on-network
##### 7.7.1.2.1 General
When the transmission control server receives a transmit media request from
the transmission control participant, it decides whether to give a grant or
not. The result is informed to the requesting transmission control
participant. When the transmission control participant receives a transmit
media granted message, it can send video media over the uplink bearer
established beforehand. The transmit media revoked message can be used as part
of revoke. The transmit media queue status request can be used to know current
position in the queue for media transmission.
Some transmission control information flows can also piggyback call control
information flows to provide efficient call setup and clearing:
\- Call setup request is optionally carried in transmit media request
(uplink); and
\- Call release request is optionally carried in media transmission release
(uplink).
##### 7.7.1.2.2 Transmit media request
Table 7.7.1.2.2-1 describes the information flow transmit media request, from
the transmission control participant to the transmission control server, which
is used to request the transmit media request. This information flow is sent
in unicast to the transmission control server.
Table 7.7.1.2.2-1: Transmit media request
* * *
Information element Status Description MCVideo ID M Identity of the user whose
media transmission is requested Media identifier O Identifies the
communication, e.g. by identifying the media flow within a media multiplex,
present only if media multiplexing
* * *
##### 7.7.1.2.3 Transmit media granted
Table 7.7.1.2.3-1 describes the information flow transmit media granted, from
the transmission control server to the transmission control participant, which
is used to indicate that a transmit media request is granted and media

###### 7.7.1.3.5.1 Transmit media request cancellation from the queue --
MCVideo user initiated
Figure 7.7.1.3.5.1-1 illustrates the procedure for transmit media request
cancellation from the video transmission queue initiated by the MCVideo user.
The MCVideo user may be an authorized user who has rights to cancel the
transmit media requests of other MCVideo users, whose transmit media requests
are in video transmission queue.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that transmission control participant B has been granted the
permission for video transmission and is transmitting video. There are several
other transmission control participants (including transmission control
participant A and transmission control participant C) requesting the
permission to transmit media which have been queued at the transmission
control server.
Figure 7.7.1.3.5.1-1: Transmit media request cancellation from queue initiated
by MCVideo user
1\. The transmission control participant A wants to remove the transmit media
request from the video transmission queue. If transmission control participant
A is an authorized MCVideo user with the rights to cancel another MCVideo
user\'s transmit media request, the authorized MCVideo user may request for
transmit media request cancellation for one or more transmission control
participants, whose transmit media request needs to be removed from the video
transmission queue.
2\. The transmission control participant A sends a transmit media cancel
request (initiating MCVideo ID) message to the transmission control server. If
the transmission control participant A wants to remove the transmit media
request(s) of other participant(s), the target participant(s)\' MCVideo ID
should be included in this message.
3\. The transmission control server shall check whether the requesting
transmission control participant has authorization to cancel the transmit
media request(s). If authorized, the transmit media request(s) will be removed
from the video transmission queue. When the on-going transmissions are
completed and are within the limit of the maximum simultaneous transmissions,
the transmission control server will process the transmit media request from
the updated video transmission queue.
4\. If the transmit media cancel request in step 3 is sent by an authorized
user (e.g., dispatcher) to cancel the transmit media request(s) of other
participant(s) from the video transmission queue, the transmit media cancel
request notify message is sent to the transmission control participant whose
transmit media request was cancelled from the video transmission queue.
5\. The transmission control server provides a transmit media cancel response
to the transmission control participant A when the transmit media request
cancellation is completed. Optionally, the new queue position information may
be notified to the transmission control participants whose transmit media
requests are in the video transmission queue (not shown in the figure).
###### 7.7.1.3.5.2 Transmit media request cancellation from the queue -
transmission control server initiated
Figure 7.7.1.3.5.2-1 illustrates the procedure for transmit media request
cancellation from the queue initiated by the transmission control server. Only
two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that transmission control participant B has been granted the
permission to transmit media and is transmitting video. There are several
other transmission control participants (including transmission control
participant A and participant C) requesting the permission to transmit media
which have been queued at the transmission control server.
Figure 7.7.1.3.5.2-1: Transmit media request cancellation from queue initiated
by transmission control server
1\. The transmission control server removes the transmit media request from
the video transmission queue based on policy. e.g., expiration of a timer. In
the case when transmission control server receives repeated transmit media
requests from a transmission control participant while the limit for maximum
simultaneous media transmissions has reached, the new transmit media request
is accepted and added into the video transmission queue and the
existing/former transmit media request is removed from the video transmission
queue or the new transmit media request is rejected and the existing/former
transmit media request of this transmission control participant is retained in
the video transmission queue.
2\. The transmission control server sends a transmit media cancel request
notify to the transmission control participant(s) whose transmit media request
is removed from the video transmission queue.

### 7.7.2 Off-network transmission control
#### 7.7.2.1 General
The procedure is for providing transmission control to MCVideo UE in an off-
network case. Transmission control is performed by using transmission control
information flows between the transmission control participant and the
transmission control arbitrator. The transmission control arbitrator is a
member MCVideo UE of the MCVideo group where the transmission rules are
applied.
Transmission control in off-network can be performed in two ways:
\- Single arbitrator: transmission participants rely on a single participant
designated as transmission arbitrator for the arbitraton of transmission
requests.
\- Self arbitration: each transmsission participant arbitrates its own
transmission based on its view of the topology.
Both of the approaches, as appropriate for the deployment model, can be
adopted for MCVideo group using a configurable parameter (as defined in Annex
A.4).
In the single arbitrator approach, one MCVideo client assumes the
responsibility for arbitration of transmission requests for all group members
within range. All requests for transmission are directed to the arbitrator,
and the arbitrator checks the configured limits on the simultaneous
transmissions, and grants or denies the request. If an MCVideo client is out
of range of the current arbitrator, the MCVideo client is allowed to transmit
and also become a transmission arbitrator. If there is insufficient capacity
to carry an extra transmission i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous
transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may request that an existing
transmitting MCVideo client is pre-empted; the pre-emption request is sent to
the transmission arbitrator.
In the self arbitration approach, each MCVideo client decides for itself
whether there is sufficient capacity to carry the transmission. If it
determines that there is insufficient capacity i.e. the configured limit for
simultaneous transmissions is reached, and from its perspective another
transmitting MCVideo client has a lower priority, the requesting MCVideo
client may send an override request directly to this other transmitting
MCVideo client, which will either accept the override request and give way, or
deny the override request.
In both the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach, if
there is insufficient capacity to carry the communication i.e. the configured
limit on the simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may
report this to the MCVideo user. The MCVideo user may decide to transmit
anyway, and instruct the MCVideo client to proceed with the transmission.
NOTE: The ProSe function within the MCVideo client could determine that there
is insufficient capacity to carry an MCVideo call requested by the MCVideo
client, however interactions between the MCVideo client and the ProSe function
are outside the scope of the present document.
Further subclauses apply to one or both of the single arbitrator approach and
the self arbitration approach. Applicability is explicitly indicated in each
of the relevant subclauses.

#### 7.7.2.3 Initializing transmission control -- single arbitrator approach
This subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.
Figure 7.7.2.3-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client initializes transmission control. The MCVideo client sends a
transmission request to detect presence of a transmission arbitrator. If the
MCVideo client does not receive a response to the transmission request, it
sends a transmission arbitration taken message and becomes the transmission
arbitrator. The MCVideo client may now transmit a video. This procedure
applies when either there have been no recent MCVideo transmissions within the
MCVideo group and therefore no arbitrator has been selected, or where there
have been recent MCVideo transmissions which may still be ongoing, but the
arbitrator cannot be reached, e.g. where MCVideo client that wants to transmit
video has gone out of range of the arbitrator.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.
2\. MCVideo client 1 wishes to transmit video, and has determined that the
pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group
has not been reached.
Figure 7.7.2.3-1: Initializing transmission control, single arbitrator case
1\. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo
group.
2\. MCVideo client 1 does not detect any response to the transmission request.
3a. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission arbitration taken message to the

#### 7.7.2.3A Initializing transmission control -- self arbitration approach
This subclause is applicable only in self arbitration approach.
Figure 7.7.2.3a-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client initializes transmission control.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.
2\. MCVideo client 1 wishes to transmit video.
Figure 7.7.2.3a-1: Initializing transmission control, self arbitration case
1\. The MCVideo client checks whether the pre-configured limit on the number
of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached and informs the
user. If the pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the
MCVideo group has been reached, the MCVideo user may defer the transmission,
or request an override as specified in subclause 7.7.2.8, or decide to
continue with the transmission anyway.
NOTE: If the MCVideo user decides to transmit even if the pre-configured limit
on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached, the
MCVideo user decides to accept any consequences of interference.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission arbitration taken message to the
MCVideo group.
3\. MCVideo client 1 transmits video to the MCVideo group.
#### 7.7.2.4 Transmission permission granted
This subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.
Figure 7.7.2.4-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client requests for transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client sends a transmission request and waits for a response. The MCVideo
client upon receiving a transmission granted message may transmit a video.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.
2\. At least one participant is currently transmitting video.
Figure 7.7.2.4-1: Requesting transmission permission
1\. MCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo
group.
2\. MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks if the
configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached.
3\. If the maximum simultaneous transmissions limit is not reached, MCVideo
client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo group.
Transmission granted message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended
recipient.
4\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video can now be
transmitted.
5\. MCVideo client 2 transmits video to the MCVideo group.
#### 7.7.2.5 Transmission permission rejected
This subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.
Figure 7.7.2.5-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client requests for transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client sends a transmission request and waits for a response.

2\. At least one participant is currently transmitting video.
Figure 7.7.2.5-1: Requesting transmission permission
1\. MCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo
group.
2\. MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks if the
configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached.
3\. If the maximum simultaneous transmissions limit has reached, MCVideo
client 1 sends a transmission rejected message to the MCVideo group.
Transmission denied message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended
recipient. The transmission rejected message may include a rejection cause
which indicates that the configured maximum transmissions limit has been
reached.
4\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video cannot be
transmitted right now.
Following step 4, the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may decide to transmit
anyway, for example if the user knows the topology of the off-network MCVideo
group and locations of the MCVideo group members and needs to transmit video
to other local MCVideo group members despite causing a potential conflict with
one or more other existing MCVideo transmissions within the MCVideo group. In
this case, the MCVideo client follows the procedure in subclause 7.7.2.3.
#### 7.7.2.6 Releasing transmission permission
This subclause is applicable in both the single arbitrator and self
arbitration approaches.
Figure 7.7.2.6-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client releases transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client stops the video transmission and sends a transmission release request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.

Figure 7.7.2.7-1: Transmission override
1\. MCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo
group.
2\. As the configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already
reached, MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks the
override policy.
3\. If MCVideo client 2 is authorized to override (based on e.g., transmission
priority), MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission revoked message to the
MCVideo group. Transmission revoked message indicates the MCVideo client from
which the permission is revoked, as the intended recipient.
4\. MCVideo client 3 stops transmission of video and MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 3 may be notified that the transmission permission has been revoked.
5\. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo
group. Transmission granted message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended
recipient.
6\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video can now be
transmitted.
7\. MCVideo client 2 transmits video to the MCVideo group.
#### 7.7.2.8 Transmission override (revoke self)
This subclause is applicable in the single arbitrator approach.
Editor\'s note: transmission override in the self arbitration approach is FFS.
Figure 7.7.2.8-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client authorized to override, requests for transmission permission.

priority), MCVideo client 1 may send a transmission revoked message to the
MCVideo group. Transmission revoked message indicates the MCVideo client 1,
the current arbitrator, whose permission is revoked.
4\. MCVideo client 1 stops transmission of video and MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 1 may be notified that the transmission permission has been revoked.
5\. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo
group. The transmission granted message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the
intended recipient and MCVideo client 2 as the subsequent transmission
arbitrator.
6a. MCVideo client 2 sends a transmission arbitration taken message to the
MCVideo group.
6b. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video can now be
transmitted.
NOTE: Step 6a and step 6b can occur in any order.
7\. MCVideo client 1, upon receiving the transmission arbitration taken
message releases transmission arbitration.

\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID.
The MCVideo service shall use the MCVideo-1, MCVideo‑8 and MCVideo-9 reference
points for this procedure.
MCVideo may use pre-established MBMS bearer for the different types of MCVideo
group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use the
pre-established MBMS bearer for distributing the media. The MBMS bearer can be
used by any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the bearer
can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel.
Both the media packets as well as the transmission control messages to the
receiving MCVideo clients are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate
MBMS bearer could be used for the transmission control messages, due to
different bearer characteristic requirements.
When using the pre-established MBMS bearer for MCVideo, the MCVideo server
perform the procedure of call connect and disconnect over MBMS as defined in
subclause 7.10.4 at the group communication session establishment step.
### 7.10.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
The MCVideo service shall support the procedure for using dynamic MBMS bearers
as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] with the following clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID.
The MCVideo service shall use the MCVideo-1, MCVideo-4, MCVideo-7, MCVideo-8
and MCVideo-9 reference points for this procedure.
MCVideo may use dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for the different types of
MCVideo group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can
use the dynamic MBMS bearer for distributing the media.
Both the media packets as well as the transmission control messages to the
receiving MCVideo clients are sent on the MBMS bearer.
When using the procedures for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for MCVideo,
the MCVideo server perform the procedure of mapping group communication to
MBMS bearer as defined in subclause 7.10.4 at the group communication session
establishment step.
### 7.10.4 Video call connect and disconnect over MBMS
#### 7.10.4.1 General
MBMS bearer can be used for MCVideo group calls. One MBMS bearer is not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBMS bearer, the MCVideo server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBMS bearer. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream or media streams within one
MBMS bearer that is used for the specific MCVideo group call. When the group
call over the MBMS bearer is finished, this temporary association information
of an MCVideo group call to specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The
procedure in figure 7.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup
before the call start. This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to
continuously use a unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBMS bearer is activated
and announced to the MCVideo clients.
#### 7.10.4.2 Procedure
##### 7.10.4.2.1 Call connect over MBMS
In figure 7.10.4.2.1-1 the MCVideo client 1 is the client that initiate an
MCVideo chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCVideo client 1
may, but does not have to be in an MBMS service area. The MCVideo client 2 and
MCVideo client 3 represents MCVideo clients receiving the MCVideo call over an
MBMS bearer. There may be other receiving clients both over unicast bearers
and over this or other MBMS bearer(s), however they are not illustrated in
this figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls.
Pre-conditions:
  * All users participating in the MCVideo group call are already affiliated to the group.
  * All participating users have joined the group session.
Figure 7.10.4.2.1-1: Chat group call connect on MBMS bearer
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
NOTE 1: The procedure does not include the steps for MCVideo client location
reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.
2\. MCVideo client 1 initiate the MCVideo group call by sending an initial
transmit media request over a unicast bearer to the MCVideo server (reference
point MCVideo-4).
3\. The MCVideo server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCVideo
group ID and information about the media stream identifier or media stream
identifiers of the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e.
the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer broadcasting the call. The message is sent over
reference point MCVideo-9.
NOTE 2: Step 3 can be deferred until step 5 and the MapGroupToBearer message
can then be included in the transmission arbitration taken message.
4\. The MCVideo server grants the right to transmit for MCVideo client 1 and
by that sends a transmit media granted message to the MCVideo client 1\. This
message is sent over a unicast bearer (reference point MCVideo-4).
5\. A media transmission notification message is sent from the MCVideo server
to all receiving users. This message includes the MCVideo ID of the
transmitting MCVideo client as well as the MCVideo group ID. The message is
sent over a MBMS bearer to all users that have previously been setup to
receive calls over the MBMS bearer. The message is sent over reference point
MCVideo-9.
6\. The users of MCVideo clients are informed about the details of video
tranmission and the video transmitter.
7\. The MCVideo clients may send a receive media request to the MCVideo
server, to indicate the reception of media over the MBMS bearer.
8\. MCVideo server accepts the media receive request and sends a receive media
response message to MCVideo clients over a MBMS bearer by using reference
point MCVideo-9.
NOTE 3: The receive media response can also be sent by unicast to the MCVideo
clients that request to receive media over the MBMS bearer.
NOTE 4: Step 7 and 8 may be omitted when auto-receive transmission mode is
used, e.g. for emergency group calls.
9\. The media is sent from MCVideo client 1 to the MCVideo server over unicast
bearer and from the MCVideo server to the MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client
3 over MBMS bearer.
NOTE 5: Additional transmission request messages in the same call will not
trigger the MapGroupToBearer message to be sent.
##### 7.10.4.2.2 Call disconnect over MBMS
Figure 7.10.4.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCVideo server to the MCVideo
clients to indicate that the MCVideo group call is being dissociated from the
MBMS bearer.
Figure 7.10.4.2.2-1: Chat group call disconnect on MBMS bearer
1\. An MCVideo group call is ongoing; the media is broadcasted over MBMS
bearer to MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3.
2\. MCVideo server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer
for the MCVideo clients
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCVideo server to MCVideo
client 2, MCVideo client 3 and possibly to MCVideo client 1 (if in MBMS
coverage area) on MBMS bearer(s).
NOTE 4: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message can be sent as part of other
messages.
NOTE 5: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message and the MapGroupToBearer message can
be combined, to facilitate switching bearers in one signalling step, as
necessary.
### 7.10.5 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
The MCVideo service shall support the procedure for switching from MBMS bearer
to unicast bearer as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] with the following
clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID.
The MCVideo service shall use the MCVideo-1, MCVideo-4, MCVideo‑7, MCVideo-8
and MCVideo‑9 reference points for this procedure.
## 7.11 Simultaneous session for MCVideo calls (on-network)
An MCVideo client and MCVideo server may use a simultaneous session as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] for MCVideo calls. The MCVideo client becomes involved
in a simultaneous session for MCVideo calls by inviting, joining or accepting
more than one MCVideo call, or affiliating to a group.
NOTE: An MCVideo client affiliating to multiple MCVideo groups with active
calls will result in the MCVideo client being invited simultaneously to
multiple MCVideo calls.
The MCVideo client can also still handle multiple MCVideo calls in parallel at
the same time i.e. using multiple dialogs.
The simultaneous session is established during either an originating on-demand
call establishment or during pre-established session establishment or a
modification of an already established pre-established session or on-demand
call.
It is possible to change the prioritisation while the MCVideo client is
engaged in multiple MCVideo calls. The setting of the priority can be made at
MCVideo call setup or by performing a modification after the MCVideo call is
established. This may result in more than one media bearer.
## 7.12 User authentication and authorization for MCVideo service
NOTE: Flow 7.12-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization flow.
3GPP TS 33.180 [14] defines the specific user authentication and authorization
architecture required by the MCVideo service in order to realize the MCVideo
user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in 3GPP TS
22.280 [2].
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 7.12-1. The user
authentication is performed based on the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[6].
Figure 7.12-1: MCVideo user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. The user authentication is performed as per the general user
authentication procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
2\. MCVideo client performs the MCVideo service authorization for the user.
Step 2 utilizes the results of step 1.
## 7.13 Support for multiple devices
An MCVideo user may be authorized to use the MCVideo service from multiple
MCVideo UEs as per the procedure in subclause 7.12.
If an MCVideo server receives a service authorization request for an MCVideo
user who is previously MCVideo service authorized on another MCVideo UE, then
the MCVideo server shall process this service authorization request as
described in subclause 7.12. In the MCVideo service authorization response to
the MCVideo user, the MCVideo server shall also indicate that the MCVideo user
is already MCVideo service authorized from another MCVideo UE.
## 7.14 Location information (on-network)
The MCVideo system makes use of all of the procedures for location management
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6], utilising the CSC-14 reference point
between the location management client and location management server and the
CSC‑15 reference point between the MCVideo server and location management
server.
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server;
\- The MC service group is the MCVideo group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCVideo group ID.
## 7.15 MCVideo resource management (on-network)
Procedures for resource management are defined in subclause 10.11 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6].
## 7.16 MCVideo client query
### 7.16.1 General

###### ## Annex A (normative): MCVideo related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCVideo service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCVideo UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCVideo user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCVideo related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCVideo service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on network and off network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCVideo UE,
MCVideo group, MCVideo user and MCVideo service configuration data refers to
the information that will be stored against each MCVideo UE, MCVideo group,
MCVideo user and MCVideo service. This means that the three separate tables
(on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each
configuration category represent the complete set of data for each
configuration data category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.281
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the
present document or the referenced document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCVideo UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCVideo UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCVideo UE after
MCVideo authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCVideo service.

# A.3 MCVideo user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]. The MCVideo user profile configuration data
is stored in the MCVideo user database. The MCVideo server obtains the MCVideo
user profile configuration data from the MCVideo user database (MCVideo-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCVideo user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCVideo service.Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3
contain the MCVideo user profile configuration required to support the use of
off-network MCVideo service. Data in table A.3-1 and table A.3-3 can be
configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point.
