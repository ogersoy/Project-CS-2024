# 4 Interworking scenarios
## 4.1 MC service scenarios
### 4.1.1 General
The following subclauses capture interworking scenarios between any MC service
and legacy systems.
### 4.1.2 Scenario 1: Private communication
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The scenarios in this subclause are generic and apply to P25, TETRA and legacy
LMR.
There are two scenarios for private communications between MC service and LMR
systems. These scenarios consider two terminals, UE A of MC service and MS B
of LMR, which belong to different mission critical communication systems, and
which could initiate a private communication in either direction. For example,
in a particular scenario UE A could initiate a private communication to MS B,
or MS B could initiate a private communication to UE A.
#### 4.1.2.2 MC service UE A initiates private communication to LMR MS B
Figure 4.1.2.2-1 illustrates this scenario:
Figure 4.1.2.2-1: MC service UE A initiates private communication to LMR MS B
In figure 4.1.2.2-1, MC service UE A is a user of MC service system A
(coloured blue), while LMR MS B is a subscriber of LMR System B (coloured
yellow). The MC service and LMR systems are different and connected via the
interworking interface. MC service UE A initiates a private communication to
LMR MS B, which receives the service from LMR system B.
#### 4.1.2.3 LMR MS B initiates a private communication to MC service UE A
Figure 4.1.2.3-1 illustrates this scenario:
Figure 4.1.2.3-1: LMR MS B initiates a private communication to MC service UE
A
Likewise, in figure 4.1.2.3-1, MC service UE A is a user of MC system A, while
LMR MS B is a subscriber of LMR System B. The MC service and LMR systems are
different and are connected via the interworking interface. LMR MS B initiates
a private communication to MC service UE A, which receives the service from MC
system A.
### 4.1.3 Scenario 2: Group communication
#### 4.1.3.1 General
The scenarios in this subclause are generic and apply to P25, TETRA and legacy
LMR.
#### 4.1.3.2 MC service UE A or LMR MS B initiates a group communication
Figure 4.1.3.2-1 and figure 4.1.3.2-2 illustrate these scenarios:
Figure 4.1.3.2-1: MC service UE A initiates a group communication
Figure 4.1.3.2-2: LMR MS B initiates a group communication
In these scenarios, UE A and possibly other UEs of MC system A, MS B and
possibly other MSs of LMR system B, participate in the same group
communication. The MC service and LMR systems are connected via the
interworking interface such that any communication is placed to all
participants in both systems.
As shown in figure 4.1.3.2-1, MC service UE A initiates a group communication
which results in group communication with group members on the LMR system.
As shown in figure 4.1.3.2-2, LMR MS B initiates a group communication which
results in group communication with group members on the MC service system.
#### 4.1.3.3 Group regrouping between Group Y and Group Z
Figure 4.1.3.3-1 and figure 4.1.3.3-2 below illustrate these scenarios:
Figure 4.1.3.3-1: MC service UE A initiates group regrouping between Group Y
and Group Z
Figure 4.1.3.3-2: LMR MS B initiates group regrouping between Group Y and
Group Z
In these scenarios, MC service UE A and MC service other UEs belong to group Y
and LMR MS B and LMR other MSs belong to group Z.
Regrouping is initiated to combine Group Y and Group Z. If MC service UE A
initiates a group communication on Group Y, the communication is sent to all
affiliated members of Group Y and Group Z. If LMR MS B initiates a group
communication, the communication is sent to all affiliated members of Group Y
and Group Z. The MC service and LMR systems are connected via the interworking
interface such that any communication placed on Group Y or Group Z is sent to
all participants in both systems.
## 4.2 MCPTT scenarios
### 4.2.1 Scenario 3: Floor control between MCPTT and legacy systems
#### 4.2.1.1 General
Floor control within the MCPTT system is managed by the centralised floor
control server and this functional entity is located within the MCPTT server
as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11], subclause 7.4.2.3.4. It coordinates the
floor requests from participating MCPTT UEs by granting, queueing, rejecting,
or revoking floor requests.
Within the context of interworking between MCPTT and legacy systems, if
multiple users under two systems within a single group communication request
the floor simultaneously, only one user\'s request needs to be granted.
Similar consideration applies to rejecting a request or revoking the floor
from a user under one system due to another user\'s action under another
system.
To ensure the integrity of floor control operation across two systems, cross-
system floor management needs to occur. This may be characterised as an inter-
system management mechanism in contrast to the floor management at a single-
system level. This inter-system floor management includes arbitration of
multiple requests from two systems and includes resolution of any conflict,
taking aspects into consideration such as order or priority of the user\'s
request, etc.
## 4.3 MCData scenarios
### 4.3.1 General
The following subclauses capture interworking scenarios between MCData SDS and
TETRA/P25 systems. They can be regarded as specific instances of the generic
MC service scenarios.
### 4.3.2 Scenario 4: Private standalone MCData SDS communication
#### 4.3.2.1 General
The scenarios in this subclause apply to private standalone MCData SDS
interworking with P25 and TETRA. There are two scenarios for private
standalone SDS communications between MCData and LMR systems. These scenarios
consider two terminals, UE A of MCData service and MS B of LMR, which belong
to different mission critical communication systems, and which could initiate
a private standalone SDS-type communication in either direction. For example,
in a particular scenario UE A could initiate a private communication to MS B,
or MS B could initiate a private communication to UE A.
#### 4.3.2.2 MCData UE initiates private standalone SDS communication to an
LMR MS
Figure 4.3.2.2-1 illustrates this scenario.
Figure 4.3.2.2-1: MCData UE initiates private communication to an LMR MS
In figure 4.3.2.2-1, MCData UE A is a user of MCData system A, whilst LMR MS B
is a subscriber of LMR system B. The MCData and LMR systems are connected via
the interworking interface. MCData UE A initiates a private standalone SDS to
LMR MS B, which receives the service from LMR system B.
#### 4.3.2.3 LMR MS initiates a private standalone SDS communication to a
MCData UE
Figure 4.3.2.3-1 illustrates this scenario
Figure 4.3.2.3-1: LMR MS initiates a private standalone SDS communication to a
MCData UE
Likewise in figure 4.3.2.3-1, MCData UE A is a user of MCData system A, whilst
LMR MS B is a subscriber of LMR system B. The MCData and LMR systems are
connected via the interworking interface. LMR MS B initiates a private
standalone SDS to MCData UE A, which receives the service from MCData system
A.
### 4.3.3 Scenario 5: Group standalone MCData SDS communication
#### 4.3.3.1 General
The scenarios in this subclause apply to group standalone MCData SDS
interworking with P25 and TETRA. There are two scenarios for group standalone
SDS communications between MCData and LMR systems. In these scenarios, UE A
and possibly other UEs of MCData system A, MS B and possibly other MSs of LMR
system B, participate in group standalone SDS communication. The MCData
service and LMR systems are connected via an interworking interface such that
any standalone SDS communication is placed to all participants in both
systems.
#### 4.3.3.2 MCData UE or LMR MS initiates a group standalone SDS
communication
These scenarios are illustrated in figure 4.3.3.2-1 and figure 4.3.3.2-2.
As shown in figure 4.3.3.2-1, MCData UE A sends a group standalone MCData SDS
which results in group SDS distribution to group members in the LMR system.
Figure 4.3.3.2-1: MCData UE A sends a group standalone SDS communication
As shown in figure 4.3.3.2-2, LMR MS B sends a standalone group SDS which
results in group MCData SDS distribution to group members in the MCData
system.

# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Identity
### 5.1.1 Key issue #1-1: Mapping of MCPTT, MCData and TETRA/P25 user
identities
#### 5.1.1.1 Description
In the TETRA Standard, an Individual TETRA Subscriber Identity (ITSI) consists
of a 48 bits length structure comprising the TETRA Mobile Country Code, TETRA
Mobile Network Code, and Individual Short Subscriber Identity (ISSI) of the
Terminal. The ISSI is unique within one TETRA system. The numbering scheme is
specified in ETSI EN 300 392‑1 [3], and the TETRA Mobile Country Codes are
specified in ITU‑T Recommendation E.218 [4].
In the P25 Standard, the Subscriber Unit ID (SUID) is 56 bits comprising the
P25 Wide Area Communications Network (WACN) ID (20 bits), System ID (12 bits),
and Unit Identifier (UID) (24 bits). The SUID is considered globally unique.
The 24 bit UID is unique within the UID\'s home system where a system is the
unique combination of WACN ID (20) and System ID (12). The numbering scheme is
specified in TIA TSB‑102‑B [5], TIA TIA‑102.AABC‑D [6], TIA TIA‑102.BACA‑B [7]
and TIA TIA‑102.AABD-B [8].
MCPTT user identity (MCPTT ID) is also a globally unique identifier within the
MCPTT service that represents the MCPTT user, and is a Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI).
Similarly, MCData user identity (MCData ID) is also a globally unique
identifier within the MCData service that represents the MCData user, and is a
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
Although the TETRA ITSI and P25 SUID provide functions that are analogous to
MCPTT ID and MCData ID, they are comprised of different elements and have
different fixed length structures e.g. TETRA ITSI is 48 bits, P25 SUID is 56
bits. In order to realise interworking between MCPTT, MCData and LMR systems,
further study on mapping of different **user identities is necessary.**
### 5.1.2 Key issue #1-2: Mapping of MCPTT, MCData and TETRA/P25 group
identities
#### 5.1.2.1 Description
TETRA defines a Group TETRA Subscriber Identity (GTSI) for each group, which
comprises the TETRA Mobile Country Code, TETRA Mobile Network Code and Group
Short Subscriber Identity (GSSI). The GSSI is unique within one TETRA system.
One ITSI may have access to one or more GTSIs.
In the P25 standard, the Subscriber Group ID (SGID) is 48 bits (20 WACN ID+12
System ID+16 Group ID). The SGID is considered globally unique. The 16 bit GID
is unique within the GID\'s home system where system is the unique combination
of WACN ID (20) and System ID.
MCPTT has a globally unique identifier (MCPTT Group ID) for each of its
groups, which is a URI. Similarly, MCData has a globally unique identifier
(MCData Group ID) for each of its groups, which is a URI.
Although the TETRA GTSI and P25 SGID provide functions that are analogous to
the MCPTT Group ID and MCData Group ID, they are comprised of different
elements and have different fixed length structures. In order to realise
interworking between MCPTT, MCData and LMR systems, further study on mapping
of different group **identities is necessary.**
## 5.2 Homing and affiliation
### 5.2.1 Key issue #2-1: Group affiliation management
#### 5.2.1.1 Description
Where users in an LMR system affiliate to a group in an interconnected LMR
system that is a participating system for the group, the system where those
group members are receiving service may send affiliations to the controlling
system of the group on their behalf in one of the following ways:
\- An affiliation may be sent to the controlling system for each group member
that affiliated in the participating system;
\- a single affiliation is sent to the controlling system when the first group
member requests an affiliation to the group in the participating system, and a
de-affiliation request is only sent when the last affiliated user requests to
de-affiliate from the group;
\- the participating system may send a group affiliation to the controlling
system, without regard for whether particular units within the system have
interest in the group; or
\- the controlling system will consider the participating system to be
permanently implicitly affiliated (e.g. due to configuration) and no explicit
affiliation signalling is sent.
The MCPTT standard provides for users to affiliate with a group through a
participating service acting as a proxy for the home service of the group. The
home service of the group routes calls to the participating service as long as
there are affiliated users served by the participating service. Users can
subscribe to group affiliation membership information and receive a list of
currently affiliated members.
Gaps:
1\. Support for statically established affiliation between P25 systems and
MCPTT services.
2\. Reconciliation of system level vs user level intersystem group affiliation
management.
3\. Representation of LMR systems/users in MCPTT group affiliation membership
lists.
### 5.2.2 Key issue #2-2: Group controlling system
#### 5.2.2.1 Description
For group communications, in order to resolve which system of the LMR system
or the MCPTT system should manage group affiliations and resolve contention
issues for call setup and floor control, one system of the LMR system and the
MCPTT system should be nominated as the group controlling system for each
group where interworking is defined.
### 5.2.3 Key issue #2-3: Late entry to group call
#### 5.2.3.1 Description
If a group call has been set up by the controlling system and does not include
the participating system, e.g. because the participating system had no
affiliated group members at the start of the group call, the controlling
system needs to send late call entry signalling to the participating system if
a group member in the participating system affiliates to the group whilst the
group call is ongoing.
## 5.3 Session setup and termination
### 5.3.1 Key issue #3-1: Private call
#### 5.3.1.1 Description
MCPTT system and LMR system utilise different mechanisms to manage a private
call including user identity, codec and protocol. MCPTT service supports
multiple simultaneously active MCPTT client instances of a single MCPTT user
ID, each on its own UE. Neither P25 nor TETRA systems explicitly support this
feature.
At least seven multi-instance cases need to be considered:
1\. A legacy radio user sends an unacknowledged transmission (such as an
unacknowledged talk-spurt) addressed to an MCPTT user with multiple MCPTT
client instances;
2\. An MCPTT user with multiple MCPTT client instances, by using one of those
instances, sends an unacknowledged transmission to a legacy radio user;
3\. A legacy radio user sends a transmission to an MCPTT user with multiple
MCPTT client instances where the transmission requires end-to-end
acknowledgement at the radio/transport level;
4\. An MCPTT user with multiple MCPTT client instances, by using one of those
instances, sends a transmission to a legacy radio user where the transmission
requires end-to-end acknowledgement at the radio/transport level;
5\. A legacy radio user sends a transmission to an MCPTT user with multiple
MCPTT client instances where the transmission requires a user response (e.g.,
a manual commencement private call);
6\. An MCPTT user with multiple MCPTT client instances, by using one of those
instances, sends a transmission to a legacy radio user where the transmission
requires a user response; and
7\. During a persistent session between a legacy radio user and an MCPTT user
with multiple MCPTT client instances (e.g., a \"normal\" private call), a new
instance of an MCPTT user with multiple MCPTT client instances becomes active.
Intuitively, the behaviours associated with a user with a single client
instance exchanging information with a user with multiple client instances
should be consistent with the degenerate case of two users with multiple
client instances exchanging private information.
Commencement mode: some LMR systems may only support manual commencement mode
(called party answers) and some may only support automatic commencement mode
(called party always auto-answers). For example, if a caller that assumes
automatic commencement mode calls a party that supports manual commencement
mode, the caller would assume that the media was delivered and would not know
that the called party had not answered.
Full duplex calls: MCPTT supports full duplex private calls, P25 Phase 1 does
not and P25 Phase 2 might not. LMR consoles and TETRA support full duplex. A
full duplex talker would not know that the media is not being delivered while
the half duplex party is talking.
Gaps:
1\. Definition and implementation of appropriate behaviours for the seven
multi-instance cases identified above.
2\. Negotiation of commencement mode.
3\. Negotiation of varying support for duplex calls.
4\. Routing of signalling messages between MCPTT user and LMR user via the
IWF.
5\. Protocol translation between MCPTT system and LMR system.
6\. Floor control arbitration between MCPTT system and LMR system.
### 5.3.2 Key issue #3-2: Call back
#### 5.3.2.1 Description
Call alert is an individually addressed legacy feature requesting that the
destination user make a private call to the initiating user at some future
time. Call back request is an essentially identical MCPTT feature. For those
legacy systems that support call alert functionality, there is no significant
incompatibility between the features apart from those induced by the multiple
instance problem identified in subclause 5.3.1 of the present document.
When a legacy user sends a call alert to a multiply instanced MCPTT user, the
request should be propagated to all instances of the MCPTT user. The user of
some instance will likely call back using a private call at some time.
When a MCPTT user makes a call back request to a legacy user, there is no
addressing ambiguity in the message delivery. There is, however, a potential
issue with how to direct the individual call placed by the legacy user to
respond to the request. One approach to this problem would attempt to direct
the call to the specific instance that made the call back request.
Alternatively, the call could be directed to all instances of the MCPTT users
without regard for which instance issued the request.
NOTE: Call back function interworking is not required by stage 1 and is not
addressed in the present document.
### 5.3.3 Key issue #3-3: Group call
#### 5.3.3.1 Description
MCPTT systems and LMR systems utilise different mechanisms to manage a group
call including user identity, group identity, codec and protocol.
The group calls will be initiated either by an MCPTT user or an LMR user, with
the group call participating users from two different systems.
There are three group call scenarios between an MCPTT system and an LMR
system:
1\. A group call on a group consisting of two sub-groups formed by group
regrouping, one from the MCPTT system and the other from the LMR system;
2\. A group call on a group consisting of members from both the MCPTT system
and the LMR system; and
3\. A group call on two linked groups, one from the MCPTT system and the other
from the LMR system.
The procedures for the above group call scenarios need further study.
Gaps:
1\. Routing of signalling messages between the MCPTT user and the LMR user via
the IWF.
2\. Protocol translation between the MCPTT system and the LMR system.
3\. Determination of the controlling system for the group call.
4\. Floor control arbitration between the MCPTT system and the LMR system.
5\. Support for group linking at the IWF.
## 5.4 Media plane
### 5.4.1 Key issue #4-1: Vocoder reconciliation
#### 5.4.1.1 Description
Vocoder reconciliation is the process of selecting source vocoders and
transcoding stages to facilitate communication between MCPTT users and legacy
users.
Criteria for making \"optimal\" vocoder and transcoder choices should at a
minimum include:
1\. Intelligibility;
2\. Tone transference;
3\. Included population;
4\. E2EE requirements;
5\. Transcoding availability; and
6\. Trans-encryption authorization and availability.
Analogue conventional systems have no \"native\" vocoder, per se, but will
need to have a means of converting received digitised voice into analogue
signals for transmission.
Digital legacy systems support at most two options for vocoder formats over
the air (e.g., P25 phase 1 and 2 vocoders for some P25 trunking systems), or
may only support a single format (e.g., P25 phase 1 vocoder for P25
conventional systems or ACELP for TETRA).
In TETRA, a speech codec has been specified for TETRA‑V2 in ETSI EN 300 395‑2
[9]:
\- TETRA ACELP speech codec (mandatory):
\- IAT: 30 ms
\- Speech frame size: 137 bits
\- Data rate: 4566.7 bit/s
P25 specifies two different codecs commonly referred to as the Full-Rate
(Phase 1) and Half-Rate (Phase 2 vocoders. The P25 codecs are described in TIA
TIA‑102.BABA [13] and TIA TIA‑102.BABA‑1 [14]:
\- Improved Multi-Band Excitation (IMBE) speech codec
\- IAT:20 ms
\- Speech framesize: 88 bits (Phase 1) and 49 bits (Phase 2)
\- Data rate: 2 modes
\- Phase 1: a net bit rate of 4.4 kbit/s for voice information and a gross bit
rate of 7.2 kbit/s after error control coding.
\- Phase 2: net bit rate of 2.45 kbit/s for voice information and a gross bit
rate of 3.6 kbit/s after error control coding.
In 3GPP, two different speech codecs have been specified in 3GPP TS 26.179
[10].
\- AMR-WB codec (mandatory)
\- IAT: 20 ms
\- Data rate: 9 modes with 6.60 kbit/s to 23.85 kbit/s
\- EVS codec in super-wideband mode (SWB) (optional)
\- IAT: 20 ms
\- Data rate: 13 modes (5.9 kbit/s to 128 kbit/s) + 9 WB-AMR Iw modes: 6.60
kbit/s to 23.85 kbit/s
The changing demand for a call (e.g. Late Call Entry) during its life time can
affect the optimal vocoder selection for the call unless the vocoder is
statically configured. For example, an optimal selection for a call that
includes a P25 phase 1 system and MCPTT users who all support the Phase 1
vocoder may be to use the Phase 1 vocoder for the call. In the event that the
P25 system no longer has demand for the call (e.g., the last P25 user de-
affiliates with the group), a different vocoder selection might be optimal.
Likewise, the addition of a P25 system (resulting from a new affiliation, for
instance) to a call might result in a different optimal vocoder selection.
Gaps:
1\. Vocoder selection and transcoding mechanisms to allow voice to be
accurately conveyed between users on legacy and MCPTT systems.
2\. Information content required to support various selection criteria.
3\. Security policies for trans-encryption.
4\. Management of vocoder selections in response to late call entry.
5\. Management of vocoder selections in response to call exit.
6\. Configuration mechanisms in legacy and/or MCPTT systems might not be
adequate to statically configure talk groups for the lowest quality vocoder of
all expected participants.
### 5.4.2 Key issue #4-2: Unstoppable audio
#### 5.4.2.1 Description
In many LMR systems still in operation (e.g. analog or digital conventional,
P25 Phase 1 FDMA trunking system), a transmitting radio sometimes cannot be
signalled that the floor has been taken or revoked. For example, there is no
floor control in conventional LMR radio at all (i.e. polite operation), and in
a P25 Phase 1 FDMA system an overridden user cannot be signalled to stop
transmitting. Thus, in the case of simultaneous PTT between MCPTT and LMR, the
user on the LMR system is sometimes unaware that he/she no longer has the
floor and will continue to transmit (i.e. unstoppable audio). The issue of
dealing with the unstoppable audio needs to be addressed. In some LMR systems,
this audio is referred to as \"losing audio\" and this audio is often routed
to a dispatcher so that the transmission is not lost which is particularly
important in emergency group calls.
Within the context of interworking between MCPTT and legacy LMR system, this
condition can occur due to simultaneous floor requests where both MCPTT and
LMR users are granted the floor by their respective servers (key issue #8-1),
or the floor granted to an LMR user is revoked by an MCPTT user (key issue
#8-2).
The corresponding stage 1 requirements from 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] are given
below:
> [R-6.18.3.2-018] Interworking between the MCPTT Service and P25 shall
> support conveyance of Losing audio from P25 subscriber units and consoles to
> authorized MCPTT Users.
>
> [R-6.18.3.2-019] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCPTT
> Administrator to authorize MCPTT Users to be able to receive Losing audio
> from P25 subscribers units and consoles.
## 5.5 Encryption
### 5.5.1 Key issue #5-1: End-to-end payload encryption
#### 5.5.1.1 Description
In P25 and TETRA, the encryption process requires the transmission of an
Algorithm ID representing the encryption scheme, a Key ID, and an
initialization vector at the start of the call. The algorithm and key
identities are also periodically transmitted with the voice payload.
Cryptographic synchronization and resynchronization are accommodated via a
synchronization vector (crypto-synch) which updates as the call proceeds and
is also periodically transmitted with the voice payload. Having learned the
algorithm, key and current crypto-synch once for a transmission, and having
not lost any subsequent voice frames, a receiving entity can decrypt the
entirety of the transmission.
In a macro system comprising only MCPTT and P25 services, E2EE requires that
the MCPTT client employ an agreed P25 Phase 1 or 2 vocoder, use a P25
compliant encryption scheme, and have a means to identify the key, and include
resynchronization information sufficient to allow for decryption for P25 units
entering and late entering the transmission. The same is true for a macro
system comprising only MCPTT and TETRA using a TETRA vocoder and encryption
scheme.
In a macro system comprising MCPTT, P25 or TETRA and some other legacy LMR
system, E2EE calling is not possible for all call legs.
For TETRA, selection of the ACELP vocoder and management of the frame stealing
process to transmit encryption synchronization in-band is required.
E2EE at the application level renders voice transcoding impossible, as there
is no way for the transcoding entity to perfom codec translation on encrypted
media without access to the encryption keys.
Based on operator policy, transcoding and transencryption are acceptable in
some circumstances.
Neither P25 nor TETRA air interface encryption need to be supported or
accommodated in MCPTT.
Support for E2EE will continue to be a high priority requirement for most
customers throughout all stages of the transition from LMR to MCPTT
interworking.
Gaps:
1\. Means for transmitting the P25 or TETRA encryption synchronization vector,
including the Key ID and the Algorithm ID within the MCPTT system.
2\. Means for ensuring the time synchronization between the sync vector and
the stream of encrypted speech packets in a P25 or TETRA to MCPTT interworked
system.
3\. Support for the TETRA vocoder in MCPTT to allow end-to-end security.
4\. Support for the P25 vocoders in MCPTT to allow end-to-end security.
5\. Definition of suitable policy options and means to provide for suitable
security in mixed macro-systems.
6\. E2EE has implications with legal interception requirements.
### 5.5.2 Key issue #5-2: Key agreement
#### 5.5.2.1 Description
In P25 and TETRA systems, the key used for voice encryption is selected by the
transmitting radio and identified in the transmission by an Algorithm ID and
Key ID pair. The receiving radio searches its key database for a matching key
and uses that key to decrypt the voice transmission.
In P25 and TETRA, the Key ID used in the transmission is only required to be
unique within a key management domain. Key ID = 0, in particular, is a special
case for both P25 and TETRA that needs to be addressed in interworking.
P25 does not specify any standardised protocols for binding a talk-group or
other plaintext to a particular key. Moreover, it specifically allows for a
user to override whatever key selection might be programmed into the radio.
Both P25 and TETRA have options for key management. Keys may be provided
manually or automatically over the air. The frequency and method of key update
can vary per user. Interworking with MCPTT will require mechanisms to allow
the same keys to be used in the systems on both sides of the interworking
interface, including conveyance of rekeying messages.
Gaps:
1\. Means for uniquely identifying the encryption key in meta-systems
comprising a multiplicity of uncoordinated P25 or TETRA systems connected to
network of MCPTT services.
2\. Means for agreeing on keys used for transmissions between P25 or TETRA and
MCPTT systems.
3\. Accommodation of Key ID = 0 in P25 and TETRA systems.
4\. Means for sharing encryption keys between a legacy P25 or TETRA system and
an MCPTT system.
5\. Means for supporting rekeying messages between a legacy P25 or TETRA
system and MCPTT system.
### 5.5.3 Key issue #5-3: Unencrypted transmissions within an encrypted call
#### 5.5.3.1 Description
Exceptional operational circumstances arise in which an \"encrypted group\"
carries unencrypted transmissions. In LMR systems, this case may occur, among
other reasons, when keys have not been fully or correctly distributed for a
group but operational considerations necessitate communications in spite of
potential security vulnerabilities. It also occurs in scenarios related to
group re-grouping in disaster situations where encrypted and unencrypted
groups are patched together to form a new group, but not all members share a
common key.
Similarly, circumstances arise in which the key selected by one user for an
encrypted call may be different than that selected by some other users. For
example, a manually keyed radio may not have access to an updated key.
TETRA has a feature called Clear Voice Override that can be used as described
above but is not commonly used because it may be viewed as a security risk.
NOTE: The interoperability scenario described above is not currently supported
by stage 1 and is not addressed in the present document.
### 5.5.4 Key issue #5-4: Key management
#### 5.5.4.1 Description
Project 25 and TETRA systems include two primary means for the management of
E2EE keys. With so called \"manual\" key management, a \"key fill device\" is
(usually) directly connected to a mobile radio and provides keys using
standardised protocols. In \"Over-the-air Rekeying\" (OTAR), keys are
distributed using a secure over-the-air protocol from a \"Key Management
Facility\" (KMF) to mobile radios. Generally speaking, each KMF is responsible
for key management of a subset of P25 radios. Also, standardised means exist
for KMFs to share keys so that a radio \"under the control\" of one KMF can
interoperate with a radio under the control of another KMF.
For example, in figure 5.5.4.1-1 the three P25 radios can share a common key
from KMF B by virtue of radio 2 receiving the key via OTAR and radio 3 via a
key fill device from KMF B, and Radio 1 receiving the same key from KMF A by
virtue of OTAR after having been provided that key via the P25 Inter-KMF
Interface (IKI).
Figure 5.5.4.1-1: Example of P25 Key Management
In addition to simple key distribution and inter-agency key sharing, P25
supports a large number of use cases for key fill and over-the-air rekeying,
consistent with the needs that legacy users have expressed over many years.
These include means for \"cold-starting\" (initial distribution of keys),
routine key rotation, repudiating a compromised unit, and zeroization
(deletion and erasing of some or all of the keys of a potentially compromised
unit).
TETRA has the same types of key management processes and options.
In MCPTT, the encryption keys for a private call between two MCPTT users are
sent by the originating UE in a MIKEY-SAKKE payload to the terminating UE, via
the KMS servers. This forms the root key for further media key derivation. The
same MIKEY-SAKKE payload solution is applied for a group call, the group key
is provided by the group management server to all the participants in the
group call in advance of the call.
Gaps:
1\. Sharing of end-to-end keys originated by P25 and TETRA user agencies with
authorised MCPTT clients.
2\. Sharing of end-to-end keys originated by MCPTT user agencies with
authorised P25 and TETRA subscriber units.
3\. Management of end-to-end keys originated in P25 and TETRA user agencies
and shared with authorised MCPTT clients.
4\. Management of end-to-end keys originated in MCPTT user agencies and shared
with authorised P25 and TETRA subscriber units.
5\. Carriage of key management messages for P25 or TETRA over MCPTT.
## 5.6 Group management
### 5.6.1 Key issue #6-1: Regrouping
#### 5.6.1.1 Description
Group regrouping enables dispatchers or any authorised user to temporarily
combine groups together. Group regrouping is used for different reasons.
Due to an incident in an area it can be necessary to temporarily enable users
from different groups to communicate to each other in order to coordinate
their activities. After the incident, the dispatcher can cancel the group
regrouping and then the users can continue to communicate with their
originally configured groups.
During quiet periods, control room managers can decide to combine groups and
handle their operations and communications with one dispatcher. Prior to less
busy periods, the group regrouping is cancelled and the groups are handled by
separate dispatchers.
MCPTT, P25, and TETRA all support group regrouping with similar requirements.
TETRA uses DGNA (Dynamic Group Number Assignment, see ETSI ETS 300 392‑11‑22
[12]), which provides patch and dynamic regrouping services that are similar
to group regroup in MCPTT. P25 supports patch and simulselect that are similar
to MCPTT group regroup and MCPTT temporary group broadcast group,
respectively. (see TIA TIA‑102 AABH‑B [15]).
Gaps:
1\. Interworking LMR regrouping with MCPTT.
2\. Ownership of the regroup.
3\. Simultaneous regroup requests from each side of the IWF-1 interface.
4\. Operation where constituent groups contain both MCPTT and LMR users.
5\. Resolution of vocoder and encryption mode for the regroup.
### 5.6.2 Key issue #6-2: Group linking
#### 5.6.2.1 Description
Group linking is the case where separate groups in each system are linked
together, where each linked group only consists of users within the same
system and users affiliate/attach to the group directly in their own system.
It is used within the same technology, e.g., TETRA and TETRA over ISI
interface, while it may be an optional solution to achieve interworking for
group calls.
The following problems need further study:
1) Identify the linked group within a system;
2) Static and dynamic group linking;
3) Store and maintain the linking relationship; and
4) Determine the controlling group among the linked groups.
### 5.6.3 Key issue #6-3: Separate regrouping within each system
#### 5.6.3.1 Description
##### 5.6.3.1.1 Local regrouping overview
If one of the MCPTT system or the LMR system does not support group regrouping
signalling via the IWF, group regrouping is only possible within each system
locally. The outcome of this will be one or more regrouped groups on one
system connected to the other system via the IWF, without the other system
necessarily being aware that the regrouping has taken place.
The following subclauses illustrate the issues with regrouping and identifies
requirements for the solutions.
##### 5.6.3.1.2 Regrouping issues
###### 5.6.3.1.2.1 Temporary group identification
If group regrouping is initiated on the MCPTT system, the IWF will need to
understand the relationship between the temporary identity used on the MC
system and the original MC service group identity to ensure that group members
within the LMR system can continue to take part in group communications with
group members within the MCPTT system. The IWF may hide the use of the
temporary MCPTT group identity from the LMR system.
###### 5.6.3.1.2.2 Media routing
Care must be taken to ensure that regrouping a group that is connected to the
LMR system via the IWF does not lead to duplication of media.
## 5.7 Prioritisation and pre-emption
### 5.7.1 Key issue #7-1: Emergency calls
#### 5.7.1.1 Description
An emergency group call is the most critical of mission critical PTT calls,
usually indicating a life threatening condition for the user. This group call
typically has the highest priority when allocation of resources is concerned -
second highest behind system call in P25 and MCPTT systems. However, since
system call is rare, for all practical purposes an emergency group call is the
highest priority PTT call.
In addition to high priority, emergency group calls may pre-empt (take
resources away) from lower priority in-progress transmissions. This is
configurable (ruthless pre-emption versus top-of-queue).
A user can initiate an emergency group call by first indicating ergonomically
that he/she is in an emergency situation. Emergency group calls can be
initiated on the user\'s currently selected group, or a special group
designated for emergencies based on configuration.
Special call processing is associated with an emergency group call in the UEs,
at the dispatch centre, and throughout the system. Dispatch consoles are
typically involved in emergency declarations, cancellations, and display of
emergency conditions. Significant attention is made to ensure that an
emergency group call transmission is set up and received with extremely high
reliability. Normal priority group calls in progress can be changed to an
emergency group call.
During times of resource contention, the PTT system can be configured to allow
emergency group calls to have either \"top-of-queue\" or \"ruthless pre-
emption\" priority. \"Top-of-queue\" means that the call setup will be
processed immediately after sufficient resources are available. \"Ruthless
pre-emption\" means that low priority transmissions can have their resources
removed to allow the emergency group call to proceed.
An in-progress emergency is defined as an emergency notification from a UE or
a dispatch console that has been accepted by the mission critical PTT system,
but has not yet been cancelled by a UE or a dispatch console. In normal
operation, the system infrastructure tracks the state of the group emergency.
The activation of an emergency group call by a user puts the user into an
emergency state. Until the emergency state is cancelled at the radio/UE, every
transmission on this group by that user is an emergency group call
transmission.
The user identity of the initiator of an emergency group call is known and
conveyed to other affiliated group members. Late entrants to the group are
also notified of in-progress emergencies and of the identity of the initiator.
Multiple users can make emergency calls and be in emergency state
simultaneously on the same group.
Special procedures are used to cancel an in-progress emergency. In some LMR
systems, a timer is used to drop the in-progress emergency when there has been
a period of inactivity. In other LMR systems, a special message can be
transmitted from sufficiently privileged users to cancel the in-progress
emergency. In either case, the emergency state of the user can only be
cancelled by that user.
Emergency calls are the highest priority calls in TETRA systems.
Gaps:
1\. Mapping of emergency calls and actions between systems. Emergency
behaviours between systems may not be compatible. For example:
a. Pre-emption may be allowed in one system, but not allowed in the other;
b. Cancellation of the emergency on one system may require a deliberate
action, while it may be automatic on another system (e.g. based on a timer);
and,
c. Emergency operation when Dynamic Regrouping is active has significant
special processing differences in North American LMR systems.
2\. Configuration of the default emergency group may be different on one
system versus the other.
3\. Similar gaps for group call and unit identities as described in subclauses
5.4, 5.5 and 5.1.1 of the present document.
4\. Emergency cancellation: trust -- What should the trust relationship be
between the legacy LMR system and the MCPTT system? Particularly, should each
believe that the other has done an acceptable job of verifying that the user
tearing down the emergency is in fact authorised to do so, or does there need
to be some kind of end-to-end authentication/authorization?
5\. Emergency private call is supported in MCPTT and TETRA, but not in P25.
6\. In North American LMR systems, the system can be optionally configured to
track, or not track, the group emergency over the air interface. Tracking
means that all users of the group will have emergency priority when
transmitting until the emergency condition is over; not tracking means only
the UE with the emergency condition has emergency priority when transmitting.
7\. In TETRA, some emergency call features are customisable, such as who
receives the call and who is authorised to end the call.
8\. TETRA may convey location information for emergency calls and alerts,
using the LIP (Location Information Protocol). For TETRA seamless management
of location information during emergencies will be a high priority
requirement.
### 5.7.2 Key issue #7-2: Emergency alerts
#### 5.7.2.1 Description
Emergency alerts are sent from an end-user device to indicate that the user of
device has an emergency condition. The notification always goes to dispatch
consoles, but can also go to other users monitoring an optional, specified
group. There is a risk that emergency alerts can be lost if only a low-level
acknowledgement is conveyed to the initiator so it is common practice that
acknowledgement of the emergency alert means that it has been delivered to the
dispatcher.
Activation and transmission of an emergency alert usually requires a special
user-initiated procedure at the UE. The identity of the user declaring the
emergency alert is known, and optionally the identity of the group associated
with the alert. Based on configuration, activation and transmission of an
emergency alert optionally puts the UE into an \"emergency state\". When in an
emergency state, subsequent PTTs from the UE will make an emergency group
call.
The receipt of an emergency alert usually causes audible and visual alerts to
be heard/displayed at the dispatch centre and optionally on other UEs. A
dispatch operator acknowledges the emergency situation (method is manufacturer
dependent) which usually includes stopping the audible and/or visual
indications (i.e. human acknowledgement is required).
As a configurable option, mission critical PTT systems may allow UEs that are
unauthorised to make an emergency alert, to make one.
Transmission, receipt, and return acknowledgement to the UE of an Emergency
Alert is expected to be timely, typically in less than 500 msec.
An emergency alert cancel enables a UE to notify a dispatch console that the
user of this UE has cancelled the emergency condition. The user/UE is
responsible for maintaining its own emergency status, and monitoring and
optionally displaying in-progress emergencies and emergency alerts of other
UEs and groups.
Cancellation of an emergency alert, and also the internal emergency state of a
UE, usually requires a special user-initiated procedure at the UE. Only the
initiator is able to cancel the emergency condition of the UE. An emergency
group call cancellation does not cancel an internal UE emergency state that
may have been initiated by an emergency alert from the user.
A dispatcher, or any authorised user, is allowed to cancel an emergency alert
within the mission critical PTT system, but this does not alter the emergency
state of any UE.
Gaps:
1\. In MCPTT an emergency alert is accompanied by transmission of the best-
known user location. In P25, the location service is a separate function and
coupling with transmission of the emergency alert is possible, but not
standardised.
2\. Geo-fencing and ad hoc emergency alert groups. In MCPTT, a user may become
alerted due to proximity to other users who may or may not be affiliated to
the same group. These alerts cannot be conveyed to an LMR system, because LMR
systems do not have the same concept of geo-fenced ad hoc groups.
3\. Configuration of the default emergency group, which also applies to
emergency alerts, may be different on one system versus the other.
4\. Similar gaps for unit identities as described in subclause 5.1.1 of the
present document.
5\. Emergency alert cancellation: What should the trust relationship be
between the legacy LMR system and the LTE/PTT system? Particularly, should
each believe that the other has done an acceptable job of verifying that the
user tearing down the emergency alert is in fact authorised to do so, or does
there need to be some kind of end-to-end authentication/authorization?
## 5.8 Floor control
### 5.8.1 Key Issue #8-1: Simultaneous floor request
#### 5.8.1.1 Description
When multiple users in a single group across two systems request the floor
simultaneously, arbitration needs to occur across the two systems to ensure
that only one user is granted the floor at any given time. Doing so ensures
the integrity of the voice communication. The situation needs to be avoided
where more than one user has the floor at the same time, which results in
multiple users talking over each other, which degrades the intelligibility of
the voice conversation significantly.
Figure 5.8.1.1-1 illustrates this scenario:
Figure 5.8.1.1-1: Simultaneous floor requests by MCPTT UE and LMR MS
In figure 5.8.1.1-1, users in a group communication are distributed between
MCPTT and LMR systems, and one MCPTT UE and one LMR MS request for the floor
simultaneously. In this case, the requests are arbitrated between the two
systems so that only one user\'s request is granted.
In the figure above, as an example, the floor request from MCPTT UE A1 is
granted and the LMR MS B1 is rejected.
### 5.8.2 Key Issue #8-2: User\'s floor is revoked by another user in another
system
#### 5.8.2.1 Description
When there is a group communication involving users across two systems, there
may be a situation where a floor request from a user under one system triggers
revocation of the current floor-granted user under another system for reasons
such as the higher priority of the new request. In this case, arbitration
needs to occur across the two systems to maintain the integrity of the group
communication. A suitable mechanism needs to be in place to ensure the floor
revocation and floor grant occurs across two systems.
Figure 5.8.2.1-1 illustrates this scenario:
Figure 5.8.2.1-1: MCPTT UE revokes the floor from LMR MS
In figure 5.8.2.1-1, users in a group communication are distributed between
MCPTT and LMR systems, and an LMR MS initially has the floor and talking. Then
an MCPTT UE requests a floor with higher priority than the LMR MS that
currently has the floor. Due to the higher priority of MCPTT UE, its floor
request is granted and the current floor to the LMR MS is revoked.
In the figure above, as an example, the floor request from MCPTT UE A1 is
granted due to higher priority and the LMR MS B1\'s floor is revoked.
A similar scenario applies if the role and the priority in the two systems are
reversed.
### 5.8.3 Key issue #8-3: Floor Request timing
#### 5.8.3.1 Description
Interworked (and interconnected) systems may be subject to additional radio
access and transport delays in comparison with a heterogeneous single-MCPTT
server network without relay or gateway nodes. This means that floor request
transmissions sent from either an LMR device on an LMR system, or an MCPTT UE
on an MCPTT system can take different times to arrive at the controlling floor
control server. These delays can be several tens of milliseconds and
potentially in excess of 80ms depending on configuration, and more in the case
of long transport backhaul. These delays are significant in comparison with
both the SA1 requirement of a round trip response time of 300ms and the human
response time of 200 -- 300ms.
In particular, if one part of a combined system is likely to be subject to
greater uplink delays towards the controlling floor control server than
another part, then users of UEs or LMR devices on the delayed component will
be subject to an inherent bias in the chance of their floor requests being
accepted. Even if queuing is applied, it is possible that a queue with small
depth might cause floor requests from a delayed system part to be rejected
because they exceeded the queuing depth.
A floor control server acting fairly would need a good approximation to the
time at which the floor request was issued by a requesting MCPTT UE or LMR
device in order to correctly prioritise and order the requests in the queue
and respond in a timely fashion.
## 5.9 MCData SDS
### 5.9.1 Key Issue #9-1: Payload size handling
#### 5.9.1.1 Description
When an MCData SDS message is sent towards an LMR system there is the
possibility that the size of the payload of a single MCData SDS message
(currently a maximum of 1000 bytes) will exceed the maximum size of a single
message of the corresponding type in the LMR system.
TETRA SDS messages may also be concatenated up to a certain limit, which could
also potentially lead to a larger combined message being sent towards the
MCData system.
Further study on handling these maximum length differences is necessary.
### 5.9.2 Key Issue #9-2: Payload conversion
#### 5.9.2.1 Description
When an MCData SDS message is sent towards an LMR system or vice-versa, the
payloads might need to be converted between system formats. LMR systems such
as TETRA make extensive use of application data carried over TETRA SDS
messages as well as using TETRA SDS messages for carriage of plain text or
status; it is probable that a range of application uses could also be true for
MC voice+data systems using the MCData SDS service. In TETRA, the relevant
application type identity is denoted by a Protocol ID (PID) and included in
the TETRA SDS message. Some of these PID values are global to TETRA, whilst
others may be proprietary to a particular system or supplier.
The conversion of the payloads and application types needs to be considered
further in order for an interworked solution to be practicable.
NOTE: Solution for payload conversion is outside the scope of the present
document.
# 6 Solutions
## 6.1 General solutions
### 6.1.1 Solution #0-1: General interworking architecture solution between
MCPTT and LMR Systems.
#### 6.1.1.1 General
LMR system specifications define the equipment and sub-systems that constitute
the network, including base stations and terminals. While in MCPTT systems,
the MCPTT server provides centralised support for MCPTT services. In order to
realise communication between these different systems, an interworking
function (IWF) is introduced to support protocol translation, identity
mapping, routing, and so on.
Figure 6.1.1.1-1 illustrates a solution based on the existing architecture of
an interworking mechanism.
Figure 6.1.1.1-1: General Interworking architecture between MCPTT and LMR
Systems
An IWF function is introduced in between the MCPTT system and the LMR system.
The IWF is composed of two parts:
1\. An interface to the MCPTT system based on the current MCPTT specification
3GPP TS 23.379 [11], the IWF-1 can use a subset of existing MCPTT reference
points (e.g. MCPTT-3 between one MCPTT server and another MCPTT server).
2\. An interface to the LMR system based on reference point(s) defined by the
LMR system.
The IWF‑1 interface, identified in, but not specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11],
is the reference point through which MCPTT systems support interworking with
legacy systems.
NOTE: TCCE (TETRA and Critical Communications Evolution) group has developed
ETSI TR 103 269‑1 [16] which defines an architecture model supporting Critical
Communications Application (CCA) to operate with broadband IP networks such as
3GPP LTE (i.e. between the IWF and the LMR system).
#### 6.1.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures that utilise an IWF-1 reference point are needed.
#### 6.1.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution specifies a general interworking architecture between the MCPTT
system and an LMR system. The solution introduces a new interworking reference
point IWF-1, which terminates in the IWF, where that IWF supports functions
such as protocol translation, identity mapping, transcoding and routing.
### 6.1.2 Solution #0-2: General interworking architecture between MCData and
LMR systems
#### 6.1.2.1 General
LMR system specifications define the equipment and sub-systems that constitute
the LMR network, including base stations and terminals, whilst in MCData
systems, the MCData server provides centralised support for MCData services
and in particular standalone MCData SDS services. In order to realise
communication between these different systems, a logical interworking function
(IWF) is introduced to support protocol translation, identity mapping,
routing, and so on.
Figure 6.1.2.1-1 illustrates a solution based on the existing architecture of
an interworking mechanism.
Figure 6.1.2.1-1 General interworking architecture for standalone SDS between
MCData and LMR Systems
A logical IWF function is introduced in between the MCPTT system and the LMR
system.
The IWF is composed of two parts:
1\. An interface to the MCData system based on the current MCData
specifications 3GPP TS 23.282 [18]. The IWF-2 reference point can use a subset
of existing MCData reference points (e.g. MCData-3 between one MCData server
and another MCData server)
2\. An interface to the LMR system based on the reference point(s) defined by
the LMR system.
To ensure that standalone SDS data can be exchanged between MCData and LMR
systems, the functionalities of the IWF that are supported for interworking
with the MCData system and the IWF-2 will be identified in the MCData
specification.
#### 6.1.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures that utilise an IWF-2 reference point are needed.
#### 6.1.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution specifies a general interworking architecture between the MCData
system and an LMR system. The solution introduces a new interworking reference
point IWF-2, which terminates in the IWF, where that IWF supports functions
such as protocol translation, identity mapping and routing.
## 6.2 Identity
### 6.2.1 Solution #1-1: Identity mapping
#### 6.2.1.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #1-1 and key issue #1-2 about user identity
and group identity mapping between an MCPTT or MCData system and an LMR
system.
The IWF provides centralised support for interworking between an MCPTT or
MCData system and an LMR system.
In MCPTT systems, the identity of an LMR user should be provided as an MCPTT
ID, and the identity of an LMR group should be provided as an MCPTT group ID,
which can be used by the IWF to derive the corresponding identities used in an
LMR system. Similarly, in MCData systems, the identity of an LMR user should
be provided as an MCData ID, and the identity of an LMR group should be
provided as an MCData group ID, which can be used by the IWF to derive the
corresponding identities used in an LMR system.
The IWF shall perform the identity mapping between an MCPTT or MCData system
and an LMR system during exchange of signalling and media messages.
#### 6.2.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Need a reference point to an IWF.
#### 6.2.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution specifies the functionality of the IWF to resolve the user
identity and group identity mapping between an MCPTT or MCData system and an
LMR system.
## 6.3 Homing and affiliation
### 6.3.1 Solution #2-1: Group affiliation
#### 6.3.1.1 Description
##### 6.3.1.1.1 Affiliation cases
The participating system of the group, which may be the LMR system or the
MCPTT system, may inform the controlling system of the group concerning group
affiliations, and may pass affiliation related signalling to the controlling
system in one of the following ways:
\- Every group affiliation in the participating system results in an
affiliation sent to the controlling system, which may contain the identity
(with appropriate translation by the IWF) of the affiliating group member; or
\- A group affiliation is sent from the participating system to the
controlling system when the first group member affiliates to the designated
group in the participating system, and a group deaffiliation is sent to the
controlling system when the last group member deaffiliates, and no other group
affiliation signalling is sent.
In the second option, only the group identity is sent from participating
system to controlling system and group members\' identities are not sent. This
implies that when a call is set up or the floor is requested by a client in
the participating system, the identity of the client will not be perceived by
the controlling system as having previously affiliated to the group.
##### 6.3.1.1.2 Group affiliation to group defined in MCPTT system
The LMR system may affiliate its group members to the interworking group via
the IWF. The LMR system manages the affiliations from other LMR group members
internally without involving the MCPTT system.
For group regroup, the affiliated group members are automatically affiliated
to the temporary group.
The signalling procedure of interworking group affiliation is described in
figure 6.3.1.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group to be affiliated to is defined in MCPTT system.
2\. The IWF is connected to and is authorised to interwork with the MCPTT
system.
3\. The interworking group information is available at the IWF.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between MCPTT
system and LMR system, the IWF shall perform the identity conversion and
protocol translation.
Figure 6.3.1.1.2-1: Group affiliation to group defined in MCPTT system
1\. The IWF sends a group affiliation request to the MCPTT server on behalf of
the LMR system.
2a. MCPTT server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If the group
policy is not locally cached on the MCPTT server then MCPTT server requests
the group policy from the group management server.
2b. MCPTT server receives the group policy from the group management server.
3\. Based on the group policy and user subscription, the MCPTT server
affiliates the LMR system to the group. If a separate affiliation for each LMR
user is expected, the status of the affiliating user is stored by the MCPTT
server as the status associated with an MCPTT ID provided by the IWF that
corresponds to the identity of that LMR user. If a separate affiliation for
each LMR user is not expected, an affiliation status for the group using an
identity provided by the IWF is stored, however no individual user\'s
affiliation status is stored.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the group affiliation status update message to the
group management server, the group management server stores and updates the
group affiliation status.
5\. The MCPTT server returns group affiliation response to the IWF.
6\. The IWF completes the group affiliation with the LMR system.
NOTE 2: How the LMR user(s) affiliates to a group is outside the scope of the
present document.
##### 6.3.1.1.3 Group de-affiliation to group defined in MCPTT system
The signalling procedure of interworking group de-affiliation is described in
figure 6.3.1.1.3-1.
The LMR system manages the individual de-affiliation requests from the LMR
users. The LMR system may de-affiliate its group members from the interworking
group via the IWF.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at IWF.
2\. The affiliation procedure described in subclause 6.3.1 is performed.
NOTE 1: For all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between MCPTT
system and LMR system, the IWF shall perform the identity convert and protocol
translation.
Figure 6.3.1.1.3-1: Group de-affiliation to group defined in MCPTT system
1\. The IWF sends the group de-affiliation request to the MCPTT server on
behalf of the LMR system.
2\. If a separate de-affiliation from each LMR user is expected and based on
the group policy and user subscription, the MCPTT server may de-affiliate the
LMR group member from the group. Further, the MCPTT server may store the
affiliation status of the user(s) for the requested MC service group(s). If a
separate de-affiliation from each LMR user is not expected, the de-affiliation
signalling de-affiliates the entire LMR system from the group.
3\. The MCPTT server sends the group de-affiliation status update message to
the group management server, the group management server stores and updates
the group affiliation status.
4\. The MCPTT server returns group de-affiliation response to the IWF.
5\. The IWF completes the group de-affiliation with the LMR system.
NOTE 2: How the LMR user(s) de-affiliate from a group is outside the scope of
the present document.
#### 6.3.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures are needed between the MCPTT server and IWF.
If a single affiliation at the system level is sent from a participating LMR
system on behalf of all affiliated group members without sending individual
group member affiliations, then either the MCPTT server will need to process
call set up and floor control requests from group members from the LMR system
that have not individually affiliated as far as that MCPTT server is aware, or
the IWF will have to provide a single identity on behalf of any calling group
member, and calling and talking party identities corresponding to the actual
LMR users will not be available to MCPTT group members.
To allow the MCPTT server to process call requests on behalf of users from the
LMR system who have not explicitly affiliated, in the case that the identity
of the calling party on the LMR system is required, the MCPTT server behaviour
will need to be changed such that call setup and floor requests are permitted
from users from the LMR system who have not explicitly affiliated to the
group.
#### 6.3.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a new procedure for an LMR user to affiliate to and de-
affiliate from an interworking group defined in MCPTT system.
Using a single affiliation by the participating system when any group members
have affiliated within that system and a de-affiliation only when the last
group member de-affiliates will enable interworking with LMR systems that do
not support sending individual group members\' affiliations through the IWF.
If the identities corresponding to the calling party from the LMR system are
required to be conveyed to receiving MCPTT users, the behaviour of the MCPTT
server will need to be changed to allow call setup and floor control
signalling from users from the LMR system who have not affiliated to the
group.
### 6.3.2 Solution #2-2: Group controlling system
#### 6.3.2.1 Description
A group which contains group members in both the LMR system and the MCPTT
system can be considered to be a single group spanning both systems. To enable
consistent behaviour for contention management and media distribution, one of
the two systems needs to be defined as the controlling system for the combined
group. The other system is considered to be the participating system for
affiliation and group calls. From the perspective of the MCPTT system, the
controlling system will be the system in which the group is defined:
\- If the MC service group ID is defined in a group management server within
the MCPTT system, the MCPTT system will be the controlling system.
\- If the MC service group ID appears to the MCPTT system to refer to an MC
service group that is defined in a partner system which is represented by the
IWF, the LMR system will be the controlling system.
Therefore, either the LMR system or the MCPTT system may be defined as the
controlling system for each group.
The participating system will send affiliation signalling to the controlling
system to indicate its interest in inter-system group calls within the
relevant group(s).
Where group calls are to be setup, when a group member in the participating
system initiates a group call, the participating system will send call
requests to the controlling system. The controlling system will include the
participating system in group calls within the relevant group(s) provided the
participating system is implicitly affiliated.
Where floor control signalling is sent within a group by a group member within
the participating system, the participating system will send floor requests to
the controlling system for arbitration. The controlling system will send floor
control grant signalling to the participating system for distribution to group
members within the call. Further floor control key issues are listed in key
issues 8-1, 8-2 and 8-3.
#### 6.3.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
There is no functional impact on existing nodes, as both MCPTT and LMR systems
have the concept of controlling and participating servers and systems.
The MC service group identity identifies which system is the controlling
system for an MC service group, as the identity of the group contains the
identity of the system where the group is defined. This may be the LMR system
if the MC service group address identifies the IWF as the system where the
group is defined.
#### 6.3.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution allows a single point of control for affiliation, group call and
floor control.
## 6.4 Session setup and termination
### 6.4.1 Solution #3-1: Private call with parameter negotiation solution
#### 6.4.1.1 Description
##### 6.4.1.1.1 General
The following sub-clauses address the gaps in key issue #4 of the present
document. Solutions for the 3 gaps are presented, followed by procedures for
private call setup in manual and automatic commencement modes. The procedures
incorporate the concepts from the gap solutions.
###### 6.4.1.1.1.1 Gap 1 - Multiple MCPTT client instances
No special mechanisms are needed for interworking to support communication
with multiple instances of MCPTT clients. MCPTT users can be addressed by
MCPTT ID which the MCPTT system routes to the correct MCPTT client instance.
There are no cases in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11] for an MCPTT client instance to late
join a private call and therefore no solution needed in TR 23.782 for an
additional MCPTT client instance late joining a private call.
###### 6.4.1.1.1.2 Gap 2 - Commencement mode compatibility
LMR systems support various combinations of private call parameters and
capabilities. To cope with various LMR implementations of private call, this
subclause introduces the concept of parameter negotiation. Subclauses
6.4.1.1.2 and 6.4.1.1.3 below incorporate these concepts.
The new parameters to be negotiated are:
\- media type (codec type);
\- E2EE mode;
\- commencement mode;
\- implicit floor (who talks first); and
\- duplex mode (full or half duplex).
Editor's note: Negotiation of codec type and the impact of E2EE on this
solution are FFS.
The operation is as follows. The caller presents desired values for the
parameters at call setup. The server forwards the parameter selection as part
of call setup to the system of the called party. The called party\'s system
responds with an alternate choice for one or more parameters or simply accepts
the call. The server chooses the final set of parameters and conveys them to
the calling party or rejects the call.
While this subclause pertains to private calls with LMR users, the procedures
are written such that they can also apply to any user in any peer system.
For cases where one or more parameters proposed by the MCPTT client are not
supported by the IWF, it\'s up to the MCPTT client to decide whether to end
the call attempt or whether to adapt its behavior to the calling user and try
again with the new parameters.
###### 6.4.1.1.1.3 Gap 3 - Full duplex calls
The proposed solution for duplex mode negotiation for gap 2 above is
applicable to this gap.
##### 6.4.1.1.2 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode -- users in
multiple systems
In this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT private call
(automatic commencement mode) for communicating with a user in an LMR system,
with or without floor control enabled.
In figure 6.4.1.1.2-1, an MCPTT client initiates establishment of an MCPTT
private call with an LMR user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call;
Figure 6.4.1.1.2-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode -- users
in multiple systems
1\. MCPTT client 1 registers to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in
subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
2\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private
call.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server. The MCPTT private call request contains:
\- the MCPTT ID corresponding to the LMR called user and an SDP offer
containing one or more media types;
\- the encryption mode;
\- an indication of whether MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor;
\- requested commencement mode (automatic in this case); and
\- an indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to
establish floor control).
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorised to initiate the private call. If the MCPTT private call request is
requesting automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorised to initiate a call in
automatic commencement mode.
5\. If authorised, MCPTT server 1 sends the MCPTT private call request towards
the IWF, including the original parameters with possible modification to the
listed media types.
6\. The IWF sends an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server,
indicating alternative values for any parameters that it or its client cannot
support. If no alternative parameters are given in the response, a call can be
established without steps 9 and 10 and the LMR end user can be notified of the
incoming call.
7\. MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1.
MCPTT server 1 checks whether the any alternative parameter values are
proposed by the IWF. If the parameters in the MCPTT private call response
match those in the original MCPTT private call request from MCPTT client 1,
then MCPTT client 1 proceeds to step 8. If the parameters in the MCPTT private
call response have changed and are acceptable to MCPTT client 1, then MCPTT
client 1 sends a new MCPTT private call request with the new parameters and
behaves according to those parameters. The calling MCPTT user may be notified
of the change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor
control. The MCPTT user may choose to end the call rather than continue with
the new parameters.
8\. MCPTT client 1 has successfully established media plane for communication
to the IWF and either end can transmit media. For successful call
establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor
control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to transmit.
At the same time the IWF is informed by the floor control server at MCPTT
service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 6.4.1.1.3 Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- users in
multiple systems
In this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT private call (manual
commencement mode) for communicating with an LMR user via an IWF, with or
without floor control enabled.
In figure 6.4.1.1.3-1, an MCPTT client initiates establishment of an MCPTT
private call with an LMR user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode for the call.
Figure 6.4.1.1.3-1: Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- users in
multiple systems
1\. MCPTT client 1 registers to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in
subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
2\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private
call.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server. The MCPTT private call request contains:
\- the MCPTT ID corresponding to the called LMR user and an SDP offer
containing one or more media types;
\- an indication of whether MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor;
\- requested commencement mode (manual in this case); and
\- an indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to
establish floor control).
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorised to initiate the private call. If the MCPTT private call request is
requesting manual commencement mode then the MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorised to initiate a call in
manual commencement mode.
5\. If authorised, MCPTT server 1 sends the MCPTT private call request towards
the IWF, including the original parameters with possible modification to the
listed media types.
6\. The IWF sends an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server, which
may indicate alternative values.
7\. MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1.
MCPTT client 1 checks whether the any alternative parameter values were
included in the response and may adapt its behaviour toward the end user or
may end the call. If the parameters in the MCPTT private call response have
changed and are acceptable to MCPTT client 1, then MCPTT client 1 sends a new
MCPTT private call request with the new parameters to MCPTT server 1 and
behaves according to those parameters. The calling user may be notified of the
change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor
control. The user may choose to end the call rather than continue with the new
parameters.
8\. The receiving IWF sends an MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT server while waiting
for the call to be accepted.
9\. MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client1. MCPTT client 1
may indicate to the MCPTT user that the LMR user has been notified, e.g. by
producing ringback audio.
10\. Once the call has been accepted, the IWF sends an MCPTT private call
response to MCPTT server 1.
11\. MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client
1. MCPTT client 1 may indicate to the MCPTT user that the call is connected,
e.g. by stopping the ringback audio.
12\. MCPTT client 1 has successfully established media plane for communication
to the IWF and either end can transmit media. For successful call
establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor
control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to transmit.
At the same time the IWF is informed by the MCPTT floor control that the floor
is taken.
#### 6.4.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Introduction of parameters for negotiation modifies the existing procedures
and call flows between the MCPTT server and a partner MCPTT system and between
the MCPTT server and MCPTT clients.
#### 6.4.1.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution provides a simple enhancement so that MCPTT clients can support
various LMR modes of operation (commencement modes, duplex mode and who talks
first) and describes how LMR systems can cope with multiple MCPTT client
instances.
### 6.4.2 Solution #3-2: Private call initiated by LMR user to MCPTT user
#### 6.4.2.1 Description
The private call initiated by a LMR user to an MCPTT user shall be supported.
When the IWF receives a private call request from an LMR user to an MCPTT
user, the IWF shall send the private call request towards the MCPTT server
based on the called party (e.g., user identity).
The signalling procedure for private call initiated by a LMR user to an MCPTT
user is described in figure 6.4.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 1 is registered and its respective user - MCPTT user 1 is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service.
2\. The called LMR user is provided an MCPTT ID and considered as an MCPTT
user registered at IWF.
3\. The identity mapping relationship for the MCPTT user and the LMR user
between the MCPTT system and LMR system is maintained at the IWF.
Figure 6.4.2.1-1: Private call initiated by LMR user to MCPTT user
1\. Upon receiving the private call from the LMR user to the MCPTT user, the
IWF converts the LMR user identity to the MCPTT ID and performs the protocol
translation.
NOTE 1: How LMR user initiates a private call is outside the scope of the
present document.
2\. The IWF sends a private call request (calling MCPTT ID, called MCPTT ID,
media description information (e.g., codec), E2EE and commencement mode) to
the MCPTT server .The called MCPTT ID is the identity of LMR user in MCPTT
system. The IWF may include a requested commencement mode that indicates that
the call is to be established in automatic commencement mode if automatic
commencement mode is requested by the initiating LMR user.
3\. MCPTT server calls the called MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 to join the
MCPTT private call as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11]. The MCPTT user accepts
the private call. If E2EE is negotiated, then the calling MCPTT user and the
called LMR user shall use the same codec. If E2EE is not specified, the
calling MCPTT user and the called LMR user can use different codecs and
transcode is needed at the IWF.
4\. The MCPTT server returns the private call response to the IWF.
5\. IWF performs identity convert and protocol translation, and sends back a
private call response to the LMR user. The LMR user confirms the successful
private call setup.
NOTE 2: How IWF provides response to LMR system and how LMR user confirms a
private call is successfully established are outside the scope of the present
document.
6\. LMR user and MCPTT client 1 have successfully established media plane for
communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call
establishment for private call with floor control request from LMR user, the
MCPTT client 1 is informed that floor is taken.
NOTE 3: The LMR system is the controlling system. How the floor control is
managed in the LMR system is outside the scope of the present document.
#### 6.4.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures are needed between the MCPTT server and IWF.
#### 6.4.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a solution to address private call initiated by a LMR
user to an MCPTT user. The parameters used for private call for interworking
is negotiated during the call setup including commencement mode, E2EE, etc.
### 6.4.3 Solution #3-3: Group call on a temporary group
#### 6.4.3.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #3-3 group call. This solution describes the
group call initiated on a temporary interworking group consisting of groups
from MCPTT system and LMR system. This solution is applied for pre-arranged
group call, broadcast group call and emergency and imminent peril group call.
#### 6.4.3.2 Description
##### 6.4.3.2.1 Group call initiated by MCPTT user over interworking temporary
group defined in MCPTT system
This subclause describes the group call between MCPTT system and LMR system on
a temparary interworking group, which consists of two sub-groups that one from
MCPTT system and the other from LMR system.
When the group call is initiated by an MCPTT user, the MCPTT server hosting
the interworking temporary group shall act as the controlling server and
request the IWF to call the LMR sub-group.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 6.4.3.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The temporary interworking group consisting of the two sub-groups, one
from MCPTT system and the other from LMR system, has been created and
configured.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is registered and its respective user - MCPTT user 1 is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service.
3\. The users in this temporary interworking group have been affiliated to the
temporary interworking group during group regroup procedure.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at IWF. For all the signalling pass through
the IWF between MCPTT system and LMR system, the IWF shall perform identity
conversion and protocol translation.
Figure 6.4.3.2.1-1: Group call initiated by MCPTT user over temporary
interworking group defined in MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate a group call for the
selected interworking group identified by MCPTT group ID.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request including MCPTT group ID, SDP
offer with media parameters towards the MCPTT server, which hosts the
temporary group selected by the user. If there is a floor request to transmit,
then the group call request contains an indication of an implicit floor
request.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorised to
initiate a group call over the selected temporary group. If authorised and the
group call is ongoing for that group, the MCPTT server adds the requesting
MCPTT client 1 to the existing group call and notifies the MCPTT client 1 that
the group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCPTT server resolves the
MCPTT group ID with GMS and gets the identities of sub-groups.
4\. MCPTT server proceeds group call setup procedures to call sub-group from
MCPTT system as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
5\. MCPTT server sends a group call request including identity of the sub-
group from LMR system towards the IWF.
6\. Upon receiving the group call request, the IWF performs the identity
conversion and protocol translation, and call the LMR sub-group.
NOTE 1: How the LMR sub-group is called is outside the scope of the present
document.
7\. IWF then returns group call response to the MCPTT server. If E2EE is
specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR users shall use the same codec. If
E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and the LMR users can use different
codecs and transcode is needed at the IWF.
8\. The MCPTT server sends group call request the MCPTT client 1 about
successful call establishment.
9\. Interworking group call has successfully established media plane for
communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call
establishment for group call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, floor
participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor control server
within MCPTT server, giving it permission to transmit. At the same time group
members are informed that floor is taken.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT system where the interworking group is defined is the
controlling system of the group call.
##### 6.4.3.2.2 Group call initiated by LMR user over temporary interworking
group defined in MCPTT system.
This subclause describes the group call between MCPTT system and LMR system on
a temparary interworking group, which consists of two sub-groups that one from
MCPTT system and the other from LMR system.
When a group call is initiated by an LMR user, the MCPTT server hosting the
interworking group shall act as the controlling server and requests the IWF to
call the LMR sub-group.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 6.4.3.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The temporary interworking group consisting and the two sub-groups that
one from MCPTT system and the other from LMR system has been created and
configured.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is registered and its respective user - MCPTT user 1 is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service.
3\. The users in this temporary interworking group have been affiliated to the
temporary interworking group during group regroup procedure.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at IWF. For all the signalling pass through
the IWF between MCPTT system and LMR system, the IWF shall perform identity
conversion and protocol translation.
Figure 6.4.3.2.2-1: Group call initiated by LMR user over temporary
interworking group defined in MCPTT system
1\. Upon receiving the group call from the LMR user, the IWF performs identity
conversion and protocol translation. For a group call with floor control,
floor control is to be established.
NOTE 1: How LMR user initiates a group call with or without floor control is
outside the scope of the present document.
2\. The IWF sends a group call request including MCPTT group ID to MCPTT
server host the temporary group for call establishment. If floor control is
requested by the calling LMR user, an indication of implicit floor request is
included.
3\. The MCPTT server resolves the group ID with GMS to get the identities of
sub-groups. MCPTT server calls the sub-group from MCPTT system as described in
3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
NOTE 2: If E2EE is specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR users shall use
the same codec. If E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and the LMR users
can use different codecs and transcode is needed at the IWF.
4\. MCPTT server sends group call request to the IWF to call the sub-group
from the LMR system.
5\. The IWF performs the identity conversion and protocol translation. And
calls the sub-group from LMR system.

#### 6.4.3.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures are needed between the MCPTT server and IWF over IWF-1.
#### 6.4.3.4 Solution evaluation
The solution proposes a solution that makes it possible for an LMR user or an
MCPTT user to initiate a group call over a temporary interworking group
defined in MCPTT system. This solution reuses the temporary group call
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11] to the utmost.
### 6.4.4 Solution #3-4: Group call on an interworking group
#### 6.4.4.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #3-4, group call. This solution describes
the group call initiated on an interworking group with group members from an
MCPTT system and an LMR system. This solution is applied for pre-arranged
group calls, broadcast group calls and emergency and imminent peril group
calls.
#### 6.4.4.2 Description
##### 6.4.4.2.1 Group call initiated by MCPTT user over interworking group
defined in MCPTT system
This subclause describes the group call between an MCPTT system and an LMR
system on an interworking group in an MCPTT system, where the group consists
of group members from the MCPTT system and the LMR system.
When a group call is initiated by an MCPTT user, the MCPTT server hosting the
interworking group shall act as the controlling server and request the IWF to
call the LMR group members.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 6.4.4.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group, consisting of group members from the MCPTT system
and the LMR system, has been created and configured.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is registered and its respective user, MCPTT user 1, is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service.
3\. The MC users have been affiliated to the interworking group, and the IWF
has affiliated to the group on behalf of the LMR group members.
4\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at the IWF. For all signalling passed
through the IWF between the MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF shall
perform identity conversion and protocol translation.
Figure 6.4.4.2.1-1: Group call initiated by MCPTT user over interworking group
defined in MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate a group call for the
selected interworking group identified by the MCPTT group ID.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request including an MCPTT group ID and
an SDP offer with media parameters towards the MCPTT server, which hosts the
interworking group selected by the user. If there is a floor request to
transmit, then the group call request contains an indication of an implicit
floor request.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorised to
initiate a group call over the selected interworking group. If authorised and
the group call is ongoing for that group, the MCPTT server adds the requesting
MCPTT client 1 to the existing group call and notifies the MCPTT client 1 that
the group call is already in progress. Otherwise, the MCPTT server resolves
the MCPTT group ID with the GMS and gets the identities of the group members.
4\. MCPTT server proceeds to the group call setup procedures to call group
members from the MCPTT system as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
5\. The MCPTT server sends a group call request including the identity of the
group member from the LMR system towards the IWF.
NOTE 1: Step 5 may occur at the same time as or before step 4.
6\. Upon receiving the group call request, the IWF performs the identity
conversion and protocol translation, and calls the group members from LMR
system.
NOTE 2: How the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is outside
the scope of the present document.
7\. The IWF then returns a group call response to the MCPTT server.
8\. The MCPTT server sends a group call request the MCPTT client 1 about
successful call establishment.
9\. Interworking group call has successfully established the media plane for
communication and group members can transmit media. For successful call
establishment for a group call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the
floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor by the floor control
server within the MCPTT server, giving it permission to transmit. At the same
time group members are informed that the floor is taken.
NOTE 3: If E2EE is specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR users shall use
the same codec. If E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and the LMR users
can use different codecs and a transcode is needed at the IWF.
##### 6.4.4.2.2 Group call initiated by MCPTT user over interworking group
defined in LMR system
This subclause describes the solution to achieve the group call between MCPTT
system and LMR system by creating a interworking group in LMR system, which
consists of group members from MCPTT system and LMR system.
When a group call is initiated by an MCPTT user, the LMR system hosting the
interworking group shall act as the controlling system. The group call request
from the initiating MCPTT user shall be routed to the LMR system via the IWF
for controlling of the group call establishment.

Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group, consisting of group members from the MCPTT system
and the LMR system, has been created and configured.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is registered and its respective user, MCPTT user 1, is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service, and has affiliated to
the interworking group.
3\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT

floor request to transmit, then the group call request contains an indication
of an implicit floor request.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorised to
initiate a group call for the selected interworking group.
4\. If authorised, MCPTT server routes the group call request to the IWF.
5\. The IWF performs identity conversion and protocol translation, and
initiates group call to the target LMR system hosting the interworking group.
Then the IWF gets the identity of group members from the MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: How LMR system handles the group call and resolves a group is outside
the scope of the present document.

group call response to the target LMR system and target LMR system confirms
that the group call is successfully setup.
NOTE 2: How LMR system confirms the successful group call establishment is
outside the scope of the present document.
10, 11. The group call response is delivered to MCPTT client 1 for
confirmation of the successful call establishment.
12\. Interworking group has successfully established media plane for
communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call
establishment for group calls with floor control request from MCPTT client 1,
the floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor by the LMR
system, giving it permission to transmit. At the same time other group members
are informed that the floor is taken.
NOTE 3: If E2EE is specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR users shall use
the same codec. If E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and the LMR users
can use different codecs and transcoding is needed at the IWF.

defined in MCPTT system.
This subclause describes the solution to achieve the group call between an
MCPTT system and an LMR system by creating an interworking group in the MCPTT
system, which consists of group members from MCPTT system and LMR system.
When a group call is initiated by an LMR user, the MCPTT server hosting the

##### 6.4.4.2.4 Group call initiated by LMR user over interworking group
defined in LMR system.
This subclause describes the solution to achieve a group call between an MCPTT
system and an LMR system by creating a interworking group in the LMR system,
which consists of group members from the MCPTT system and the LMR system.
When a group call is initiated by an LMR user, the LMR system hosting the
interworking group shall act as the controlling system and requests the IWF to
call the MCPTT group members.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 6.4.4.2.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The interworking group, consisting of group members from the MCPTT system
and from the LMR system, has been created and configured.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is registered and its respective user, MCPTT user 1, is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service and has affiliated to
the interworking group.

#### 6.4.4.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures are needed between the MCPTT server and IWF.
#### 6.4.4.4 Solution evaluation
This solution provides new procedures that make it possible for an LMR user or
an MCPTT user to initiate a group call over interworking group defined in the
LMR system or in the MCPTT system.
The solution cannot be fulfilled if the clients of one system (e.g. the LMR
system) cannot make calls to a group defined on the other system (e.g. the
MCPTT system).
If the LMR system only supports group calls over group regrouping or linked
groups, the group call procedures over an interworking group may not be
applicable.
This solution requires that each group member be called from the other side of
IWF-1, a large signalling load may result across IWF-1.
### 6.4.5 Solution #3-5: Late entry in interworking group call
#### 6.4.5.1 Description
##### 6.4.5.1.1 Late entry overview
If a group call is ongoing in the group controlling system, but does not
include the participating system, for example if the participating system had
no affiliated group members at the time that the call was established, the
participating system needs to be included in the group call when or shortly
after a group member affiliates.
If an explicit affiliation is sent to the controlling system because of the
affiliations of group members within the participating system, either when the
first group member affiliates to the group in the participating system or when
each group member affiliates to the group in the participating system, then
late entry call setup signalling can be sent to the participating system when
the controlling system receives the group affiliation from the participating
system.
These procedures are described in the following subclauses.
##### 6.4.5.1.2 Late entry following affiliation, MCPTT controlling system
In this procedure, an explicit affiliation is used as the trigger for late
call entry signalling and the MCPTT system is the controlling system.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 6.4.5.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A group call is ongoing in the MCPTT system, and the MCPTT system is the
controlling system for the interworking group call.
2\. The LMR system is the participating system, and is not taking part in the
group call as there were no group members affiliated to the group at the start
of the call.
Figure 6.4.5.1.2-1:Late entry from LMR system with MCPTT system controlling
1\. A group member affiliates to the interworking group in the LMR system.
2\. The IWF sends a group affiliation request for the interworking group to
the MCPTT server. If the LMR system provides individual affiliations from
group members, the MCPTT ID corresponding to the affiliating group member is
included in the request. If the LMR system does not provide individual
affiliations from group members, the MCPTT ID will correspond to the IWF.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that the affiliation to the MCPTT group from the
IWF is authorised.
4\. The MCPTT server responds to the IWF that the affiliation is accepted.
5\. The MCPTT server sends a late entry group call setup for the interworking
group to the IWF to include the LMR system in the group call.
6\. The IWF responds with a successful call setup response.
7\. The media plane is established between MCPTT server and IWF. Floor control
signalling is sent to the IWF to indicate the current talking party.
##### 6.4.5.1.3 Late entry following affiliation, LMR controlling system
In this procedure, an explicit affiliation is used as the trigger for late
call entry signalling and the LMR system is the controlling system.
The signalling procedure is described in figure 6.4.5.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A group call is ongoing in the LMR system, and the LMR system is the
controlling system for the interworking group call.
2\. The MCPTT system is the participating system, and is not taking part in
the group call as there were no group members affiliated to the group at the
start of the call.
Figure 6.4.5.1.3-1:Late entry from LMR system with MCPTT system controlling
1\. An MCPTT client whose user is a group member affiliates to the
interworking group in the MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT server sends a group affiliation request for the interworking
group to the IWF.
3\. The IWF sends a group affiliation response for the interworking group to
the MCPTT server. It is assumed that the IWF or connected LMR system has
performed any necessary authorization checks prior to sending a positive
response.
4\. The MCPTT server sends a group affiliation response to the MCPTT client,
informing the MCPTT client of successful affiliation to the interworking
group.
5\. As there is an ongoing call, the IWF sends a group call late entry setup
request to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 1: The message may be the same as that which would be sent to set up a
group call in a non-late entry case
6\. The MCPTT server sends the group call request to the MCPTT client.
7\. The MCPTT server responds to the IWF with a successful call setup
response.
8\. The MCPTT client responds to the MCPTT server acknowledging the set up of
the group call.
NOTE 2: Step 7 may occur either before step 6, or as shown following step 6
and before step 8, or following step 8.
9\. The media plane is established between IWF, MCPTT server and MCPTT client.
Floor control signalling indicates the current talking party to the MCPTT
client.
#### 6.4.5.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MCPTT server must respond to affiliation to the group from the LMR system
with late entry call setup signalling, which may be the same as call setup
signalling in a non-late entry case.
#### 6.4.5.3 Solution evaluation
This solution allows late entry into ongoing interworking group calls.
### 6.4.6 Solution #3-6: Group call over linked group
#### 6.4.6.1 Description
When an LMR group is provided a new MCPTT group identity in IWF, the MCPTT
group identity is linked with the LMR group.
When the MCPTT group identity (M~G1~) is linked with the LMR group (L~G1~) and
is regrouped into a temporary group (M~TG1~) in the MCPTT system, the IWF is
notified about the temporary group information in MCPTT system, and the IWF
must recognise the MCPTT system as the controlling system for its linked
group. From the MCPTT system point of view, the M~G1~ is regarded as another
constituent group of the temporary group from another MCPTT system (i.e.,
IWF), while from the LMR system point of view, the MCPTT group (M~TG1~) is
regarded as the other linked group, which shall be called when a group call is
initiated to this linked LMR group.
If a group call initiated by an MCPTT user to this temporary group (M~TG1~),
or if a group call is initiated by an LMR user to the LMR group (L~G1~) and if
the LMR system supports the regroup, the temporary group call defined in MCPTT
is applied, and the MCPTT system is the controlling system.
For the group call initiated by an LMR user to the LMR group (L~G1~), if the
LMR system neither supports the regroup nor understands the M~TG1~, the
following procedure is applied:
Pre-conditions:
\- The LMR group L~G1~ is linked with a MCPTT group identity (M~G1~) in the
IWF, and regroup into a temporary group (M~TG1~);
\- M~TG1~ is specified to be called when a group call is initiated over L~G1~
according to the local policy at IWF.
\- MCPTT system owning the temporary group is the controlling system.
Figure 6.4.6.1-1 Temporary group call with linked group
1\. The IWF receives a group call request to LMR group L~G1~ linked with M~G1~
at IWF.
2\. The IWF will call the temporary group (M~TG1~), where M~G1~ (linked with
LMR group L~G1~)is the sub-group.
3\. The MCPTT server calls all the sub-groups as described in 3GPP TS 23.379
[11].
4a. The MCPTT server sends a group call request to the IWF to call the
constituent group of the temporary group.
4b. Upon receiving the regroup call request, IWF does not forward the request
to the LMR system, and directly provides the group call response indicating
success.
5\. MCPTT server then returns a group call response to the IWF about the
successful setup of the group call. IWF notifies the LMR user about the call
setup result.
6\. The media and floor control plane is established with the MCPTT system
being the controlling system. The subsequent floor control and media
distribution is as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
#### 6.4.6.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
There are no impacts on the existing nodes and functionality in the MCPTT
system.
#### 6.4.6.3 Solution evaluation
The solution reuses the existing temporary group call procedure to support
group regrouping in the MCPTT system where one of the groups is linked to a
group in the LMR system.
## 6.5 Media plane
### 6.5.1 Solution #4-1: Codec reconciliation
#### 6.5.1.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #4-1 Vocoder reconciliation.
During group call, the MCPTT server can initiate the codec reconciliation to
switch to a more suitable codec according to LMR participants behaviours, e.g,
when the first LMR user enters late or rejoins the group call, or the last
user leaves the group call.
The procedure of MCPTT server initiated codec reconciliation is described in
figure 6.5.1.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
  * An MCPTT group call is ongoing using an MCPTT specific codec or a group call is ongoing using an LMR codec.
Figure 6.5.1.1-1: Codec reconciliation procedure
0\. A interworking group call is ongoing. When the first LMR user enters late
or rejoins the group call, or the last user leaves the group call, MCPTT
server can initiate codec reconciliation to select a select an optimal codec.
1\. MCPTT server sends codec reconciliation request to all the participants to
renegotiate a new codec.
2\. The participants returns a codec reconciliation response.
3\. Then the participants use the new codec of the group call.
Editor's note: When to start using the new codec, e.g., after current
transmission, is FFS.
#### 6.5.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution requires the MCPTT server to initiate codec reconciliation
according to the LMR participants in the group call, e.g., late entry to the
call, rejoin and leave the call.
MCPTT codecs used when there are only MCPTT group members are needed to be
configured in the group configuration data.
#### 6.5.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides dynamic codec reconciliation to select an optimal codec
according to the current LMR participants in the group call.
This solution result in large amount of signalling at MCPTT server when
switching to the new codec. The voice continuity and quality may be impacted
based on when to apply the new codec.
### 6.5.2 Solution #4-2: Codec configuration
#### 6.5.2.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #4-1, vocoder reconciliation.
This solution addresses a scenario where the speech codec used by the LMR
system can be used by the MC service clients so that speech can be carried end
to end between all group members in both LMR and MCPTT system without
transcoding.
NOTE 1: TETRA only specified a single speech codec, but P25 may use two, a
full rate and a half rate version of the same underlying codec.
The solution is to configure one or more LMR codecs as preferred codecs for
the group.
NOTE 2: The Managed Object for MCPTT group configuration refers to \'codecs\'
whereas 3GPP TS 24.383 [19] refers to a single preferred codec. Text alignment
of 3GPP TS 24.383 [19] may be the only change needed.
#### 6.5.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MCPTT UEs need to support the LMR codec(s).
Group configuration data needs to support one or more LMR codecs.
The MCPTT server should ensure that an LMR codec is selected for the MCPTT
group call.
#### 6.5.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a means of restricting the codec used within an MCPTT
group call to that used in an LMR system, when LMR group members are expected
to join the group via the IWF, without using a transcoding solution.
The advantage is that there does not to need be any change of codec when LMR
members join or leave a group shared with MCPTT users. The disadvantage is
that use of the LMR codec will result in lower speech quality for MCPTT users
when there are no LMR group members taking part in MCPTT group calls.
The solution permits end to end encryption using LMR mechanisms to be used
within the MCPTT group.
### 6.5.3 Solution #4-3: Codec negotiation by LMR system
#### 6.5.3.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #4-1, vocoder reconciliation.
An MCPTT group may be configured to use an LMR speech codec, such that speech
can be carried end to end between all group members in both LMR and MCPTT
system without transcoding.
An LMR system may support more than one speech codec; for example P25 supports
both a full rate and a half rate speech codec. Circumstances within the LMR
system may require that the codec in use within a group is changed according
to the needs of the LMR system.
Figure 6.5.3.1-1 below illustrates a procedure which allows the LMR system to
change the speech codec within an MCPTT group that is connected to the LMR
system via the IWF.
Pre-conditions:
\- Group members have affiliated to the MCPTT group in both the LMR system and
in the MCPTT system
\- A permitted LMR codec has been negotiated for use by MCPTT group members
\- MCPTT group members support the requested second LMR speech codec
NOTE: The exception condition created if the MCPTT client does not support the
requested LMR codec is outside the scope of this solution.
\- The LMR system requires to change to an alternative speech codec
Figure 6.5.3.1-1: Codec reconciliation procedure
1\. The IWF sends a codec reconciliation request to the MCPTT server on behalf
of the LMR system.
2\. The MCPTT server checks that the requested codec is permitted for the
MCPTT group.
3\. The MCPTT server sends a codec reconciliation response to the IWF.
4\. The MCPTT server sends a codec reconciliation request to the MCPTT
client(s) to negotiate the use of the speech codec requested by the LMR
system.
5\. The MCPTT client replies with a codec reconciliation response to the MCPTT
server, indicating acceptance of the new speech codec.
6\. Further transmissions in the MCPTT group use the new codec in the media
plane.
The time at which the new codec is first used by a transmitting party is
outside the scope of this procedure. A possible solution is to use the codec
at the start of the next transmission in the MCPTT group.
Editor\'s note: The study may require involvement of other standardisation
groups, e.g. SA4.
#### 6.5.3.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution requires the MCPTT server and MCPTT clients to support the
relevant LMR speech codecs and to accept a negotiation for a different speech
codec initiated by the LMR system.
#### 6.5.3.3 Solution evaluation
This solution allows the selection of codec within an MCPTT group to be
negotiated according to the needs of the LMR system.
To enable the solution, the set of LMR codecs needs to be supported by all
group members, and this has implications for configuration and management of
exception conditions when the configuration or capabilities of all group
members do not support all of the required LMR codecs.
An alternative solution would be a transcoding solution, where the change of
LMR codec is hidden from the MCPTT system. The impact of transcoding compared
with use of the LMR codec would need further investigation,
The solution will support end to end encryption between all group members
using LMR encryption mechanisms that are applicable to the set of LMR speech
codecs.
### 6.5.4 Solution #4-4: Floor override with unstoppable audio
#### 6.5.4.1 Description
Unstoppable audio may be unique to legacy LMR systems, but the issue of how to
deal with multiple audio streams during a call is not. MCPTT has similar
requirements concerning routing of overridden audio in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2]. The
solution proposed is based on the solution defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11],
subclause 10.9.1.3.2.2, Floor override without using floor revoked during an
MCPTT session.
#### 6.5.4.2 Floor override with unstoppable audio on an interworking group
Figure 6.5.4.2‑1 shows the high-level procedure where an MCPTT session is
already established between the floor participants (with floor granted to an
LMR user represented by the IWF) and the floor control server (with an
override based on priority and configured to permit the transmission of
overridden floor participant from the IWF). The group is defined in the MCPTT
system and the MCPTT Server is the floor control server. Only two UEs involved
in the session are shown for simplicity.
Pre-conditions
\- The MCPTT floor control server has been configured to support override.
\- The override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor
participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.
\- An MCPTT session is established between an MCPTT client, the interworked
system, and controlling server.
\- Session is ongoing.
Figure 6.5.4.2‑1: Floor override (overridden continues to transmit) during an
interworking session
1\. It is assumed that the floor participant B (represented by the IWF in the
figure) has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.
2\. Floor participant A having a floor priority which is relatively higher
than that of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor
priority information that is received in the floor request message.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor
participants (via the IWF). Floor participant B continues transmitting the
(overridden) voice media transmission.
NOTE 1: All other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group
call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn
who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.
6a. The floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.
6b. The user of floor participant B is notified of the status that the floor
is now taken by floor participant A. In this case floor participant B is
unable to receive the message and continues transmitting (unstoppable audio).
7\. Floor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the
session established beforehand.
NOTE 2: Floor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of
floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both
transmissions is based on configuration.
NOTE 3: When floor participant A stop transmitting, if floor participant B is
still sending voice, then the floor is granted back to floor participant B and
audio is routed to all current floor particpants.
#### 6.5.4.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
In MCPTT, a new user profile item may be needed to identify users who are
authorized to receive overriding, overridden, or both transmissions. An
affiliation option may be needed so an authorized user can specify reception
of the losing audio in addition to, or instead of, the winning audio.
#### 6.5.4.4 Solution evaluation
The solution proposes a new procedure to support the detection and propagation
of the \"unstoppable audio\" condition and allows distributing this audio to
authorized group members within the MCPTT system. This prevents important
transmissions from being lost. This solution reuses the existing floor
override without using floor revoked procedure defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11].
## 6.6 Encryption
### 6.6.1 Solution #5-1: Means for supporting TETRA and P25 end-to-end
encrypted speech
#### 6.6.1.1 Description
##### 6.6.1.1.1 General
The following sub-clauses address the gaps in key issue #5-1 of the present
document. Solutions for the 3 gaps are presented.
##### 6.6.1.1.2 Gap 1 - means for transmitting the P25 or TETRA encryption
synchronization vector, including the Key ID and the Algorithm ID within the
MCPTT system
The TETRA end-to-end encryption synchronization vector will be carried in
MCPTT as an optional parameter in an RTP packet that may also carry one or
more TETRA speech frames. The TETRA end-to-end encryption synchronization
vector contains the Key ID, the Algorithm ID and the cipher synchronization
information. (The Key ID identifies the encryption key used to encrypt the
speech and the Algorithm ID identifies the end‑to‑end encryption algorithm in
use.)
The P25 end-to-end encryption synchronization vector will be carried in MCPTT
as an optional parameter in an RTP packet that may also carry one or more P25
speech frames. The P25 end-to-end encryption synchronization vector contains
the Key ID, the Algorithm ID and the cipher synchronization information. (The
Key ID identifies the encryption key used to encrypt the speech and the
Algorithm ID identifies the end‑to‑end encryption algorithm in use.)
##### 6.6.1.1.3 Gap 2 - Means for ensuring the time synchronization between
the sync vector and the stream of encrypted speech packets in a P25 or TETRA
to MCPTT interworked system.
Receivers of end-to-end encrypted TETRA or P25 speech have to be able to apply
an encryption synchronization vector to a specific speech frame which could be
delivered at a later time than the encryption synchronization vector.
TETRA/P25 speech frames and TETRA/P25 end-to-end synchronization vectors will
be delivered to TETRA/P25 speech receivers in the same order as they were
transmitted to allow the receivers to maintain synchronization with the
encrypted speech. RTP sequence numbering and/or speech frame numbering in the
RTP payload can be used to maintain the ordering. The integrity of the RTP
sequence numbering needs to be maintained throughout the MCPTT network.
##### 6.6.1.1.4 Gap 3 - support for the TETRA vocoder in MCPTT to allow
end‑to‑end security
ETSI TCCE will provide an ETSI standard specifying the format of TETRA speech
(including encryption synchronization vectors) to be carried in RTP packets
over MCPTT. ETSI TCCE will obtain IANA registration for the format and the
name to be used in MCPTT call setup SDP negotiations. ETSI TCCE will specify
any speech format transformations, timing and encryption synchronization
actions to be performed by the IWF or TETRA SwMI.
##### 6.6.1.1.5 Gap 4 - Support for the P25 vocoders in MCPTT to allow end-to-
end security.
The standard for specifying the format of P25 speech (including encryption
synchronization vectors) to be carried in RTP packets over MCPTT will be
obtained. IANA registration for the format and the name to be used in MCPTT
call setup SDP negotiations will be obtained, but this is outside the scope of
3GPP. Any speech format transformations, timing and encryption synchronization
actions to be performed by the IWF or P25 RF Subsystem will be coordinated
with TIA through ATIS.
#### 6.6.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MCPTT UEs configured to support end‑to‑end encrypted speech communications
with TETRA or P25 equipment shall support:
\- SDP negotiation for the use of the TETRA or P25 speech format;
\- use of the TETRA or P25 speech transport format for MCPTT;
\- use of the TETRA ACELP vocoder, or use of the P25 Phase 1 or Phase 2
vocoder;
\- use of the TETRA or P25 end-to-end encryption mechanism;
\- use of a key management protocol that allows delivery of TETRA or P25
end‑to‑end encryption keys
\- use of appropriate encryption algorithms.
The IWF will need to be able to perform any necessary transformations of the
speech format timing and encryption synchronization actions to be specified by
ETSI TCCE or TIA through ATIS.
#### 6.6.1.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution provides a method for transporting TETRA end‑to end encrypted
speech between MCPTT clients and the TETRA IWF. This solution also provides a
method for transporting P25 end-to-end encrypted speech between MCPTT clients
and a P25 RF Subsystem.
## 6.7 Group management
### 6.7.1 Solution #6-1: Group regroup
#### 6.7.1.1 Description
##### 6.7.1.1.1 General
The following subclauses address the gaps in key issue #6-1 of the present
document.
##### 6.7.1.1.2 Gap 1 -- interworking LMR group regrouping with MC service
The procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [17] are followed, but with the replacement
of step 4 and the addition of step 5a. The IWF will behave on the interface as
if it is a peer MC service server with a peer group management client and peer
group management server.
Exceptions to the 3GPP TS 23.280 [17] procedures are detailed in the
subclauses below.
The impact from this gap solution will be a new reference point between the
IWF and the group management server.
###### 6.7.1.1.2.1 MC service initiates the group regroup
The procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [17] are followed, but with the replacement
of step 4 and the addition of step 5a. The IWF will behave on the interface as
if it is a peer MC service server and a peer group management server. This is
described in figure 6.7.1.1.2.1-1.
Figure 6.7.1.1.2.1-1: Temporary group formation - group regrouping to an IWF
1\. The group management client of the MC service user (e.g. dispatcher)
requests group regroup operation to the group management server (which is the
group management server of the authorised MC service user). The identities of
the groups being combined shall be included in this message. The group
management client may indicate the security level required for the temporary
group. The group management client may indicate the priority level required
for the temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorised MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server checks whether the group is a temporary group. If the group
is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise
the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server forwards the group regroup request to the IWF
with the information about the IWF\'s groups.
4\. The IWF may check whether any constituent MC service groups are in
emergency, have calls ongoing or are already part of an MC service group
regroup. The IWF sends a check group status to the MC service server.
5\. The MC service server responds with the status of the group regroup\'s
constituent MC service groups. For LMR systems that do not support group
regrouping, the IWF may return failure.
6\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, off-network
information, and the MC service IDs of the groups being combined, the priority
level of the temporary group, and the security level of the temporary group.
If the authorised MC service user does not specify the security level and the
priority level, the group management server shall set the lower security level
and the higher priority of the constituent groups.
7\. The group management server 1 notifies the IWF about its group regroup
operation.
8\. The IWF acknowledges the group management server.
9\. The group management server notifies the MC service server of the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups.
10\. The MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server.
11\. The group management server notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server,
possibly with an indication of lower security level.
12\. The group management server provides a group regroup response to the
group management client of the authorised MC service user (e.g. dispatcher).
###### 6.7.1.1.2.2 IWF initiates the group regroup
The procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [17] are followed, but with the replacement
of steps 1 and 2. The IWF will behave on the interface as if it is a peer MC
service server with a peer group management server. This is described in
figure 6.7.1.1.2.2-1.
Figure 6.7.1.1.2.2-1: Temporary group formation - group regrouping from an IWF
1\. The IWF may check whether any constituent MC service groups are in
emergency, have calls ongoing or are already part of an MC service group
regroup by sending a check group status request to the MC service server.
2\. The MC service server responds with the status of the MC service groups.
NOTE: Steps 3-10 are as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [17]. Steps internal to
the IWF are out of scope and are not shown.
3\. The IWF sends a group regroup request to the group management server.
4\. The group management server checks whether the group is a temporary group.
If the group is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected,
otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
5\. The group management server provides a group regroup response. Due to
security aspects concerning sharing information among different systems, the
group management server does not share the users\' information of the groups
under its management to the IWF.
6\. The IWF notifies the group management server regarding the temporary group
creation with information of the constituent groups.
7\. The IWF acknowledges the notification from the group management server.
8\. The group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups.
9\. The MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server.
10\. The group management server notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server,
possibly with an indication of a lower security level.
##### 6.7.1.1.3 Gap 2 -- ownership of the group regroup
This solution proposes that the server that initiates the group regroup owns
the group regroup, as implied in 3GPP TS 23.280 [17].
##### 6.7.1.1.4 Gap 3 - simultaneous group regroup requests from each side of
the IWF-1 interface
Some LMR implementations do not allow a group that is already in a group
regroup to be group regrouped again, i.e. both sides of the IWF interface try
to group regroup the same group. The following cases are examined:
\- Case 1: MC service group regroup, LMR group. When the group management
server sends a group regroup request to the IWF and the LMR group is already
in an:
\- LMR group regroup. The IWF decides whether to remove the LMR group from the
existing LMR group regroup or to reject the request. In the case of the
latter, the IWF informs the group management server, which informs the group
management client which informs the authorised MC service user of the LMR
group(s) that cannot be group regrouped.
\- MC service group regroup. The IWF determines that the group is already in a
group regroup on the MC system via the check group status request and
response. The IWF decides whether to reject the request. To reject the
request, the IWF informs the group management server, which informs the group
management client which informs the authorised MC service user of the LMR
group(s) that cannot be group regrouped.
\- Case 2: LMR group regroup, MC service group. When the IWF sets up the group
regroup it can decide whether to omit the MC service group that\'s in another
MC service group regroup, from the new LMR group regroup. The IWF cannot
remove the MC service group from an existing MC service group regroup.
\- Case 3: LMR group regroup, LMR group. This case is out of scope of the
present document.
\- Case 4: MC service group regroup, MC service group. The MC service system
has control over its own groups in its own group regroups. There\'s no impact
to the LMR system if MC service groups are group regrouped multiple times.
The impact from this gap will be some result codes to inform the authorised
user via the group regroup notification response that one or more LMR groups
cannot be group regrouped and an information flow element listing those LMR
groups.
##### 6.7.1.1.5 Gap 4 -- Group regroup with MC service clients and LMR clients
###### 6.7.1.1.5.1 General
The subclauses below address expected issues with group regroups containing MC
service clients and LMR clients.
###### 6.7.1.1.5.2 Announcement group part of group regroup
Some LMR systems allow announcement groups (similar to an MC group broadcast
group) to be part of a group regroup, others do not.
The case to consider is when the MC service server sets up a group regroup
that includes an LMR announcement group. When the MC service server sends a
group regroup request to the IWF, the IWF checks whether any constituent
groups in the request are announcement groups that the LMR system owns. If the
LMR system does not support announcement groups as part of group regroups,
then the IWF indicates the groups that cannot be supported in the group
regroup notification response. The group management server sends the response
back to the originating authorised MC service user via the group management
client. The authorised MC service user can retry the group regroup without the
unsupported constituent group(s).
The impact from this gap will be new result codes to inform the authorised
user via the group regroup notification response that one or more LMR groups
are announcement groups and cannot be group regrouped. In addition, an
information flow element listing those LMR groups is needed.
###### 6.7.1.1.5.3 Emergency on constituent group
Some LMR systems allow a constituent group to be in the emergency state,
others do not. The following cases are examined:
\- Case 1: MC service group regroup, emergency on LMR group, LMR does not
support emergencies on group regroups. The group management server initiates a
group regroup and a constituent group that is owned by the LMR system is in
emergency. When the IWF receives the group regroup request that contains an
LMR system owned constituent group that is in emergency, and the IWF does not
wish to support a group regroup with this group in emergency, the IWF
indicates that in the group regroup response. The response contains the
group(s) that it does not wish to support and a result code indicating why.
The MC service authorised user creating the group regroup is notified via the
group management client.
\- Case 2: MC service group regroup, emergency on LMR group, LMR supports
emergencies on group regroups. For LMR systems that support emergencies on
constituent groups, the IWF informs the MC service server of the emergency on
the group regrouped group, and includes the identity of the constituent group
that\'s in emergency. When the emergency is cancelled, the IWF informs the MC
service server and includes the identity of the constituent group that\'s no
longer in emergency.
\- Case 3: LMR group regroup, emergency on MC service group, LMR does not
support emergencies on group regroups. The IWF initiates a regroup and a
constituent group that is owned by the MC system is in emergency. The IWF
checks whether any constituent MC service groups are in emergency using the
check group status request and response and decides whether to include them in
the group regroup.
\- Case 4: LMR group regroup, emergency on MC service group, LMR supports
emergencies on group regroups. The IWF initiates a group regroup and a
constituent group that is owned by the MC system is in emergency. The IWF
checks whether any constituent MC service groups are in emergency using the
check group status request and response. The IWF can decide how to treat the
group regroup, given that at least one constituent MC service group is in
emergency.
The impact from this gap will be new message flows and procedures to request,
cancel and track emergencies on a partner system\'s group regrouped group,
changes to the group regroup response information flow and new messages to
check on the operational status of an MC service group.
###### 6.7.1.1.5.4 Activity on constituent group
Some LMR implementations do not allow a group with a call in progress to be
added to a group regroup. The following cases are examined:
\- Case 1: MC service group regroup, LMR group activity. This solution
proposes a \'group has call in progress\' result code for a group regroup
request. The MC service user that\'s requesting the group regroup can elect to
omit the LMR group from the group regroup or can wait and try again.
\- Case 2: LMR group regroup, MC service group activity. The IWF can check
whether a constituent MC service group has call activity by using the check
group status request and response. The IWF can omit the MC service group from
the group regroup.
The impact from this gap will be changes to the group regroup response
information flow and new messages to check on the operational status of an MC
service group.
##### 6.7.1.1.6 Gap 5 - Resolution of vocoder and encryption mode for the
group regroup
Editor\'s note: This subclause can be completed when vocoder and encryption
modes procedures are defined for interconnect scenarios and when the
encryption key issues in the present document are solved. It is expected that
the solution will refer to and leverage those solutions.
#### 6.7.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The solution requires:
\- a new reference point between the LMR system and the group management
server;
\- changes to some MC service group regroup procedures and information flows;
\- new message flows and procedures to request, cancel and track emergencies
on a partner system\'s group regrouped group; and
\- new messages to check on the operational status of an MC service group.
#### 6.7.1.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution addresses four of the five regroup key issue gaps: general
regroup interworking, ownership of regroups spanning IWF-1, simultaneous
regroups and issues with mixed system regroups. A new reference point and some
new MC service messages are required.
This solution does not apply if the LMR system does not support group regroup
procedure over the interworking reference point.
### 6.7.2 Solution #6-2: Group regroup between MCPTT and LMR system in MCPTT
system
#### 6.7.2.1 Description
Group regroup for interworking between MCPTT and LMR system is to create an
temporary interworking group in MCPTT system including constituent MCPTT
groups, LMR groups.
The signalling procedure of interworking group creation is described in figure
6.7.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client is registered and its respective user - MCPTT user is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service and regroup groups.
2\. The constituent groups to be regrouped are pre-configured at MCPTT client.
3\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at IWF. For all the signalling that passes
through the IWF between MCPTT system and LMR system, the IWF shall perform the
identity conversion and protocol translation.
Figure 6.7.2.1-1: Group regroup between MCPTT and LMR system in MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user at group management client initiates group regroup by sending
group regroup request to group management server. The identities of
constituent groups are included.
2\. The group management server checks if the MCPTT user is authorised to
perform group regroup operation. If success, the group management server
creates and stores the information of the temporary group, including the
temporary group ID, the group ID of the groups being combined, the priority
level of the temporary group and the security level of the temporary group. If
the authorised user does not specify the security level and the priority
level, the group management server shall set the lowest security level and the
highest priority of the constituent groups.The users of the temporary group
may be automatically affiliated if configured.
3\. Group management server sends the group regroup request to the IWF.
4\. IWF performs the authorization check with LMR system that whether the LMR
group can be regrouped.
5\. IWF returns the group regroup response to group management server.
6\. Group management server creates the temporary interworking group and
stores the group information.
7\. The group management server notifies the MCPTT server regarding the group
regroup with the information of the temporary group.
8\. The group management server notifies the IWF regarding the group creation
regroup with the information of the temporary group.
9\. After receiving the group regroup notify message, the IWF performs the
identity mapping and notifies the LMR system about the temporary interworking
group.
10\. The group management server notifies the MCPTT group members about the
temporary interworking group.
11\. The group management server returns a group regroup response to the group
management client of the authorised user.
NOTE: How the IWF interacts with LMR system is outside the scope of the
present document.
#### 6.7.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures are needed between the group management server and IWF.
#### 6.7.2.3 Solution evaluation
The solution proposes a new procedure to support the user regroup for
interworking. This solution reuses the existing group creation procedure
defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11] at the utmost.This solution does not apply if
the LMR system does not support user regroup procedure over the interworking
reference point.
### 6.7.3 Solution #6-3: Group creation between MCPTT and LMR system
#### 6.7.3.1 Description
Group creation for interworking between MCPTT and LMR system is to create an
interworking group in MCPTT system including both MCPTT users and LMR users.
The signalling procedure of interworking group creation is described in figure
6.7.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client is registered and its respective user - MCPTT user is
authenticated and authorised to use the MCPTT service and create an
interworking group.
2\. The LMR users information to be included in the newly created group is
pre-configured at MCPTT client.
3\. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between MCPTT system
and LMR system has been configured at IWF. For all the signalling that passes
through the IWF between MCPTT system and LMR system, the IWF shall perform the
identity conversion and protocol translation.
Figure 6.7.3.1-1: Group creation between MCPTT and LMR system
1\. MCPTT user at group management client initiates interworking group
creation by sending group creation request to group management server. Both
the MCPTT users and the LMR users are included.
2\. Group management server performs authorization check.
3\. Group management server sends the group creation request to the IWF.
4\. IWF performs the authorization check with LMR system that whether the LMR
users can be included.
5\. IWF returns the group creation response to group management server.
6\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
interworking group as group configuration data as described in 3GPP TS 23.280
[17]. The users of the temporary group may be automatically affiliated if
configured.
7\. The group management server notifies the MCPTT server regarding the group
creation with the information of the group members.
8\. The group management server notifies the IWF regarding the group creation
with the information of the group members.
9\. After receiving the group creation notify message, the IWF performs the
group identity and user identity mapping between MCPTT system and LMR system,
and notifies the LMR system the group creation
10\. The group management server notifies the MCPTT users.
11\. The group management server returns a group creation response to the
group management client of the authorised user.
NOTE: How IWF interacts with LMR system is outside the scope of the present
document.
#### 6.7.3.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New procedures are needed between the group management server and IWF.
#### 6.7.3.3 Solution evaluation
The solution proposes a new procedure to support the user regroup for
interworking. This solution reuses the existing group creation procedure
defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11] at the utmost.
This solution does not apply if the LMR system does not support user regroup
procedure over the interworking reference point.
### 6.7.4 Solution #6-4: Local group regrouping within each system
#### 6.7.4.1 Regrouping solution description
To prevent routing issues and complexity, the following rules can be applied:
\- If group regrouping signalling using temporary groups is used on the MC
system, the IWF must prevent the regroup signalling from propagating to the
LMR system;
\- the IWF must handle the translation between temporary group identities on
the MC system and the original interworking group identity used on the LMR
system; and
\- regrouping can only take place within a system if
\- the re-grouped groups are not interworking groups;
\- the system in which the regouping is performed is the controlling system
for those interworking groups involved in the re-grouping; or
\- the system in which the regrouping is performed in a participating system
and only one of the groups included in the re-grouping is an interworking
group, and floor control for the set of regrouped groups in the participating
system is deferred to the controlling system via the IWF.
#### 6.7.4.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
If group regrouping is permitted on the MCPTT system, there is no impact on
the MCPTT server with respect to group regrouping signalling sent between
systems, as the IWF will isolate the LMR system from the regroup signalling.
Group configuration within the group management server should identify
interworking groups, and provide restrictions on the ability to perform group
regrouping for interworking groups.
The MCPTT server will need to allow the configuration of groups that are
interworking groups and for which regrouping is not permitted, and to prevent
regrouping in those groups.
#### 6.7.4.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a means of allowing group regrouping within a system
and still providing communication between systems, subject to limitations.
## 6.8 Prioritization and pre-emption
### 6.8.1 Solution #7-1: Emergency calls
#### 6.8.1.1 General
This subclause addresses the following gaps from key issue #7-1: Emergency
calls: 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
#### 6.8.1.2 Description
##### 6.8.1.2.1 Emergency call procedure
Figure 6.8.1.2.1-1 shows the procedure for an emergency call initiated by a
user in the LMR system. The figure is based upon the figure for emergency
calls in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11], subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1. This scenario assumes
that the LMR group is mapped at the IWF to an interworking group defined in
the MCPTT system. Key issue #7-1, gap 3 is addressed in the scenario.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating LMR user is a member of an LMR group that corresponds to an
interworking group defined in the MCPTT system.
Figure 6.8.1.2.1-1: Emergency group call
1\. An LMR user initiates an emergency group call. The IWF maps the LMR group
to an MCPTT group.
2\. The IWF sends an MCPTT emergency group call request including a MCPTT
group ID to the MCPTT server hosting the MCPTT group. The request contains an
indication of the MCPTT emergency. The MCPTT server records the MCPTT identity
of the LMR user that initiated the MCPTT emergency group call until the MCPTT
emergency is cancelled. Once an MCPTT emergency call has been initiated, the
MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until
cancelled. The IWF may indicate in its request that an MCPTT emergency alert
is to be sent when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT ID of the LMR user to the
MCPTT emergency group if the user is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT ID of the LMR user authorized for
initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and if
authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
MCPTT participants in the MCPTT group. IWF actions for priority are out of
scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: Successive calls during the MCPTT group\'s in-progress emergency state
will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an
indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming MCPTT group call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency group call request. For
a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT ID of the LMR user via the IWF to inform of the successful MCPTT
emergency call establishment.
NOTE 3: How the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is outside
the scope of the present document.
NOTE 4: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 12
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
10\. The LMR user via the IWF, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have
successfully established media plane for communication.
##### 6.8.1.2.2 Emergency cancel
The emergency cancel process follows the \"MCPTT emergency group call cancel\"
procedure define in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11] with exceptions described here:
\- Emergency cancel notifications are sent to group members on the LMR system
via the IWF.
\- For LMR implementations that cancel emergencies automatically, the IWF
implementations shall, based upon local policy, either convert automatic
cancellations so that they behave as if the cancellation comes from an
authorized (LMR) user or block automatic cancellations from reaching IWF-1
entirely. This item addresses key issue #7-1, gap 1b.
\- In the case of an interworking group, where the group might not have all
LMR group members in its configuration, each LMR user that is expected to
interact with the MCPTT system must be given a corresponding MCPTT user ID in
the MCPTT system, as described in solution #1-1. This enables the MCPTT system
to identify the user and authorize the user\'s actions (such as emergency
cancel) against the user\'s profile. This item addresses key issue #7-1, gap
4.
##### 6.8.1.2.3 Imminent peril calls
For LMR systems that do not support imminent peril, imminent peril calls may
be propagated into the LMR system by the IWF as normal group calls or the IWF
may reject imminent peril calls.
##### 6.8.1.2.4 Losing audio
For LMR systems where a user cannot be pre-empted, the IWF identifies the
audio as losing audio to the system. Solution #4-4 in sub-clause 6.5.4 applies
to key issue #7-1, gap 1a.
##### 6.8.1.2.5 Default emergency group
In MCPTT, the user\'s profile determines whether an emergency is raised on the
user\'s currently selected group or on a configured default emergency group.
It\'s up to the IWF and the legacy system to which it is connected to
determine what group the emergency is raised on and whether an alert is also
sent when the emergency is raised. All emergency behavior by the IWF on behalf
of its users mapped to MCPTT shall comply with behaviors defined in 3GPP TS
23.379 [11]. The implementation shall ensure that emergency related parameters
of a group or private call are adhered to. For example, an MC service group
must be configured in the MC sevice group managment system for emergency
alerts in order for an emergency alert to be sent on it. This can be enforced
through proper configuration of both LMR and MCPTT systems or can be enforced
at run time by the IWF. If a system is configured to raise emergencies on a
default emergency group, consideration must be given to configure this default
emergency group for interworking so that LMR users can participate in
emergencies. This item addresses key issue #7-1, gap 2.
##### 6.8.1.2.6 Emergency private call
An emergency private call to an LMR user will have emergency priority for the
portion of the call transported in the MCPTT system and the LTE EPS but will
not receive priority on the LMR system in systems that do not support
emergency private calls. This item addresses key issue #7-1, gap 5.
##### 6.8.1.2.7 LMR systems that do not track group emergencies
The MCPTT system tracks the emergency state of every group. In interworked LMR
systems that do not track the emergency state of groups, only a UE in
emergency state will be given emergency priority on the LMR system when
talking. For any user talking on an emergency group, the portion of the call
transported by the MCPTT system will receive emergency priority. This item
addresses key issue #7-1, gap 6.
#### 6.8.1.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MCPTT emergency call request and response messaging and media plane may
need modification so that each message and media packet is sent only once to
the IWF and not for every affiliated LMR group member behind the IWF.
#### 6.8.1.4 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a means of originating and receiving emergency group
calls to and from LMR users via the IWF.
### 6.8.2 Solution #7-2: Emergency alerts
#### 6.8.2.1 Description
In this procedure, an LMR user is initiating an emergency alert via the IWF.
Figure 6.8.2.1-1 shows the procedure for an emergency alert initiated by a
user in the LMR system. The figure is based upon the figure for MCPTT
emergency alerts in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11], subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group is previously defined on the group management server
with MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 affiliated to that MC service
group.
2\. The IWF may or may not have carried out an explicit affiliation procedure
with the MC service group.
Figure 6.8.2.1-1 MC service emergency alert
1\. The IWF initiates an MC service emergency alert on behalf of an LMR user.
2\. IWF requests the MC service server to send an MC service emergency alert
request to the designated MC service group.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user ID that represents
the LMR user is authorized for initiation of MC service emergency alerts for
the indicated MC service group.
4\. MC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the
members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
5\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert response to the
IWF to confirm the MC service emergency alert request. MC service group calls
made to this MC service group by the IWF will be sent as emergency calls until
the IWF determines that the LMR user no longer has an emergency condition. How
the IWF determines the emergency condition is out of scope of the present
document.
6\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request towards
the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members.
The MC service emergency alert request message shall contain the following
information: Location, MC service ID and MC service group ID (i.e., MC service
user\'s selected MC service group or dedicated MC service emergency group, as
per MC service group configuration) and the MC service user\'s mission
critical organization name.
NOTE 2: If the location of the LMR user is not available to the IWF, the alert
in step two shall contain an indication that location is not available. This
note addresses key issue #7-2, gap 1.
7\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency.
8\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert.
9\. The MC service server implicitly affiliates the client to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the ongoing emergency condition.
NOTE 4: Sending the emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
#### 6.8.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service emergency alert request and response messaging may need
modification so that each message is sent only once to the IWF and not one for
every affiliated LMR group member behind the IWF.
#### 6.8.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a means of originating and receiving emergency alerts
to and from LMR users via the IWF. Key #7-2, gaps 3, 4 and 5 are solved by
solution #7-1. Key issue #7-2, gap 2 refers to a stage 1 requirement that is
not addressed by stage 2. The gap is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.9 Floor control
### 6.9.1 Solution #8-1: Time-stamping of floor requests during transmission
#### 6.9.1.1 Description
##### 6.9.1.1.1 General
The following sub-clauses provide a solution to key issue #8-3 of the present
document.
A solution to ensuring that the floor grant procedure works fairly when
transmission requests are queueable is to introduce a configurable option of
including a time-stamp in the floor request messages for MC systems where
interworking is a possibility. The time-stamp is used once the call is in
progress. The solution is targeted at the operation of groups which feature
interworked devices.
The following subclauses describe the behaviour at the affected nodes.
##### 6.9.1.1.2 Behaviour at the MC service client
If the MC UE supports this feature and is configured to use it then the MC
service client adds a time-stamp to its floor request messages. The source of
the time-stamp is not specified. It shall be possible to compare the time-
stamp supplied by the MC service client with that used in the rest of the MC
service.
##### 6.9.1.1.3 Behaviour at the IWF
In the case that the MC service server is the controlling server, when an LMR
device requests the floor, the IWF will receive an floor request from the
interworked system. An IWF supporting the feature will ensure that the floor
request message that it sends towards the MC service server contains a time-
stamp. The source of the time-stamp is not specified, but if the IWF requires
a timing source itself then there are many accurate sources available -- e.g.
using NTP as defined in IETF RFC 5905 [21], or using PTP as defined in IEEE
1588‑2008 [22].
Depending on configuration of the IWF and capabilities of the interworked
system, the time-stamp to be used may be either obtained via interworking or
inserted by the IWF.
If the LMR system provides the controlling server and has the ability to
interpret a time-stamp the IWF will send a suitably formatted floor request
towards that system when it receives a floor request from the MC system.
##### 6.9.1.1.4 Behaviour at the floor control server
A floor control server supporting the feature will receive floor requests in
the usual way. If priority and transmit queuing is supported then the floor
control server will need to receive the incoming floor requests and then
arbitrate and respond in a timely manner. The availability of a time-stamp
will enable the floor control server to sort incoming floor requests in order
of transmission, which would not otherwise be possible.
If queuing is supported then the floor control server will be able to order
the time of floor requests by using the available time-stamp and notify any
queued requesters in the correct order.
##### 6.9.1.1.5 Floor request and floor grant procedure with time-stamping
The procedure and flows for carrying out floor request, arbitration and grant
remains essentially the same as currently described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [11],
except for handling the addition of the time-stamp as a parameter within the
floor requests and floor arbitration. In the example given in figure
6.9.1.1.5‑1 an LMR device (not shown) and a MCPTT UE request the floor within
close proximity in time to each other, the LMR device slightly earlier than
the MCPTT UE. Queuing is supported. Figure 6.9.1.1.5‑2 illustrates the case
when the LMR system provides the controlling server.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client, interworked system and
controlling server.
2\. Session is ongoing.
Figure 6.9.1.1.5-1: Procedure flows for floor grant in interworking when time-
stamp is included (MCPTT controlling server)
Process:
1\. Media transmission is ongoing.
2\. The MCPTT client wishes to send voice media over the session.
3\. MCPTT client sends a floor request message to its floor control server
containing time-stamp information.
4\. The IWF sends a floor request message containing time-stamp information to
the floor control server representing the time that the LMR device made its
floor request.
5\. The floor control server makes a determination of action to take on the
request based on criteria (e.g. floor priority, time of sending).
6\. The floor control server sends queue position info to the floor
participants.
7\. The floor becomes idle.
8\. The floor control server responds with a floor granted message towards the
IWF.
9\. The floor control server sends a floor taken message towards the MCPTT
client including information about who is granted the floor.
10\. The receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the user of the
MCPTT client.
In the case that the LMR system provides the controlling server then the pre-
conditions remain the same and the information flow is as follows:
Figure 6.9.1.1.5-2: Procedure flows for floor grant in interworking when time-
stamp is included (LMR system controlling server)
Process:
1\. Media transmission is ongoing
2\. The MCPTT client wishes to send voice media over the session.
3\. MCPTT client sends a floor request message to its floor control server
containing time-stamp information and in turn the floor control server sends a
corresponding floor request message towards the IWF.
4\. As a result of decisions in the controlling system the IWF sends queue
position info to the MCPTT floor control server and in turn the floor control
server sends queue position info to the MCPTT client.
5\. The floor becomes idle.
6\. The IWF sends a floor taken message towards the MCPTT server including
information about who is granted the floor and in turn the MCPTT floor control
server send floor taken to the MCPTT client.
7\. The receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the user of the MCPTT
client.
#### 6.9.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
An MC service client making use of this option shall be required to include an
accurate time-stamp into its floor request messages.
A floor control server supporting the feature shall be able to make priority,
floor grant arbitration and queue position allocation making use of time-stamp
information received in the floor request message.
An IWF supporting the feature shall be suitably configurable to be able to
include time-stamp information in floor request messages that it sends to a
controlling floor control server.
#### 6.9.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a mechanism to resolve any latency bias between
interworked systems and apply floor control fairly. The overall performance in
a combined system supporting the solution will depend on the accuracy level
with which the time-stamps are applied across the interworked systems.
In the case when the LMR system provides the controlling server, the solution
is only applicable if the LMR system supports use of time-stamping
information.
### 6.9.2 Solution #8-2: Group controlling system
#### 6.9.2.1 Description
This solution applies to both key issue #8-1 and #8-2.
The general approach of group control system, as described in subclause 6.3.2
for key issue #2-2, can be used to resolve and arbitrate floor control
requests between MCPTT and LMR systems. The controlling system of the group
communication manages the floor control requests from group members between
two systems, and determines the action, e.g. receiving, granting, denying
request, and revoking floor.
##### 6.9.2.1.1 Floor request arbitration in the MCPTT system as the control
system
In this procedure, the MCPTT system is the controlling system and its floor
controlling server arbitrates the floor requests from both MCPTT and LMR
systems and grant one participant.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A group communication with members consisting of MCPTT and LMR systems is
established and is in progress.
2\. The MCPTT system is the controlling system for the group communication.
Figure 6.9.2.1.1-1: MCPTT system as the controlling system arbitrates floor
control requests from 2 systems
1\. A group communication consisting of participants from both MCPTT and LMR
is in progress.
2\. The floor control server in the MCPTT system (being the controlling
system) receives floor requests from participants in both MCPTT and LMR
systems via IWF at the same time.
3\. The floor control server in the MCPTT system arbitrates the received
requests and determines one user to be granted the floor (MCPTT user in this
case).
4\. The floor control server sends floor granted message to the MCPTT user.
5\. The floor control server sends floor taken message to the LMR user via the
IWF.
6\. The MCPTT user sends media to the group.
NOTE: The case where the LMR user is granted the floor is similar to the case
above, except that the floor granted and floor taken message are swapped.
##### 6.9.2.1.2 Floor request arbitration in the LMR system as the control
system
In this procedure, the LMR system is the controlling system and its floor
controlling server arbitrates the floor requests from both MCPTT and LMR
systems and grant one participant.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A group communication with members consisting of MCPTT and LMR systems is
established and is in progress.
2\. The LMR system is the controlling system for the group communication.
Figure 6.9.2.1.2-1: LMR system as the controlling system arbitrates floor
control requests from 2 systems
1\. A group communication consisting of participants from both MCPTT and LMR
is in progress.
2\. The floor control server in the LMR system (being the controlling system)
receives floor requests from participants in both MCPTT and LMR systems via
IWF at the same time (the figure shows the MCPTT system side only).
3\. The floor control server in the LMR system arbitrates the received
requests and determines one user to be granted the floor (MCPTT user in this
case).
4\. The floor control server in the LMR system sends floor granted message to
the MCPTT user via the IWF.
5\. The floor control server sends floor taken message to the LMR user (not
shown in the figure).
6\. The MCPTT user sends media to the group.
NOTE: The case where the LMR user is granted the floor is similar to the case
above, except that the floor granted message is replaced by floor taken
message in step 4.
##### 6.9.2.1.3 Floor revocation in the MCPTT system as the control system
In this procedure, the MCPTT system is the controlling system and its floor
controlling server revokes the floor from the current talker due to a floor
request with higher priority from another participant in the LMR system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A group communication with members consisting of MCPTT and LMR systems is
established and is in progress.
2\. The MCPTT system is the controlling system for the group communication.
3\. An MCPTT user has the floor.
Figure 6.9.2.1.3-1: MCPTT system as the controlling system revokes the floor
due to override by an LMR user
1\. A group communication consisting of participants from both MCPTT and LMR
is in progress. An MCPTT client has the floor.
2\. A participant in the LMR system sends floor request to the floor control
server in MCPTT system (being the controlling system) via IWF. This request
has higher priority than the current floor holder.
NOTE 1: The priority value in the floor request sent to the MCPTT server in
step 2 needs to conform to the definition in the MCPTT system.
3\. The floor control server in MCPTT system determines to override the
current floor.
4\. The floor control server in MCPTT system sends floor revoked message to
the MCPTT client who currently holds the floor.
5\. The floor control server in MCPTT system sends floor granted message to
the LMR client via the IWF.
6\. The LMR client sends media to the group.
NOTE 2: The case where the LMR client initially has the floor and a MCPTT
client sends floor request and trigger floor revocation in the floor control
server is similar to the case above, except that the floor request message
originates from the MCPTT client and floor revoked / floor granted message are
swapped.
##### 6.9.2.1.4 Floor revocation in the LMR system as the control system
In this procedure, the LMR system is the controlling system and its floor
controlling server revokes the floor from the current talker due to a floor
request with higher priority from another participant in the MCPTT system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A group communication with members consisting of MCPTT and LMR systems is
established and is in progress.
2\. The LMR system is the controlling system for the group communication.
3\. An LMR user has the floor.

to override by an MCPTT user
1\. A group communication consisting of participants from both MCPTT and LMR
is in progress. An LMR client has the floor.
2\. A participant in the MCPTT system sends floor request to the floor control
server in LMR system (being the controlling system) via IWF. This request has
higher priority than the current floor holder.
3\. The floor control server in LMR system determines to override the current
floor.
4\. The floor control server in LMR system sends floor revoked message to the
LMR client who currently holds the floor (not shown in the figure).
5\. The floor control server in LMR system sends floor granted message to the
MCPTT client via the IWF.
6\. The MCPTT client starts to send media to the group.
NOTE: The case where the MCPTT client initially has the floor and a LMR client

## 6.10 MCData SDS
### 6.10.1 Solution #9-1: Procedure for standalone MCData SDS interworking
#### 6.10.1.1 Description
##### 6.10.1.1.1 General
The following sub-clauses provide a solution to standalone SDS interworking
between an MCData system and an LMR system.
This solution describes handling both MCData system initiated standalone SDS
messages and LMR system initiated standalone messages in a way that ensures
that standalone MCData SDS messages are satisfactorily converted to and from
LMR.
The following subclauses describe the behaviour at the affected nodes,
including information flows to illustrate the solution.
##### 6.10.1.1.2 Behaviour at the MCData Client
The MCData Client behaves as currently specified.
NOTE: In the event that the stage 1 requirement on application identifier
support described in 3GPP TS 22.282 [20], [R‑5.2.2‑006], is implemented in
3GPP specifications then behaviour at the MCData client might be affected.
##### 6.10.1.1.3 Behaviour at the IWF
The IWF emulates a partner MCData system when interacting with the MCData
system.
##### 6.10.1.1.4 Behaviour at the MCData Server
The MCData Server behaves as currently specified, with the ability to route
messages to individual and group addresses associated with the IWF.
##### 6.10.1.1.5 MCData user to LMR user SDS request
The procedure in figure 6.10.1.1.5-1 describes the case where, in response to
a request from an MCData user, an MCData client initiates a one-to-one MCData
data communication for sending a standalone SDS data to an LMR user over the
signalling plane with or without a disposition request. Standalone refers to
sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS data size is assumed
to be within the allowed limits over MCData-SDS-1 using SIP reference points.
This procedure is based on the existing procedure for MCData SDS one-to-one
standalone short data service using signalling control plane described in 3GPP
TS 23.282 [18], section 7.4.2.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The IWF and the MCData user on MCData client 1 are registered with the
MCData server for receiving the MCData service.
2\. The IWF and MCData client 1 belong to the same MCData system.
Figure 6.10.1.1.5-1: MCData user initiates a signalling control plane one-to-
one standalone short data service request to an LMR user
1\. The user or an application of MCData client 1 initiates an SDS transfer
request to an MCData ID that represents an LMR user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends an MCData standalone data request to the MCData
server. The MCData standalone data request can contain a disposition request
if indicated by the user or application of MCData client 1.
3\. The MCData server checks whether MCData client 1 is authorized to send the
MCData standalone data request. The MCData server also checks whether any
policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or content to
certain members or LMR users due, for example, to location or user privilege
or affiliation. The MCData server observes that the destination MCData ID is
located behind the IWF.
4\. The MCData server initiates a MCData standalone data request towards the
IWF indicating as ultimate destination the MCData ID that represents the LMR
user.
5\. The IWF processes the payload for delivery to the LMR system.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by MCData client
1 and if the LMR system provided data disposition, then the IWF initiates an
MCData data disposition notification delivery report. The MCData data
disposition notification from the IWF can be stored by the MCData server for
disposition history interrogation from authorized MCData users.
7\. The MCData data disposition notification delivery report is sent to MCData
client 1.
8\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by MCData client 1,
and if the LMR system provides an indication that the data has been read,
then, once the IWF determines that the data has been read, the IWF initiates
an MCData data disposition notification read report. The MCData data
disposition notification from the IWF can be stored by the MCData server for
disposition history interrogation from authorized MCData users.
9\. MCData data disposition notification read report is sent to the MCData
client 1.
##### 6.10.1.1.6 LMR user to MCData user SDS request
The procedure in figure 6.10.1.1.6-1 describes the case where, in response to
a request from an LMR user, the IWF initiates a one-to-one MCData data
communication for sending a standalone SDS data to an MCData user over the
signalling plane with or without a disposition request. Standalone refers to
sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS data size is assumed
to be within the allowed limits over MCData-SDS-1 using SIP reference points.
This procedure is based on the existing procedure for MCData SDS one-to-one
standalone short data service using signalling control plane described in 3GPP
TS 23.282 [18], subclause 7.4.2.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The IWF and the MCData user on MCData client 1 are registered with the
MCData server for receiving the MCData service.
2\. The IWF and MCData client 1 belong to the same MCData system.
3\. The IWF has received a data delivery request from from an LMR user
destined for a chosen MCData user and has performed any necessary data
conversion.
Figure 6.10.1.1.6-1: LMR user initiates a signalling control plane one-to-one
standalone short data service request to an MCData user
1\. The IWF sends an MCData standalone data request to the MCData server
containing the converted payload and indicating as source address the MCData
ID of the originating LMR user and as destination address the MCData ID of
MCData client 1. The MCData standalone data request can contain a disposition
request if indicated by the IWF. (Use of the disposition request could depend
on configuration of the IWF or could be requested by the LMR user.)
2\. The MCData server checks whether the IWF is authorized to send the MCData
standalone data request (this includes a check on the authorization of the
originating LMR user, as represented by the MCData ID included in the
request). The MCData server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted
to limit certain types of message or content to certain members due, for
example, to location or user privilege or affiliation.
3\. The MCData server initiates a MCData standalone data request towards the
MCData user on MCData client 1.
> 4\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
> data, is not command instructions, etc.) the MCData user of MCData client 1
> can be notified. If the payload is not for MCData user consumption the
> MCData user of MCData client 1 is not notified. The actions taken when the
> payload contains application data or command instructions are specific based
> on the contents of application identifiers inside the payload. Payload
> content received by MCData client 1 which is addressed to a known local non-
> MCData application that is not yet running causes MCData client 1 to start
> the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start application) and pass
> the payload content to the just started application.
NOTE: Remote start applications can conduct additional security checks on the
authorization of the requesting MCData ID.
Editor\'s note: We could also put the above note into the MCData TS.
5\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the IWF, then
MCData client 1 initiates an MCData data disposition notification delivery
report. The MCData data disposition notification from MCData client 1 can be
stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
authorized MCData users.
6\. The MCData data disposition notification delivery report is sent to the
IWF.
7\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the IWF, then
once the receiving user reads the data, MCData client 1 initiates a MCData
data disposition notification read report. The MCData data disposition
notification from MCData client 1 can be stored by the MCData server for
disposition history interrogation from authorized MCData users. The MCData
data disposition notification from MCData client 1 can be stored by the MCData
server for disposition history interrogation from authorized MCData users.
8\. MCData data disposition notification read report is sent to the IWF.
#### 6.10.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
There are no impacts on existing nodes and functionality.
NOTE: In the event that the stage 1 requirement on application identifier
support described in 3GPP TS 22.282 [20], [R‑5.2.2‑006], is implemented in
3GPP specifications then the MCData client might be impacted.
#### 6.10.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution specifies the necessary functionality at the IWF and MCData
client to enable standalone MCData SDS message transport between MCData
systems and LMR systems.
NOTE: Specification of payload conversion is outside the scope of the present
document.
### 6.10.2 Solution #9-2: Payload size handling for standalone MCData SDS
interworking
#### 6.10.2.1 Description
##### 6.10.2.1.1 General
The following sub-clauses provide a solution to key issue #9-1 of the present
document.
This solution describes handling both MCData system initiated standalone SDS
messages and LMR system initiated standalone data messages in a way that the
maximum size limits of MCData SDSs and LMR messages are observed.
The following subclauses describe the behaviour at the affected nodes,
including information flows to illustrate the solution.
##### 6.10.2.1.2 Behaviour at the MCData client
This key issue has no direct impact on the MCData client. However, it might be
valuable to provide by configuration a maximum MCData SDS message size to
optimise communications involving LMR systems in order to avoid requirements
for message segmentation en route to the LMR system.
##### 6.10.2.1.3 Behaviour at the IWF
The IWF emulates a partner MCData system when interacting with the MCData
system. Consequently, it will behave according to configuration and the
capabilities of the LMR and the MCData system in handling the onward
transmission of an incoming message between the MCData system and the LMR
system.
##### 6.10.2.1.4 Behaviour at the MCData Server
This key issue has no impact on the MCData server.
#### 6.10.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
In the case that optimisation of MCData SDS size for LMR interworking is
applied at the MCData client on a per user or per group basis, the MCData
client would require additional configuration parameters.
#### 6.10.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution specifies the necessary functionality to enable standalone
MCData SDS message payload size conversion between MCData systems and LMR
systems. If optimisation is not applied then there is no impact to the MCData
system.

# 8 Conclusions
## 8.1 General
The Study on mission critical communication interworking between LTE and non-
LTE systems has identified 25 key issues and 68 sub-key issues or \'gaps\'.
During the study, 25 solutions were proposed. The proposed solutions address
21 of the key issues.
Two key issues were deferred due to lack of stage one requirements: #3-2 call
back and #5-3 unencrypted audio during encrypted call. A key issue pertaining
to message and transmission trunking was removed because the solution to the
issue could be contained entirely within the IWF and thus deemed out of scope.
The study proposed a single architecture: an interworking interface connecting
with an out of scope entity (the IWF) with a behaviour similar to a peer MCPTT
system from the perspective of an interworked MCPTT server and a behaviour
similar to a peer MCData server from the perspective of an interworked MCData
server. The study attempted to identify aspects of the interface different
from MCPTT-3 and that would impact the architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[11] and 3GPP TS 23.280 [17].
The following subclauses summarize the conclusions of all key issues.
## 8.2 Conclusions on key issues
### 8.2.1 Solution with no key issue
Solution #0-2 specifies a general interworking architecture between the MCData
system and an LMR system. No impact to existing MCPTT or MCData specifications
is envisioned.
### 8.2.2 Key issue #1-1: Mapping of MCPTT, MCData and TETRA/P25 user
identities
Solution #1-1 proposes mapping MCPTT identities to/from LMR identities at the
IWF. No impact to existing MCPTT specifications is envisioned.
### 8.2.3 Key issue #1-2: Mapping of MCPTT and TETRA/P25 group identities
Solution #1-1 proposes mapping MCPTT identities to/from LMR identities at the
IWF. No impact to existing MCPTT specifications is envisioned.
### 8.2.4 Key issue #2-1: Group affiliation
Solution #2-1 addresses both the interworking groups and linked group cases
and would be applicable for whichever approach is adopted. In the case of a
single affiliation by the IWF on behalf of multiple LMR users, there will be
an impact to MCPTT. The proposed solution is recommended to be implemented in
release 15.
### 8.2.5 Key issue #2-2: Group controlling system
Solution #2-2 proposes that an interworking group be defined on the system
that will be the controlling server for the group. No impacts to MCPTT have
been identified.
### 8.2.6 Key issue #2-3: Late entry to group call
Solution #3-5 proposes that late call entry for interworking functions the
same as late call entry for MCPTT. No impacts to MCPTT have been identified.
### 8.2.7 Key issue #3-1: Private call
Solutions #3-1 and #3-2 both address the key issue in a similar way. Solution
#3-1 adds parameter negotiation to cope with LMR system incompatibilities.
Both solutions identify impacts to MCPTT. A combination of the two proposed
solutions is recommended to be implemented in release 15.
### 8.2.8 Key issue #3-2: Call Back
Call back function interworking is not required by stage 1 and is not
addressed in the present document.
### 8.2.9 Key issue #3-3: Group call
Solutions #3-3 and #3-4 both address the key issue, the former for temporary
groups and the latter for interworking groups. Neither solution identifies
MCPTT system impacts.
### 8.2.10 Key issue #4-1: Vocoder reconciliation
#### 8.2.10.1 Solution #4-1
Solution #4-1 proposes that the MCPTT server reconcile the chosen vocoder when
the first LMR user joins or the last LMR user leaves, as necessary. This
solution has potential impact to MCPTT. The solution is recommended to be
implemented in release 15 in combination with solution #4-3.
#### 8.2.10.2 Solution #4-2
Solution #4-2 provides a means of restricting the codec used within an MCPTT
group call to that used in an LMR system, when LMR group members are expected
to join the group via the IWF, without using a transcoding solution.
The advantage is that there does not to be any change of codec when LMR
members join or leave a group shared with MCPTT users. The disadvantage is
that use of the LMR codec will result in lower speech quality for MCPTT users
when there are no LMR group members taking part in MCPTT group calls.
The solution permits end to end encryption using LMR mechanisms is to be used
within the MCPTT group.
The solution identifies impacts to MCPTT UEs, the MCPTT server and group
configuration.
#### 8.2.10.3 Solution #4-3
Solution #4-3 allows the selection of codec within an MCPTT group to be
negotiated according to the needs of the LMR system.
To enable the solution, the set of LMR codecs needs to be supported by all
group members, and this has implications for configuration and management of
exception conditions when the configuration or capabilities of all group
members do not support all the required LMR codecs.
An alternative solution would be a transcoding solution, where the change of
LMR codec is hidden from the MCPTT system. The impact of transcoding compared
with use of the LMR codec would need further investigation.
The solution will support end to end encryption between all group members
using LMR encryption mechanisms that are applicable to the set of LMR speech
codecs.
The solution identifies impacts to MCPTT UEs and the MCPTT server.
The solution is recommended to be implemented in release 15 in combination
with solution #4-1.
### 8.2.11 Key issue #4-2: Unstoppable audio
Solution #4-4 proposes a new procedure to support the detection and
propagation of the "unstoppable audio" condition and allows distributing this
audio to authorized group members within the MCPTT system. This prevents
important transmissions from being lost. This solution reuses the existing
floor override without using floor revoked procedure defined in TS 23.379
[11]. This solution has potential impact to MCPTT. The solution is recommended
to be implemented in release 15.
### 8.2.12 Key issue #5-1: End to end payload encryption
Solution #5-1 provides a method for transporting TETRA end‑to end encrypted
speech between MCPTT clients and the TETRA IWF. This solution also provides a
method for transporting P25 end-to-end encrypted speech between MCPTT clients
and a P25 RF Subsystem. The solution identifies impacts to the MCPTT system.
The recommendation is to implement the solution in release 15.
### 8.2.13 Key issue #5-2: Key agreement
No solutions were proposed for the key issue.
### 8.2.14 Key issue #5-3: Unencrypted transmissions within an encrypted call
No solutions were proposed for the key issue.
### 8.2.15 Key issue #5-4: Key management
No solutions were proposed for the key issue.
### 8.2.16 Key issue #6-1: Regrouping
Solutions #6-1, #6-2 and #6-3 propose solutions for regrouping. Solution #6-1
proposes solutions for both interworking and linked group regroups and a
solution for 4 of the 5 key issue gaps. Solution #6-2 is a general solution
for regroup initiated by an MCPTT client and is complementary to solution
#6-1. Solution #6-3 is a general solution for regroup initiated by an MCPTT
server, and is complementary to solution #6-1. Of the 3 solutions, only #6-1
has identified potential impact to MCPTT. The recommendation is to implement
relevant concepts from solution #6-1 in combination with solution the approach
in solution #3-6, in release 15.
### 8.2.17 Key issue #6-2: Group Linking
Solution #3-6 reuses the existing temporary group call procedure to support
group regrouping in the MCPTT system where one of the groups is linked to a
group in the LMR system. The solution identified no impacts to the MCPTT
system.
### 8.2.18 Key issue #6-3: Separate regrouping within each system
Solution #6-4 proposes a solution for routing issues and complexity when
groups are regrouped in separate systems. The solution has impact on the MCPTT
system. The recommendation is to implement the solution in release 15.
### 8.2.19 Key issue #7-1: Emergency calls
Solution #7-1 provides a means of originating and receiving emergency group
calls to and from LMR users via the IWF. While the solution identifies
potential impacts on the MCPTT system, the impacts are avoided by the
selection of solution #3-6.
### 8.2.20 Key issue #7-2: Emergency alerts
Solution #7-2: Emergency alerts provides a means of originating and receiving
emergency alerts to and from LMR users via the IWF. While the solution
identifies potential impacts on the MCPTT system, the impacts are avoided by
the selection of solution #3-6.
### 8.2.21 Key issue#8-1: Simultaneous floor request
Solution #2-2 allows a single point of control for affiliation, group call and
floor control. The solution identifies no impact to the MCPTT system.
### 8.2.22 Key issue #8-2: User\'s floor is revoked by another user in another
system
Solution #2-2 allows a single point of control for affiliation, group call and
floor control. The solution identifies no impact to the MCPTT system.
### 8.2.23 Key issue #8-3: Floor Request timing
Solution #8-1 proposes a solution for simultaneous floor requests in which a
timestamp is included with the request. The solution has impact on the MCPTT
system. Further discussion is needed before the solution can be recommended
for implementation in release 15.
### 8.2.24 Key issue #9-1: Procedure for standalone MCData SDS interworking
Solution #9-2 specifies the necessary functionality at the IWF and MCData
client to enable standalone MCData SDS message transport between MCData
systems and LMR systems. The solution identifies no impact to the MCPTT nor
the MCData system.
### 8.2.25 Key issue #9-2: Payload size handling
Solution #9-1 specifies the necessary functionality to enable standalone
MCData SDS message payload size conversion between MCData systems and LMR
systems. If optimisation is not applied, then there is no impact to the MCData
system. The solution identifies impact to the MCData client parameters. The
recommendation is to implement the solution in release 15.
