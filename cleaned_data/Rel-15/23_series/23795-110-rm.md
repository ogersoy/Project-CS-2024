# 4 Analysis of V2X standards
## 4.1 3GPP V2X service requirements
### 4.1.1 Description
The V2X service requirements are specified in 3GPP TS 22.185 [2] and 3GPP TS
22.186 [3].
The V2X service requirements specified in 3GPP are identified by taking into
account the V2X service requirements defined in other SDOs, e.g. ETSI ITS, US
SAE.
The following types of V2X applications are addressed:
\- Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V);
\- Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I);
\- Vehicle-to-Network (V2N); and
\- Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P).
The following V2X scenarios are addressed:
\- Safety-related V2X scenarios: e.g. automated driving, vehicle platooning
\- Non-safety-related V2X scenarios: e.g. mobile high data rate entertainment,
mobile hotspot/office/home, dynamic digital map update
A relevant aspect of advanced V2X applications is the Level of Automation
(LoA), which reflects the functional aspects of the technology and affects the
system performance requirements. The following LoA are defined by SAE J3016
[37]:
\- 0 -- No Automation;
\- 1 -- Driver Assistance;
\- 2 -- Partial Automation;
\- 3 -- Conditional Automation;
\- 4 -- High Automation; and
\- 5 -- Full Automation.
### 4.1.2 Analysis

## 4.2 3GPP EPS architecture for V2X communications
### 4.2.1 Description
The V2X architecture, functional entities to facilitate vehicular
communications for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services, which includes
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle-to-
Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) are specified based on EPS
in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8].
NOTE: Analysis of 3GPP 5GS architecture for V2X communications is out of scope
of the present document.
### 4.2.2 Analysis
The following reference points described in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] have V2X
application layer impact:
1\. V1: The reference point between V2X application in the UE and the V2X
application server. This reference point is considered out of scope of 3GPP TS
23.285 [8].
2\. V2: The reference point between the V2X Application Server and the V2X
Control Function in the operator\'s network. The V2X Application Server may
connect to V2X Control Functions belonging to multiple PLMNs. V2 is used by
V2X control function for obtaining PC5 configuration parameters for V2X
communications, from the V2X Application Server.
3\. V3: The reference point between the UE and the V2X Control Function in
UE\'s home PLMN. It is applicable to both PC5 and LTE-Uu based V2X
communication and optionally MBMS and LTE-Uu based V2X communication. V3 is
used by V2X control function for provisioning V2X configuration parameters to
the UE.
4\. V5: The reference point between the V2X applications in the UEs. This
reference point is considered out of scope of 3GPP TS 23.285 [8].
NOTE: The PC5 parameters provisioned by the V2X control function over V3 take
precedence over the PC5 parameters provisioned over V1 on the V2X UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8].
The following high level functions specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] have V2X
application layer impact:
1\. Authorization and provisioning for V2X communications over PC5 reference
point
2\. V2X message transmission/reception over PC5 reference point
3\. V2X message transmission/reception over LTE-Uu reference point
4\. V2X Application Server discovery
5\. QoS handling for V2X communication
6\. MBMS bearer announcement for V2X use
7\. Support for V2X communication for UEs in limited service state
8\. V2X communication in roaming scenarios (home routing and local break-out
of SIPTO type)
9\. V2X Message Distribution Server deployments
## 4.3 ETSI ITS communication architecture and requirements
### 4.3.1 Description
This subclause considers the specifications related to facilities layer which
have impact on the V2X application support layer for analysis.
The ITS station reference architecture follows the principles of the OSI model
and the communication protocol stack is specified in ETSI EN 302 665 [33]
consisting of:
\- Access layer;
\- Networking and transport layer;
\- Facilities layer; and
\- Applications layer.
The facilities layer protocols and communication requirements most commonly
used are specified in ETSI EN 302 637‑2 [31], ETSI EN 302 637-3 [32], and ETSI
TS 103 301 [30]. Those services provide application support to construct,
manage and process messages distributed between end users or between
infrastructure and end-users based on payload received from the V2X
application(s).
### 4.3.2 Analysis
The facilities layer acts as the application support layer between the
networking and transport layer and the application layer. The facilities layer
provides generic messaging support for the application layer and thus is not
meant to address transport issues such as optimized use of LTE-Uu and PC5
communications of the 3GPP network systems (EPS/5GS). The solutions in the
present document can be utilized by the facilities layer to enhance the
interaction with the 3GPP system. The network and transport layers are the
appropriate ITS layers that could be aware of the physical interface between
communication endpoints to enable tightly coupled operation.
## 4.4 SAE and related standards communication architecture and requirements
### 4.4.1 Description
This subclause analyzes the SAE and related specifications for message and
facilities layers which may have impact on the V2X application support.
The WAVE ITS station reference architecture in IEEE 1609.0 [34] follows the
principles of the OSI model and the communication protocol stack is specified
in ISO 21217:2014 [35], consisting of:
\- Access layer;
\- Networking and transport layer;
\- Message layer or Facilities layer; and
\- Applications layer.
The message layer (SAE/IEEE) or facilities layer (ISO) protocols and
communication requirements most commonly used are specified in current
standards SAE J2945/3 [38], SAE J2945/4 [39], and SAE J2945/6 [40] as well as
ISO 21217:2014 [35]. Those services provide application support to construct,
manage and process messages distributed between end users or between
infrastructure and end-users based on payload received from the V2X
application(s). Upper layer standards in SAE as well as ISO are currently
being adapted to work with C-V2X as specified in SAE J3161 [41] and ISO/DIS
17515-3 [36].
### 4.4.2 Analysis
The message/facilities layer acts as the application support layer between the
networking and transport layer and the application layer. The
message/facilities layer provides generic messaging support for the
application layer and thus is not meant to address transport issues such as
optimized use of LTE-Uu and PC5 communications of the 3GPP network systems
(EPS/5GS). The solutions in the present document can be utilized by the
message/facilities layer to enhance the interaction with the 3GPP system. The
network and transport layers are the appropriate WAVE/ITS layers that could be
aware of the physical interface between communication endpoints to enable
tightly coupled operation.
# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue 1 - Communication of V2X application QoS requirements with
3GPP systems
### 5.1.1 General
The V2X services described in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3], require ultra-reliable and
low latency characteristics, and may require high data rates due to the very
high expected payloads. The Categories of Requirements (CoR) and Level of
Automation (LoA) is defined, which reflects the functional aspects of the
technology and affects the system performance requirements.are defined to
support such V2X scenarios.
The following CoRs are defined:
\- General Aspects;
\- Vehicle Platooning;
\- Advanced Driving;
\- Extended Sensors; and
\- Remote Driving.
The following LoAs are defined:
\- No Automation (0);
\- Driver Assistance (1);
\- Partial Automation (2);
\- Conditional Automation (3);
\- High Automation (4); and
\- Full Automation (5).
For the combination of each CoR scenario and each degree of LoA, requirements
are specified in terms of Payload (Bytes), Transmission rate (Message/Sec),
Maximum end-to-end latency (ms), Reliability (%), Data rate (Mbps), Minimum
required communication range (meters).
V2X scenarios are delay and reliability critical while the rate (and thus the
resource) requirement may vary for each CoR and LoA, since they may support
different payloads (from 300 B to 12000 B) under the strict delay requirement.
Also, different CoR and LoA combination may require different QoS parameters
(even for the same V2X application, e.g. platooning). This poses additional
challenges regarding the accommodation of QoS and resource requests by 3GPP
systems from numerous and resource demanding services.
### 5.1.2 Key issue 1a - Communication of V2X application network QoS
requirements with 3GPP systems
Some V2X scenarios are group-based communications (e.g. platooning); hence a
request for resources may involve numerous users, possibly in different cells
or even different systems. The request for QoS and resource allocations may
need to be satisfied jointly for all users (or a specified set of users)
within a short amount of time, considering the fact that 3GPP systems (EPS,
5GS) are expected to accommodate significant load by other requests requiring
resources. Furthermore, if the request is not entirely successful, the request
cannot result in any resources being held temporarily, as those resources may
need to be available to other requests. To this end, it may be also necessary
to queue for resources while resolving potential congestions.
In stage 2 specification, 3GPP TS 23.285 [8], the QoS handling for V2X
communication over LTE Uu reference point specifies the use of:
\- QCI 3 and QCI 79 for unicast delivery for V2X messages.
\- QCI 75 for multicast delivery of V2X messages.
The V2X application, due to the different LoA options (1-5) and different
modes of operation (e.g. unicast vs multicast broadcast) may require to change
the QoS and resource demand un-predictably (e.g. LoA adjustment due to
application demand), so the 3GPP systems needs to be able to adapt fast and
decide accordingly whether it can fulfill the new requirement for all users
(or a specified set of users).
**Given the aforementioned considerations** and the increased complexity of
scenarios and the wider variety of requirements, it is required to further
study the following aspects:
\- Abstract the knowledge of network QoS to the applications.
\- Whether the capability provided by the core network to the V2X application
for allocation of unicast and multicast resources is sufficient.
### 5.1.3 Key issue 1b - Communication of V2X application PC5 QoS requirements
with 3GPP systems
In stage 2 specification, 3GPP TS 23.303 [9], the QoS handling over PC5 is
achieved by ProSe Per-Packet Priority selected by the application layer (based
on criteria that are outside the scope of 3GPP TS 23.303 [9]) from a range of
8 possible values.
It is required to further study the following aspects:
\- Defining ProSe Per-Packet Priority usage for V2X communication over PC5.
## 5.2 Key issue 2 - Monitoring network situation of 3GPP systems by V2X
application
In a V2X scenario, for a given CoR, the LoA can be adjusted in the range
between 1 and 5 and this adjustment in LoA may be a result of a particular
network situation (e.g. congestion). The V2X application may monitor the
network situation and adapt the LoA for a given CoR corresponding to a V2X
scenario. This change in LoA should also be communicated to the V2X UE by the
V2X application server.
This aspect where _V2X application server is capable to adjust the LoA for
single or specified sets of users of the same service (e.g. platooning), by
monitoring the network situation (e.g. network load)_ and communicating the
change of LoA with V2X UE over V1 reference point is currently not addressed
in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8].
The ability to provide the V2X application with the 3GPP network conditions
(e.g. network load) and the aspect of communicating the change of LoA to the
V2X UE requires further study.
## 5.3 Key issue 3 - V2X USD provisioning via V1 reference point
In 3GPP TS 23.285 [8], the V2X USD is used for receiving MBMS based V2X
traffic. As it is stated in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8], there are three approaches for
the V2X USD provisioning as follows:
> _\"- Provided with V2X USDs for receiving MBMS based V2X traffic via
> existing MBMS service announcement mechanisms, or provisioned from V2X
> Control Function, or provisioned from the V2X Application Server via V1
> reference point\"_
_\"To provide the UE with the_ _V2X_ _USD(s),_ _the following ways_ _may be
used:_
_\- Existing MBMS service announcement mechanisms specified in TS 23.246 [8]_
_and TS 26.346 [11]._
_\- Provisioning_ _as described in clause_ _4.4.1.2.2,_ _i.e. pre-
configuration in the UE and/or configuration from V2X Control Function._
_-_ _Provisioning from the V2X Application Server via V1 reference point\"_
\-- \--
As one of the V2X USD provisioning options, the implementation of provisioning
via V1 reference point is not defined as it is outside the scope of SA2.
Gap:
\- How to implement the option of provisioning the V2X USD from the V2X
application server via V1 reference point.
## 5.4 Key issue 4 - Local service information
The V2X application server discovery related information is specified in
subclause 4.4.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] and V2X application discovery
procedure is specified in subclause 5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.285 [8]. The V2X
application server discovery via MBMS is shown below.
Figure 5.4-1: V2X application server discovery using broadcast as specified in
3GPP TS 23.285 [8]
The local service information in step 2 includes the V2X application server
discovery parameters defined in subclause 4.4.1.2 and subclause 4.4.7.3 of
3GPP TS 23.285 [8].
For the V2X scenarios like extended sensors, platooning, the V2X UEs may be
connected to the serving PLMN, but the V2X application server information may
change as per the geographical location. However, it is not specified in SA2
how to deliver local service information to V2X UE.
Gap:
\- It is for further study how to deliver local service information at the
application layer.
## 5.5 Key issue 5 - Service continuity during MBMS based V2X traffic
In 3GPP TS 23.285 [8], V2X communication can be delivered over unicast or
MBMS. The service continuity issue including transferring V2X traffic from
MBMS to unicast is to be considered. The V2X service interruption due to high
speed mobility should be minimized. This key issue refers to the key issue#1
in 3GPP TR 23.780 [14] with the difference that V2X application server is the
instance of GCS AS.
The different use cases can be described as follows:
1\. The V2X UE moves from one cell to another within the same MBSFN area. Both
cells are contributing to the MBSFN transmission. This mobility case is
supported in current RAN specification, see subclause 15.4 in 3GPP TS 36.300
[24].
2\. The V2X UE moves from one MBSFN area to another MBSFN area. In this
scenario both MBSFN areas are transmitting on the same MBMS bearer, i.e. the
same TMGI. MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2 may use different frequencies. In
this mobility case the V2X UE detects bad reception from MBSFN area 1 and
triggers a transfer to unicast. After some time the V2X UE will detect the
MBSFN area 2 transmission and return to reception over MBMS. In this scenario
it is not possible to avoid going to unicast.
3a. The V2X UE moves from one MBMS service area to another MBMS service area.
In this scenario, the two MBMS service area transmissions use different MBMS
bearers i.e. different TMGI. Furthermore a specific V2X group communication is
not required to be transmitted in both MBMS service areas. In this mobility
case the V2X UE detects bad reception from MBSFN area 2 and triggers a
transfer to unicast. After some time the V2X UE will detect the MBSFN area 3
transmission and if the same V2X group communication is transmitted in the new
area the V2X UE will return to reception over MBMS. In this scenario it is not
possible to avoid going to unicast.
3b. The V2X UE moves from one MBMS service area to another MBMS service area.
In this scenario the two MBMS service area transmissions use different MBMS
bearers with the same TMGI, separated by the application with the use of
different flow IDs. The flow IDs is not visible to the UE.
4\. The V2X UE moves out from an MBSFN area to a new cell that is not
transmitting over MBMS. This service continuity use case is defined in 3GPP TS
23.468 [10].
5\. The UE A moves out of coverage and uses UE-R as a UE-to-network relay UE.
In this scenario the UE A moves from in coverage and listening to an MBMS
bearer to out of coverage but remains in on-network by using UE-R as a relay.
There is currently no service continuity procedure defined for this scenario.
The key issue described is the service continuity issues in use case 2 and use
case 3 according to the description above.
Figure 5.5-1: Service continuity use cases
Gaps:
\- The MBMS listening status report about the MBMS reception quality for V2X
service is missing;
\- The switching of MBMS bearer to unicast over V1 reference points for V2X
service is missing; and
\- Evaluate whether the existing solution to key issue#1 in 3GPP TR 23.780
[14] can be resued for V2X services.
## 5.6 Key issue 6 - Handling MBMS bearer suspension
In Rel-12, 3GPP has introduced the capability of automatically suspending
(pre-empting) / resuming MBMS bearers in case of MBMS congestion. Some
signalling procedures are specified (see 3GPP TS 36.321 [25], 3GPP TS 36.443
[26], and 3GPP TS 23.468 [10]) to notify the UEs of MBMS bearer suspension and
to allow the UEs to notify the application server. Currently the efficient
handling of MBMS bearer suspension/resumption by the V2X application server
has not been considered.
This key issue includes the following aspects for further study:
\- How the V2X application server acquires the MBMS bearer suspension.
\- Efficient signalling of MBMS bearer suspension / resumption over V1
reference point.
\- Minimized V2X services impact of MBMS bearer suspension, especially in the
case of high connection density for congested traffic.
\- Efficient application recovery from conditions of MBMS congestion and MBMS
bearer suspension.
## 5.7 Key Issue 7 - V2X UE capabilities reporting
This key issue refers to the key issue#8 in 3GPP TR 23.780 [14] with the
difference that V2X application server is the instance of GCS AS.
The V2X application server acts as the instance of GCS AS. In LTE based MBMS,
two MBMS delivery mode named SC-PTM and MBSFN are defined. In current
specifications, the GCS AS is responsible for making the decision to use MBMS
or not, while the MCE is responsible for selecting the MBMS delivery mode. In
both entities, the UE\'s supporting MBMS delivery mode is missing to make the
decision, which may cause the case that GCS AS determines to use MBMS with MCE
determining the MBMS delivery mode that most of UEs do not support, then the
UEs can not receive the traffic via MBMS. To achieve the coherent MBMS
operation, the following information should be made available to the GCS AS,
e.g.
\- The MBMS mechanism selected by the MCE (if it has already selected);
\- The UE\'s support of the MBMS mechanism(s); and
\- The eNB cell the UE is located.
Gap:
\- How to coordinate MBMS operation between V2X UE, V2X application server and
MCE.
\- Evaluate whether the existing solution to key issue#8 in 3GPP TR 23.780
[14] can be reused for V2X services.
## 5.8 Key issue 8 - PC5 parameters provisioning over V1
Currently, the PC5 based discovery and communication parameters specified in
sub clause 4.4.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] are pre-configured at the UE or
provisioned by the V2X control function, which may not be sufficient for the
business model that the V2X application server is dominated by 3^rd^ party
e.g., vehicle OEM, and the 3^rd^ party would like to provide the PC5
parameters directly to the V2X application client located in the V2X UE. 3GPP
TS 23.285 [8] also indicates that these parameters may be configured on the UE
through the V1 reference point from the V2X Application Server. To support
this business model, the provisioning PC5 based discovery and communication
parameters over V1 is for further study.
Gap:
\- Evaluate whether the existing provisioning mechanisms for PC5 based
discovery and communication parameters are sufficient where the V2X
application server is deployed by a 3rd party; and
\- Study how to provision PC5 based discovery and communication parameters
over V1 reference point.
## 5.9 Key issue 9 -- V2X group communication
The existing one-to-many ProSe direction communication in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8]
is mainly designed for safety V2X application such as Intersection Movement
Assist (IMA), Left Turn Assist (LTA). In those use cases, the V2V messages
have to be exchanged with all the other vehicles around. Therefore, the
Layer-2 ID used for one-to-many ProSe direct communication is configured per
V2X services.
However, when it comes to platooning scenario, the situation is different.
Some messages for platoon management and coordination, e.g., vehicles of the
platoon need to exchange information regarding when to take which road,
whether to brake or accelerate and when, etc., should be exchanged only within
the platoon. In Uu-based V2X communication, the V2X application server will
guarantee that those messages are only sent to the platoon members. But in
PC5-based V2X communication, the existing preconfigured Layer-2 ID per V2X
service in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] is not enough. Because the platoon member has to
differentiate the messages only for its own platoon and from other vehicles or
platoons. In fact, ProSe Layer-2 Group ID is specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [9],
but it is only used for public safety off-network group commination. Further
study is needed to support V2X group communication in following aspects:
\- Support the platoon specific ProSe Layer-2 Group ID.
\- How to maintain the mapping of ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and V2X application
group.
\- How to deliver the mapping of ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and V2X application
group to V2X UE.
## 5.10 Key issue 10 -- UE location report over V1
In 3GPP TS 23.285 [8], in order to support V2X communication with MBMS, V2X
application server acts as the GCS AS. The V2X application server performs the
related functions and procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10], and maps
UE provided location information to a form that is understood by the 3GPP MBMS
system (e.g. MBMS SAI(s), ECGI(s)). The UE may provide its geographic location
information in the V2X message and Cell ID information in the signalling to
the V2X application server over V1 reference point. However, V1 reference
point is outside scope of 3GPP SA2.
How to report the UE location (e.g. MBMS SAI(s), ECGI(s)) in the signalling
over V1 reference point for MBMS based V2X communication requires further
study.
## 5.11 Key issue 11 - Support for uplink video streaming
Uplink video streaming from multiple UEs is required for several V2X
applications as detailed in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3] and 3GPP TR 22.804 [4].
While traditional approaches consider the processing of camera images inside
the vehicle, the post-processing can take place inside the network or at an
application server outside the 3GPP system as illustrated in 3GPP TR 22.804
[4]. This allows to offload complex operations from the vehicle and provides
the external server with more detailed view of the road situation as compared
to sending only selected features from the processed data. The mobile network
should provide the uplink capacity to upload the images and videos. The post-
processing module is responsible for analysing the images coming from multiple
cameras.
The present document defines an application layer model for supporting
interaction between a VAE client and a VAE server. To support uplink video
streaming use-cases multiple clients connected to different PLMNs need to
communicate with the V2X server.
The key issue should study the VAE capabilities (e.g., message procedures,
grouping) required to support the above use-case.
## 5.12 Key issue 12 - Handling multiple V2X application priorities at the V2X
UE
The present document defines an application enabler model which allows V2X
clients and V2X application servers to exchange information over the 3GPP
system. There is a gap when multiple in-vehicle applications at the client
(V2X UE) with different priorities communicate to V2X application servers over
the 3GPP system. The VAE client should allow different V2X applications with
different priorities to communicate with the V2X application servers according
to their requirements.
The key issue should further study how to handle multiple V2X applications
with different priorities at the UE.
## 5.13 Key issue 13 - Communicating application requirements from the V2X
application server
The 3GPP network system may be enriched with the exchange of information from
the V2X application server for certain V2X use-cases (e.g. local map
acquisition or lane merge) that are expected to be delivered in certain
time/space horizons. This can include information about the service demand
(e.g. number of involved vehicles, aumont of data to be transferred, time
windows for transfer,). This can also include timing requirements provided by
the V2X application. Examples of the timing requirements are whether periodic
or event-based interaction is needed, interaction performed either before or
during an ongoing session, possible time windows for the interaction (e.g. the
interaction should happen in a window of XX sec before a network change or a
V2X application adaptation is expected to happen). This information allows the
3GPP network system to properly provision the required resources for the V2X
application and meet the requirements of the V2X application.
Gap:
\- Defining which information to be provided by the V2X application to 3GPP
network system to enable the 3GPP network system to provision the required
resources for the V2X application considering the demand and timing
requirements of the V2X application.
\- Defining the VAE capabilities to provide the demand and timing requirements
to the 3GPP network system.
## 5.14 Key issue 14 - Network assistance for enhancing QoE in V2X
applications
3GPP TS 22.186 [3] describes several use-cases and service requirements to
enhance 3GPP network system support for V2X services. In several use-cases
(e.g., platooning, HD/3D local map download, infotainment), providing a high
QoE to the V2X UE is desired. The 3GPP network system typically assigns QoS
bearers for different UEs. Nevertheless, the quality experienced by a V2X UE
changes dynamically during an ongoing session due to mobility, channel quality
and content variability (e.g., bit-rate variation) which requires further
adaptation by the V2X application server. The V2X application specific server
is responsible for applying the necessary adaptations at the application to
enhance the QoE.
This contribution proposes to study the enabling functionalities at the V2X
application server and the V2X UE to support the V2X UE application. In
particular, the key issue should study the required VAE capabilities to
support QoE enhancements.
## 5.15 Key issue 15 - V2X USD provisioning using existing MBMS service
announcement mechanisms
3GPP TS 23.285 [8] describes three approaches for the V2X USD provisioning:
> _\"- Provided with V2X USDs for receiving MBMS based V2X traffic via
> existing MBMS service announcement mechanisms, or provisioned from V2X
> Control Function, or provisioned from the V2X Application Server via V1
> reference point\"_
_\"To provide the UE with the_ _V2X_ _USD(s),_ _the following ways_ _may be
used:_
_\- Existing MBMS service announcement mechanisms specified in TS 23.246 [8]_
_and TS 26.346 [11]._
_\- Provisioning_ _as described in clause_ _4.4.1.2.2,_ _i.e. pre-
configuration in the UE and/or configuration from V2X Control Function._
_\- Provisioning from the V2X Application Server via V1 reference point\"_
\-- \--
3GPP TS 23.285 [8] does not specify any mechanisms for V2X USD provisioning by
the V2X application server using MBMS service announcement mechanisms.
Gap:
\- How to provision V2X USDs from the V2X application server using existing
MBMS service announcement mechanisms specified in 3GPP TS 23.246 [10] and 3GPP
TS 26.346 [14].
## 5.16 Key issue 16 - **Supporting larger files or V2X messages**
3GPP TR 22.886 [5] introduces the case of sending larger files or messages
(e.g. subclause 5.3 of 3GPP TR 22.886 [5]). Sending larger files or messages
typically requires a partitioning step to separate the file / message payload
over multiple IP packet payloads.
3GPP TR 22.886 [5] does not further define \"large message\". However,
software updates or HD map files are easily larger than 100Kbyte in size. The
VAE capabilities should provide common functions to application specific
functions.
Gaps:
\- How does a V2X application server provide larger files or V2X messages
using unicast and multicast.
\- How does a V2X UE provide larger files or V2X messages for uplink
distribution.
## 5.17 Key issue 17 - **Determining UE location for a geographical area**
3GPP TR 22.886 [5] introduces the case of sending larger files or messages
into a defined geographical area (e.g. subclause 5.3 of 3GPP TR 22.886 [5]).
In particular, in case of unicast file / message delivery, delivery into
certain geographical areas should be studied so that only UEs inside of the
targeted geographical areas receive the file / message.
Gap:
\- How to map between the application geographical definition and the network
geographical area definition.
## 5.18 Key issue 18 - **Resolving UE address for ETSI ITS facility layer
messages**
3GPP Cellular-V2X PC5 interface can support ETSI ITS facility layer messages
using BTP/GeoNetworking as the transport and network protocols. As specified
in 3GPP TS 24.386 [16], the PC5 interface of 3GPP V2X can directly support
non-IP traffic. However, conveying ETSI ITS messages over the 3GPP Uu
interface, which only supports IP as the network layer protocol, is not
standardized. Although the current ETSI ITS standards do not preclude
transmitting ETSI ITS facility layer messages using TCP/IP or UDP/IP protocol
as the transport and network layer protocols, there are clear gaps for
supporting ITS facility layer messages over the 3GPP Uu interface. UE
addressing specified in ETSI ITS is non-IP based. Hence all ETSI ITS facility
layer messages require VAE capabilities support for translating the UE
addressing of ETSI ITS to IP based addressing.
## 5.19 Key issue 19 - **Resolving security issues for ETSI ITS distribution**
The current ETSI ITS standards and specifications are not complete for
delivering ETSI ITS facility layer messages using the TCP/IP or UDP/IP
protocol stack, especially for delivering secured messages. Security in ETSI-
ITS context includes authenticity/integrity (certificates assuring information
comes from trusted sources and was not corrupted) and privacy (especially
prevent geographic tracking of individual vehicles or persons). _In
particular, how to fulfil the ITS security requirements as specified in_ ETSI
TS 102 940 _[28] using the ETSI security specifications as specified in_ ETSI
TS 103 097 _[29] and_ ETSI TS 102 723-8 _[27] at the V2X application layer
needs to be studied._
Editor\'s note: The security solution needs input from SA3.
**_It requires further study:_**
\- How to resolve the security issues for ETSI ITS at the application layer.
## 5.20 Key issue 20 -- V2X dynamic groups
Some of the V2X scenarios require group-based communication (e.g. platooning).
Unlike V2X communication for safety scenarios where all V2X UEs in the
communication range receive broadcasted communication, the group-based
communication is expected to be received only by the V2X UEs of the members of
that group. Dynamic groups can be formed for a specific purpose decided at the
application layer. However the members of a dynamic groups are determined
dynamically (with the assistance of the V2X application server or
independently by the V2X UEs when they are not connected to the network)
during the operation. The focus of this key issue is to support the
application layer for forming V2X dynamic groups by including the V2X UEs to
the group, determined in an ad-hoc fashion. In V2X dynamic groups, the group
management operations that need to be supported include adding or removing
members of the group, splitting or merging of groups.
Further study is needed for enabling layer to support application layer V2X
dynamic groups formation and communication, on the following aspects:
For V2X dynamic groups formation with the V2X UEs in Uu communication range:
a) providing support to identify V2X UEs from one or more PLMNs, belonging to
a dynamic group.
b) providing support to provision PC5 parameters enabling dynamic group
communication continuity over V5.
c) providing support to dynamic groups management (adding or removing members,
split or merge dynamic groups).
For V2X dynamic groups formed with the V2X UEs in PC5 communication range:
a) providing support to identify V2X UEs belonging to a dynamic group.
b) providing support to enable dynamic group communication over V5.
c) providing support to dynamic groups management (adding or removing members,
split or merge dynamic groups).
## 5.21 Key issue 21 -- V2X application support for network slicing
Network slicing is a set of technologies to support network service
differentiation and meet the diversified requirements from tenants like
vertical industries as specified in subclause 5.15 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [11].
Network slice is a logical network that provides specific network capabilities
and network characteristics. The application support for slices is a
standardized feature in 3GPP 5GS and mainly involves the interaction between
the 5GS (e.g. slice management system) and the 3^rd^ party (tenants) for the
pre-commissioning, operation and management of the slice end-to-end as
specified in 3GPP TS 28.530 [21].
In V2X use cases as defined in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3], both safety and non-safety
communications need to be supported with diverse and conflicting KPIs
(latency, reliability, throughput). **A V2X service provider may use one or
more network slices for V2X to bundle one or more V2X services to support
multiple KPI and QoS requirements.**
The network slice for V2X will be of slice type URLLC. The slice types are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [11]. The specific details of the network slice
for V2X is not yet defined.
Editor\'s note: How the SA2 definition of the V2X slice impacts this key issue
is FFS.
**Further study is required to determine how to abstract the network slice
details from the V2X application to enable the most efficient utilization of
network resources across V2X services.**
## 5.22 Key issue 22 -- Support for operation modes selection for V2V
communications
The V2X services need to support different modes of operation for V2V (PC5 and
Uu) communications, to ensure meeting the tight service requirements
especially for the reliability and delay critical services. In particular, V2V
should be supported via PC5 for direct V2V communication and/or Uu for
indirect V2V communication considering KPI improvement. The V2X application
layer requires to control the operation modes selection considering the V2V
service KPIs for reliability and latency as specified in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3].
**The aforementioned considerations for operation mode selection for V2V
scenarios are not addressed in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8]. Hence, it is required to
study** whether and how the VAE capabilities should support the selection of
Uu and PC5 modes of operation for V2V services considering KPI improvement
(especially reliability and latency).
## 5.23 Key issue 23 -- Support for service continuity between Uu and UE-to-
network relay for V2X communications
The V2X services specified in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3] require support for service
continuity between Uu and UE-to-network relay for V2X communications (e.g.
where V2X UEs have mobility in areas of limited or no coverage). The V2N
service should be supported via Uu direct V2N communication or PC5 and Uu in a
UE-to-Network Relay operation mode to ensure service continuity.
**It is required to study** whether and how the VAE capabilities should
support the V2N service continuity when changing between Uu and UE-to-Network
relay mode of operation.

#### 7.1.1.2 V2X application layer functional model
Figure 7.1.1.2-1 illustrates the simplified architectural model for the V2X
application layer. It utilizes the architectural reference model specified in
subclause 4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] which have impact on the application layer
support aspects.
Figure 7.1.1.2-1: Simplified architectural model for the V2X application layer
The V2X UE1 communicates with V2X application server over V1 reference point.
The V2X UE1 and V2X UE2 communicate over V5 reference point. V2X UE1 can also
act as a UE-to-network relay, to enable V2X UE2 to access the V2X application
server over V1 reference point.
The reference point V1 supports the V2X application related interactions
between V2X UE and V2X AS and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8]. This
reference point is supported for both unicast and multicast delivery modes.
The reference point V5 supports the interactions between the V2X UEs and is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8].
Figure 7.1.1.2-2 illustrates the detailed V2X application layer functional
model. It enhances the simplified architectural model for the V2X application
layer by specifying the functional entities at the V2X application layer.
Figure 7.1.1.2-2: V2X application layer functional model
The V2X application server consists of V2X application enabler (VAE) server
and the V2X application specific server. The VAE server provides the V2X
application layer support functions to the V2X application specific server
over Vs reference point.
The V2X UEs consist of the VAE client and the V2X application specific client.
The VAE client provides the V2X application layer support functions to the V2X
application specific client over Vc reference point.
The VAE client communicates with the VAE server over V1-AE reference point.
The V2X application specific client communicates with V2X application specific
server over V1-APP reference point.
NOTE 1: The V1-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.
The VAE client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of V2X UE1 over V5-AE
reference point. The V2X application specific client of V2X UE2 communicates
with VAE client of V2X UE1 over V5-APP reference point.
NOTE 2: The V5-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.
V2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay,
\- to enable VAE client on V2X UE2 to access VAE server over V1-AE reference
point; and
\- to enable V2X application specific client on V2X UE2 to access V2X
application specific server over V1-APP reference point.
A V1-AE message can be sent over unicast, transparent multicast via xMB,
transparent multicast via MB2. The non-transparent multicast via xMB (as
specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [20]) is triggered by a V1-AE message. Multicast
distribution can be supported by both transparent and non-transparent
multicast modes.
The VAE server interacts with the 3GPP network systems over V2, MB2, xMB, Rx,
T8, Npcf and N33 reference points. The EPS and 5GS are considered as the 3GPP
network systems.

## 7.2 Solution #2: UE location report over V1
### 7.2.1 Solution description
#### 7.2.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue 10 and describes how to report the UE
location (e.g., MBMS SAI(s), ECGI(s)) in the signalling to the VAE server via
V1-AE to support MBMS-based communication.
#### 7.2.1.2 Location reporting event triggers configuration procedure
The procedure for configuring the location reporting event triggers from the
VAE server to the VAE client is illustrated in figure 7.2.1.2-1. This
procedure is also applied for the location reporting event triggers update.
Pre-condition:
\- If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is activated
by the VAE server.
Figure 7.2.1.2-1: Location reporting event triggers configuration
1\. VAE server sends the location reporting configuration request to the VAE
client including the initial location reporting event triggers configuration
(or a subsequent update), e.g., minimum time between consecutive reports, SAI
changes, or ECGI changes. This message can be sent via unicast or multicast.
2\. VAE client stores or updates the location reporting event triggers
configuration.
3\. VAE client sends the location reporting configuration response to the VAE
server.
#### 7.2.1.3 Location reporting event triggers configuration cancel procedure
The procedure for cancelling the location reporting event triggers
configuration at the VAE client is illustrated in figure 7.2.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has subscribed the VAE client location with the location
reporting event triggers.
2\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the VAE server.
Figure 7.2.1.3-1: Location reporting event triggers configuration cancel
1\. VAE server sends the location reporting configuration cancel request to
the VAE client to stop receiving the UE location information. This message can
be sent via unicast or multicast.
2\. VAE client invalidates the location reporting event triggers configuration
and no longer reports its location to the VAE server.
3\. VAE client sends the location reporting configuration cancel response to
the VAE server.
#### 7.2.1.4 Location reporting procedure
The procedure for UE location report over V1-AE reference point is illustrated
in figure 7.2.1.4-1.
Pre-condition:
\- UE is configured to report location based on event trigger or periodically.
Figure 7.2.1.4-1: UE location report over V1

server when the configured location reporting events occurs.
2\. VAE server may return a UE location report response if requested in UE
location report message.
### 7.2.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the reporting of the UE location (e.g., MBMS SAI(s),
ECGI(s)) in the signalling to the VAE server via V1-AE to support MBMS-based
communication.
## 7.3 Solution #3: Handling MBMS bearer suspension via V1
### 7.3.1 Solution description
#### 7.3.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 6 to allow the VAE server to acquire the
MBMS bearer suspension event. In this solution, the VAE client reports the
MBMS bearer suspension to the VAE server. The VAE server takes actions
corresponding to the MBMS bearer suspension event, e.g. switching all the VAE
clients associated to this MBMS bearer to unicast bearer.
#### 7.3.1.2 Procedure
The information flow below defines a procedure in which the VAE client
notifies the VAE server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer detected by VAE
client.
Figure 7.3.1.2-1: MBMS suspension notification from VAE client
1\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [24].
2\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling
Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [24].
3\. The VAE client detects the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS suspension
report to the VAE server.
The same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that
may be detected by the VAE client.
### 7.3.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables VAE server to handle the MBMS bearer suspension event,
e.g. switching all the VAE clients associated to this MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer. This solution addresses the aspect of VAE server acquiring the
information of MBMS bearer suspension of the key issue 6.
## 7.4 Solution #4: V2X USD provisioning via V1 reference point
### 7.4.1 Solution description
#### 7.4.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 3. The V2X application server can
provision the V2X USD information to V2X UE via V1 reference point for V2X
communication using MBMS.
#### 7.4.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for provisioning V2X USD to the V2X
UE via V1 reference point.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The V2X UE has connected to the V2X application server.
2\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the VAE server.
Figure 7.4.1.2-1: V2X USD provisioning via V1 reference point
1\. The VAE server of the V2X AS is triggered for providing V2X USD to V2X UE.
2\. The VAE server of the V2X AS sends the V2X USD announcement to the VAE
client in the V2X UE with the information of the V2X USDs corresponding to the
V2X applications. The V2X USD information consists of TMGI, list of SAIs,
frequency and SDP information for V2X applications\' communication using MBMS.
The details of V2X USD are specified in subclause 4.4.7.2 in 3GPP TS 23.285
[8]. This message can be sent via unicast or multicast.
3\. Upon receiving the V2X USD announcement, the VAE client of the V2X UE
stores the received V2X USDs.
Editor\'s notes: Defining principles for storing and applying precedence when
V2X USD is configured via different mechanisms (e.g. MBMS service announcement
or pre-configuration or by VAE server via V1 reference point) is FFS.
4\. The VAE client of the V2X UE provides an acknowledgement to the VAE server
of the V2X AS.
### 7.4.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the V2X application server to provision the V2X USDs to
the V2X UE via V1 reference point for V2X communication using MBMS. This
solution supports the scenario where the V2X application is deployed by 3^rd^
party like OEM, and the OEM prefers to provision the service provisioning data
directly to its V2X UE, rather than provisioning by the PLMN operator.
This solution provides a mechanism for the option specified in 3GPP TS 23.285
[8] for V2X USD provisioning from the V2X application server via V1 reference
point.
## 7.5 Solution #5: V2X UE obtaining the local service information
### 7.5.1 Solution description
#### 7.5.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 4. For the V2X scenarios like extended
sensors, platooning, the V2X UEs may be connected to the serving PLMN, but the
V2X application server information may change as per the geographical
location. Also it is not practically feasible to provide all the V2X server
USDs to the V2X UE via the initial V2X UE configuration by the PLMN. It is
hence required that the V2X server USDs may be provided considering the
mobility of the V2X UE. This solution describes the procedure for obtaining
the local service information by the V2X UE via V1.
#### 7.5.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.5.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for obtaining the local service
information by the V2X UE via V1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The V2X UE is connected to the V2X server in geographical area A.
2\. The V2X UE has no local service information for geographical area B.
3\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the VAE server.
Figure 7.5.1.2-1: Obtaining local service information by V2X UE via V1
1\. The VAE client sends a V2X server USD request to the VAE server
(responsible for geographic location A) which may include mobility information
like the geographic locations (geographic location B).
2\. The VAE server determines the V2X server USD(s) information corresponding
to the geographic locations information received in step 1.
3\. The VAE server provides the V2X server USD(s) with the corresponding
geographic locations information to the VAE client via a V2X server USD
response. The V2X USD information consists of TMGI, list of SAIs, frequency
and SDP information with the local service information for local V2X
application server discovery. The details of V2X server USD are specified in
subclause 4.4.7.3 in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8]. This message can be sent via unicast
or multicast.
4\. Upon receiving the V2X server USD(s) in step 3, the VAE client stores the
V2X server USD(s) information to be used to receive the local service
information in the specific geographic location.
### 7.5.2 Solution evaluation
This solution proposes a new procedure to allow the V2X UE to get the V2X
server USD from the V2X application server via V1 reference point for some
geographic locations for which the V2X UE has no V2X server USDs before
entering those geographic locations.
This solution also provides a mechanism for dynamic provisioning of V2X server
USD for a newly deployed local V2X application server to cater to a
geographical area.
This solution is complementary to the mechanims specified in subclause
4.4.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] for providing the local service information to
the V2X UE.
There is no solution by 3GPP SA WG4 for local service information provisioning
from V2X application server.
## 7.6 Solution #6: PC5 parameters provisioning via V1 reference point
### 7.6.1 Solution description
#### 7.6.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 8. The Vehicle OEMs\' may operate their
own V2X application server which are responsible to provide over the air (OTA)
configuration to the V2X UE.
7.6.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.6.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for provisioning PC5 parameters to
the V2X UE via V1 reference point.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The V2X UE has discovered and connected to the V2X application server.
2\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the VAE server.
Figure 7.6.1.2-1: PC5 parameters provisioning via V1 reference point
1\. The VAE server sends the set PC5 parameters request to the VAE client with
the information of the PC5 parameters. The PC5 parameters information are
specified in subclause 4.4.1.1.2 in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8]. This message can be
sent via unicast or multicast.
2\. Upon receiving the set PC5 parameters request, the VAE client stores the
received PC5 parameters in the V2X UE.
3\. The VAE client provides an acknowledgement by sending the set PC5
parameters response to the VAE server.
### 7.6.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the over the air (OTA) configuration of PC5 parameters
from V2X application server to the V2X UE over V1 reference point.
This solution provides a mechanism to the option specified in 3GPP TS 23.285
[8] for provisioning the PC5 parameters to the V2X UE via V1 reference point.
## 7.7 Solution #7: Network situation and QoS monitoring
### 7.7.1 Solution description
#### 7.7.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 2. The VAE server shall support
monitoring of 3GPP systems\' network situation for V2X services (on top of the
monitoring events proposed in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12]):
\- The VAE server should receive and process access network-related monitoring
events/reports from 3GPP network system. The AN-related monitoring
events/report may include RAN-related resource/traffic situation statistics
and context to perform granular resource and QoS management.
\- The VAE server should be able to initiate monitoring of the QoS for single
or aggregately for groups of vehicles (supporting a V2X service and being in
proximity) having ongoing sessions.
Editor\'s note: The role of V2X UE in providing the information related to
monitoring events to the VAE server is FFS.
#### 7.7.1.2 Network situation and QoS monitoring events
Table 7.7.1.2-1 describes the list of network situation and QoS monitoring
events relevant for V2X applications. The information for \"Involved EPS
entity\" and \"Involved 5GS entity\" represents the current status of support
for the monitoring events to the V2X application layer. If the monitoring
events are currently supported, the entities involved in EPS and 5GS are
indicated in the table. If the monitoring events are currently not supported,
a note is captured to indicate that support may be required by the relevant
3GPP network system.

#### 7.7.1.3 Procedure for network situation and QoS monitoring
Figure 7.7.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure for network situation monitoring by
VAE server.
Figure 7.7.1.3-1: Network situation and QoS monitoring
1\. The VAE server sends a monitoring request to the underlying 3GPP network
system by including the V2X application information optionally the mobility
and location(s) information corresponding to one or many V2X UEs.
2\. The 3GPP network system provides a monitoring response to the VAE server
indicating the success or failure for initiating monitoring of network
situation and QoS for the requested information.
3\. The 3GPP network system monitors the network situation for the V2X
application and the V2X UEs.
NOTE: The details of how the 3GPP network system monitors the network
situation and determines the monitoring information is out of scope of the
present document.
#### 7.7.1.4 Procedure for network situation and QoS monitor reporting
Figure 7.7.1.4-1 illustrates the procedure for network situation monitor
reporting by VAE server.
Pre-condition:
\- The network situation and QoS monitoring has been initiated as specified in
subclause 7.7.1.2.
Figure 7.7.1.4-1: Network situation and QoS monitor reporting
1\. The 3GPP network system sends a monitoring report (event driven or based
on rules configured at the 3GPP network system) to the VAE server including
the RAN and core network information (e.g. resource availability, RAN failure,
RAN overload, Loss of connectivity, change in QoS level) with the
corresponding information for the V2X application, V2X UE or group of V2X UEs.
Editor\'s note: Whether and how the monitoring information is provided to the
V2X application specific server by VAE server is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The granularity of monitoring report provided to VAE server is
FFS.
### 7.7.2 Solution evaluation
This is a viable technical solution and addresses key issue 2 for VAE server
to support monitoring of 3GPP systems\' network situation for V2X services.
The VAE server communicates with 3GPP EPS and 3GPP 5GS for monitoring the
network situation.
The list of monitoring events specified in subclause 7.7.1.2 are not
exhaustive. The support for these monitoring events by 3GPP EPS and 3GPP 5GS
are responsibility of SA2.
The aspect of communicating the change of LoA to the V2X UE is out of scope of
the present document.
## 7.8 Solution #8: V2X USD provisioning using SACH
### 7.8.1 Solution description
#### 7.8.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 15. The V2X application server can
provision the V2X USD information to V2X UE using MBMS. The current solution
proposes to use the Service Announcement Channel (SACH) as defined in 3GPP TS
26.346 [18] Annex L.2 / L.3.
7.8.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.8.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for provisioning V2X USD to the V2X
UE.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The V2X UE includes an MBMS client as defined in 3GPP TS 26.347 [19].
2\. The VAE client is aware about usage of MBMS and can receive service
announcement via SACH.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the VAE server informs the client about MBMS
usage.
Figure 7.8.1.2-1: V2X USD provisioning using SACH
1\. The VAE server desires to send data over MBMS. It triggers the creation of
an MBMS service from the V2X application enabling server and the BM-SC.
2\. The BM-SC sends the V2X USD information using the Service Announcement
Channel (SACH) to the VAE client. The V2X USD information consists of
serviceIds, TMGI, list of SAIs, frequency and SDP information for V2X
applications\' communication using MBMS. Each USD is uniquely identified by
the serviceId. The V2X USD can include USDs which are identified by their
serviceIds.
3\. Upon receiving the V2X USD announcement, the VAE client stores the
received V2X USD. Note, the VAE client may have stored already several other
USDs.
### 7.8.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the V2X application server to provision the V2X USDs to
the V2X UE. Either the full USD or a handle for the USD (i.e. a serviceId) is
sent using MBMS SACH.
## 7.9 Solution #9: Abstraction of network QoS aspects for V2X communications
### 7.9.1 Solution description
#### 7.9.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to the key issue 1a. The VAE server abstracts from
the V2X application specific server the details of network QoS information and
stores the mapping information of the LoA and network QoS information to
enable communication of appropriate network QoS requirements with the
underlying 3GPP network systems.
The VAE server communicates with SCEF or PCEF in EPS and NEF or PCF in 5GS for
network QoS aspects.
#### 7.9.1.2 Procedure
The solution is described in the high-level procedure illustrated in figure
7.9.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has the mapping relationship of LoA information and network
QoS information (QCIs) corresponding to the V2X services.
2\. The network situation and QoS monitoring procedure specified in subclause
7.7.1.3 has been initiated by VAE server.
Figure 7.9.1.2-1: Abstraction of network QoS aspects for V2X communications
0\. The network situation and QoS monitor reporting is performed as specified
in subclause 7.7.1.4.
Editor\'s note: How the SA2 work on eV2X impacts this solution is FFS.
1\. The VAE server sends a monitoring report to the V2X application specific
server which has impact on the V2X application provided by the V2X application
specific server which includes information related to the UEs identification
and the LoA levels that can be supported for the V2X application.
2\. Based on monitoring information received and other V2X application
context, a trigger for LoA change may be initiated at the V2X application
specific server.
3\. The V2X application specific server sends an LoA resource modification
request including the information of the V2X UE(s) or V2X application group
ID, the current operating LoA per UE and the target operating LoA per UE.
4\. The VAE server translates the service adaptation information to the
corresponding network QoS requirements based on the mapping information
applicable for one or more sessions involving one or more V2X UEs.
5\. The VAE server communicates with the appropriate entity (e.g. SCEF or
PCRF) of the underlying 3GPP network systems (EPS or 5GS) to modify the QoS
levels for the resources involved in the V2X communications with the
information of V2X UEs and the new QoS level per UE.
6\. The VAE server provides a LoA resource modification response to the V2X
application specific server.
7\. The VAE server notifies about the change of QoS related to the adapted LoA
to the VAE client of the V2X UEs.
8\. The 3GPP network system applies the PDN/PDU session modification on the
V2X UE(s).
### 7.9.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables VAE server to provide the abstraction of network aspects
for V2X communications and supports the translation of LoA resource
modification request to corresponding network QoS aspects and communicates
with the underlying 3GPP network system(s).
## 7.10 Solution #10: Communication of V2X application PC5 QoS requirements
with 3GPP systems
### 7.10.1 Solution description
#### 7.10.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 1b and describes the ProSe Per-Packet
Priority values to be applied for the multicast packets relayed to a UE over
PC5.
#### 7.10.1.2 ProSe Per-Packet Priority values
The needed quality of service (on a per message basis) as determined by the
V2X application (i.e. KPI) must be mapped to the available list of ProSe Per-
Packet Priority values.
#### 7.10.1.3 Procedure
VAE client includes ProSe Per-Packet Priority value corresponding to the V2X
application layer functional requirements, to be applied for the multicast
packets relayed to a UE over PC5.
### 7.10.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables QoS handling over PC5 according to application layer QoS
needs by selecting an appropriate ProSe Per-Packet Priority value.
## 7.11 Solution #11: Switching from MBMS delivery to unicast delivery
### 7.11.1 Solution description
This solution addresses scenario 2 and 3a as described in key issue 5 in
subclause 5.5. The V2X communication has to be switched to unicast for service
continuity when the V2X UE suffers from bad MBMS bearer condition. This
solution is similar to the procedure in subclause 10.7.3.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[7], which is currently used for mission critical service between UE and MC
service server.
Figure 7.11.1-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a V2X UE is
about to move out of MBMS coverage by switching from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that the MBMS bearer has been activated by V2X application
enabler server for downlink delivery.
Figure 7.11.1-1: Switching from MBMS delivery to unicast delivery
1\. The V2X UE detects that it suffers from bad MBMS bearer condition for the
corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is implementation specific.
2\. The VAE client notifies the VAE server that it suffers from bad MBMS
bearer condition for the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS
listening status report.
3\. The VAE server sends the downlink data by unicast delivery to the VAE
client.
NOTE: The unicast bearer may be set up on demand after step 2 or before.
4\. During the switching, the V2X UE simultaneously receives downlink data
through both unicast bearer and MBMS bearer. If there is no downlink data to
the VAE client, this step can be skipped.
5\. The V2X UE ceases to receive the downlink data through MBMS bearer but
continues receiving data through unicast bearer.
### 7.11.2 Solution evaluation
The solution allows the VAE client to report the MBMS listening status to the
VAE server to trigger the switching from multicast delivery to unicast
delivery. This solutions provides a mechanism to maintain the service
continuity in V2X communication with MBMS.
## 7.12 Solution #12: Supporting for V2X group communication
### 7.12.1 Solution description
#### 7.12.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 9 to support the V2X group communication
over ProSe. Each V2X application group has to be mapped to a ProSe Layer-2
group ID in order to avoid any interference during PC5 communications for the
V2X application groups. The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID is only used in PC5 V2X
group communication (without the involvement of the V2X application server).
In this solution, the V2X application group management (e.g. group creation,
membership management) is the responsibility of the V2X application specific
server. The V2X group information is provided to the VAE server. The VAE
server assigns a ProSe Layer-2 Group ID from the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID pool
to a V2X application group ID. The VAE server then delivers the assigment of
the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and the V2X application group ID to the VAE client.
#### 7.12.1.2 VAE server pushes ProSe group communication parameters procedure
The VAE server pushes the assignment of V2X application group IDs with ProSe
Layer 2 IDs to the UEs belonging to the same or different PLMNs.
The procedure for pushing V2X ProSe group communication parameters to VAE
client over V1 reference point is illustrated in figure 7.12.1.2-1.
Editor\'s note: Handling the case where the VAE clients in a single V2X
application group are from multiple VAE servers is FFS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. V2X application group information is available at the VAE server.
2\. VAE server has a pool of the ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs to be assigned.
3\. VAE server is able to provide to assignment to the VAE client from
multiple PLMNs.
NOTE 1: For a single V2X application group, only one single VAE server is
responsible for pushing the parameters for the V2X group communication over
ProSe.
NOTE 2: When a single V2X application specific server connects multiple VAE
servers, how to determine the VAE server for pushing the parameters for V2X
group communication over ProSe is implementation.
Figure 7.12.1.2-1: VAE server pushes the parameters for V2X group
communication over ProSe
1\. The VAE server assigns the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID to a V2X application
group ID when triggered by V2X application specific server.
2\. The VAE server pushes the mapping relationship of the ProSe Layer-2 Group
ID and V2X application group ID in a ProSe group parameters push request to
the VAE client(s) who are members of the V2X application group.
3\. The VAE client(s) provide an acknowledgement to the VAE server via a ProSe
group parameters push response.
### 7.12.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the VAE server to provision the ProSe parameters for V2X
group communication over ProSe to the V2X UE within the group members via V1
reference point. This solution requires the V2X application group related
information from V2X application specific server. This solution facilitates
the the V2X application specific server better use the ProSe feature for V2X
group communication.
## 7.13 Solution #13: Group communication parameters provisioning via V5
### 7.13.1 Solution description
#### 7.13.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 9 to support the V2X group communication
over ProSe. In this solution, an authorized V2X UE broadcasts the available
ProSe Layer-2 Group ID(s) being used for platooning and the related
destination information.
As a use case showing the value of this solution, in Figure 7.13.1.1-1, UE A
and UE B are going to destination A and destination B, respectively. To go
their destinations, they should pass by IC#12 on the highway. RSU as an
authorized V2X UE, sends platooning service information messages via PC5. The
destination Layer-2 ID of the message is pre-configured ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
for V2X platooning service. The vehicles who are authorized to use the V2X
platooning service can interpret the message. UE A and UE B determine to
select ProSe Layer2 Group ID which is mapped to IC#12 based upon the
platooning information broadcasted by the RSU.
Figure 7.13.1.1-1: RSU assisted dynamic platoon communication
#### 7.13.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.13.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for providing group information to
the V2X UE via V5-AE reference point.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAE client 1 (e.g. RSU) has been provisioned with the ProSe Layer-2
Group ID(s) assigned to group(s).
Figure 7.13.1.2-1: Group communication parameters provisioning via V5
1\. VAE client 1 (e.g. RSU) sends periodic group communication parameters
announcement message corresponding to each group over ProSe Layer-2 ID. This
message contains the PC5 parameters information as specified in subclause
4.4.1.1.2 in 3GPP TS 23.285 [8] and the relevant group selection criteria.
NOTE: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the VAE client
1\'s radio coverage) during the V5 group communication, the group
communication parameters announcement message is periodically sent.
2\. The VAE client 2 selects the appropriate ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
corresponding to its group needs.
### 7.13.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables an authorized V2X UE to broadcast the ProSe Layer-2
Group ID to be used for PC5 group communication and corresponding group
selection criteria information via V5 reference point.
## 7.14 Solution #14: Autonomous decision for assigning ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
### 7.14.1 Solution description
#### 7.14.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 9 to support the V2X group communication
over ProSe. In this solution, the UE is configured with rules to be able to
generate an appropriate ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for platooning by the V2X
Application Server. When the V2X client decides to start platooning, it
generates ProSe Layer-2 Group ID based on the configured rules corresponding
to V2X UE\'s destination.
Figure 7.14.1.1-1: Unassisted dynamic platoon communication
#### 7.14.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.14.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for generating a ProSe Layer-2
Group ID based on configured rules, by the V2X UE corresponding to a group
criteria.
Pre-condition:
\- VAE client 1, 2, 3, 4 have been provided with the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
generation rules.
Figure 7.14.1.2-1: Autonomous decision for assigning ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
1\. VAE clients 1, 2, 3, 4 generate ProSe Layer-2 Group ID independently based
on the provisioned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID(s) generation rules for its group
criteria.
NOTE: Ensuring that the ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs generated independently are
not clashing is out of scope of the present document.
2\. The VAE clients send communication only to the generated ProSe Layer-2
Group ID.
### 7.14.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a mechanism for VAE clients to autonomously generate
and assign ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for its group criteria. This solution
requires the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID generation rules to be provisioned in each
of the V2X UEs. Within the solution, how to avoid clashing of ProSe Layer-2
Group IDs generated independently is not detailed.
## 7.15 Solution #15: Support for uplink video streaming using FLUS framework
### 7.15.1 Solution description
#### 7.15.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue #11. Multiple V2X UEs are communicating
with a V2X application server for uplink streaming of captured videos. The
FLUS source and FLUS sink provide enabler functions as specified in 3GPP TS
26.238 [15] to support uplink video streaming. The VAE client and the VAE
server act as a FLUS source enabler function and a FLUS sink enabler function,
respectively.
#### 7.15.1.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. The V2X application specific client triggers the VAE client to start
sending video.
2\. The VAE client (FLUS source) is pre-provisioned with the URI of the VAE
server (FLUS sink) as specified in subclause 5.2.1.2 of 3GPP TS 26.238 [15].

UEs and V2X application server
1\. The VAE client creates a FLUS session (according to subclause 5.3.2 of
3GPP TS 26.238 [15]) with a VAE server. The session establishment is carried
over V1 reference point. The VAE server returns a session identifier for the
FLUS session.
2\. Once the session is established, the VAE client starts sending the
captured video to the VAE server.
3\. The VAE server may provide the received video for post-processing to the
V2X application specific server.
The VAE server may receive multiple videos from multiple FLUS sources via the
same procedure and may provide the received videos for post-processing.
### 7.15.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the uplink video streaming from multiple V2X UEs to a
V2X application server based on the FLUS framework. The solution provides a
framework for uplink video streaming which can be carried over HTTP, RTP, or
other protocol depending on the FLUS source and sink capabilities.
## 7.16 Solution #16: Communicating application requirements from the V2X
application server
### 7.16.1 Solution description
#### 7.16.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 13. The V2X application server provides
application and timing requirements to the 3GPP network system.
#### 7.16.1.2 Procedure for subscription to the 3GPP network system
Figure 7.16.1.2-1: Subscription for communicating application requirements
from the V2X application server
1\. The VAE server sends the subscription request message to the 3GPP network
system (e.g., PCF) in order to provide V2X application requirements to the
network and to receive related notifications.
2\. The 3GPP network system sends the subscription response message to the VAE
server with the result of the request.

requirements relevant to the service including amount of data to be
transferred, time window for transfers, key performance indicators affecting
application behaviour, time constraints for interaction with the network.
2\. The 3GPP network system provides a response to the VAE server indicating
whether the communicated requirements are supported by the network.
NOTE: The above procedure can be also used by the VAE server to update the
information related to an ongoing session.
#### 7.16.1.4 Procedure for notification generation
Figure 7.16.1.4-1: Notification for communicating application requirements
1\. The 3GPP network system takes into consideration the information received
from the VAE server according to the procedure specified in the subclause
7.16.1.3 and generates a notification. The notification includes information
comprising whether the application demand can/cannot be satisfied in a certain
time range. The notification might also include an updated list of application
demand supported by the network according to current or expected network
capabilities.
2\. The 3GPP network system provides a notification to the VAE server.
NOTE: The above procedure can be also used by the network to provide a new
notification, e.g., to notify an updated list of network capabilities.
### 7.16.2 Solution evaluation
The solution enables the VAE server to communicate application requirements to
the 3GPP network system. The solution provides the 3GPP network system with
application-specific information including timing information about the V2X
application which allows the 3GPP network to increase the level of knowledge
about the application requirements. This can be used to help the network
satisfy the application demands.

## 7.21 Solution #21: Resolving UE address for ETSI ITS facility layer
messages
### 7.21.1 Solution description
#### 7.21.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 18. The solution relies on the V2X UE
providing geographical location/area information to the VAE server. This
information is used by the VAE server to create a mapping between the
geographical location and the identification of the V2X UE. The solution
focuses on unicast scenarios.
#### 7.21.1.2 Procedure for tracking geographical location at the VAE server
Pre-conditions:
1\. The address of the VAE server is known to the VAE client; and
2\. The VAE client has established a relation with a specific geographical
area (e.g., by subscribing to a certain URL which corresponds to a
geographical area, or through a tile identifier that represents a certain
geographical area, or geo-fence tile identifier).
NOTE: How the VAE client retrieves the geographical area information (e.g.,
calculating locally at the client or through a geo-lookup) is for further
study.
Figure 7.21.1.2-1: Solution for tracking the client geographical area/location
at the VAE server
1\. The VAE client provides geographic location/area information (e.g.,
subscription URL, tile identifier) to the VAE server. Upon entering a new
geographical area, the client updates the geographic location/area information
by reporting a new tile identifier or subscribing to a new content URL or geo-
fence tile identifier.
2\. The VAE server considers the geographical area information (e.g.,
subscription URL or tile identifier or geo-fence tile identifier) with the
client identification information to create a mapping. Note that the
identification information of the client can be extracted from the
reporting/subscription message in step 1.
#### 7.21.1.3 Procedure for message delivery to target geographical locations
from the VAE server
Pre-condition:
\- The VAE server has created a mapping between geographical location/area
information and client identification.
Figure 7.21.1.3-1: Solution for delivering messages to target geographical
locations from the VAE server
1\. The application-specific server sends an ETSI ITS message (e.g., DENM,
CAM) with target geographical locations.
2\. The VAE server determines the client identification for the intended
clients in the target geographic locations using the mapping as specified in
subclause 7.21.1.2.
3\. The VAE server transmits the message to each VAE client using the client
identification.
4\. The VAE client provides the ETSI ITS message to the application-specific
client.
NOTE: The procedures for message delivery are not limited to ETSI ITS
messages.
### 7.21.2 Solution evaluation
This is a viable solution to enable unicast delivery of ETSI ITS facility
layer messages over 3GPP Uu. The solution is independent of the geographical
area identification (e.g., tile identifier or content subscription) and

### 7.22.2 Solution evaluation
The solution provides a generic mechanism at the VAE to support
interoperability between V2X application clients and V2X application services
supporting multiple capabilities. This solution enables the V2X applications
using the same version of ETSI ITS security protocol stack to communicate with
each other over the Uu interface.
## 7.23 Solution #23: Supporting V2X dynamic group communication over Uu
### 7.23.1 Solution description
#### 7.23.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 20 where enabling layer supports V2X UEs
in the Uu communication range, with application layer V2X dynamic group
formation and communication.
In this solution, the V2X application specific server is responsible for V2X
dynamic group formation (including information like group ID assignment, group
definition), membership management (e.g. user authorization), checking if
there is an existing dynamic group for the group definiton and delivery of
dynamic group communication over Uu interface. The VAE server is responsible
for assigning a ProSe Layer-2 Group ID from the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID pool
corresponding to the V2X application specific server provided dynamic group
formation and then delivering the assignment of the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and
the V2X dynamic group formation to the VAE client over V1 reference point.
VAE client may further broadcast the dynamic group formation including
corresponding ProSe Layer-2 Group ID to other VAE clients within the PC5
communication proximity, enabling more V2X UEs to join the dynamic group.
When there is loss of connectivity at the V2X UEs with the network, service
continuity is ensured by the V2X UEs switching to PC5 communication using the
VAE server assigned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID corresponding to the dynamic group
formation.
#### 7.23.1.2 VAE server configuring dynamic group parameters procedure
The VAE server pushes the assignment of V2X dynamic group IDs with ProSe Layer
2 IDs to the V2X UE, requesting to form dynamic group.
The procedure for pushing V2X ProSe dynamic group communication parameters to
VAE client over V1 reference point is illustrated in figure 7.23.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. V2X application dynamic group is defined at the V2X application specific
server with V2X UE 2 assigned as dynamic group leader; and
2\. VAE server has a pool of the ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs to be assigned.
Figure 7.23.1.2-1: VAE server configuring dynamic group parameters
1\. The V2X application specific server requests the VAE server to configure
dynamic group including dynamic group information (e.g. dynamic group ID, V2X
group member, group definition).
2\. To enable PC5 communication, the VAE server assigns ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
to the received dynamic group information from the available ProSe Layer-2
Group ID pool.
3\. The VAE server triggers a push request including PC5 parameters and
dynamic group information to the VAE client 2.
4\. The VAE client 2 stores the received dynamic group parameters from the VAE
server.
NOTE: The VAE client 2 can engage in the group communication over Uu
interface.
#### 7.23.1.3 Enabling V2X UEs to join V2X dynamic group procedure
The procedure for VAE client broadcasting the dynamic group formation to the
V2X UEs in the PC5 communication proximity is illustrated in figure
7.23.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The dynamic group parameters received from the VAE server are available at
VAE client 2 as per the procedure in subclause 7.23.1.2; and
2\. VAE client 1 is in PC5 communication proximity to VAE client 2 (dynamic
group leader) and is listening on a PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE
communications.
Figure 7.23.1.3-1: Enabling V2X UEs to join V2X dynamic group
1\. The VAE client 2 broadcasts PC5 parameters and the dynamic group
information using PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE communications and received
by the VAE client 1 which is in the PC5 communication proximity.
2\. The VAE client 1 stores the received PC5 parameters and the dynamic group
formation in the V2X UE 1.
3\. The V2X UE 1 may join the dynamic group and engage in the group
communication over Uu interface.
NOTE: The VAE client 1 can discard the received information in step 1, if the
V2X application specific client does not join the dynamic group.
#### 7.23.1.4 Switching from Uu to PC5 V2X communications controlled by UE
procedure
The procedure for V2X dynamic group communication switching from Uu
communication to PC5 communication is illustrated in figure 7.23.1.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. V2X dynamic group PC5 parameters are already configured on both the V2X
UEs, as per the procedures in subclause 7.23.1.2 or subclause 7.23.1.3; and
2\. V2X UE 1 and V2X UE2 are engaged in dynamic group communication over Uu
interface.
Figure 7.23.1.4-1: Switching from Uu to PC5 V2X communications controlled by
UE
1\. V2X UEs engaged in dynamic group communication over Uu interface, moved to
an area where they have lost connectivity with the network.
2\. The VAE UEs engaged in dynamic group communication switch to ProSe direct
communication using the PC5 parameters already configured for the dynamic
group.
3\. The V2X UEs continue their dynamic group communication over PC5 interface.
### 7.23.2 Solution evaluation
This solution supports the VAE server to configure dynamic group parameters
including PC5 parameters and dynamic group formation information corresponding
to the dynamic group created by the V2X application specific server. Further
this solution enables V2X UEs to join an existing V2X dynamic group. This
solution also supports V2X dynamic group communication by switching from Uu
communication to PC5 communication. Switching from PC5 to Uu V2X
communications controlled by UE procedure is required.
## 7.24 Solution #24: Supporting V2X dynamic group communication over PC5
### 7.24.1 Solution description
#### 7.24.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 20 where enabling layer supports V2X UEs
in the PC5 communication range, with application layer V2X dynamic group
formation and communication.
In this solution, the V2X application specific client is responsible for V2X
dynamic group information (including information like group ID assignment,
group definition) and checking if there is an existing dynamic group for the
group definition. VAE client may further broadcast the dynamic group formation
to other VAE clients within the PC5 communication proximity, enabling more V2X
UEs to join the dynamic group.
#### 7.24.1.2 Enabling dynamic group formation procedure
The procedure for enabling layer supporting V2X UEs in the PC5 communication
range, with the application layer V2X dynamic group formation and
communication is illustrated in figure 7.24.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. V2X UE 1 has received request to form a dynamic group; and
2\. VAE client 2 is in the PC5 communication proximity of VAE client 1 and is
listening on a PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE communications.
Figure 7.24.1.2-1: Enabling dynamic group formation procedure
1\. Each V2X UE is configured with unique pool of ProSe Layer 2 IDs, when they
are still in the coverage area of the VAE server.
2\. Uu connection is lost at the VAE client 1 and VAE client 2.
3\. Upon receiving a request from the application specific client to create a
dynamic group, the VAE client 1 assigns ProSe Layer-2 Group ID from the
available ProSe Layer-2 Group ID pool (obtained from step 1) corresponding to
the dynamic group formation information.
NOTE 1: If the dynamic group formation information matches with an existing
dynamic group, the VAE client 1 joins the corresponding dynamic group and does
not create a new dynamic group.
4\. The VAE client 1 triggers a broadcast request including PC5 parameters and
dynamic group formation information as per step 3, using PC5 channel dedicated
for V5-AE communications.
5\. Upon receiving the broadcast, the VAE client 2 stores the received PC5
parameters and the dynamic group formation information in the V2X UE.
NOTE 2: The VAE client 2 can discard the received information in step 5, if
the V2X application specific client does not join the dynamic group.
NOTE 3: The VAE client 2 receiving the PC5 parameters and the dynamic group
formation information can engage in the group communication over PC5
interface.
### 7.24.2 Solution evaluation
This solution supports the VAE client to form a dynamic group by assigning a
ProSe Layer-2 Group ID from the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID pool to the V2X user
provided dynamic group information.
## 7.25 Solution #25: Dynamic group management
### 7.25.1 Solution description
This solution addresses the dynamic group management in key issue 20. The VAE
capabilities provides support for dynamic group management (e.g. creation,
join, leave) based on the group configuration information (e.g. group join
policy, dynamic group leader) provided by the V2X application layer. The
decisions and corresponding triggers (e.g. group creation, join, leave) for
group management are responsibility of the V2X application layer and the
details of the group management are abstracted by the VAE capabilities. The
V2X application layer mainly focuses on group communication over the dynamic
groups.
#### 7.25.1.1 Group creation
Group creation support is provided for the V2X applications (e.g. platooning
and cooperative short distance grouping) to provide a dedicated group for the
V2X UEs to communicate with each other. The group creation supports group
without any group members to enable group member joining.
The procedure for group creation is illustrated in figure 7.25.1.1-1.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAE client 1 has received a trigger for group creation from the V2X
application specific client 1.
Figure 7.25.1.1-1: Group creation
1\. The VAE client 1 sends group creation request to the VAE server.
2\. The VAE server checks whether VAE client 1 is authorized. If authorized,
the VAE server checks the group policy (e.g. limit for the maximum number of
members allowed for the group if a VAE client list is included in step 1,
limit for maximum number of groups that the VAE client 1 can create). If
allowed, the VAE server allocates a unique group identity, creates and stores
the information of the group including the group member if included, the
dynamic group leader information, the group join policy, the associated ProSe
layer-2 group identity used for ProSe direct communication within the group.
3\. The VAE server sends the group creation response to the VAE client 1 with
the group information and the associated ProSe layer-2 group identity. The VAE
server provides the group information (e.g. group identity) to the
corresponding V2X application specific server. Upon receiving the group
information from the VAE server, the VAE client provides the group information
to the corresponding V2X application specific client.
4\. If VAE clients (group member) information is available, the VAE server
sends the group creation notify to the VAE clients (group members).
#### 7.25.1.2 Group join controlled by the VAE server
The procedure for group joining controlled by the VAE server is illustrated in
figure 7.25.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has the group information and broadcasts the group
information to the geographical areas where it is relevant;
2\. The VAE client 1 has discovered the group information from the VAE server
and provided to the V2X application client 1; and
3\. The VAE client 2 is the dynamic group leader.
Figure 7.25.1.2-1: Group join controlled by the VAE server
1\. When triggered by the V2X application specific client 1 to join a group,
the VAE client 1 sends group join request to the VAE server.
2\. The VAE server checks group join policy including the limit for the
maximum number of members allowed for the group.
3\. If confirmation by dynamic group leader is required, the VAE server gets
the group joining confirmation from the VAE client 2 (dynamic group leader).
4\. If the VAE client 1 satisfies the group join policy, the VAE server adds
the requesting VAE client 1 to the group and updates the group information.
5\. The VAE server sends the group join response to the VAE client 1 with the
group information and the associated ProSe layer-2 group identity.
6\. The VAE clients of the group are notified about the joining of the VAE
client 1.
#### 7.25.1.3 Group join over PC5 controlled by the authorized VAE client
The procedure for group joining over PC5 controlled by the authorized VAE
client is illustrated in figure 7.25.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has the group information and broadcasts the group
information to the geographical areas where it is relevant along with the
dynamic group leader information;
2\. The VAE client 1 has discovered the group information from the VAE server;
and
3\. The VAE client 2 is the dynamic group leader and can operate both on Uu
and PC5.
Figure 7.25.1.3-1 Group join over PC5 controlled by the authorized VAE client
1\. When triggered by the V2X application specific client 1 to join a group,
the VAE client 1 sends group join request to the VAE client 2 (dynamic group
leader) over PC5.
2\. The VAE client 2 checks the group join policy including the limit for the
maximum number of members allowed for the group.
3\. If allowed, the VAE client 2 adds the requesting VAE client 1 to the group
and updates the group information.
4\. Other VAE clients of the group are notified about the joining of the VAE
client 1.
5\. The VAE client 2 sends the group join response to the VAE client 1 with
the group information and the associated ProSe layer-2 group identity.
6\. The VAE client 2 sends the group update notify to the VAE server.
### 7.25.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the dynamic group management support for the V2X
applications (e.g. platooning) to allow the V2X application layer to create
and join the groups. The V2X applications can initiate group communications
using the group identity while all the dynamic group management aspects are
abstracted and controlled by the VAE client and the VAE server.
## 7.26 Solution #26: Abstraction and control of network slice instance for
V2X communications
### 7.26.1 Solution description
#### 7.26.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 21. The VAE capabilities abstracts the
network slice information and its usage from the V2X applications. In this
solution, LoA is an example and this procedure can be used for application
triggers requiring resource modification.
A resource modification request for the LoA (e.g. triggered by V2X UE or by
V2X application specific server) may trigger adjustment of the network
resources (impacting network slice) for the affected V2X UEs corresponding to
the V2X service. The result may be dynamic modification of resources of the
network slice instance (scale in/out, resource management policies) if this
change affects multiple V2X UEs.
The VAE Server has the capability to translate the information related to the
LoA for which resource modification is requested to appropriate network
resource adjustment information for the network slice instance and to further
communicate with the control plane of the 5GS (via NEF) for adjusting network
slice instance parameters.
#### 7.26.1.2 Procedure
The solution is described in the high-level procedure illustrated in figure
7.26.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has the mapping relationship of LoA information and network
slice instance information corresponding to the V2X services and the VAE
server has provided this mapping relationship information to the VAE client;
2\. The UE is connected to a network slice (assuming URLLC slice type), and is
mapped to a Network Slice Instance by the 5G system;
3\. V2X UE is attached to a network slice instance using the communication
procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [11], subclause 5.15.1; and
4\. The VAE server receives periodically network and QoS monitoring as
specified in subclause 7.7.1.4, which includes network slice analytics and
performance monitoring information (e.g. slice congestion, load).
Figure 7.26.1.2-1: Abstraction and control of network slice instance for V2X
communications
1\. The VAE server sends periodic monitoring information of actual and
predicted network metrics (e.g. delay, error rate) to VAE client to ensure up-
to-date network resource situation.
2\. The V2X application layer at the V2X UE triggers a resource modification
for the LoA based on the network metrics and V2X UE context information.
3\. The VAE client translates the information related to the LoA for which the
resource modification was requested to a network metric adjustment information
(e.g. change in bandwidth) and further sends a network resource adjustment
request to the VAE server.
4\. The VAE server communicates with the appropriate entity (e.g. NEF) of the
underlying 3GPP network system to modify the network slice instance parameters
and the resources involved in the V2X communications with the information of
affected V2X UEs.
NOTE: The details for interaction with the underlying network for network
slice resource modification is the responsibility of SA2.
5\. The VAE server provides a success or failure indication via the network
resource adjustment response to the VAE client
6\. If the network resource adjustment was successful, the V2X UE performs the
application layer adaptation corresponding to the resource modification for
the LoA in coordination with other affected V2X UEs with the support of the
V2X application specific server.
### 7.26.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables VAE server to abstract and control the network slice
instance aspects for V2X communications by supporting the translation of the
application requirements to the network slice requirements and communicating
with the underlying 3GPP network system(s). The details for interaction with
the underlying network for network slice resource modification is the
responsibility of SA2.
## 7.27 Solution #27: Switching the mode of operation for V2V communications
controlled by network
### 7.27.1 Solution description
#### 7.27.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to key issue 22. The V2X services need to support
different modes of operation for V2V (PC5 and Uu) communications. The V2X
application layer requires to control the operation modes selection
considering the V2V service KPIs as specified in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3].
The modes of operations can be configured based on network capabilities
information available at the V2X application layer, in order to ensure V2V
service KPI fulfilment in the following scenarios:
\- The VAE server triggers switching the user plane configuration from direct
(PC5) to in-direct (Uu) V2V, when the side-link conditions/QoS are expected to
downgrade for single or pre-defined group of V2X-UEs (e.g. based on
information from V2X UEs or from V2X application specific server).
\- The VAE server triggers switching the user plane configuration from
indirect (Uu) to direct (PC5) V2V, when the resource situation or network QoS
are expected to downgrade for single or pre-defined group of V2X-UEs (based on
the received monitoring events and/or network analytics).
#### 7.27.1.2 Switching from Direct (PC5) to Indirect (Uu) V2V communications
Figure 7.27.1.2-1 illustrates the solution where the V2V communications are
switched from direct (PC5) to indirect (Uu) mode.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The network situation and QoS monitoring procedure specified in subclause
7.7.1.3 has been initiated by VAE server and the network situation and QoS
monitor reporting (e.g. congestion, load) is performed as specified in
subclause 7.7.1.4;
2\. The VAE server is provided with the KPI information for the V2V services;
and
3\. V2X UE 1 and V2X UE2 are engaged in direct (PC5) V2V session.
Figure 7.27.1.2-1: Switching from direct (PC5) to indirect (Uu) V2V
communications
1\. The V2X UEs periodically provide PC5 monitoring reports to the VAE server
which includes information of the V2V service KPIs as received by the V2X UEs.
2\. The VAE server monitors the PC5 conditions corresponding to the direct V2V
session(s) and further decides to switch the mode of operation from direct
(PC5) to indirect (Uu) for the on-going V2V session(s), if the KPIs for the
V2V service communication are degraded.
3\. The VAE server communicates with the appropriate entity (e.g. SCEF or NEF)
of the underlying 3GPP network systems (EPS or 5GS) to establish indirect (Uu)
V2V connectivity (PDN/PDU session and user plane path) with the information of
V2X UEs and the new mode of operation.
4\. The VAE server notifies about the change of mode of operation (PC5 to Uu)
to the affected V2X UEs.
5\. The VAE server notifies about the change of mode of operation (PC5 to Uu)
to the V2X application specific server with the information of the V2X UEs and
the V2V service.
6\. The 3GPP network system applies the PDN/PDU session establishment on the
V2X UEs.
#### 7.27.1.3 Switching from Indirect (Uu) to Direct (PC5) V2V communications
Figure 7.27.1.3-1 illustrates the solution where the V2V communications are
switched from indirect (Uu) to direct (PC5) mode.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The network situation and QoS monitoring procedure specified in subclause
7.7.1.3 has been initiated by VAE server and the network situation and per UE
or UEs QoS monitor reporting is performed as specified in subclause 7.7.1.4;
2\. The VAE server is provided with the KPI information for the V2V services;
and
3\. V2X UE 1 and V2X UE2 are engaged in indirect (Uu) V2V session.
Figure 7.27.1.3-1: Switching from indirect (Uu) to direct (PC5) V2V
communications
1\. Based on monitoring information available at the VAE server about the on-
going V2V session(s), the VAE server estimates a QoS downgrade for the V2V
indirect communication (e.g. uplink or downlink link degradations,
congestions, overload) and decides to switch the mode of operation from
indirect (Uu) to direct (PC5) for the V2V session(s).
2\. The VAE server sends a change mode of operation request to the affected
V2X UEs with the PC5 provisioning parameters.
3\. Upon receiving the request from the VAE server, the V2X UEs performs
discovery and authentication of the V2V communication. If the V2X UEs have
already established PC5 control signaling (PC5-C), the PC5 needs to be
modified using PC5-C to support direct data plane traffic exchange.
NOTE 1: If the PC5 session establishment cannot be performed (e.g. due to
unavailability, failure to meet requirements by side-link); the indirect (Uu)
V2V session continues till the V2X application layer decides the Level of
Automation (LoA) change to adapt the QoS requirements for the service (see
solution to key issue 1 specified in subclause 7.9.1).
4\. The involved V2X UEs send a change mode of operation response to the VAE
server indicating success or failure of the direct V2V session establishment.
NOTE 2: If the V2X UE sends an acknowledgement message upon receiving the
change mode of operation request, then at step 4, the V2X UE sends the change
mode of operation response as a notification message.
5\. The VAE server communicates with the appropriate entity (e.g. SCEF or NEF)
of the underlying 3GPP network systems (EPS or 5GS) to release the indirect
V2V session (PDN/PDU session) with the information of V2X UEs and the new mode
of operation.
6\. The VAE server notifies about the change of mode of operation (Uu to PC5)
to the V2X application specific server with the information of the V2X UEs and
the V2V service.
### 7.27.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses key issue 22 and provides mechanisms where the VAE
server switches the modes of operation for the V2V sessions over indirect (Uu)
or direct (PC5) communications based on monitoring information.

Apart from the key issue 21, all the key issues are applicable for EPS. The
key issue 21 is only applicable for 5GS. As 5GS does not currently support
functionalities (e.g. ProSe, MBMS) required for V2X communications, several
key issues as listed in table 8.3-1 cannot be applicable for 5GS. Further
study is required to complete these solutions to be enabled over 5GS.
The key issues and solutions which are enabled over EPS shall be considered
for the normative phase.
# 9 Conclusions
This technical report fulfills the objectives of the study on application
layer support for V2X services enabled on 3GPP systems (EPS, 5GS), including
the following:
1) Identification of key issues (clause 5) and corresponding architecture
requirements (subclause 6.2) for V2X application enabler capabilities.
2) Analysis of existing V2X standardization activities (clause 4) related to
3GPP V2X service requirements, 3GPP EPS architecture for V2X communications,
ETSI ITS communication architecture and requirements and SAE and related
standards communication architecture and requirements.
3) Individual solutions (clause 7) addressing the key issues including the
solution for functional model for V2X application layer (subclause 7.1)
4) Overall evaluation (clause 8) of all the solutions
The results from the study will be considered for follow-up normative work in
Release 16 as follows:
1) The architecture requirements (in clause 6) will be considered as the basis
for technical specification with necessary enhancements and additions;
2) The solution for V2X application layer functional model (subclause 7.1)
will be used as the baseline functional model with necessary enhancements as
appropriate;
3) The key issues (clause 5) and individual solutions (clause 7) enabled over
EPS are considered to be the candidate solutions with necessary enhancements
as appropriate, according to the overall evaluation (clause 8) and the
functional model (subclause 7.1).
There are dependencies on 3GPP groups identified in the overall evaluation
(clause 8) which are required for fulfilling the solutions (clause 7).
