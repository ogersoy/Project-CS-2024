# 4 Architecture Model and Concepts
## 4.1 General Concept
The end-to-end communications, between the MTC Application in the UE and the
MTC Application in the external network, uses services provided by the 3GPP
system, and optionally services provided by a Services Capability Server
(SCS).
The MTC Application in the external network is typically hosted by an
Application Server (AS) and may make use of an SCS for additional value added
services. The 3GPP system provides transport, subscriber management and other
communication services including various architectural enhancements motivated
by, but not restricted to, MTC (e.g. control plane device triggering).
Different models are foreseen for machine type of traffic in what relates to
the communication between the AS and the 3GPP system (refer to Annex A) and
based on the provider of the SCS. The different architectural models that are
supported by the Architectural Reference Model in clause 4.2 include the
following:
\- Direct Model - The AS connects directly to the operator network in order to
perform direct user plane communications with the UE without the use of any
external SCS. The Application in the external network may make use of services
offered by the 3GPP system;
\- Indirect Model - The AS connects indirectly to the operator network through
the services of a SCS in order to utilize additional value added services for
MTC (e.g. control plane device triggering). The SCS is either:
\- MTC Service Provider controlled: The SCS is an entity that may include
value added services for MTC, performing user plane and/or control plane
communication with the UE. Tsp is regarded as an inter-domain interface for
control plane communication; or
\- 3GPP network operator controlled: The SCS is a mobile operator entity that
may include value added services for MTC and performs user plane and/or
control plane communication with the UE, making Tsp a control plane interface
internal to the PLMN;
\- Hybrid Model: The AS uses the direct model and indirect models
simultaneously in order to connect directly to the operator\'s network to
perform direct user plane communications with the UE while also using a SCS.
From the 3GPP network perspective, the direct user plane communication from
the AS and any value added control plane related communications from the SCS
are independent and have no correlation to each other even though they may be
servicing the same MTC Application hosted by the AS.
When using the hybrid model, the MTC Service provider controlled SCS, and the
3GPP operator controlled SCS may offer different capabilities to the MTC
Applications.
Since the different models are not mutually exclusive, but just complementary,
it is possible for a 3GPP operator to combine them for different applications.
This may include a combination of both MTC Service Provider and 3GPP network
operator controlled SCSs communicating with the same PLMN.
## 4.2 Architectural Reference Model
Figures 4.2-1a and 4.2-1b show the architecture for a UE used for MTC
connecting to the 3GPP network (UTRAN, E-UTRAN, GERAN, etc.) via the
Um/Uu/LTE-Uu interfaces. They also show the 3GPP network service capability
exposure to SCS and AS. The architecture covers the various architectural
models described in clause 4.1.
Figure 4.2-1a: 3GPP Architecture for Machine-Type Communication (non-roaming)
Figure 4.2-1b: 3GPP Architecture for Machine-Type Communication (Roaming)
Figure 4.2-2 shows the overall architecture for Service Capability Exposure
which enables the 3GPP network to securely expose its services and
capabilities provided by 3GPP network interfaces to external 3rd party service
provider SCS/AS hosting an Application(s).
Figure 4.2-2: 3GPP Architecture for Service Capability Exposure
Figure 4.2-3: 3GPP roaming Architecture for Service Capability Exposure
NOTE 1: Refer to TS 23.002 [5], TS 23.060 [6], TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.272 [11]
and TS 23.040 [12] for the details of 3GPP network-internal reference points
not specifically shown or labelled in figure 4.2-1a, figure 4.2-1b, figure
4.2-2, or described in this specification.
NOTE 2: The SCS is controlled by the operator of the HPLMN or by a MTC Service
Provider.
NOTE 3: In the non-roaming case, all 3GPP network entities providing
functionality for MTC are in the same PLMN. In the roaming case, 3GPP
architecture for MTC supports both the home routed (illustrated in Figures
4.2-1a and 4.2-1b) and the local-breakout roaming (not illustrated) scenarios.
For the home routed scenario, the MTC Server/Application User Plane
communication is routed through the HPLMN. In the local breakout scenario, the
User Plane communication is routed directly through the serving PLMN/VPLMN
over deployed GGSN/P-GW.
NOTE 4: Figure 4.2-2 does not include all the interfaces and network elements
that may be connected to SCEF.
NOTE 5: Figure 4.2-3 does not include all the interfaces and network elements
that may be connected to an Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF).
The SCS is an entity which connects to the 3GPP network to communicate with
UEs used for MTC and the MTC-IWF and/or SCEF in the HPLMN. The SCS offers
capabilities for use by one or multiple MTC Applications. A UE can host one or
multiple MTC Applications. The corresponding MTC Applications in the external
network are hosted on one or multiple ASs.
Tsms is the interface that encompasses all the various proprietary SMS-SC to
SME interface standards (see TR 23.039 [14]) and is outside the scope of 3GPP
specifications. Tsms can be used to send a trigger to a UE encapsulated in a
MT-SMS as an over-the-top application by any network entity (e.g. SCS) acting
as a SME. Tsp is a 3GPP standardized interface to facilitate value-added
services motivated by MTC (e.g. control plane device triggering) and provided
by a SCS.
T8 is the interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS. SCEF exposed network
services can be accessed by SCS/AS through APIs over T8 interface. In the
indirect model, the SCS and the Application Server hosting Application(s) can
be collocated.
For the roaming scenario, the MTC-IWF shall have the connection with HSS and
SMS-SC within the home network only as shown in the figure 4.2-1b.
The Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) is the key entity within the
3GPP architecture for service capability exposure that provides a means to
securely expose the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network
interfaces. In standalone MTC-IWF deployment, MTC-IWF functionality (e.g. T4
triggering) is made available to the SCS/AS via the Tsp interface. In certain
deployments, the MTC-IWF may be co-located with the SCEF in which case MTC-IWF
functionality is exposed to the SCS/AS via T8 interface (i.e. API). In
deployments where MTC-IWF is not co-located with SCEF, interactions between
MTC-IWF and SCEF are left up to the implementation.
The trust domain (see figure 4.2-2) cover entities that are protected by
adequate network domain security. The entities and interfaces within the trust
domain may all be within one operator\'s control, or some may be controlled by
a trusted business partner which has a trust relationship with the operator
e.g. another operator or a 3rd party. The security requirements for the trust
domain are out of scope of this specification.
When the SCEF belongs to a trusted business partner of the HPLMN, it is still
seen as an HPLMN entity by other HPLMN or VPLMN functional entities invoked by
the SCEF (e.g. HSS, MME).
Applications operating in the trust domain may require only a subset of
functionalities (e.g. authentication, authorization, etc.) provided by the
SCEF. Applications operating in the trust domain can also access network
entities (e.g. PCRF), wherever the required 3GPP interface(s) are made
available, directly without the need to go through the SCEF.
The Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF) is optional. When deployed, the IWK-SCEF is
located in the VPLMN as shown in the figure 4.2-1b.
## 4.3 Reference points

Identifiers(s) in the GGSN/PGW, the GGSN/PGW either queries a MTC AAA server
for retrieval of External Identifier(s) based on IMSI or routes
RADIUS/Diameter requests for AAA servers in external PDNs (as specified in TS
29.061 [8]) via a MTC AAA proxy.
### 4.4.5 SGSN/MME/MSC

needed;
\- deliver the SMS payload, Application Port ID, IMSI of the UE to MTC-IWF via
T4; and
\- send SMS delivery report to UE.
### 4.4.7 MTC AAA
To support translation of the IMSI to External Identifier(s) at the network
egress, an AAA function (MTC AAA) is used in the HPLMN. The MTC AAA may be
deployed to return the External Identifier(s) based on IMSI. Alternatively the
MTC AAA may be deployed as a RADIUS/Diameter proxy between the GGSN/PGW and
the AAA server in the external PDN.
When deployed as an AAA Server, the MTC AAA shall support the following
functionalities:
\- termination of the S6n reference point where the MTC-AAA communicates with
the HLR/HSS;
\- return the external identifier(s) corresponding to an IMSI; and
\- may query the HSS with IMSI to retrieve the External Identifier(s) and may
cache IMSI/External Identifier mapping to avoid multiple HSS queries.
When deployed as an AAA Proxy, the MTC AAA shall support the following
functionalities:
\- termination of the S6n reference point where the MTC-AAA communicates with
the HLR/HSS;
\- replace IMSI with an External Identifier for messages to an external AAA
server;
\- replace External Identifier with IMSI for messages from an external AAA
server;
\- identifying the destination external AAA server using standard
RADIUS/Diameter procedures; and
\- optionally, query the HSS with IMSI to retrieve the external identifier(s)
and cache IMSI/External Identifier mapping to avoid multiple HSS queries.
### 4.4.8 Service Capability Exposure Function
The Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) provides a means to securely
expose the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network interfaces. The
SCEF provides a means for the discovery of the exposed services and
capabilities. The SCEF provides access to network capabilities through
homogenous network application programming interfaces (e.g. Network APIs)
defined over T8 interface. The SCEF abstracts the services from the underlying
3GPP network interfaces and protocols.
Individual instances of SCEF may vary depending on what service capabilities
are exposed and what API features are supported.
The SCEF is always within the trust domain. An application can belong to the
trust domain or may lie outside the trust domain.
The SCEF may support CAPIF. When CAPIF is supported, the SCEF supports the
CAPIF API provider domain functions. The CAPIF and associated API provider
domain functions are specified in TS 23.222 [43].
The functionality of the SCEF may include the following:
\- Authentication and Authorization:
\- Identification of the API consumer,
\- Profile management,
\- ACL (access control list) management.
NOTE 1: The details of security aspects of T8 interface are outside the scope
of this specification.
\- Ability for the external entities to discover the exposed service
capabilities
\- Policy enforcement:
\- Infrastructural Policy: policies to protect platforms and network. An
example of which maybe ensuring that a service node such as SMS-SC is not
overloaded.
\- Business Policy: policies related to the specific functionalities exposed.
An example may be number portability, service routing, subscriber consent etc.
\- Application Layer Policy: policies that are primarily focused on message
payload or throughput provided by an application. An example may be
throttling.
\- Assurance:
\- Integration with O&M systems,
\- Assurance process related to usage of APIs.
\- Accounting for inter operator settlements.
NOTE 2: The details of accounting aspects of T8 interface are outside the
scope of this specification.
\- Access: issues related to external interconnection and point of contact
\- Abstraction: hides the underlying 3GPP network interfaces and protocols to
allow full network integration. The following functions are among those that
may be supported:
\- Underlying protocol connectivity, routing and traffic control,
\- Mapping specific APIs onto appropriate network interfaces,
\- Protocol translation.
NOTE 3: Abstraction is applied only in cases where required functionality is
not natively provided by 3GPP network
The services and capabilities offered by SCEF to SCS/AS include:
\- Group Message Delivery (see clause 4.5.5),
\- Monitoring events (see clause 4.5.6),
\- High latency communication (see clause 4.5.7),
\- Informing about potential network issues (see clause 4.5.8),
\- Resource management of background data transfer (see clause 4.5.9),
\- E-UTRAN network resource optimizations based on communication patterns
provided to the MME (see clause 4.5.10),
\- Support of setting up an AS session with required QoS (see clause 4.5.11),
\- Change the chargeable party at session set-up or during the session (see
clause 4.5.12),
\- Non-IP Data Delivery (see clause 4.5.14),
\- Packet Flow Description management (see clause 4.5.15),
\- Enhanced Coverage restriction control (see clause 4.5.17),
\- Network Parameter Configuration (see clause 4.5.20),
\- Accessing MTC-IWF Functionality via T8 (see clause 5.17),
The SCEF shall protect the other PLMN entities (e.g. HSS, MME) from requests
exceeding the permission arranged in the SLA with the third-party service
provider.
When needed, the SCEF supports mapping between information exchanged with
SCS/AS (e.g. geographical identifiers) and information exchanged with internal
PLMN functions (e.g. cell-Id / ENB-Id / TAI / MBMS SAI , etc.). This mapping
is assumed to be provided by the SCEF based on local configuration data.
### 4.4.9 Interworking SCEF
The Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF) is optional. When deployed, the IWK-SCEF is
located in the VPLMN for inter-connection with the SCEF of the HPLMN. The
Interworking SCEF receives the Monitoring Event Reports from the underlying
entities and sends them to the SCEF. The IWK-SCEF relays the non-IP data
between the MME/SGSN and the SCEF.
NOTE: In this release the only VPLMN network entities connected towards the
IWK-SCEF are the MMEs and SGSNs.
The functionality of the Interworking SCEF may include the following:
\- Normalization of reports according to roaming agreement between VPLMN and
HPLMN, e.g. change the location granularity (from cell level to a level
appropriate for the HPLMN) of Monitoring Event Reports received from the
underlying entities; and
\- Optionally, generate charging/accounting information:
\- For generation of charging/accounting information, the IWK-SCEF receives
the Monitoring configuration information as well as the Monitoring Event
Report from the underlying nodes;
\- For generation of charging/accounting information, the IWK-SCEF receives
the NIDD charging ID from the SCEF during the T6a/T6b Connection Establishment
Procedure (see clause 5.13.1.2),
### 4.4.10 RAN Congestion Awareness Function
A RCAF supporting network status reporting shall support the following
functionalities:
\- termination of the Ns reference point where SCEF connects to the RCAF;
\- request for one-time or continuous reporting of network status changes by
the SCEF; and
\- report of one-time or continuous network status changes to the SCEF.
### 4.4.11 Packet Flow Description Function
A Packet Flow Description Function (PFDF) shall support the following
functionalities:
\- Termination of the Nu reference point where SCEF connects to the PFDF;
\- Management of Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) (i.e. provision, modification
and removal) according to the instructions received from the SCS/AS via the
SCEF;
\- Provision of Packet Flow Description (PFDs) to the PCEF/TDF as specified in
TS 23.203 [27].
## 4.5 High Level Function
### 4.5.1 Device Triggering Function
Device Triggering is the means by which a SCS sends information to the UE via
the 3GPP network to trigger the UE to perform application specific actions
that include initiating communication with the SCS for the indirect model or
an AS in the network for the hybrid model. Device Triggering is required when
an IP address for the UE is not available or reachable by the SCS/AS.
Device trigger message contains information that allows the network to route
the message to the appropriate UE and the UE to route the message to the
appropriate application. The information destined to the application, along
with the information to route it, is referred to as the Trigger payload. The
UE needs to be able to distinguish an MT message carrying device triggering
information from any other type of messages.
NOTE: The Trigger payload, for example, upon the reception by the UE possibly
provides information to the application that may trigger application related
actions. The application in the UE may perform indicated actions, such as for
example to initiate immediate or later communication to the SCS/AS, based on
the information contained in the Trigger payload.
Device Triggering is subscription based. The subscription provides the
information whether a UE is allowed to be triggered by a specific SCS. When
device triggers are delivered via MT-SMS the serving nodes MME, SGSN and MSC
provide the service towards a specific UE based on the UE\'s subscription for
MT-SMS and other subscription parameters affecting MT-SMS service provision.
Device triggering recall/replace functionality allows a SCS to recall or
replace previously submitted trigger messages which are not yet delivered to
the UE.
Charging data are collected for the device triggering. The MTC-IWF generates
CDRs for the service requester. When device triggers are delivered via MT-SMS
then network entities, like MME, SGSN, MSC or SMS-SC generate CDRs for SMS
services provided for the mobile subscriber.
### 4.5.2 PS-only Service Provision
PS-only service provision is providing a UE with all subscribed services via
PS domain. PS-only service provision implies a subscription that allows only
for services exclusively provided by the PS domain, i.e. packet bearer
services and SMS services. The support of SMS services via PS domain NAS is a
network deployment option and may depend also on roaming agreements.
Therefore, a subscription intended for PS-only service provision may allow
also for SMS services via CS domain to provide a UE with SMS services in
situations when serving node or network don\'t support SMS via PS domain NAS.
The functionality that enables PS-only service provision is described in TS
23.060 [6] and TS 23.272 [11].
The functionality that enables PS-only service provision for SMS delivery in
IMS is described in TS 23.204 [13].
### 4.5.3 Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning
Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning aids the RAN in optimizing the
setting of RAN parameters. See TS 23.401 [7] for details.
### 4.5.4 UE Power Saving Mode
A UE may adopt the PSM for reducing its power consumption. That mode is
similar to power-off, but the UE remains registered with the network and there
is no need to re-attach or re-establish PDN connections. A UE in PSM is not
immediately reachable for mobile terminating services. A UE using PSM is
available for mobile terminating services during the time it is in connected
mode and for the period of an Active Time that is after the connected mode.
The connected mode is caused by a mobile originated event like data transfer
or signalling, e.g. after a periodic TAU/RAU procedure. PSM is therefore
intended for UEs that are expecting only infrequent mobile originating and
terminating services and that can accept a corresponding latency in the mobile
terminating communication.
For mobile terminated data while a UE is in PSM, the functions for High
latency communication may be used as described in clause 4.5.7.
PSM has no support in the CS domain on the network side. PSM should only be
used by UEs using the PS domain, SMS and mobile originated IMS or CS services.
A UE that uses mobile terminated CS services other than SMS should not use PSM
as the CS domain does not provide support for mobile terminated CS voice
services to UEs that are in PSM. A UE that uses delay tolerant mobile
terminated IMS services other than SMS should not request for PSM unless IMS
uses the functions for High latency communication as described in clause
4.5.7.
NOTE 1: The frequency of keep-alive messages on Gm impacts the possibility to
use IMS services for UEs applying PSM.
Applications that want to use the PSM need to consider specific handling of
mobile terminating services or data transfers. A network side application may
send an SMS or a device trigger to trigger an application on UE to initiate
communication with the SCS/AS, which is delivered when the UE becomes
reachable. Alternatively a network side application may request monitoring of
reachability for data to receive a notification when it is possible to send
downlink data immediately to the UE, which is when the UE becomes reachable
for downlink data transfer. Alternatively, if an SCS/AS has periodic downlink
data, it is more efficient when the UE initiates communication with the SCS/AS
to poll for downlink data with that period. For either of the options to work,
the UE should request an Active Time that is together with the time being in
connected mode long enough to allow for potential mobile terminated service or
data delivery, e.g. to deliver an SMS.
When the UE wants to use the PSM it shall request an Active Time value during
every Attach and TAU/RAU procedures. If the network supports PSM and accepts
that the UE uses PSM, the network confirms usage of PSM by allocating an
Active Time value to the UE. The network takes the UE requested value, the
Maximum Response Time (defined in clause 5.6.1.4), if provided with the Insert
Subscriber Data message from HSS, and any local MME/SGSN configuration into
account for determining the Active Time value that is allocated to the UE. If
the UE wants to change the Active Time value, e.g. when the conditions are
changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the value it wants in the
TAU/RAU procedure.
NOTE 2: The minimum recommended length for the Active Time is the time
allowing for the \'msg waiting flag\' in the MME/SGSN to trigger the SMSC via
the HSS to deliver an SMS to the MME/SGSN, e.g. 2 DRX cycles plus 10 seconds.
NOTE 3: The Maximum Response Time value can be configured as desired Active
Time value in the HSS via O&M.
An Active Time may be shorter than the time estimated for delivering a waiting
SMS to the UE in NOTE 2 above, e.g. 0 seconds. If the MME/SGSN allocates such
a shorter Active Time to the UE, the MME/SGSN (for signalling only connections
and if the \'msg waiting flag\' is set) and the RAN (for connections with
RAB(s) set up) should be configured to keep the connection with the UE
sufficiently long such that a waiting SMS can be delivered.
NOTE 4: The RAN configuration of RAB connection times need not differentiate
between UEs.
If the MME/SGSN is requested to monitor for Reachability for Data, the
MME/SGSN (for signalling only connections) and the RAN (for connections with
RAB(s) set up) should keep the connection for the Maximum Response Time less
the Active Time, if Maximum Response Time is provided with the Insert
Subscriber Data message from HSS. Otherwise a configured default Maximum
Response Time is assumed by the MME/SGSN.
The UE is in PSM until a mobile originated event (e.g. periodic RAU/TAU,
mobile originated data or detach) requires the UE to initiate any procedure
towards the network. In Attach and RAU/TAU procedures a PSM capable UE may
request a periodic TAU/RAU Timer value suitable for the latency/responsiveness
of the mobile terminated services. If the UE wants to change the periodic
TAU/RAU Timer value, e.g. when the conditions are changed in the UE, the UE
consequently requests the value it wants in the TAU/RAU procedure.
NOTE 5: If the UE or application performs any periodic uplink data transfer
with a periodicity similar to the Periodic TAU/RAU Timer value, it preferably
requests a Periodic TAU/RAU Timer value that is at least slightly larger than
the data transfer period to avoid periodic TAU/RAU procedures that would
increase power consumption.
Any timers and conditions that remain valid during power-off, e.g. NAS-level
back-off timers, apply in the same way during PSM. The UE may leave the PSM
any time, e.g. for mobile originated communications.
If the network confirms the usage of PSM to a UE, the network shall not
activate the ISR for such UE.
The specific procedure handling is described in TS 23.060 [6] and TS 23.401
[7].
### 4.5.5 Group Message Delivery
The Group Message Delivery feature allows an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a
group of UEs. Two methods of Group Message Delivery are specified:
\- Group Message Delivery via MBMS which is intended to efficiently distribute
the same content to the members of a group that are located in a particular
geographical area when MBMS is used;
\- Group Message Delivery via unicast MT NIDD for UEs which are part of the
same External Group Identifier.
The specific procedure handling for group message delivery using MBMS is
described in clause 5.5.1. The group message delivery using MBMS has limited
applicability and does not support all the scenarios, e.g. UEs not supporting
MBMS, UEs located in areas where MBMS is not deployed. The SCS/AS may recall
or replace a previously submitted MBMS message; this is described in clause
5.5.2.
The Group MT NIDD procedure for delivering non-IP data to a group via unicast
MT NIDD is described in clause 5.5.3. The SCEF uses the SCS/AS Identifier and
the External Group Identifier to determine the APN that will be used to send
the non-IP data to the group member UEs. This determination is based on local
policies. When the SCEF receives a Group MT NIDD request from the SCS/AS, the
SCEF queries the HSS to resolve the group members and forks the message by
sending it in a unicast manner to all of the individual UEs that are
associated with the External Group Identifier.
NOTE: In order for the non-IP data to reach each group member UE, each group
member UE must have a PDN connection established to the APN and the SCS/AS
must have performed an NIDD Configuration Procedure for the External Group
Identifier.
### 4.5.6 Monitoring Events
#### 4.5.6.1 General
The Monitoring Events feature is intended for monitoring of specific events in
3GPP system and making such monitoring events information available via the
SCEF. It is comprised of means that allow the identification of the 3GPP
network element suitable for configuring the specific events, the event
detection, and the event reporting to the authorised users, e.g. for use by
applications or logging, etc. If such an event is detected, the network might
be configured to perform special actions, e.g. limit the UE access.
Configuration and reporting of the following monitoring events may be
supported:
\- Monitoring the association of the UE and UICC and/or new IMSI-IMEI-SV
association;
\- UE reachability;
\- Location of the UE, and change in location of the UE;
NOTE 1: Location granularity for event request, or event report, or both could
be at cell level (CGI/ECGI), TA/RA level or other formats e.g. shapes (e.g.
polygons, circles, etc.) or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.).
\- Loss of connectivity;
\- Communication failure;
\- Roaming status (i.e. Roaming or No Roaming) of the UE, and change in
roaming status of the UE; and
NOTE 2: Roaming status means whether the UE is in HPLMN or VPLMN.
\- Number of UEs present in a geographical area; and
\- Availability after DDN failure.
To support monitoring features in roaming scenarios, a roaming agreement needs
to be made between the HPLMN and the VPLMN. The set of capabilities required
for monitoring may be accessible via different 3GPP interfaces/nodes.
Selection of 3GPP interface(s) to configure/report the event is dependent on
the type of the event, operator configuration, required frequency of event
reporting, application provided parameters in monitoring event request, etc.
Support for Monitoring Events can be offered either via HSS, MME/SGSN (as
described in clause 4.5.6.2) or via PCRF (as described in clause 4.5.6.3).
Based on operator policies, it shall be possible to configure Monitoring
Events such that some Monitoring Event follows procedures in clause 4.5.6.2
while another Monitoring Event follows procedures in clause 4.5.6.3. SCEF
shall not enable a given Monitoring Event for the same UE via both
HSS/MME/SGSN, and PCRF. For the case of group based Monitoring Events, the
SCS/AS (either the same SCS/AS or different SCSs/ASs) may configure a Monitor
Event with different External Group Identifiers. If, in such a case, more than
one External Group Identifier point to the same UE and no Group Reporting
Guard Time was provided with any of the monitoring event configurations, the
MME, HSS, and SCEF should not send duplicate reports of the same event for the
same UE to the same destination.
NOTE 3: If the configuration of Monitoring Events uses signalling which was
specified as part of another feature than the Monitoring feature, then the
requirements on the HSS, MME/SGSN and PCRF as specified by that feature apply
e.g. not to generate accounting information, not to verify SLA etc.
#### 4.5.6.2 Monitoring Events via HSS and MME/SGSN
Monitoring Events via the HSS and the MME/SGSN enables SCEF to configure a
given Monitor Event at HSS or MME/SGSN, and reporting of the event via HSS
and/or MME/SGSN. Depending on the specific monitoring event or information, it
is either the MME/SGSN or the HSS that is aware of the monitoring event or
information and makes it available via the SCEF.
The procedures for requesting specific monitoring information or event reports
as well as the report procedures are described in clause 5.6.
#### 4.5.6.3 Monitoring Events via PCRF
Monitoring Events via the PCRF enables the SCEF to retrieve the location
information and to report communication failure of a UE. When not performing
group monitoring, the SCEF acting as AF shall have an active Rx session to
enable the PCRF to report these events. The procedure is defined in TS 23.203
[27] clause 6.2.3. The procedure for requesting location information, when not
performing group monitoring, is described in clause 5.6.4.1.
The UE location information, provided over Rx, may include a time stamp to
indicate when the UE was last-known to be in that location, i.e. if the
current location or the last-known location is provided. The UE location
information is reported at the time the Rx session is established, modified or
terminated. The subscription to UE location information is not persistent
across Rx sessions. The UE location information is provided for 3GPP IP-CAN
type, for Trusted WLAN access (S2a) or untrusted WLAN (S2b) as defined in TS
23.203 [27] clause 6.2.3.
The reporting of communication failure refers to the reporting of RAN/NAS
release cause codes according to TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.060 [6], and TWAN/UWAN
release causes according to TS 23.402 [26]. Once the RAN/NAS or TWAN/UWAN
release cause codes are reported to the PCRF, the PCRF reports it to the SCEF
according to TS 23.203 [27] for applicable IP-CAN types and RAT types listed
in TS 23.203 [27].
Monitoring Events via the PCRF also enable the SCEF to request the location
information of a group of UEs via Nt interface.
The procedure for requesting monitoring of a group of UEs via the PCRF is
described in clause 5.6.4.1a. Group monitoring requests are sent by the SCEF
to each PCRF in the operator´s network.
NOTE: The existing PCRF addressing mechanism defined in TS 23.203 [27] does
not apply for requesting reporting events for a group of UEs.
The procedure for reporting the location information for a group of UEs is
performed for each UE that has an IP-CAN session established at the time the
SCEF requests the UE location for a group of UEs as described in clause
5.6.4.2.
The UE location information, provided over Nt, may include a time stamp to
indicate when the UE was last-known to be in that location, i.e. if the
current location or the last-known location is provided. The UE location
information is provided for 3GPP IP-CAN type, for Trusted WLAN access (S2a) or
untrusted WLAN (S2b).
#### 4.5.6.4 Void
### 4.5.7 High latency communication
Functions for High latency communication may be used to handle mobile
terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using power
saving functions e.g. UE Power Saving Mode (see clause 4.5.4) or extended idle
mode DRX (see clause 4.5.13) depending on operator configuration. \"High
latency\" refers to the initial response time before normal exchange of
packets is established. That is, the time it takes before a UE has woken up
from its power saving state and responded to the initial downlink packet(s).
High latency communication is handled by an extended buffering of downlink
data in the Serving GW controlled by the MME/S4-SGSN or in the Gn/Gp-SGSN. The
MME/S4-SGSN asks the Serving GW to buffer downlink data until the UE is
expected to wake up from its power saving state. The Gn/Gp-SGSN similarly
buffers downlink data until the UE is expected to wake up from its power
saving state. If a Serving GW change or a Gn/Gp-SGSN change is invoked, the
buffered packets are forwarded and will not be lost. The number of packets to
buffer is decided by the Serving GW or Gn/Gp-SGSN, but the MME/S4-SGSN may
optionally provide a suggestion for the number of downlink packets to be
buffered based on the information received from the HSS. The information
received from the HSS may be subscription based or may be based on information
provided by the SCS/AS during the configuration of the event, see clause
5.6.1.4.
For Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, High latency communication is handled
by the buffering of downlink data in the Serving GW or the MME as described in
TS 23.401 [7].
High latency communication may also be handled by notification procedures (see
clause 5.7), when an MME/S4-SGSN is used (i.e., this procedure does not apply
to a Gn/Gp-SGSN). The SCS/AS requests notification when a UE wakes up from its
power saving state and sends downlink data to the UE when the UE is reachable.
Especially for infrequent mobile terminated communication this may be
suitable. This notification procedure is available based on two different
monitoring events:
\- Monitoring event: UE Reachability; or
\- Monitoring event: Availability after DDN failure.
An SCS/AS may request a one-time \"UE Reachability\" notification when it
wants to send data to the UE. Alternatively the SCS/AS may request repeated
\"Availability after DDN failure\" notifications where each notification is
triggered by a DDN failure i.e. the SCS/AS sends a downlink packet which is
discarded by Serving GW but which triggers the MME/SGSN to send an event
notification to the SCS/AS next time the UE wakes up.
When requesting to be informed of either \"UE Reachability\" or \"Availability
after DDN failure\" notification for a UE for which PSM or extended idle mode
DRX is enabled, the SCS/AS may also request Idle Status Indication. If the HSS
and the MME/SGSN support Idle Status Indication, then when the UE transitions
into idle mode, the MME/SGSN includes the time at which the UE transitioned
into idle mode, the active time and the periodic TAU/RAU time granted to the
UE by the MME/SGSN in the notification towards the SCEF, the eDRX cycle length
and the Suggested number of downlink packets if a value was provided to the
S-GW.
The length of the power saving intervals used by the network decides the
maximum latency for a UE. An SCS/AS, which has a specific requirement on the
maximum latency for UEs it communicates with, may provide its maximum latency
requirement to the network. This is done either by interaction with the
application in the UE and setting of appropriate time values in the UE (e.g.
periodic RAU/TAU timer) for the Power Saving Mode, or by providing the maximum
latency at the configuration of the \"UE reachability\" monitoring event (if
used) (see clause 5.7).
The tools for High latency communication make the behaviour of the 3GPP
network predictable when sending mobile terminated data to UEs applying power
saving functions. The network will deliver downlink packets with high
reliability for both stationary and mobile UEs when the UE wakes up from its
power saving state. Therefore SCS/AS can adapt its retransmissions to reduce
the load on both the SCS/AS itself and the network.
### 4.5.8 Support of informing about potential network issues
The SCS/AS may request the SCEF for being notified about the network status in
a geographical area. The SCS/AS can request for a one-time reporting of
network status or a continuous reporting of network status changes.
### 4.5.9 Resource management of background data transfer
The 3rd party SCS/AS requests a time window and related conditions from the
SCEF for background data transfer to a set of UEs via the Nt interface. The
SCS/AS request shall contain the SCS/AS identifier, SCS/AS Reference ID, the
volume of data expected to be transferred per UE, the expected amount of UEs,
the desired time window and optionally, network area information. The SCEF
passes this information to a selected PCRF. The PCRF shall determine one or
more transfer policies each including a recommended time window for the data
transfer together with a maximum aggregated bitrate for the expected volume of
data and a reference to the applicable charging rate during the time window
and provide them to the SCEF together with a Reference ID. The SCEF shall
forward the Reference ID and the transfer policies to the 3rd party SCS/AS. If
more than one transfer policy was received, the 3rd party SCS/AS needs to
select one of them and inform the SCEF about the selected transfer policy
(which forwards it to the PCRF). If this is not done, none of the transfer
policies provided by the operator will be valid.
NOTE 1: The maximum aggregated bitrate (optionally provided in a transfer
policy) is not enforced in the network. The operator may apply offline CDRs
processing (e.g. combining the accounted volume of the involved UEs for the
time window) to determine whether the maximum aggregated bitrate for the set
of UEs was exceeded by the ASP and charge the excess traffic differently.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that the 3rd party SCS/AS is configured to understand
the reference to a charging rate based on the agreement with the operator.
After having negotiated the time window, the SCS/AS (acting as an AF), shall
provide the Reference ID to the PCRF for each UE individually together with
the SCS/AS session information via the Rx interface. Alternatively, the SCS/AS
activates the selected transfer policy via the SCEF, for each UE in the group,
by using the \"Set the chargeable party at session set-up\" or \"Change the
chargeable party during the session\" procedure from clauses 5.12.1 and 5.12.2
to provide the Reference ID to the same or different PCRF. The PCRF retrieves
the corresponding transfer policy from the SPR. The PCRF derives the PCC rules
for the background data transfer according to this transfer policy and
triggers PCC procedures according to TS 23.203 [27] to provide the respective
policing and charging information to the PCEF.
NOTE 3: The SCS/AS will typically request sponsored connectivity for the
background data transfer to individual UEs.
NOTE 4: A transfer policy is only valid until the end of its time window. The
removal of outdated transfer policies from the SPR is up to implementation.
NOTE 5: The SCS/AS can contact the PCRF directly or interact with the PCRF via
the SCEF.
### 4.5.10 E-UTRAN network resource optimizations based on communication
patterns provided to the MME
Predictable communication patterns (CP) of a UE may be provided by the
Application Server to the SCEF in order to enable network resource
optimizations for such UE(s). The SCEF filters the CP parameters and forwards
them to the HSS, which provides them to the MME. The MME may use the CP
parameters as input to derive the CN assisted eNodeB parameters as described
in TS 23.401 [7]. This feature is applicable to UEs served over the E-UTRAN
access.
### 4.5.11 Support of setting up an AS session with required QoS
The 3rd party SCS/AS may request that a data session to a UE that is served by
the 3rd party service provider (AS session) is set up with a specific QoS
(e.g. low latency or jitter) and priority handling. This functionality is
exposed via the SCEF towards the SCS/AS.
The SCS/AS can request the network to provide QoS for the AS session based on
the application and service requirements with the help of a QoS reference
parameter which refers to pre-defined QoS information.
NOTE 1: The pre-defined QoS information is part of the SLA between the
operator and the 3rd party SCS/AS.
When the SCEF receives the request from the SCS/AS to provide QoS for an AS
session, the SCEF acts as an AF per TS 23.203 [27] specifications and
transfers the request to provide QoS for an AS session to the PCRF via the Rx
interface.
NOTE 2: An SLA has to be in place defining the possible QoS levels and their
charging rates. For each of the possible pre-defined QoS information sets, the
PCRF needs to be configured with the corresponding QoS parameters and their
values as well as the appropriate Rating-Group (or receive this information
from the SPR).
NOTE 3: The QoS reference parameter is transferred by existing Rx parameters.
Before the QoS reference parameter is forwarded, the SCEF can perform a
mapping from the name space of the 3rd party AS to the name space of the
operator.
If the SCEF gets informed about bearer level events for the Rx session (e.g.
transmission resources are released/lost) the SCEF shall inform the SCS/AS
about it.
### 4.5.12 Change the chargeable party at session set-up or during the session
The SCS/AS may request the SCEF to start or stop sponsoring a data session for
a UE that is served by the 3rd party service provider (AS session), i.e. to
realize that either the 3rd party service provider is charged for the traffic
(start) or not (stop). The SCS/AS may request to be set as the chargeable
party, i.e. sponsoring the traffic, either at AS session set-up or to change
it during an ongoing AS session. The SCEF acts as an AF and existing
functionality defined in TS 23.203 [27] for sponsored data connectivity is
used to support this functionality. If the SCEF gets informed that the Rx
session terminates (e.g. due to a release of PDN connection) the SCEF shall
inform the SCS/AS about it and shall forward any accumulated usage report
received from the PCRF.
### 4.5.13 Extended idle mode DRX
#### 4.5.13.1 General
The UE and the network may negotiate over non-access stratum signaling the use
of extended idle mode DRX for reducing its power consumption, while being
available for mobile terminating data and/or network originated procedures
within a certain delay dependent on the DRX cycle value.
Applications that want to use extended idle mode DRX need to consider specific
handling of mobile terminating services or data transfers, and in particular
they need to consider the delay tolerance of mobile terminated data. A network
side application may send mobile terminated data, an SMS, or a device trigger,
and needs to be aware that extended idle mode DRX may be in place. A UE should
request for extended idle mode DRX only when all expected mobile terminating
communication is tolerant to delay.
A UE that uses mobile terminated CS services other than SMS should not request
for extended idle mode DRX as the CS domain does not provide support for
mobile terminated CS voice services to UEs that are in extended idle mode DRX.
A UE that uses delay tolerant mobile terminated IMS services other than SMS
should not request for extended idle mode DRX unless IMS uses the functions
for High latency communication as described in clause 4.5.7.
NOTE 1: The frequency of keep-alive messages on Gm impacts the possibility to
use IMS services for UEs applying extended idle mode DRX.
In order to negotiate the use of extended idle mode DRX, the UE requests
extended idle mode DRX parameters during attach procedure and RAU/TAU
procedure. The SGSN/MME may reject or accept the UE request for enabling
extended idle mode DRX. In case the SGSN/MME accepts the extended idle mode
DRX, the SGSN/MME based on operator policies and, if available, the extended
idle mode DRX cycle length value in the subscription data from the HSS, may
also provide different values of the extended idle mode DRX parameters than
what was requested by the UE. If the SGSN/MME accepts the use of extended idle
mode DRX, the UE applies extended idle mode DRX based on the received extended
idle mode DRX parameters. If the UE does not receive extended idle mode DRX
parameters in the relevant accept message because the SGSN/MME rejected its
request or because the request was received by SGSN/MME not supporting
extended idle mode DRX, the UE shall apply its regular discontinuous reception
as defined in TS 23.401 [7] clause 5.13.
NOTE 2: The extended idle mode DRX cycle length requested by UE takes into
account requirements of applications running on the UE. Subscription based
determination of eDRX cycle length can be used in those rare scenarios when
applications on UE cannot be modified to request appropriate extended idle
mode DRX cycle length. The network accepting extended DRX while providing an
extended idle mode DRX cycle length value longer than the one requested by the
UE, can adversely impact reachability requirements of applications running on
the UE.
The specific negotiation procedure handling is described in TS 23.060 [6] and
TS 23.401 [7].
If a UE requests via NAS both to enable PSM (requesting an active time and
possibly a periodic TAU timer) and extended idle mode DRX (with a specific
extended idle mode DRX cycle value), it is up to the SGSN/MME to decide
whether to:
1\. Enable only PSM, i.e. not accept the request for extended idle mode DRX.
2\. Enable only extended idle mode DRX, i.e. not accept the request for an
active time.
3\. Enable both PSM (i.e. provide an active time) and extended idle mode DRX
(i.e. provide an extended idle mode DRX parameters).
The decision between the three above, and which active time, periodic TAU
timer and/or extended idle mode DRX cycle value to provide to the UE, are
implementation dependent, based on local configuration, and possibly other
information available in the SGSN/MME. The method selected is then used until
the next Attach or RAU/TAU procedure is initiated, when a new decision may be
made. If both extended idle mode DRX and PSM are enabled, the extended idle
mode DRX cycle should be set in order to have multiple paging occasions while
the active timer is running.
NOTE 3: To maximize the power saving while in the extended idle mode DRX
cycle, the Periodic TAU timer needs to be longer than the extended idle mode
DRX cycle.
In the specific case when the PSM active time provided by the UE is greater
than the extended idle mode DRX cycle value provided by the UE, the SGSN/MME
may enable both PSM and extended idle mode DRX. This allows a UE to minimize
power consumption during the active time e.g. when the active time is slightly
longer than typical active time values for example in the order of several
minutes.
In case extended idle mode DRX is enabled, the network handles mobile
terminated data using high latency communication feature, according to clause
4.5.7, GTP-C retransmissions as described in TS 23.060 [6] and TS 23.401 [7],
and applies techniques to handle mobile terminated SMS according to TS 23.272
[11] and location services according to TS 23.271 [33].
#### 4.5.13.2 Paging for extended idle mode DRX in UTRAN
The procedure makes use of the regular DRX cycle mechanism for determination
of Paging Occasions (POs) (see TS 25.304 [34]) in conjunction with a new TeDRX
timer and a means to synchronize the start of the TeDRX timer with a time
reference referred to here as Tref. The TeDRX timer is set to the extended
Idle mode DRX cycle value negotiated earlier on NAS level. At TeDRX expiry
i.e. when the extended Idle mode DRX cycle elapses the UE monitors the network
for paging using regular DRX parameters.
CN and UE start the extended TeDRX timer at transmission and reception,
respectively, of the Attach Accept or RAU Accept message where the relevant
extended Idle mode DRX parameters are provided. In other words, Tref
corresponds in the CN to the instant when RAU Accept message is sent and in
the UE to the instant when the respective Accept message is received.
The TeDRX timer is maintained and used only when the Attach/RAU procedure was
successfully executed and independent of UE\'s PMM state, i.e. transitions
between Idle and Connected mode do not affect the TeDRX timer.
In order to improve paging reliability e.g. to avoid paging misses due to cell
reselection or due to imperfect synchronization of the Tref parameter in the
UE and the SGSN, a Paging Transmission Window Time (PTW) described by its
duration TPTW is introduced. During PTW the UE monitors the network for paging
when the extended Idle mode DRX cycle based on the extended Idle mode DRX
value expires. During the PTW there may be multiple opportunities to page the
UE which monitors the network for paging using regular DRX parameters.
Figure 4.5.13.2-1 The usage of PTW and independence of the extended Idle mode
DRX cycle from UE state
In reference to Figure 4.5.13.2-1, upon expiry of the TeDRX timer in the UE,
the UE monitors the network for paging for TPTW seconds. TDRX is the duration
of the regular DRX cycle.
The necessary information for applying the PTW is provided to the UE over NAS
when extended Idle mode DRX is negotiated.
In the case of a paging trigger received in the CN for a UE in PMM Idle state,
the CN forwards the paging message towards relevant RAN node(s) immediately if
the paging trigger was received within the PTW. Otherwise the CN forwards the
paging message shortly ahead of the beginning of the next PTW taking possible
imperfections in the synchronization between the CN and the UE into account.
#### 4.5.13.3 Paging for extended idle mode DRX in E-UTRAN
##### 4.5.13.3.0 General
For WB-E-UTRAN, the extended idle mode DRX value range will consist of values
starting from 5.12s (i.e. 5.12s, 10.24s, 20.48s, etc.) up to a maximum of
2621.44s (almost 44 min). For NB-IoT, the extended idle mode DRX value range
will start from 20.48s (i.e., 20.48s, 40.96s, 81.92, etc.) up to a maximum of
10485.76s (almost 3 hours) (see TS 36.304 [35]). The extended idle mode DRX
cycle length is negotiated via NAS signalling according to clause 4.5.13.1.
The MME includes the extended idle mode DRX cycle length for WB-E-UTRAN or NB-
IoT in paging message to assist the eNodeB in paging the UE.
NOTE: Heterogeneous support of extended idle mode DRX in tracking areas
assigned by MME in a TAI list can result in significant battery life reduction
in the UE as compared to homogeneous support by eNodeBs of extended idle mode
DRX.
For extended idle mode DRX cycle length of 5.12s, regular paging strategy as
defined in TS 23.401 [7] is used.
For extended idle mode DRX cycle length of 10.24s or longer, clauses
4.5.13.3.1, 4.5.13.3.2 and 4.5.13.3.3 apply.
##### 4.5.13.3.1 Hyper SFN, Paging Hyperframe and Paging Time Window length
A Hyper-SFN (H-SFN) frame structure is defined on top of the SFN used for
regular idle mode DRX. Each H-SFN value corresponds to a cycle of the legacy
SFN of 1024 radio frames, i.e. 10.24s. When extended idle mode DRX is enabled
for a UE, the UE is reachable for paging in specific Paging Hyperframes (PH),
which is a specific set of H-SFN values. The PH computation is a formula that
is function of the extended idle mode DRX cycle, and a UE specific identifier,
as described in TS 36.304 [35]. This value can be computed at all UEs and MMEs
without need for signalling. The MME includes the extended idle mode DRX cycle
length and the PTW length in paging message to assist the eNodeB in paging the
UE.
The MME also assigns a Paging Time Window length, and provides this value to
the UE during attach/TAU procedures together with the extended idle mode DRX
cycle length. The UE first paging occasion is within the Paging Hyperframe as
described in TS 36.304 [35]. The UE is assumed reachable for paging within the
Paging Time Window. The start and end of the Paging Time Window is described
in TS 36.304 [35]. After the Paging Time Window length, the MME considers the
UE unreachable for paging until the next Paging Hyperfame.
##### 4.5.13.3.2 Loose Hyper SFN synchronization
NOTE: This clause applies for extended DRX cycle lengths of 10.24s or longer.
In order for the UE to be paged at roughly similar time, the H-SFN of all
eNodeBs and MMEs should be loosely synchronized.
Each eNodeB and MME synchronizes internally the H-SFN counter so that the
start of H-SFN=0 coincides with the same a preconfigured time epoch. If
eNodeBs and MMEs use different epochs, e.g., due to the use of different time
references, the GPS time should be set as the baseline, and the eNodeBs and
MMEs synchronize the H-SFN counter based on the GPS epoch considering the time
offset between GPS epoch and other time-reference epoch a preconfigured time.
It is assumed that eNodeBs and MMEs are able to use the same H-SFN value with
accuracy in the order of legacy DRX cycle lengths, e.g. 1 to 2 seconds. There
is no need for synchronization at SFN level.
There is no signalling between network nodes required to achieve this level of
loose H-SFN synchronization.
##### 4.5.13.3.3 MME paging and paging retransmission strategy
NOTE: This clause applies for extended DRX cycle lengths of 10.24s or longer.
When the MME receives trigger for paging and the UE is reachable for paging,
the MME sends the paging request. If the UE is not reachable for paging, then
the MME pages the UE just before the next paging occasion.
The MME determines the Paging Time Window length based on paging
retransmission strategy, and uses it to execute the retransmission scheme.
If the UE is unreachable for paging, then MME may follow clause 4.5.7 \"High
latency communication\" for functionality related to Mobile Terminated
communication with high latency.
### 4.5.14 Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD)
#### 4.5.14.1 General
Functions for NIDD may be used to handle mobile originated (MO) and mobile
terminated (MT) communication with UEs, where the data used for the
communication is considered unstructured from the EPS standpoint (which we
refer to also as Non-IP). The support of Non-IP data is part of the CIoT EPS
optimizations. The Non-IP data delivery to SCS/AS is accomplished by one of
two mechanisms:
\- Delivery using SCEF;
\- Delivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel.
The delivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel is further described in
TS 23.401 [7].
NIDD via the SCEF is handled using a PDN connection to the SCEF. The UE may
obtain a Non-IP PDN connection to the SCEF either during the Attach procedure
(see TS 23.401 [7] clause 5.3.2.1) or via UE requested PDN connectivity (see
TS 23.401 [7] clause 5.10.2) or via PDP Context Activation Procedure (see TS
23.060 [6] clause 9.2.2.1).
NOTE 1: The UE is not made aware that a particular Non-IP PDN connection is
provided via SCEF or via PGW. However, the network informs the UE whether a
particular Non-IP PDN connection uses Control plane CIoT Optimization (see TS
23.401 [7]).
An association between the SCS/AS and a PDN Connection to the SCEF needs to be
established to enable transfer of non-IP data between the UE and the SCS/AS.
When the Reliable Data Service is not enabled, the SCEF determines the
association based on provisioned policies that may be used to map an SCS/AS
identity and User identity to an APN. When the Reliable Data Service is
enabled, the SCEF determines the association based on port numbers and
provisioned policies that may be used to map SCS/AS identities and User
identity to an APN (see clause 4.5.14.3).
NOTE 2: When more than one SCS/AS is associated with the same PDN Connection,
it is permissible for packets to or from one port number to be associated with
more than one SCS/AS. Also, any polices that are applied to the PDN Connection
(e.g. APN Rate Control), apply to traffic from all of the SCS/AS\'s that are
associated with the PDN Connection.
NIDD via SCEF uses the User Identity, APN, and the SCS/AS identity to identify
which UE a particular T6a/T6b connection belongs to. The User Identity is the
user\'s IMSI. The user\'s IMSI shall not be used on the interface between SCEF
and SCS/AS. In order to perform NIDD configuration or to send or receive NIDD
data, the SCS/AS shall use MSISDN or External Identifier to identify the user.
In order to facilitate correlation of SCS/AS requests to T6a/T6b connection
for a given UE, the HSS provides to the SCEF (see NIDD Configuration procedure
in clause 5.13.2) the user\'s IMSI, and if available, the MSISDN (when NIDD
Configuration Request contains an External Identifier) or if available,
External Identifier (when NIDD Configuration Request contains an MSISDN).
Depending on operator configuration, the SCEF may perform buffering of MO
and/or MT Non-IP data. In this release of specification, neither the MME/SGSN
nor the IWK-SCEF are expecting to buffer data pertinent to PDN connection to
the SCEF.
The Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) may be used to transfer parameters
between the UE and SCEF (e.g. maximum packet size). The PCO\'s information
shall be passed transparently through the MME/SGSN. As specified in TS 23.401
[7] and TS 23.060 [6], the PCO is sent in the EPS Session Management
signalling between UE and MME and in GPRS Session Management signalling
between UE and SGSN.
The SCEF applies rate control as described in TS 23.401 [7] clause 4.7.7.
#### 4.5.14.2 Enhancements for reliable delivery of NIDD
To ensure reliable delivery of Non-IP data (NIDD) between UE and SCEF using
the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization, the following functions may be
supported by the 3GPP system:
\- Reliable delivery by acknowledgements on a hop-by-hop basis, i.e. the link
layer protocol on each interface used for NIDD uses acknowledgments and nodes
apply retransmissions if needed to ensure reliable delivery.
\- The UE may retransmit UL data that was not acknowledged by the RLC on the
AS layer in the UE;
\- The MME may retransmit DL data for which it got a non-delivery indication
from the eNodeB (see e.g. TS 23.401 [7], clause 5.3.4B.3, step 15);
\- The MME indicates to the SCEF the status of the DL data delivery. The SCEF
may forward this status to the AS;
\- Disabling/enabling of MME retransmission is handled by a subscription
parameter \'Acknowledgements of downlink NAS data PDUs\'.
#### 4.5.14.3 Reliable Data Service
The Reliable Data Service may be used by the UE and SCEF or P-GW when using
PDN Connection of PDN Type \'Non-IP\'. The service provides a mechanism for
the SCEF or P-GW to determine if the data was successfully delivered to the UE
and for UE to determine if the data was successfully delivered to the SCEF.
When a requested acknowledgement is not received, the Reliable Data Service
retransmits the packet. The service is enabled or disabled based on APN
Configuration per SLA.
When the service is enabled, a protocol is used between the end-points of the
Non-IP PDN Connection. The protocol uses a packet header to identify if the
packet requires no acknowledgement, requires an acknowledgement, or is an
acknowledgment and to allow detection and elimination of duplicate PDUs at the
receiving endpoint. Port Numbers in the header are used to identify the
application on the originator and to identify the application on the receiver.
The UE indicates its capability of supporting Reliable Data Service in the
Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) to the SCEF or P-GW. If SCEF or P-GW
supports and accepts Reliable Data Service then it indicates to the UE, in the
PCO, that the Reliable Data Service shall be used if enabled in the APN
configuration.
In order to prevent situations where a Reliable Data Service instance needs to
interface to both the user and control plane, the Reliable Data Service may
only be used with PDN connections for which the \"Control Plane Only\"
indicator is set or with PDN connections using the Control Plane EPS CIoT
Optimization when the MME does not move PDN connections to the user plane. The
Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization is defined in TS 23.401 [7].
### 4.5.15 Support of PFD management via SCEF
The PFDs may be managed by the 3rd party SCS/AS via the SCEF, which ensures
the secure access to the operator\'s network even from the 3rd party SCS/AS in
untrusted domain. The 3rd party SCS/AS may request to create, update or remove
PFDs in the PFDF via the SCEF.
The specific procedure for PFD management via SCEF is described in clause
5.14.1.
### 4.5.16 MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4
MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 is subscription based. The subscription provides the
information whether a UE is allowed to originate MSISDN-less MO-SMS. Support
for subscription without MSISDN is defined in TS 23.012 [36].
The UE is pre-configured with the Service Centre address that points to SMS-SC
that performs this MO-SMS delivery via MTC-IWF delivery procedure. The
recipient of this short message is set to the pre-configured address of the
SCS/AS (i.e. Address of the destination SME). If UE has multiple external IDs
associated to the same IMSI, the external ID that is associated with an SMS
may be determined from the UE\'s IMSI and the Application Port ID value in the
TP-User-Data field (see TS 23.040 [12]). The MTC-IWF may obtain the external-
ID by querying the HSS with the IMSI and application port ID via S6m.
UE is aware whether the MO-SMS delivery status (success or fail) based on the
SMS delivery report from SMS-SC. The network does not perform any storing and
forwarding functionality for MO-SMS.
NOTE: This way of communicating small data is considered an intermediate
method that will eventually be replaced by Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD)
procedures.
### 4.5.17 Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF
Restriction of use of the Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 23.060 [6] and
TS 23.401 [7]
The support for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF enables 3rd
party service providers to query status of, enhanced coverage restriction or
enable/disable enhanced coverage restriction per individual UEs. The specific
procedure for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF is described in
clause 5.16.
### 4.5.18 MBMS user service for UEs using power saving functions
MBMS Bearer Services as defined in TS 23.246 [29] together with MBMS User
Services defined in TS 26.346 [38], or MBMS Bearer Services accessed via the
MB2 interface defined in TS 23.468 [30], provide means to deliver data or
triggering payload over broadcast to multiple UEs at the same time. However,
for devices using power saving functions, e.g. Power Saving Mode (defined in
clause 4.5.4) or extended idle mode DRX (defined in clause 4.5.13), the UEs
are usually unreachable for long periods of time. Moreover, different UEs are
likely to be reachable at different times. Therefore, it is important that the
time intervals the UE stays awake to receive MBMS user service or to discover
if there is any MBMS user service scheduled for delivery, should not
necessarily be the same as the reachable intervals negotiated for extended
idle mode DRX or PSM.
If a UE becomes unreachable for unicast service due to either PSM or extended
idle mode DRX, the UE may still perform MBMS specific procedures, e.g.
activation/deactivation of the MBMS bearer service, MBMS data transfer
reception, reception of service announcement (if needed), as defined in TS
23.246 [29] and TS 26.346 [38].
For those intervals the UE needs to be awake for MBMS bearer service, the
following cases can be identified:
1\. When the UE\'s need to be awake due to MBMS coincides with the UE already
being in connected mode due to other reasons, the UE follows normal connected
mode procedures.
2\. When the UE\'s need to be awake due to MBMS coincides with the UE already
being in idle mode and reachable (e.g. in active time for PSM or PTW for eDRX)
the UE follows normal idle mode procedure.
3\. When the UE\'s need to be awake due to MBMS coincides with the UE being in
idle mode and in deep sleep, i.e. unreachable for paging to the network, the
UE leaves the deep sleep state only to perform procedures related to MBMS
service.
\- If the MBMS user service does not require the UE to transition to connected
mode, i.e., the UE receives MBMS user service in idle mode, then the UE does
not update the MME to become reachable for paging. The UE would therefore
still be considered unreachable for paging in the MME. This minimizes the
signalling between the UE and the network.
\- If the MBMS user service requires the UE to transition to connected mode
(e.g. for HTTP reception reporting, file repair, etc.) then the UE performs
regular procedures for ECM connected mode. This would therefore make the UE
become reachable in the network for other unicast services.
4\. When the UE is in the middle of an MBMS data transfer, and the UE is
scheduled to move to deep sleep due to power saving, e.g. end of PTW for
extended idle mode DRX or expiration of active time for PSM, then the UE does
not go to deep sleep during the remainder of the current MBMS data transfer.
NOTE 1: If at the end of the current MBMS data transfer, the UE knows there is
another MBMS data transfer scheduled soon, in that case depending of the time
between MBMS data transfers, the UE can decide to go to sleep between MBMS
data transfers.
There are two possible ways the UE can be notified of an upcoming MBMS
broadcast session start:
1\. If MBMS User Services defined in TS 26.346 [38] is used, the UE needs to
receive MBMS service announcement while awake (i.e. while in connected mode,
or while idle mode during PTW for extended idle mode DRX, or active time for
PSM). The UE wakes up if not already awake for MBMS service reception based on
the schedule received in the service announcement. For this option, the MBMS
service announcement may be provided via MBMS broadcast service announcement
or via any of the possible unicast service announcement delivery mechanisms
defined in TS 23.246 [29]. If MBMS access via the MB2 interface as defined in
TS 23.468 [30] is used, similar mechanisms need to be provided by the
application layer using unicast mechanisms.
NOTE 2: In order to allow all UEs using power saving function to receive the
service announcement in time to be able to receive the MBMS broadcast data
delivery, the application server needs to be aware of the maximum unreachable
period of the UEs.
2\. The UE may be configured by the application server with specific times to
perform MBMS procedures, and wakes up from deep-sleep if needed at those
times. The UE may also receive MBMS service announcements and/or MBMS
broadcast delivery at those times (if needed).
NOTE 3: The configuration (e.g. TMGI, start time) is out of scope of 3GPP and
assumed to be performed between application server and UE at application
layer. The application server needs to initiate MBMS bearer service procedures
during those time intervals.
### 4.5.19 Enhancements to Location Services for CIoT
Location Services (LCS) are defined in TS 23.271 [33]. In order to support
Location Services for CIoT UEs, following enhancements to Location Services
are defined (refer to TS 23.271 [33] for detailed procedures):
\- Deferred location for the UE availability event:
\- When extended idle mode DRX or PSM is used, a deferred location after a UE
becomes available it is useful to avoid reliance on notifying an external
client when the UE next becomes available and requiring the external client to
then issue a Mobile Terminated Location Request (MT-LR) before the UE becomes
unavailable again.
\- The procedures for deferred location from V-GMLC to the external client and
the EPC Mobile Terminating Location Request (EPC-MT-LR) procedure are combined
properly in the V-GMLC as specified TS 23.271 [33].
\- Indication of UE RAT type and/or coverage level to Evolved Serving Mobile
Location Centre (E-SMLC):
\- Providing an E-SMLC with an indication of the RAT type and/or the coverage
level may enable the E-SMLC to appropriately determine a maximum size, maximum
frequency and maximum transfer delay for positioning messages sent to and from
the UE.
\- RAT type and coverage level indications from the MME to the E-SMLC are
introduced in TS 23.271 [33].
\- For the case of coverage level, and indication of coverage level from eNB
to MME is introduced.
\- Support of UE positioning measurements in idle mode:
\- NB-IoT UEs or Cat-M1 UEs may perform measurements for some positioning
methods only when in ECM-IDLE state due to minimal resources.
\- An E-SMLC that is aware of this (e.g. from an indication sent by the UE)
may allow additional response time to the UE (e.g. in the QoS) to obtain the
measurements. An MME that is aware of this (e.g. from the UE access type) may
also allow additional time for a location session to complete.
\- Addition of Periodic and Triggered Location for EPC:
\- A flexible periodic and/or triggered Mobile Terminated Location Request
(MT-LR) capability is useful to enable UE location at times other than when a
UE normally becomes available and/or with better granularity than a cell ID.
\- New procedures are introduced in TS 23.271 [33] to initiate and maintain
deferred periodic and triggered event reporting and to cancel reporting by an
LCS client, UE or network entity. The area event, periodic event and motion
event are clarified in the context of EPC access. Impacts to LCS messages
between an LCS Client and GMLC, between GMLCs and between an H-GMLC and PPR
are included.
\- Support of Last Known Location for a UE that are unreachable for long
periods of times:
\- For UEs that are unreachable for long periods of time, e.g. using extended
idle mode DRX or PSM, last known location support enables an external LCS
client to receive some information on UE location without waiting (e.g. a few
hours) for the UE to become reachable.
\- The EPC-MT-LR procedure defined in TS 23.271 [33] is enhanced to support
last known location based on a last known serving cell.
### 4.5.20 MBMS user service for NB or M UE categories
TS 36.306 [41] defines UE categories M1, M2 for WB-E-UTRAN and NB1, NB2 for
NB-IoT that can only support limited bandwidth and transport block size. In
order for UEs of these categories to be able to receive MBMS service, E-UTRAN
needs to be able to determine the UE category that applies to the specific
service indicated by the TMGI.
In order for E-UTRAN to know the UE categories for MBMS bearer service, the UE
Capability for MBMS (which includes UE Category for MBMS and optionally
associated coverage level for MBMS) is provided by SCS/AS to the BMSC via the
SCEF. Using PLMN specific QCI information, the characteristics are signalled
by the BM-SC to E-UTRAN following the procedures described in clause 5.5.1 of
the present specification and TS 23.246 [29]. This includes:
\- QCI(s) that are determined taking into account the UE Category for MBMS
that indicates the \"M\" or \"NB\" category (M1, M2, NB1, NB2) as defined in
TS 36.306 [41] that can receive the service indicated by the TMGI. E-UTRAN
uses the QCI to determine the radio parameters that would determine the
categories of UEs that are required to receive the service. EUTRAN is
configured with the QCI to UE Category for MBMS mapping.
NOTE 1: The way UE Category for MBMS needs to be interpreted is to allow PLMN
specific QCI to be derived by the BMSC that would allow the MBMS service to be
received by each UE type. For example, for UE Category for MBMS \"M1 and M2\",
a QCI will be derived that will map to radio configuration that would allow M1
and M2 UEs to receive the service over the radio interface. For UE Category
Info \"NB2\", a QCI will be derived that will map to radio configuration that
would allow only NB2 UEs to receive the service over the radio interface.
\- Optionally, the SCS/AS may provide additional information regarding the
coverage level for the related MBMS service. The coverage level indicates if
the MBMS service is intended to be received by UEs located in extended
coverage and is used by E-UTRAN to determine the radio configuration required,
e.g. determine the number of repetitions, to reach the UEs that receive the
MBMS service. Three levels of Coverage Level for MBMS are defined as
\"normal\", \"medium\" and \"high\". The coverage level information, when
provided, shall be reflected via the QCI.
NOTE 2: It is up to E-UTRAN implementation how the coverage level information
can be used.
NOTE 3: A single QCI does not allow for both NB and M category UEs to receive
the same service indicated by one TMGI.
### 4.5.21 Network Parameter Configuration via SCEF
The SCS/AS may issue network parameter configuration requests to the network,
via the SCEF, to suggest parameter values that may be used for Maximum
Latency, Maximum Response Time and Suggested Number of Downlink Packets. By
suggesting values for these parameters, the SCS/AS may influence certain
aspects of UE/network behaviour such as the UE\'s PSM, extended idle mode DRX,
and extended buffering configurations. Based on operator\'s configuration, the
SCEF and HSS may choose to accept, reject or modify the suggested
configuration parameter value. The SCEF indicates accepted/modified values to
the SCS/AS. This feature can also be used to suggest parameter values for a
group of UEs.
NOTE: The SCS/AS can observe how the MME ultimately configures the UE for PSM
and extended idle mode DRX by configuring \"UE Reachability\" or
\"Availability after DDN failure\" notifications with the Idle Status
Indication option (see clause 4.5.7).
The specific procedure for Network Parameter Configuration via SCEF is
described in clause 5.18.
## 4.6 Identifiers
### 4.6.1 General
Identifiers relevant for the 3GPP network are specified in TS 23.003 [4].
### 4.6.2 External Identifier
A subscription used for MTC has one IMSI and may have one or several External
Identifier(s) that are stored in the HSS. If there are several External
Identifiers, the HSS shall store one default External Identifier and one or
more additional External Identifiers.
NOTE 1: If several External Identifiers are mapped to one IMSI, some functions
might not work in this release of the specification.
External Identifier shall be globally unique. It shall have the following
components:
a. Domain Identifier: identifies a domain that is under the control of a
Mobile Network Operator (MNO). The Domain Identifier is used to identify where
services provided by the operator network can be accessed (e.g. MTC-IWF or
SCEF provided services). An operator may use different domain identifiers to
provide access to different services and/or MTC Service Providers.
b. Local Identifier: Identifier used to derive or obtain the IMSI. The Local
Identifier shall be unique within the applicable domain. It is managed by the
Mobile Network Operator.
NOTE 1: Use of External Identifiers is not restricted to MTC only.
NOTE 2: Use of IMSI outside the 3GPP operator domain is dependent on the
operator policy.
### 4.6.3 External Group Identifier
A subscription used for MTC may be associated to one or several IMSI-Group
Identifier(s) (see TS 23.003 [4]) that are stored in the HSS.
A subscription may be associated to one or several External Group
Identifier(s) that are stored in the HSS. The External Group Identifier shall
be formatted the same as the External Identifier that is described in clause
4.6.2. The Local Identifier is used to derive or obtain an IMSI-Group
Identifier. An External Group Identifier maps to an IMSI-Group Identifier. An
IMSI-Group Identifier maps to zero, one or several External Group Identifiers.
The External Group Identifier is used on the interface between the SCS/AS and
the SCEF and on the interface between the SCEF and the HSS. This identifier is
used in procedures such as group message delivery, communication pattern
provisioning, and monitoring event configuration and deletion. When the
External Group Identifier is used in the communication pattern provisioning or
monitoring event configuration and deletion procedures, the HSS shall be able
to resolve the External Group Identifier to an IMSI-Group Identifier and one
External Identifier for each of the IMSIs in the IMSI-Group. The purpose of
this association is to enable the SCEF to determine what External Identifier
to use and derive APN from SCS/AS Identifier and the External Identifier to
route non-IP data to the UE when non-IP data is sent to an External Group
Identifier.
NOTE: Additional information can assist HSS to resolve the IMSI-Group
Identifier to one External Identifier for each of the IMSIs in the IMSI-Group,
e.g. Provider Information, Service information (e.g. NIDD, MONTE). How the HSS
resolves to one of the External Identifier(s) in a UE\'s subscription is
implementation specific.
## 4.7 Addressing
For UEs used for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) IP Addressing principles
and solutions for different scenarios are described in clause 5 of TS 23.221
[21].
## 4.8 Security Aspects
### 4.8.1 Security Requirements
#### 4.8.1.0 General
Security requirements are described in TS 33.187 [25].
#### 4.8.1.1 Void
#### 4.8.1.2 Void
## 4.9 SCEF - SCS/AS API Procedures
### 4.9.1 General
This clause identifies commonalities (for both parameters and procedures)
found on T8 interface.
### 4.9.2 Common Parameters
This clause defines parameters which are required on T8 interface:
T8 Long Term Transaction Reference ID (TLTRI) is a parameter which refers to
long term transaction (e.g. NIDD Configuration, Group Message Request,
Monitoring Event configuration) between the SCEF and the SCS/AS when using T8
interface. Long term transactions consist of one or more request messages
which may have one or more response messages. TLTRI is assigned by the SCEF
and is unique through the duration of the transaction. It is stored on both
the SCEF and the SCS/AS for the duration of the transaction.
NOTE 1: Short term transaction identifiers for the T8 interface are not
described in this specification as stage 3 mechanisms (defined in TS 29.122
[44]) ensure the correlation between request and response message.
T8 Destination Address is a parameter that is included by the SCS/AS in T8
messages where the SCS/AS can request response to a specific address.
Accuracy is an optional parameter which indicates the desired level of
accuracy of the requested location information. It may be at cell level
(CGI/ECGI) for GPRS/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, or (eNodeB-ID) eNodeB level, or (TAI/RAI)
TA/RA level, or (PLMN-ID) PLMN-level, or TWAN identifier in TWAN access, or
other formats, e.g., shapes (e.g. polygons, circles etc.) or civic addresses
(e.g. streets, districts etc.) or geographic co-ordinate (latitude, longitude)
etc.
NOTE 2: The exact definition of other formats such as shapes or civic
addresses or geographic coordinate is left up to Stage 3.
Idle Status Indication is an optional parameter indicating the need for an
SCS/AS to be notified of when a UE, for which PSM or extended idle mode DRX is
enabled, transitions into idle mode.
TLTRI for Deletion identifies the TLTRI of the long-term transaction being
requested for deletion.
## 4.10 Charging Principles
Depending on operator configuration, accounting functionality for transactions
over T8 may be supported by the SCEF.
NOTE: The details of the required accounting information are outside the scope
of the present document.
Depending on operator configuration the MME, SGSN, SCEF and IWK-SCEF support
accounting functionality for Monitoring Events, and NIDD via SCEF feature.
Accounting and charging information support for Monitoring Events is specified
in TS 32.240 [28] and TS 32.278 [39].
Accounting and charging information support for NIDD via SCEF feature is
specified in TS 32.240 [28] and TS 32.253 [40].

## 5.2 Device triggering procedures
### 5.2.1 Device triggering procedure over Tsp
Figure 5.2.1-1: Device triggering procedure over Tsp
> 1\. The SCS determines the need to trigger the device. If the SCS has no
> contact details for an MTC-IWF, it may determine the IP address(es)/port(s)
> of the MTC-IWF by performing a DNS query using the External Identifier or
> using a locally configured MTC-IWF identifier.
>
> 2\. The SCS sends the Device Trigger Request (External Identifier or MSISDN,
> SCS Identifier, trigger reference number, validity period, priority,
> Application Port ID and trigger payload) message to the MTC-IWF. The SCS
> includes a trigger payload that contains the information destined for the
> MTC application, along with the information to route it to the MTC
> application. The Application Port ID is set to address a triggering function
> within the UE.
>
> NOTE 1: The assignment of SCS identifier is out of scope of 3GPP. The SCS
> identifier should meet the 3GPP / operator requirement. As an example it may
> be possible to use MSISDN as SCS identifier.
>
> 3\. The MTC-IWF checks that the SCS is authorised to send trigger requests
> and that the SCS has not exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission

>
> 4\. The MTC-IWF sends a Subscriber Information Request (External Identifier

> including the identities of the UE\'s serving CN node(s).
NOTE 2: The MTC-IWF may cache authorization and routing information for the
UE. However, this may increase the probability of trigger delivery attempt
failures when the cached serving node information is stale.
NOTE 3: Optionally, mapping from External Identifiers to MSISDN is also
provided for legacy SMS infrastructure not supporting MSISDN-less SMS.
> 5\. The HSS/HLR sends the Subscriber Information Response (IMSI and/or
> MSISDN and related \"Routing information\" including the serving node(s)

>
> 6\. The MTC-IWF attempts T4 trigger delivery procedure according to clause

### 5.2.2 Trigger Delivery using T4
Figure 5.2.2-1: T4 Trigger Delivery Flow
1\. The MTC-IWF selects a suitable SMS-SC based on configured information. The
MTC-IWF sends a Submit Trigger (External Identifier or MSISDN, IMSI, SCS
Identifier, trigger reference number, validity period, priority, serving node
ID(s) if available from HSS, SMS Application port ID, trigger payload, Trigger
Indication) message to the SMS-SC. The SMS-SC should avoid an initial HSS/HLR
interrogation (SRI for SM) when it has already received necessary parameters
in the Submit Trigger message from the MTC-IWF. The MTC-IWF forwards the
Application Port ID received from SCS as the SMS Application port ID which is
used to address the triggering function within the UE. The Trigger Indication
is a standardised identifier to allow the UE and the network to distinguish an
MT message carrying device triggering information from any other type of
messages. The SMS-SC does any necessary segmentation for larger messages.
If the MTC-IWF indicates that \"Absent subscriber\" was received from HSS, the
SMS-SC should not submit the message, but store it directly and send Routing
Information for SM to request the HSS to add the SMS-SC address to the Message
Waiting List.
2\. The SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Confirm message to the MTC-IWF to
confirm that the submission of the SMS has been accepted by the SMS-SC.
3\. The MTC-IWF sends a Device Trigger Confirm message to the SCS to confirm
that the Device Trigger Request has been accepted for delivery to the UE.
4, 5, 6. The short message is delivered to the UE (see MT-SMS procedures
specified in TS 23.040 [12]). This may involve delivery attempts in MSC or
MME, SGSN or over IMS via IP-SM-GW (see MT-SMS without MSISDN procedures
specified in TS 23.204 [13]).
The SMS-delivered trigger payload is processed and handled by the triggering
function in the UE. Any information contained within the trigger payload is
forwarded to the related or addressed UE-application.
7\. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information and includes the SCS
Identifier. The SMS Application port ID which is included in the SM User Data
Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs in order to enable
differentiated charging. The SMS-SC stores the trigger payload, without
routing information. If the message delivery fails and is attempted to be
delivered again, HSS interrogation will be performed.
8\. If the message delivery fails and the validity period of this trigger
message is not set to zero, the SMS-SC shall send a SM Message Delivery Status
Report to request the HSS to add the SMS-SC address to the Message Waiting
list. When the message delivery is later re-attempted, a new HSS interrogation
will be performed by the SMS-GMSC using IMSI or MSISDN. HSS interrogations
using IMSI shall not be forwarded or relayed to SMS-Router or IP-SM-GWs. HSS
may include up to three serving node identities (MSC or MME, SGSN, IP-SM-GW)
in the response to SMS-GMSC.
9\. If the message delivery fails and depending on the failure cause either
directly or when validity period of the trigger message expires, or when the
message delivery succeeds, the SMS-SC shall send a Message Delivery Report
(cause code, trigger reference number, SCS Identifier) to the MTC-IWF.
### 5.2.3 Device triggering recall/replace procedures
#### 5.2.3.1 Device trigger recall/replace procedure over Tsp
Figure 5.2.3.1-1: Device trigger recall/replace procedure over Tsp
1\. The SCS determines it needs to recall/replace a trigger message that it
has previously submitted. The SCS sends Device Action Request (External
Identifier or MSISDN, SCS Identifier, old trigger reference number, new
trigger reference number, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and
trigger payload) message with action type set to \"Trigger Recall Request\" or
\"Trigger Replace Request\". The SCS needs to include new trigger reference
number, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and trigger payload for
trigger replace request only. The old trigger reference number indicates the
trigger reference number which was assigned to the previously submitted
trigger message that the SCS wants to cancel. The new trigger reference number
is assigned by the SCS to the newly submitted trigger message.
If the SCS is not authorized to perform device triggering or the SCS has
exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission over Tsp, the MTC-IWF rejects
the Device Action Request message with action type set to \"Trigger Recall
Request\" or \"Trigger Replace Request\" by sending a Device Action Answer
message with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition,
and the flow stops at this step.
NOTE 1: The validity period in a trigger replace request needs to be greater
than zero for the MTC-IWF to attempt its delivery.
2\. The MTC-IWF sends a Subscriber Information Request (External Identifier or
MSISDN and SCS Identifier) message to the HSS/HLR to determine if SCS is
authorized to perform device triggering to the UE. This message is also to
resolve the External Identifier or MSISDN to IMSI and retrieve the related HSS
stored \"Routing information\" including the identities of the UE\'s serving
CN node(s) which are needed for trigger replace request only.
NOTE 2: Optionally, mapping from External Identifiers to MSISDN is also
provided for legacy SMS infrastructure not supporting MSISDN-less SMS.
3\. The HSS/HLR sends the Subscriber Information Response (IMSI and/or MSISDN
and related \"Routing information\" including the serving node(s) identities,
cause) message. The IMSI and/or MSISDN and related \"Routing information\"
including the serving node(s) identities in the Subscriber Information
Response message is only needed for trigger replace request and not used by
MTC-IWF for trigger recall request. HSS/HLR policy (possibly dependent on the
VPLMN ID) may influence which serving node identities are returned. If the
cause value indicates the SCS is not allowed to perform device triggering to
this UE, or there is no valid subscription information, the MTC-IWF sends a
Device Action Answer message with a cause value indicating the reason for the
failure condition and the flow stops at this step. Otherwise this flow
continues with step 4.
4\. If trigger message which should be recalled or replaced was submitted to a
SMS-SC as defined in clause 5.2.2, T4 device trigger replace procedure
according to clause 5.2.3.2 or T4 device trigger recall procedure according to
clause 5.2.3.3 is performed.
5\. The MTC-IWF indicates trigger recall/replace success or failure in Device
Action Answer message to the SCS. The MTC-IWF generates the necessary CDR
information including the External Identifier or MSISDN and SCS Identifier.
If recall/replace of a trigger is successful, this is reflected in the
\"Device Trigger Report\" of the original trigger message (per step 7 in
clause 5.2.1) with delivery outcome \"Recalled\"/\"Replaced\".
NOTE 3: If recall/replace of a trigger failed because the trigger was already
delivered or has expired, a \"Device Trigger Report\" of the original trigger
will already have been created with the appropriate delivery outcome.
6\. For trigger replace request, the new trigger message will be delivered to
the UE immediately or when the UE is available following steps 4 - 9 as
defined in clause 5.2.2.
#### 5.2.3.2 Replace procedure for trigger delivery using T4
Figure 5.2.3.2-1: Replace procedure for trigger delivery using T4
1\. Based on the Action type in Device Action Request message, the MTC-IWF
sends a Submit Trigger Replace (External Identifier or MSISDN, IMSI, SCS
Identifier, old trigger reference number, new trigger reference number,
validity period, priority, serving node ID(s) if available from HSS, SMS
Application port ID, trigger payload, Trigger Indication) message to the SMS-
SC. The MTC-IWF selects the SMS-SC to which the old trigger message was
submitted, e.g. based on configured information.
2\. The SMS-SC determines whether the trigger message identified by the
External Identifier or MSISDN, SCS Identifier, and old trigger reference
number in the received Submit Trigger Replace message, is pending at SMS-SC.
A) If the trigger message is pending at SMS-SC, steps 3a - 6a are performed.
3a. The SMS-SC deletes the stored trigger message and stores the new trigger
message to deliver it when the UE is available.
4a. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information and includes the SCS
Identifier. The SMS Application port ID which is included in the SM User Data
Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs in order to enable
differentiated charging.
5a. The SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Replace Response message to the MTC-IWF
to inform that the previously submitted trigger message has been successfully
replaced by the new one in the SMS-SC.
6a. The SMS-SC sends a Trigger Delivery Report for the original trigger
message indicating that this message has been replaced.
NOTE: Step 5a and step 6a are combined in single message in Stage 3.
B) If the trigger message is not pending at SMS-SC, steps 3b - 4b are
performed. In this case, the SMS-SC treats the new trigger message as a
trigger message that it has to deliver to the UE.
3b. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information and includes the SCS
Identifier. The SMS Application port ID which is included in the SM User Data
Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs in order to enable
differentiated charging.
4b. The SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Replace Response message to the MTC-IWF
to inform that the replace request failed and the SMS-SC shall deliver the new
trigger message.
#### 5.2.3.3 Recall procedure for trigger delivery using T4
Figure 5.2.3.3-1: Recall procedure for trigger delivery using T4
1\. Based on the Action type in Device Action Request message, the MTC-IWF
sends a Submit Trigger Recall (External Identifier or MSISDN, SCS Identifier,
old trigger reference number) message to the SMS-SC. The MTC-IWF selects the
SMS-SC to which the old trigger message was submitted, e.g. based on
configured information.
2\. The SMS-SC determines whether the trigger message identified by External
Identifier or MSISDN, SCS Identifier, and old trigger reference number in the
received Submit Trigger Recall message, is pending at SMS-SC.
A) If the trigger message is pending at SMS-SC, steps 3a - 6a are performed.
3a. The SMS-SC deletes the stored trigger message.
4a. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information and includes the SCS
Identifier. The SMS Application port ID which is included in the SM User Data
Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs in order to enable
differentiated charging.
5a. The SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Recall Response message to the MTC-IWF
to inform that the previously submitted trigger message has been successfully
deleted in the SMS-SC.
6a. The SMS-SC sends a Trigger Delivery Report for the original trigger
message indicating that this message has been recalled.
NOTE: Whether step 5a and step 6a are combined in single message in Stage 3.
B) If the trigger message is not pending at SMS-SC, steps 3b - 4b are
performed.
3b. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information and includes the SCS
Identifier. The SMS Application port ID which is included in the SM User Data
Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs in order to enable
differentiated charging.
4b. The SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Recall Response message to the MTC-IWF
with a cause value indicating that the recall request failed.

## 5.4 Security Procedures
### 5.4.0 General
The security procedures are specified in TS 33.187 [25].
### 5.4.1 Void

## 5.5 Group message delivery procedures
### 5.5.1 Group message delivery using MBMS
Figure 5.5.1-1: Group message delivery using MBMS
NOTE 1: Unless the SCS/AS wants to extend the expiration time for an allocated
TMGI, steps 1-5 can be skipped if a valid TMGI allocation already exists or if
the MBMS bearer activation is performed without TMGI pre-allocation.
If MB2 is used:
1\. If there is no assigned TMGI for an External Group Id, the SCS/AS sends
the Allocate TMGI Request (External Group ID, SCS Identifier, (optional)
location information, Accuracy) message to the SCEF. The SCS/AS may determine
the IP address(es)/port(s) of the SCEF by performing a DNS query using the
External Group Identifier or using a locally configured SCEF
identifier/address. The location information restricts the distribution of the
group message. It takes the format indicated in Accuracy parameter which can
be either a list of cell IDs, or a list of MBMS Service Areas, or civic
addresses, or a geographic area, or a combination of any of the above. Using
the location information, the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorized to
request TMGI allocation.
If the expiration time for a previously allocated TMGI is to be extended, in
addition to External Group ID, SCS Identifier and location information, the
previously allocated TMGI is included in the Allocate TMGI Request message.
NOTE 2: A single SCEF can be connected to multiple BM-SCs in a given PLMN. The
location information is used to identify BM-SC(s) to which MB2-C/U messages
are to be sent to.
2\. The SCEF determines whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request TMGI
allocation.
3\. The SCEF initiates TMGI allocation by the BM-SC (see TMGI Allocation
Procedure specified in TS 23.468 [30]). In this procedure, if the TMGI is not
included in step 1, the SCEF requests allocation of only one TMGI. If a TMGI
is included in step 1, the SCEF requests to extend the TMGI expiration time
for that TMGI. The SCEF stores TMGI and TMGI expiration received in this step.
4\. The SCEF sends Allocate TMGI Response (Cause, TMGI, TMGI expiration)
message to the SCS/AS. Cause value indicates success or failure of the
requested procedure. In case of failure, the reason for the failure condition
is also included. The TMGI allocated by the BM-SC to which the SCS/AS is
expected to send the group message, and TMGI expiration indicating the
expiration time for the TMGI are also included.
NOTE 3: The SCEF may cache the serving BM-SC Identity information and mapping
between External Group ID and TMGI.
Steps 5 to 14 are skipped if the SCS/AS only wants to extend the expiration
time of the TMGI (MB2 only).
5\. Application level interactions may be applied for the devices of specific
group to retrieve the related MBMS service information, e.g. TMGI, start time,
etc. in the case of MB2. Application level interactions between the UE and the
SCS/AS are out of scope of this specification.
If xMB is used, steps 1 to 5 are skipped.
6\. The SCS/AS sends the Group Message Request (External Group Identifier, SCS
Identifier, TMGI (MB2 only), Message Delivery Stop Time (xMB only), optional
(Group Message Payload, location information, Accuracy, Message Delivery Start
Time) message to the SCEF.
In the case of xMB, the SCEF creates a service using xMB for the group message
and associates the external Group Identifier with the HTTP REST resource
identifier of the service provided by the BM-SC upon service creation. The
then SCEF forwards either only the ServiceID (see Table 5.4A-2 in TS 26.346
[38]) to the SCS/AS or all service announcement. After the service is created,
the SCS/AS triggers session creation towards the SCEF.
The SCEF assigns a TLTRI that identifies this group message delivery request.
The location information is included to identify the location over which group
message is to be sent. It takes the format indicated in Accuracy parameter
which can be either a list of cell IDs, or a list of MBMS Service Areas, or
civic addresses, or a geographic area, or a combination of any of the above.
The Message Delivery Start Time indicates the time at which the group message
is to be sent by the network on the MBMS bearer(s). If not included, the group
message is expected to be sent immediately. The Message Delivery Stop Time
indicates the time at which the group message delivery is expected to be
completed. When included, Group Message Payload indicates the payload the
SCS/AS intends to deliver to UEs. Absence of Group Message Payload is
indicative of the SCS/AS using delivery of group message in step 13a.
NOTE 4: A single Group Message Payload can be sent to all included TMGIs (MB2
only).
NOTE 5: Whether actual payload or a reference to the payload (e.g. URI) is
sent in this step is left to Stage 3. In case of latter, the SCEF downloads
the payload prior to step 13.
In the case of xMB, if the application in the UE receives a ServiceId through
application level interaction, the application can activate reception using
MBMS device APIs (see TS 26.347 [42]).
7\. The SCEF checks that the SCS/AS is authorised to send a group message
request. It also checks to see if Message Delivery Start Time doesn\'t start
after the TMGI expiration (MB2 only). In the case of xMB, the SCEF ensures
that the xMB session stop time is not before the Message Delivery Start Time.
If either of the checks fail, then the SCEF executes step 11 with a cause
value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at
this step. In this case, the SCS/AS may subsequently release the TMGI
allocated at step 3 by requesting an explicit de-allocation, or may rely on
the expiration timer.
8\. If MB2 is used, the Activate MBMS Bearer Procedure (see TS 23.468 [30]
clause 5.1.2.3.2) is executed with the following changes:
\- In step 1 of this procedure, the SCEF, acting as GCS AS, may include
location information from step 6. If no location information is provided in
step 6 of this procedure, then the SCEF, based on local configuration, uses
either a list of MBMS Service Area Identities, or a list of cell IDs, or both
as the MBMS broadcast area.
\- In step 2 of this procedure, the BM-SC may map the civic address(es) (if
provided) and/or geographic area(s) (if provided) of location information into
MBMS Service Area Identities subject to operator policies.
8a-8c. If xMB is used, the Create Session procedure (see TS 26.346 [38] clause
5.4A.5.2) and the Update Session Procedure (see TS 26.346 [38] clause
5.4A.5.4) is executed with the following changes:
\- In step 1 and step 2 of Create Session procedure, the SCEF acts as a
Content Provider.
\- In step 1 of Update Session procedure, the SCEF, acting as Content Provider
may include location information from step 6, session start and session stop.
If no location information is provided in step 6 of this procedure, then the
SCEF, based on local configuration, uses either a list of MBMS Service Area
Identities, or a list of cell IDs, or both as the MBMS broadcast area. The
SCEF shall derive the session start based on the Message Delivery Start Time
if provided in step 6 and the session stop based on the Message Delivery Stop
Time if provided in step 6. The Session Resource ID as defined in TS 26.346
[38] Create Session response sent by the BM-SC to SCEF uniquely identifies an
MBMS session during which MBMS service data is sent. Given that an MBMS
session can target a certain MBMS Service Area via a TMGI and an MBMS Service
Area description, it can be mapped to a specific group (i.e. MBMS UEs
belonging to that group and which have received MBMS service announcement
information containing the TMGI of the MBMS bearer service associated with
this MBMS session can activate reception for that session).
\- In step 2 of Update Session procedure, the BM-SC may map the civic
address(es) (if provided) and/or geographic area(s) (if provided) of location
information into MBMS Service Area Identities subject to operator policies.
In the case of xMB, depending on the service created, the BM-SC may send the
service announcement information to the UE as specified in TS 26.346 [38]. The
service announcement information is referenced by the ServiceId which was
provided by the BM-SC to the SCEF and then forwarded to the SCS/AS for service
identification.
9\. Void.
10\. Void.
11\. The SCEF sends a Group Message Response (TLTRI, TMGI (MB2 only),
Acceptance Status, (optional) SCEF Message Delivery IP address/port) message
to the SCS/AS to indicate whether the Request has been accepted for delivery
to the group. The SCEF sends Acceptance Status of TMGI to indicate whether
activation of MBMS bearer corresponding to the TMGI was accepted or rejected.
If Group Message Payload was not included in step 6, then the SCEF also sends
SCEF Message Delivery IP address and port number to the SCS/AS.
NOTE 6: The SCEF can map BMSC address and port number (received in step 8 for
MB-2 or xMB delivery) to a different IP address and port number to be used
between the SCEF and the SCS/AS for delivery of group message payload.
12\. Application level interactions may be applied for the devices of specific
group to retrieve the related MBMS service information, e.g. TMGI, start time.
Application level interactions between the UE and the SCS/AS are out of scope
of this specification. When using xMB, the application may receive the
appropriate information through MBMS device APIs from the MBMS Client (see TS
26.347 [42]).
13a. If Group Message Payload was included in step 6, then at Message Delivery
Start Time, the SCEF delivers to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) to
corresponding to MB2-U or xMB-U IP address and port number associated with
respective TMGI. If Group Message Payload was not included in step 6, then at
or after the requested Group Message Start Time, but before the TMGI
Expiration time (if MB2 is used) or Message Delivery Stop Time (if xMB is
used), the SCS/AS transfers the content to be delivered to the group to the
SCEF using the SCEF Message Delivery IP address and port number received at
step 11. The BM-SC transfers the corresponding content to UEs. To avoid that
potential responses to the broadcast message by high numbers of devices are
sent at almost the same time, it is recommended that the SCS/AS provide the
UEs with a response time window if it expects the UEs to respond to the
delivered content.
NOTE 7: Subsequent to this step, it is up to the SCS/AS if the MBMS bearers
will be kept active and allocated and for how long. The mechanisms defined in
TS 23.468 [30] or TS 26.346 [38] can be used by the SCEF to release the MBMS
resources.
13b. Upon execution of 13a, the SCEF sends a Group Message Delivery (TLTRI,
TMGI, Delivery Trigger Status) message to the SCS/AS to indicate whether group
message delivery was triggered successful. TLTRI refers to the transaction
identified by TLTRI in step 6. For the TMGI, the SCEF sends Delivery Trigger
Status to indicate whether delivery of Group Message Payload corresponding to
the TMGI was successful or not.
14\. When a UE receives the Group Message Payload it may initiate immediate or
later communication with the SCS/AS.
NOTE 8: It is recommended that the UE application ensures distribution of any
responses within the response time window.
### 5.5.2 Modification of previously submitted Group message
Figure 5.5.2-1: Modification of previously submitted Group Message
0\. The pre-condition for this flow is the successful completion of step 11
from clause 5.5.1.
1\. Application level interactions may be applied for the devices of specific
group to retrieve the related MBMS service information, e.g. TMGI, start time,
etc. in case of MB2 or ServiceId in case of xMB. When the application receives
a ServiceId through application level interaction, the application can
activate reception using MBMS device APIs (see TS 26.347 [42]). Application
level interactions between the UE and the SCS/AS are out of scope of this
specification.
2\. The SCS/AS determines that modification of previously accepted Group
Message Delivery Request is required. The SCS/AS sends the Modify Group
Message Request (TLTRI, Requested Action, Message Delivery Start Time, Message
Delivery Stop Time (xMB only), optional (External Group Identifier, SCS
Identifier, TMGI (MB2 only), Group Message Payload, location information,
Accuracy) message to the SCEF. In the case of xMB, the SCEF identifies the
associated MBMS Service using the external Group Identifier. Requested Action
is either set to \"Modify\", or \"Cancel\". \"Modify\" indicates the request
is to modify the transaction identified by TLTRI. \"Cancel\" indicates the
request is to cancel the transaction identified by TLTRI. When set to
\"Modify\", then the remainder parameters, except Message Delivery Start Time,
are optional, and included only if different to that of step 6 from clause
5.5.1. When set to \"Cancel\", no other parameters are included.
3\. The SCEF uses TLTRI to locate the context of previously accepted Group
Message Delivery Request executed in clause 5.5.1. If no associated
transaction is found, or if a transaction if found but step 13a from clause
5.5.1 was completed, then step 4 is executed with appropriate Cause value, and
the flow stops at this step. Otherwise, the flow proceeds.
4\. If Requested Action was set to \"Cancel\", then if MB2 is used the
mechanisms defined in TS 23.468 [30], clause 5.1.2.3.3 and if xMB is used the
mechanisms defined in TS 26.346 [38] clause 5.4A.5.5 are executed by the SCEF
to release the associated MBMS resources. If Requested Action was set to
\"Modify\", then if MB2 is used the mechanisms defined in TS 23.468 [30],
clause 5.1.2.4 are used by the SCEF to modify the associated MBMS resources,
whereas if xMB is used the mechanisms defined in TS 26.346 [38], clause
5.4A.5.4 with the following changes:
\- In step 1 of this procedure, the SCEF, acting as GCS AS (if MB2 is used) or
Content provider (if xMB is used), may include location information from step
2. If no location information is provided in step 2 of this procedure, then
the SCEF, based on local configuration, uses either a list of MBMS Service
Area Identities, or a list of cell IDs, or both as the MBMS broadcast area.
\- In step 2 of this procedure, the BM-SC may map the civic address(es) (if
provided) and/or geographic area(s) (if provided) of location information into
MBMS Service Area Identities subject to operator policies.
5\. If Requested Action was set to \"Cancel\", then the SCEF sends a Modify
Group Message Response (Cause) message to the SCS/AS with appropriate Cause
value depending on whether the cancellation was accepted, and the flow stops
at this step. If Requested Action was set to \"Modify\", then the SCEF sends a
Modify Group Message Response (Cause, TMGI, Acceptance Status) message to the
SCS/AS to indicate whether the requested modifications were accepted. The
usage of parameters is similar to step 11 of clause 5.5.1.
6\. Steps 12-14 of clause 5.5.1 are executed.
### 5.5.3 Group Message Delivery via unicast MT NIDD
Figure 5.5.3-1: Group Message Delivery via unicast MT NIDD
1\. If SCS/AS has downlink non-IP data to send to a group of UEs, the SCS/AS
sends a Group MT NIDD Submit Request (SCS/AS Identifier, External Group
Identifier, TLTRI, non-IP data, Reliable Data Service Configuration, Maximum
Latency, PDN Connection Establishment Option) message to the SCEF. The SCS/AS
may determine the IP address(es)/port(s) of the SCEF by performing a DNS query
using the External Group Identifier or using a locally configured SCEF
identifier/address. When non-IP data is sent to an External Group Identifier,
the Reliable Data Service Configuration shall indicate that no reliable data
service acknowledgment is requested.
2\. Based on the preceding NIDD Configuration of the UE Group (see clause
5.13.2) and the SCEF stored list of authorized External Identifiers associated
to the External Group Identifier, the SCEF sends a single Group MT NIDD Submit
Response (Cause) message to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the Group
MT NIDD Submit Request. The Cause may indicate that the non-IP packet size is
larger than the Maximum Packet Size determined in the preceding NIDD
configuration of the UE Group.
3\. The SCEF performs this step for each External Identifier that belongs to
the External Group Identifier. The SCEF stored the list of authorized External
Identifiers associated to the External Group Identifier during the preceding
NIDD Configuration of the UE Group (see clause 5.13.2). The SCEF determines
the EPS Bearer Context based on the NIDD Configuration TLTRI that is
associated with the SCS/AS Identifier and the External Identifier. If an SCEF
EPS bearer context corresponding to the External Identifier and SCS/AS
Identifier is found, then the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised to
send NIDD requests and that the SCS/AS has not exceeded its rate control quota
or rate of data submission to the SCEF EPS bearer. If this check fails, the
SCEF does nothing in this step for this UE and the Cause value that is
associated with this UE and provided to the SCS/AS in step 4 will indicate the
reason for the failure condition for each failed UE. For each UE that passes
these checks, the SCEF continues with the flow by executing steps 2-9 (except
steps 2b and 5) of the Mobile Terminated NIDD Procedure of clause 5.13.3.
4\. After executing step 3 for all UEs, the SCEF sends an aggregated response
message Group MT NIDD Submit Indication (TLTRI associated with the Request of
step 1, Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication(s), Re-Transmission time(s),
Trigger Indication(s), Cause(s)). The Re-Transmission time(s) report, for UEs
that have power saving function and did not receive the MT NIDD message, how
long time it will take before they are reachable. Re-Transmission time(s) are
not sent for UEs where transmission was successful. The SCEF does not buffer
the non-IP data further (if applicable) and provides a Hop-by-Hop
Acknowledgment Indication, and a Cause value for each UE in the response to
the SCS/AS. See clause 5.13.3 for a description of the Hop-by-Hop
Acknowledgment Indication and when it is included. The Trigger Indication(s)
is used to indicate UE(s) for which a trigger was sent in order to establish a
PDN connection.
NOTE: The Re-Transmission time is used to inform the SCS/AS when the UE is
expected to become reachable again, it is the expected wake up time that MME
provided to SCEF when delivery failed for UEs with long sleep time.
## 5.6 Monitoring Procedures
### 5.6.0 Common Parameters
This clause describes the common parameters required for Monitoring Event
procedures.
SCEF Reference ID is a parameter created by the SCEF to associate a Monitoring
Event report or a deletion of a Monitoring Event to a specific Monitoring
Request and the associated context information within the SCEF. SCEF Reference
ID is stored by HSS, MME, SGSN, and IWK-SCEF.
NOTE 1: For the case of an individual UE, an SCEF may aggregate Monitoring
Event configuration requests for the same External identifier/MSISDN from
different SCS/AS instances.
NOTE 2: For the case of groups, an SCEF may aggregate Monitoring Event
configuration requests for the same External Group Identifier from different
SCS/AS instances.
SCEF ID indicates the SCEF to which the Monitoring Indication message has to
be sent to by the HSS, MME, SGSN, or IWK-SCEF. SCEF ID is stored by the HSS,
MME, SGSN, and IWK-SCEF.
SCEF Reference ID for Deletion identifies the monitoring event configuration
that shall be deleted before applying the requested monitoring event
configuration.
Monitoring Type identifies the specific Monitoring Event being requested.
If the Monitoring Event Configuration requested from the SCEF is for a group
of UEs, the HSS includes User Identity in the monitoring event configuration.
Maximum Number of Reports is an optional parameter that indicates the maximum
number of event reports to be generated by the HSS, MME, or SGSN until the
associated monitoring event is considered to expire. This parameter can be
used when configuring a monitoring event for an individual UE or a group. When
the parameter is configured for a group, the configured value is applied to
each individual UE\'s monitoring event configuration. A value of one implies a
single event report is to be generated which makes it equivalent to a One-time
Monitoring Request.
Monitoring Duration is an optional parameter that indicates the absolute time
at which the related monitoring event request is considered to expire. For
Monitoring Requests for a group, this parameter applies to every group member
UE.
Inclusion of either Maximum Number of Reports (with a value higher than one)
or Monitoring Duration makes the Monitoring Request a Continuous Monitoring
Request. For a Continuous Monitoring Request, a single Monitoring Request may
generate more than one Monitoring Indication message. Support of continuous
monitoring is optional.
Absence of both Maximum Number of Reports and Monitoring Duration makes the
Monitoring Request a One-time Monitoring Request. For One-time Monitoring
Requests, a single Monitoring Request generates only one Monitoring Report for
an individual UE and for an individual group member UE.
If for a given Monitoring Event both Maximum Number of Reports and Monitoring
Duration are included then the monitoring request is considered to expire as
soon as one of the conditions is met.
Chargeable Party Identifier is an optional parameter included by the SCEF. It
identifies the entity towards which accounting/charging functionality is
performed by the involved 3GPP network elements.
MTC Provider Information is an optional parameter included by the SCEF. It
identifies the MTC Service Provider and/or MTC Application. Optionally the MTC
Provider Information may also be provided by the SCS/AS.
Group Reporting Guard Time is an optional parameter for group-based monitoring
configuration to indicate the time for which the Monitoring Event Reporting(s)
detected by the UEs in a group can be aggregated before sending them to the
SCEF/SCS/AS. The value of the Group Reporting Guard time should be set less
than the Monitoring Duration. For the continuous monitoring reporting, unless
the Monitoring Duration has been reached, the Group Reporting Guard timer is
restarted when it expires. If the time left until Monitoring Duration is less
than the Group Reporting Guard Time, then the Group Reporting Guard timer
shall be set to expire when the Monitoring Duration expires. If the Monitoring
Duration is expired, the Group Reporting Guard Time, if running, shall be
considered to expire and aggregated Monitoring Event Reporting(s) is sent to
destination immediately.
Number of UEs is a parameter that is provided to the SCEF during group-based
monitoring configuration to indicate the number of UEs within the group
identified by the External Group Identifier. The SCEF uses this value to
determine whether the monitoring event has been reported for all group member
UEs.
### 5.6.1 Monitoring Event configuration and deletion via HSS
#### 5.6.1.1 Configuration Procedure
Figure 5.6.1.1-1 illustrates the procedure of configuring monitoring at the
HSS or the MME/SGSN. The procedure is common for various Monitoring Event
types. Common parameters for this procedure are detailed in clause 5.6.0. The
steps and parameters specific to different Monitoring Event types are detailed
in clauses 5.6.1.3 to 5.6.1.9.
The procedure is also used for deleting a previously configured Monitoring
Event either as a standalone procedure or together with configuring a new
Monitoring Event between the same SCEF and the same SCS/AS, or replacing a
previously configured Monitoring Event with a new Monitoring Event of the same
type between the same SCEF and the same SCS/AS, or for one-time reporting in
case the Configured Monitoring Event is available at the configured node.
Figure 5.6.1.1-1: Monitoring event configuration and deletion via HSS
procedure
1\. The SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Request (External Identifier or MSISDN or
External Group ID, SCS/AS Identifier, Monitoring Type, Maximum Number of
Reports, Monitoring Duration, T8 Destination Address, TLTRI for Deletion,
Group Reporting Guard Time, MTC Provider Information) message to the SCEF. The
SCEF assigns a TLTRI that identifies the Monitoring Request. If the SCS/AS may
perform deletion of a previously configured Monitoring Event together with
configuring a new Monitoring Event. If the SCS/AS wants to perform deletion of
a previously configured Monitoring Event, then it shall include TLTRI for
Deletion.
If the SCS/AS wants to configure Monitoring Event for the group of UEs, the
SCS/AS can send Monitoring Request message including External Group Identifier
and Group Reporting Guard Time. If the SCS/AS includes External Group
Identifier in the Monitoring Request message, External Identifier or MSISDN
shall be ignored. A Group Reporting Guard Time is an optional parameter to
indicate that aggregated Monitoring Event Reporting(s) which have been
detected for the UEs in a group needs to be sent to the SCS/AS once the Group
Reporting Guard Time is expired.
NOTE 1: A relative priority scheme for the treatment of multiple SCS/AS
Monitoring Requests, e.g. for deciding which requests to serve under overload
condition, can be applied. This priority scheme is used locally by the SCEF,
i.e. it is not used nor translated in procedures towards other functions.
2\. The SCEF stores SCS/AS Identifier, T8 Destination Address, Monitoring
Duration, Maximum Number of Reports and Group Reporting Guard Time, if
provided. The SCEF stores the TLTRI, and also assigns it to an SCEF Reference
ID. Based on operator policies, if either the SCS/AS is not authorized to
perform this request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or the Monitoring
Request is malformed or the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota or rate of
submitting monitoring requests, the SCEF performs step 9 and provides a Cause
value appropriately indicating the error. If the SCEF received a TLTRI for
Deletion, the SCEF looks up the SCEF context pointed to by the TLTRI to derive
the related SCEF Reference ID for Deletion.
The SCEF uses the Group Reporting Guard Time for a Monitoring Event Reporting
for the group of UEs when the Monitoring Indication message is sent from the
MME/SGSN to the SCEF. The SCEF sets the Group Reporting Guard Time for HSS
less than the value for the SCEF received from SCS/AS in order to ensure to
receive accumulated Monitoring Indication from HSS before the Group Reporting
Guard Timer for SCEF is expired.
3\. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Request (External Identifier or MSISDN or
External Group Identifier, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID, Monitoring Type,
Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, SCEF Reference ID for
Deletion, Chargeable Party Identifier, Group Reporting Guard Time, MTC
Provider Information) message to the HSS to configure the given Monitoring
Event on the HSS and on the MME/SGSN, if required. If the External Group
Identifier is included, External Identifier or MSISDN shall be ignored. For
one-time Monitoring Request of Roaming Status, the SCEF does not indicate the
Group Reporting Guard Time.
NOTE 1a: The MTC Provider Information in step 1 is an optional parameter. The
SCEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it
to an SCEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the
SCEF determines the MTC Provider Information if not present in step 1 is left
to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting SCS/AS).
4\. The HSS examines the Monitoring Request message, e.g. with regard to the
existence of External Identifier or MSISDN or External Group Identifier,
whether any included parameters are in the range acceptable for the operator,
whether the monitoring event(s) is supported by the serving MME/SGSN, whether
the group-basis monitoring event feature is supported by the serving MME/SGSN,
or whether the monitoring event that shall be deleted is valid. The HSS
optionally authorizes the chargeable party identified by Chargeable Party
Identifier. If this check fails the HSS follows step 8 and provides a Cause
value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF.
NOTE 2: The details of the chargeable party authorization are outside the
scope of this specification.
The HSS stores the SCEF Reference ID, the SCEF ID, Maximum Number of Reports,
Monitoring Duration and the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion as provided by the
SCEF. For a Monitoring Request for a group, such parameters are stored for
every group member UE.
The HSS uses the Group Reporting Guard Time for a Monitoring Event Reporting
for the group of UEs when the Monitoring Indication message is sent from the
HSS to the SCEF.
4a. For group based processing, if the HSS receives the Monitoring Request
with an External Group Identifier, the HSS sends a Monitoring Response (SCEF
Reference ID, Number of UEs, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge
acceptance of the Monitoring Request immediately before beginning the
processing of individual UEs indicating that Group processing is in progress.
The HSS deletes the monitoring event configuration identified by the SCEF
Reference ID, if it was requested.
4b. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Response (TLTRI, Cause) message to the SCS/AS.
The Cause value indicates progress of Group processing request.
5\. If required by the specific Monitoring Type and when Monitoring Event(s)
is supported by the serving MME/SGSN, the HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data
Request (Monitoring Type, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID, Maximum Number of
Reports, Monitoring Duration, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, Chargeable Party
Identifier) message to the MME/SGSN for each individual UE and for each
individual group member UE. If the Monitoring Request message is for a group
of UEs, for each UE group member, the HSS includes the selected External ID or
the MSISDN in the monitoring event configuration and sends an Insert
Subscriber Data Request message per UE to all the MME/SGSN(s) serving the
members of the group. Optionally, the HSS allocates a Provider-Group-ID based
on the MTC Provider Information (different from the IMSI-Group-Id) and sends
it to the MME/SGSN to assist the serving node(s) when selecting and
differentiating configurations for a given MTC Service Provider (e.g. to
delete the configurations for a specific MTC Service Provider at the
MME/SGSN).
NOTE 2a: How the HSS selects an External ID when multiple External IDs are
associated with the same IMSI is left to implementation, e.g. based on the MTC
Provider Information (if received) or the default External ID (if not
received).
NOTE 2b: The Provider-Group-ID is used for group operations e.g. as specified
in TS 23.401 [7], clause 4.3.7.4.2 NAS level congestion control.
6\. If the MME/SGSN is configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the SCEF
then clause 5.6.6 applies. Otherwise, the MME/SGSN verifies the request, e.g.
if the Monitoring Type is covered by a roaming agreement when the request is
from another PLMN or whether it serves the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion and
can delete it. If this check fails, the MME/SGSN follows step 7 and provides a
Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the HSS. Based
on operator policies, the MME/SGSN may also reject the request due to other
reasons (e.g. overload or HSS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting
monitoring requests defined by an SLA).
The MME/SGSN stores the received parameters and starts to watch for the
indicated Monitoring Event unless it is a One-time request and the Monitoring
Event is available to the MME/SGSN at the time of sending Insert Subscriber
Data Answer. The MME/SGSN deletes the monitoring configuration identified by
the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, if provided.
NOTE 3: The MME/SGSN will transfer the parameters stored for every monitoring
task as part of its context information during an MME/SGSN change.
7\. If the monitoring configuration is successful, the MME/SGSN sends an
Insert Subscriber Data Answer (Cause) message to the HSS. If the requested
Monitoring Event is available to the MME/SGSN at the time of sending Insert
Subscriber Data Answer, then the MME/SGSN includes the Monitoring Event Report
in the Insert Subscriber Data Answer message.
8\. For single UE processing, the HSS sends a Monitoring Response (SCEF
Reference ID, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the
Monitoring Request and the deletion of the identified monitoring event
configuration, if it was requested. The HSS deletes the monitoring event
configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID, if it was requested. If the
requested Monitoring Event is available to the HSS at the time of sending
Monitoring Response message or was received from the MME/SGSN in step 7, then
the HSS includes a Monitoring Event Report in the Monitoring Response message.
If it is a One-time request and the Insert Subscriber Data Answer includes a
Monitoring Event Report, the HSS deletes the associated Monitoring Event
configuration for the individual UE or for the individual group member UE.
For group-based processing, if the HSS sent the Monitoring Response in step
4a, i.e. due to having received a Monitoring Request with an External Group
Identifier and if the Group Reporting Guard Time was provided in the
Monitoring Request, the HSS accumulates multiple responses for the UEs of the
group within the Group Reporting Guard Time. After the Group Reporting Guard
Time expiration, the HSS sends a Monitoring Indication with the accumulated
responses. The HSS includes UE identity(ies) and a Cause value indicating the
reason for the failure in the message if the monitoring configuration of the
group member failed.
NOTE 4: For the group-basis Monitoring Event configuration, the HSS may divide
the accumulated Monitoring Indications into multiple messages due to e.g.
limitation of the message size.
In the case of UE mobility, the HSS determines whether the new MME/SGSN
supports requested Monitoring Event(s).
9a. For single UE processing, the SCEF sends a Monitoring Response (Cause,
Monitoring Event Report) message to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of
the Monitoring Request and the deletion of the identified monitoring event
configuration, if it was requested. If the SCEF received a Monitoring Event
Report then it includes the Monitoring Event Report in the Monitoring Response
message. If it is a One-time request for an individual UE and the Monitoring
Response includes a Monitoring Event Report for the UE, the SCEF deletes the
associated Monitoring Event configuration.
9b. For group-based processing, if no Group Reporting Guard Time was set, then
the SCEF sends the Monitor Indication (TLTRI, Cause, Monitoring Event Report)
message to the SCS/AS as it receives them from the HSS. Otherwise, it
accumulates Monitoring Event for the UEs of the group until the expiration of
Group Reporting Guard Time. Upon expiration, the SCEF sends a Monitoring
Indication (TLTRI, Cause, list of (External Identifier or MSISDN, Monitoring
Event Report)) message to the SCS/AS. A list of accumulated Monitoring Event
Report for each UE identified by either External Identifier or MSISDN is also
included.
If the Monitoring Request is a one-time request for a group of UEs, the SCEF
uses the list of UE Identities that were received in step 8 and the Number of
UEs parameter that was received in step 4a to check if the reports for all the
individual group member UEs have been received. If the SCEF determines that a
report for all individual group member UEs have been received, the SCEF sends
a request to the HSS to delete the associated Monitoring Event configuration
for the group.
9c. For each Monitoring Indication message received in step 9b, the SCS/AS
sends a Monitoring Indication Response (Cause) message to the SCEF. Cause
value reflects successful or unsuccessful acknowledgement of Monitoring
Indication message.
If the HSS detects that the current serving MME/SGSN cannot support a
requested Monitoring Event or the group-basis monitoring event feature (e.g.
after a UE mobility event), the HSS performs the procedures given below.
\- Notify the SCEF that the configured Monitoring Event for the UE is
considered to be suspended. The SCEF interprets this to mean that the network
will temporarily be unable to serve the configured Monitoring Event. In this
case:
\- When the MME/SGSN for the UE changes (e.g. due to UE mobility), and the new
MME/SGSN supports the suspended Monitoring Event, the HSS shall configure the
new MME/SGSN with the Monitoring Event and notify the SCEF of resumption of
the suspended Monitoring Event;
\- If the criteria for Continuous Reporting expire while the Monitoring Event
is suspended, the HSS and the SCEF shall independently delete the Monitoring
Event.
#### 5.6.1.2 Void
#### 5.6.1.3 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Loss of connectivity
Loss of connectivity indicates when the 3GPP network detects that the UE is no
longer reachable for either signalling or user plane communication. Such
condition is identified when the mobile reachability timer expires in the MME
or SGSN (see TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.060 [6], when the UE detaches and when an
active UE is purged (see TS 29.272 [31])). The SCS/AS may provide a Maximum
Detection Time, which indicates the maximum period of time without any
communication with the UE after which the SCS/AS is to be informed that the UE
is considered to be unreachable.
NOTE 1: As the Maximum Detection Time of loss of connectivity determines the
order of magnitude of the Periodic Update timer, the network should ensure
that this Maximum Detection Time and thereby the periodic TAU/RAU timers for
the UE remain above lower bound values both for preserving the battery of the
UE and for managing the signalling load of the network. So for UEs with
battery constraints, it should not be a small time (e.g. on the order of only
a few minutes). Even for UEs without battery constraints, trying to fulfil a
Maximum Detection Time of loss of connectivity on the order of a few minutes
can only apply to a limited number of UEs due to the cost of signalling
induced by this feature.
NOTE 2: The Maximum Detection Time of loss of connectivity is on the order of
1 minute to multiple hours.
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Loss of Connectivity\", and
optionally adds Maximum Detection Time prior to sending Monitoring Request to
the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.
3\. The SCEF executes step 3 of clause 5.6.1.1.
4\. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, it checks whether
the Maximum Detection Time is within the range defined by operator policies,
and, if acceptable then the HSS sets the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer
using the value of Maximum Detection Time, if it is provided. If the Maximum
Detection Time is not acceptable, the HSS rejects the request by executing
step 8, and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure
condition to the SCEF. If the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer was previously
set by a different Monitoring Request identified by a different SCEF Reference
ID for the same UE then, depending on operator configuration, the HSS either
performs step 8 to reject the Monitoring Request with an appropriate Cause or
accepts the request. In case the HSS accepts this request, then it cancels the
previously accepted Monitoring Request by including the SCEF Reference ID of
that Monitoring Request in step 8. The cancelled monitoring request may be
configured previously for a single UE or a group of UEs. If the cancelled
monitoring request was configured for a group of UEs, then the monitoring
event is cancelled for all UEs in the group.
NOTE 3: If the Monitoring Request message in step 4 includes a group of UEs,
the HSS checks the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer for each UE whether it
was set by a different Monitoring Request and decides either rejection or
acceptance of the Monitoring Request based on operator policy.
NOTE 4: In the present release an event subscription for a UE can be cancelled
due to conflict with a subsequent event subscription related to the Maximum
Detection Time setting of another UE as described above.
NOTE 5: Since the value of the mobile reachable timer is larger than the value
of the periodic RAU/TAU timer (by four minutes as a default), the HSS may set
the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer to a smaller value than the value of
Maximum Detection Time.
5\. The HSS executes step 5 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, the HSS includes
the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer (if modified).
6\. The MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1. If the MME/SGSN receives a
subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer value from the HSS, it allocates the
subscribed value to the UE as the periodic TAU/RAU timer. The MME/SGSN starts
watching for the expiration of the mobile reachable timer.
7\. Step 7 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed.
8\. Step 8 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed. The HSS may include the SCEF
Reference ID of previously accepted Monitoring Request which needs to be
cancelled.
9\. Step 9 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed. If SCEF Reference ID of previously
configured Monitoring Event for cancellation is included in step 8, then the
SCEF executes steps 2-5 of clause 5.6.9 using the associated TLTRI towards the
associated SCS/AS.
#### 5.6.1.4 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: UE reachability
UE reachability indicates when the UE becomes reachable for sending either SMS
or downlink data to the UE, which is detected when the UE transitions to ECM-
CONNECTED mode (for a UE using Power Saving Mode or extended idle mode DRX) or
when the UE will become reachable for paging (for a UE using extended idle
mode DRX). This monitoring event supports Reachabilty for SMS and Reachability
for Data. Only a One-time Monitoring Request for Reachability for SMS is
supported. The SCS/AS may include the following parameters in the Monitoring
Event configuration request to the SCEF:
\- Reachability Type indicating whether the request is for \"Reachability for
SMS\", or \"Reachability for Data\", or both.
\- Optionally, Maximum Latency indicating maximum delay acceptable for
downlink data transfers. Maximum Latency is used for setting the periodic
TAU/RAU timer for the UE as it sets the maximum period after which a UE has to
connect to the network again and thereby becomes reachable. Determined by the
operator, low values for Maximum Latency may deactivate PSM.
\- Optionally, Maximum Response Time indicating the time for which the UE
stays reachable to allow the SCS/AS to reliably deliver the required downlink
data. Maximum Response Time is used for setting the Active Time for the UE.
When the UE uses extended idle mode DRX, the Maximum Response Time is used to
determine how early this monitoring event should be reported to the SCS/AS
before the next Paging Occasion occurs.
\- Optionally, Suggested number of downlink packets indicating the number of
packets that the Serving Gateway shall buffer in case the UE is not reachable.
NOTE 1: As the Maximum Latency determines the order of magnitude of the
Periodic Update timer, the network should ensure that this Maximum Latency and
thereby the periodic TAU/RAU timers for the UE remain above lower bound values
both for preserving the battery of the UE and for managing the signalling load
of the network. So for UEs with battery constraints, it should not be a small
time (e.g. on the order of only a few minutes). Even for UEs without battery
constraints, trying to fulfil a Maximum Latency on the order of a few minutes
can only apply to a limited number of UEs due to the cost of signalling
induced by this feature.
NOTE 2: The Maximum Latency is on the order of 1 minute to multiple hours.
NOTE 3: The Network Parameter Configuration via SCEF feature (see clause
4.5.21) feature supersedes the option of setting Reachability Type to
\"configuration\" during configuration of the UE Reachability Monitoring Event
which is no longer recommended.
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"UE Reachability\", and includes
Reachability Type, and any combination of the following optional parameters:
Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time, Suggested number of downlink packets,
and Idle Status Indication prior to sending the Monitoring Request to the SCEF
as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, it checks whether
the Maximum Latency (if included), the Maximum Response Time (if included),
and the Suggested number of downlink packets (if included) are within the
range defined by operator policies. If not, or if the network does not support
Idle Status Indication, then depending on operator policies, the SCEF rejects
the request by performing step 9 of 5.6.1.1 with an appropriate cause value.
3\. When \"Reachability for SMS\" is requested, the SCEF subscribes with the
HSS by executing step 3 of 5.6.1.1 to get notified when the HSS is notified
that the UE is reachable. The HSS performs the UE Reachability Notification
Request procedure for getting a UE Activity Notification as described in TS
23.401 [7] and/or uses the UE Reachability function as described in TS 23.060
[6]. The Mobile-Station-Not-Reachable-Flag (MNRF) handling is described in TS
23.040 [12].
When \"Reachability for Data\" is requested, the SCEF executes step 3 of
5.6.1.1. In addition, if provided, it includes Maximum Latency, Maximum
Response Time, and Idle Status Indication.
4\. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, it checks whether
the Maximum Latency, if provided, is within the range defined by operator
policies, and if acceptable, the HSS sets the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU
timer using the value of Maximum Latency, if it is provided. If the requested
timer value is not acceptable, the HSS rejects the request by executing step
8, and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition
to the SCEF. In addition, the HSS checks whether the Suggested number of
downlink packets is within the range defined by operator policies. If it is
not, then the HSS rejects the request by executing step 8, and provides a
Cause value indicating the reason for failure condition to the SCEF. If the
subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer was previously set by a different Monitoring
Request identified by a different SCEF Reference ID for the same UE then,
depending on operator configuration, the HSS either performs step 8 to reject
the Monitoring Request with an appropriate Cause or accepts the request. In
the case that the HSS accepts this request, then it cancels the previously
accepted Monitoring Request by including the SCEF Reference ID of that
Monitoring Request in step 8. The cancelled monitoring request may be
configured previously for a single UE or a group of UEs. If the cancelled
monitoring request was configured for a group of UEs, then the monitoring
event is cancelled for all UEs in the group. If the HSS supports Idle Status
Indication, then it includes it in step 5.
NOTE 4: If the Monitoring Request message in step 4 includes a group of UEs,
the HSS checks the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer for each UE whether it
was set by a different Monitoring Request and decides either rejection or
acceptance of the Monitoring Request based on operator policy.
NOTE 5: In the present release an event subscription for a UE can be cancelled
due to conflict with a subsequent event subscription related to the Maximum
Latency setting of another UE as described above.
5\. The HSS executes step 5 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, the HSS includes
the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), Maximum Response Time (if
provided), Suggested number of downlink packets (if configured or provided),
and Idle Status Indication (if provided).
6\. The MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1 and starts watching for the
UE entering connected mode. At every subsequent TAU/RAU procedure, the
MME/SGSN applies the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer.
7\. Step 7 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed.
8\. Step 8 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed. The HSS may include the SCEF
Reference ID of previously accepted Monitoring Request which needs to be
cancelled.
9\. Step 9 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed. If SCEF Reference ID of previously
configured Monitoring Event for cancellation is included in step 8, then the
SCEF executes steps 2-5 of clause 5.6.9 using the associated TLTRI towards the
associated SCS/AS.
#### 5.6.1.5 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Location Reporting
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to request either the Current Location
or the Last Known Location of a UE. The supported Accuracy in the network may
be at different levels, which are described in clause 4.9.2. Only One-time
Reporting is supported for the Last Known Location. One-time and Continuous
Location Reporting are supported for the Current Location. For Continuous
Location Reporting, unless a Minimum Reporting Interval was provided, the
serving node(s) sends a notification every time it becomes aware of a location
change. The granularity depends on the accepted Accuracy.
Minimum Reporting Interval is an optional parameter that indicates a minimum
time interval between Location Reporting notifications. If this parameter was
provided to the MME/SGSN, when sending each Location Reporting notification,
the MME/SGSN starts a timer which runs for the duration of Minimum Reporting
Interval. While the timer is running the MME/SGSN suppresses sending Location
Reporting notification(s). If at least one Location Reporting notification was
suppressed while the timer was running, on expiry of the timer the MME/SGSN
sends location information that was contained in the latest suppressed
Location Reporting notification and restarts the timer. If the MME/SGSN is
relocated, the source MME/SGSN shall transfer the current value of the timer
to the target MME/SGSN. The target MME/SGSN shall start the timer with the
transferred value, i.e. with the time remaining from the Minimum Reporting
Interval.
NOTE 1: Due to the potential increase in signalling load, it is recommended
that a continuous monitoring of current location on cell level is only applied
for a limited number of subscribers and/or that the Minimum Reporting Interval
option is used.
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Location Reporting\", and adds
Location Type, optionally Accuracy and optionally Minimum Reporting Interval
prior to sending Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause
5.6.1.1.
Location Type indicates whether the request is for Current Location or Last
Known Location.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.
3\. If Accuracy is included in step 1 then based on operator configuration the
SCEF maps it to permissible granularity. If Accuracy is not included in step
1, the SCEF sets the granularity based on operator configuration. The SCEF
adds Location Type, Accuracy and Minimum Reporting Interval (if included in
step 1) prior to sending the Monitoring Request to the HSS as in step 3 of
clause 5.6.1.1.
4\. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1.
5\. Depending on the Location Type the HSS sets the \"Current Location
Request\" (see TS 29.272 [31]), adds Accuracy and Minimum Reporting Interval
(if included in step 3) prior to sending the Insert Subscriber Data Request to
the MME/SGSN as in step 5 of clause 5.6.1.1.
6\. The MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1 and depending on the
requested Accuracy invokes the appropriate procedures as defined in TS 23.401
[7] or TS 23.060 [6] for determining the location as requested. Unless it is a
One-time request, the MME/SGSN starts watching for cell/RA/TA/eNodeB changes,
depending on requested Accuracy.
If Minimum Reporting Interval is included in step 5, the MME/SGSN sends
Location Reporting notifications with Minimum Reporting Interval option.
7-9. Steps 7-9 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed and include the report of the
current or last known location, depending on what was requested. Depending on
operator configuration, the SCEF either maps the reported 3GPP system specific
location information to the accepted Accuracy format or sends it as-is to the
SCS/AS.
#### 5.6.1.6 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV)
Association
Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV) indicates a change of the ME (IMEI(SV)) that uses a
specific subscription (IMSI). It is based on the HSS being informed by the MME
about the UE\'s IMEI(SV) according to the procedures defined in TS 23.401 [7].
The support of this Monitoring Event by the SGSN requires the support of the
Automatic Device Detection (ADD) function/feature defined in TS 23.060 [6].
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV) Association\"
, and adds Association Type prior to sending Monitoring Request to the SCEF as
in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.
Association Type indicates whether change of IMEI or IMEISV to IMSI
association shall be detected.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.
3\. The SCEF adds Association Type prior to sending the Monitoring Request to
the HSS as in step 3 of clause 5.6.1.1.
4\. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1.
5-7. Steps 5-7 of clause 5.6.1.1 shall not be executed for this Monitoring
Event.
8-9. Steps 8-9 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed.
#### 5.6.1.7 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Roaming Status
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to query the UE\'s current roaming
status (the serving PLMN and/or whether the UE is in its HPLMN) and to get
notified when that status changes. It is based on the HSS being informed of
the UE\'s serving PLMN by the MME according to TS 23.401 [7] and by the SGSN
according to TS 23.060 [6].
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Roaming Status\" prior to sending the
Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1. Optionally, it
includes the \"PLMN Information\" parameter to request inclusion of the UE\'s
Serving PLMN ID in the Monitoring Event Report.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.
3\. The SCEF includes \"PLMN Information\", if sent in step 1, prior to
sending Monitoring Request to the HSS as in step 3 of clause 5.6.1.1.
4\. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1.
5-7. Steps 5-7 of clause 5.6.1.1 shall not be executed for this Monitoring
Event.
8-9. Steps 8-9 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed. The Monitoring Event Report for
this event is sent in the Monitoring Response message. The Monitoring Event
Report indicates whether the UE is presently roaming or not. If PLMN
Information was requested in step 1, and the operator policies allow, then the
HSS includes:
\- the HPLMN PLMN-Id if the UE is in the HPLMN or
\- the Visited PLMN-Id (see TS 29.272 [31]) if the UE is in the VPLMN.
#### 5.6.1.8 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Communication failure
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to be notified of communication
failure events, identified by RAN/NAS Release Cause codes per TS 23.401 [7].
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Communication Failure\" prior to
sending Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.
3\. The SCEF executes step 3 of clause 5.6.1.1.
4\. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1.
5\. The HSS executes step 5 of clause 5.6.1.1.
6\. The MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1 and starts watching for
communication failure events.
7-9. Steps 7-9 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed.
#### 5.6.1.9 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Availability after DDN
Failure
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to be notified of availability of the
UE after a DDN failure has occurred (see clause 5.7.1 Availability
Notification after DDN Failure).
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Availability after DDN Failure\", and
optionally Idle Status Indication prior to sending the Monitoring Request to
the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.
3\. The SCEF executes step 3 of clause 5.6.1.1 without adding Max Number of
Reports, since the \"Availability after DDN Failure\" is an ongoing event that
needs explicit deletion (see clause 5.6.1 for a description of Monitoring
Event Deletion procedures) to cancel further reports.
4-5. Steps 4-5 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed.
6\. The MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1 and starts watching for UE
availability after DDN failure events.
7-9. Steps 7-9 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed.
### 5.6.2 Monitoring Events configuration and deletion directly at the
MME/SGSN
#### 5.6.2.1 Configuration Procedure
Figure 5.6.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure of configuring monitoring at the
MME/SGSN. The procedure is common for various monitoring event types. Common
parameters for this procedure are detailed in clause 5.6.2.2. The steps
specific to different Monitoring Event types are detailed in clause 5.6.2.3.
This procedure is not applicable for group configuration.
Figure 5.6.2.1-1: Monitoring event configuration and deletion directly at
MME/SGSN procedure
1\. The SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Request (SCS/AS Identifier, Monitoring Type,
Monitoring Duration, Maximum Number of Reports, T8 Destination Address, TLTRI
for Deletion) message to the SCEF. The SCEF assigns a TLTRI that identifies
the Monitoring Request.
NOTE: A relative priority scheme for the treatment of multiple SCS/AS
Monitoring Requests, e.g. for deciding which requests to serve under overload
condition, can be applied. This priority scheme is used locally by the SCEF,
i.e. it is not used nor translated in procedures towards other functions.
2\. The SCEF stores the TLTRI, and also assigns it to an SCEF Reference ID.
Based on operator policies, if either the SCS/AS is not authorized to perform
this request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or the Monitoring Request
is malformed or the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting
monitoring requests, the SCEF performs step 6 and provides a Cause value
appropriately indicating the error. The SCEF stores the Monitoring Duration,
the Maximum Number of Reports, the T8 Destination Address, the SCS/AS
Identifier. If the SCEF received a TLTRI for Deletion, the SCEF looks up the
SCEF context pointed to by the TLTRI to derive the related SCEF Reference ID
for Deletion. If an External Group Identifier(s) was included in the request
of step 1, then then flow proceeds to step 2a, otherwise steps 2a and 2b are
skipped.
2a. When the SCS/AS includes External Group Identifier(s) in the monitoring
request, the SCEF sends an External Group ID Resolution Request (External
Group Identifier(s)) message to the HSS.
2b. The HSS resolves the External Group Identifier(s) to IMSI-Group
Identifier(s) and sends an External Group ID Resolution Response (IMSI-Group
Identifier(s)) message to the SCEF.
3\. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Request (SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID,
Monitoring Type, Monitoring Duration, Maximum Number of Reports, SCEF
Reference ID for Deletion) message to the MME(s)/SGSN(s).
4\. The MME/SGSN examines whether it can accept the request from that SCEF
based on operator configuration or whether it serves the SCEF Reference ID for
Deletion and can delete it. If acceptable, the MME/SGSN stores SCEF ID, SCEF
Reference ID, Monitoring Duration, Maximum Number of Reports and other
relevant parameters unless it is a One-time request and the Monitoring Event
is available to the MME/SGSN at this time. The MME/SGSN deletes the monitoring
configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, if provided.
5\. The MME/SGSN sends a Monitoring Response (SCEF Reference ID, Cause)
message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the Monitoring Request and to
provide the requested monitoring information or to acknowledge the deletion of
the identified monitoring event configuration, if it was requested.
6\. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Response (TLTRI, Cause, Monitoring Event
Report) message to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the Monitoring
Request and to provide the requested monitoring information in Monitoring
Event Report parameter or to acknowledge the deletion of the identified
monitoring event configuration, if it was requested.
#### 5.6.2.2 Void
#### 5.6.2.3 Specific Steps for Monitoring Event: Number of UEs present in a
geographic area
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to ask for the number of UEs that are
in the geographic area described by the SCS/AS. The SCS/AS may ask for the UEs
that the system knows by its normal operation to be within the area (Last
Known Location) or the SCS/AS may request the system to also actively look for
the UEs within the area (Current Location). Whether the request is for Current
Location or Last Known Location is indicated by the parameter Location Type.
For this monitoring event only One-time reporting is supported and the
Monitoring Duration as well as the Maximum Number of Reports parameters shall
be ignored by the SCEF if present in the request.
In this release only Last Known Location is supported for this monitoring
event.
When the SCS/AS includes External Group Identifier(s) in the monitoring
request, the MME/SGSN counts the number of UEs at the requested location that
have each IMSI Group Identifier(s) in its subscription information
corresponding to the External Group Identifier(s) received from SCS/AS. The
report that is provided by the network to the SCS/AS shall include the number
of UEs in the geographic area per External Group Identifier.
NOTE 1: The system load resulting from this request may be highly dependent on
Location Type.
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Number of UEs present in a geographic
area\" and adds Location Type and Geographic Area before sending Monitoring
Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.2.1. The request may optionally
include External Group Identifier(s).
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.2.1. In addition, the SCEF maps the
Geographic Area to a list of cells, eNodeBs and/or RAI(s)/TAI(s) and
identifies the MMEs/SGSNs serving them by resolving the RA(s)/TA(s) to node
addresses.
NOTE 2: The mapping of Geographic Areas to serving operator (MNO) network list
of cells, eNodeBs and/or RAs/TAs, and the identity of the associated serving
nodes (e.g. MMEs/SGSNs) is configured at the SCEF.
3\. The SCEF adds Monitoring Type, Location Type, list of cells, eNodeBs
and/or RAI(s)/TAI(s) before sending the Monitoring Request to those MMEs/SGSNs
identified in step 3 of clause 5.6.2.1. If External Group Identifier(s) were
included in step 1, then the IMSI-Group Identifier(s) that were obtained in
step 2 are included in the request to the MME/SGSN.
4\. The MME/SGSN executes step 4 of clause 5.6.2.1. In addition, if the
request is for Last Known Location with cell or eNodeB granularity or for a
location with RA/TA granularity, the MMEs/SGSNs collect all UEs for which the
MME/SGSN stores a last known cell, eNodeB or RA/TA registration information
that corresponds to the requested location.
NOTE 3: For Location Type Last Known Location, how the MME/SGSN determines the
candidate set of UEs to be included is left to implementation.
5\. The MME/SGSN executes step 5 of clause 5.6.2.1. The response from the
MME/SGSN includes the count of the number of UEs at the requested location. If
the request of step 3 included an IMSI-Group Identifier(s), the report from
the MME/SGSN shall include the number of UEs in the geographic area per IMSI-
Group Identifier(s). When IMSI-Group Identifier(s) were included in the
request of step 3, the MME/SGSN may optionally, depending on operator
configuration, include either the External Identifiers or the MSISDNs of the
UEs that are associated with each IMSI-Group Identifier(s).
6\. The SCEF combines the results from all involved MMEs/SGSNs to the total
sum, i.e. the Number of UEs, and executes step 6 of clause 5.6.2.1. When
External Identifiers or MSISDNs were included in the results that were
received from the MME(s)/SGSN(s) in step 5, they are included in the response
to the SCS/AS.
### 5.6.3 Reporting of Monitoring Events from the HSS or the MME/SGSN
#### 5.6.3.1 Reporting Procedure
The following figure illustrates the common procedure flow of reporting
Monitoring Events that are detected by the MME/SGSN or HSS. The steps specific
to different Monitoring Event types are detailed in clauses 5.6.3.2 to
5.6.3.8.
Figure 5.6.3.1-1: Monitoring event reporting procedure
1a. A Monitoring Event is detected by the MME/SGSN at which the Monitoring
Event is configured.
1b. Either a Monitoring Event is detected by the HSS, or the HSS needs to
inform the SCEF about the change of status (suspend/resume/cancel) of an
ongoing monitoring if an event related with the change of monitoring support
at the serving node, (e.g. lack of monitoring support in MME/SGSN or
revocation of monitoring authorization) is detected in the HSS. The HSS also
stores the time when the Event is detected or the status is changed.
2a. The MME/SGSN sends a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID(s),
Monitoring Event Report, User Identity) message to the SCEF. The SCEF store
the time when it receives the Monitoring Indication.
If the Monitoring Event configuration was triggered by a One-time Monitoring
Request, then the Monitoring Event configuration is deleted by the MME/SGSN
upon completion of this step. If the MME/SGSN has a Maximum Number of Reports
stored for this monitoring task, the MME/SGSN shall decrease its value by one.
If the value of remaining number of reports is zero, the MME/SGSN shall
locally remove the Monitoring Event Configuration. If the Monitoring Event
configuration includes User Identity, the MME/SGSN sends the Monitoring
Indication message including the User Identity. So that the SCEF can determine
what groups the report pertains to, multiple SCEF Reference IDs can be
included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same monitoring
indication.
2b. When reporting for an individual UE or individual Group Member UE, the HSS
sends a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID(s), External ID or MSISDN,
Monitoring Event Report) message to the SCEF. External ID or MSISDN are only
included if the indication is associated with an individual Group Member UE.
If the Monitoring Event configuration was triggered by a One-time Monitoring
Request, then the Monitoring Event configuration for the individual UE and for
the individual group member UE is deleted by the HSS upon completion of this
step. If the HSS has a Maximum Number of Reports stored for this monitoring
task, the HSS shall decrease its value by one. Based on SCEF Reference ID the
SCEF can determine what groups the report pertains to. Multiple SCEF Reference
IDs can be included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same
monitoring indication.
If Group Reporting Guard Time was provided during the Monitoring Event
configuration procedure, the HSS accumulates a Monitoring Event for the UEs of
the group within the Group Reporting Guard Time. After the Group Reporting
Guard Time expiration, the HSS send a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference
ID, (Monitoring Event Report(s), External ID or MSISDN) Set, External Group
ID) message to the SCEF. For each group member UE all the Monitoring Event
Report and the corresponding stored time(s) are sent to the SCEF.
The External Group ID may be included in the message to indicate that the
event has been detected for all group members. When the External Group ID is
included in the indication, External ID(s) and MSISDN(s) are optional.
NOTE: For the group-basis Monitoring Event configuration, the HSS may divide
the accumulated Monitoring Event Reports into multiple Monitoring indication
messages due to the limitation of the message size.
3a. Using the SCEF Reference ID, the SCEF retrieves the associated TLTRI along
with the T8 Destination Address.
If the TLTRI refers to a Monitoring Event Configuration for a single UE, the
SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, Cause, Monitoring Event Report)
message to the identified destination. If the TLTRI refers to a group-based
Monitoring Event configuration, and if no Group Reporting Guard Time was set,
then the SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI(s), Cause, Monitoring Event
Report) message to the identified destination. So that the SCEF can determine
what groups the report pertains to, multiple TLTRIs can be included if the UE
is part of multiple groups that require the same monitoring indication.
If the TLTRI refers to a group-based Monitoring Event Configuration, and if
Group Reporting Guard Time was provided during the Monitoring Event
configuration procedure, then the SCEF accumulates Monitoring Event for the
UEs of the group until the Group Reporting Guard Time expiry. Upon expiration
of which, the SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, Cause, list of
(External Identifier or MSISDN, Monitoring Event Report(s))) message to the
identified destination. A list of accumulated Monitoring Event Report for each
group member UE identified by either External Identifier or MSISDN is also
included. For each group member UE all the received Monitoring Event Report,
and the corresponding time received at SCEF or the time value sent by HSS, are
sent to the SCS/AS.
For individual UE, if a report is received (step 2a or step 2b) for One-time
Monitoring Request or the maximum number of reports is reached for a
Continuous Monitoring Request, the SCEF requests the HSS (for monitoring
events configured via HSS) to delete the related monitoring event
configuration for the individual UE and deletes also its associated Monitoring
Event configuration according to the procedure of clause 5.6.1.1 step 3-8.
For an individual group member UE, if a report is received (step 2a or step
2b) for One-time Monitoring Request or the maximum number of reports is
reached for a Continuous Monitoring Request, based on the Number of UEs
received in step 4a in clause 5.6.1.1 and local policy, the SCEF shall either:
\- request the HSS (for monitoring events configured via HSS) to delete the
related monitoring event configuration for the individual group member UE; or
\- wait until reports for all group member UEs are complete and then request
the HSS (for monitoring events configured via HSS) to delete the related
monitoring event configuration.
The SCEF uses the identity of individual group member UE(s) (i.e. External
Identifier or MSISDN) received in the step 2a or step 2b and the Number of UEs
received in step 4a in clause 5.6.1.1 to determine if reporting for the group
is complete. If it is complete, the SCEF deletes the associated Monitoring
Event configuration for the group.
3b. For each Monitoring Indication message received in step 3a, the SCS/AS
sends a Monitoring Indication Response (Cause) message to the SCEF. Cause
value reflects successful or unsuccessful acknowledgement of Monitoring
Indication message.
When the Monitoring Duration expires for a continuous Monitoring Request in
the HSS, the MME/SGSN or the SCEF, then each of these nodes shall locally
delete the related Monitoring Event configuration associated with the
individual UE or group member UE.
#### 5.6.3.2 Reporting Event: Loss of connectivity
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the mobile reachability timer expires, when an active UE is purged
(see TS 29.272 [31]), when ISR is disabled and a UE, MME, SGSN, or HSS
initiated detach occurs (see TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.060 [6]), or when ISR is
enabled and a UE, MME, SGSN, or HSS initiated detach occurs and the MME or
SGSN sends a Detach Notification message to the SGSN or MME with a Cause value
that indicates complete, see (TS 23.401 [7]).
2a. Step 2a of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
#### 5.6.3.3 Reporting Event: UE reachability
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the UE changes to connected mode or when the UE will become reachable
for paging (for a UE using extended idle mode DRX).
If Maximum Response Time was included in step 5 of clause 5.6.1.4, then the
MME/SGSN keeps the corresponding S1-U/Iu-PS connections of the UE for a
duration of at least the Maximum Response Time less the UE\'s PSM Active Timer
value. If the UE uses extended idle mode DRX, the MME/SGSN takes the Maximum
Response Time into account to determine when to report this monitoring event
before the next Paging Occasion occurs.
1b. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1b of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the HSS detects that the UE is reachable for SMS.
2a. Step 2a of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed. The Monitoring Event Report
indicates if the event was caused by the UE changing to connected mode or by
the UE becoming reachable for paging.
2b. Step 2b of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Steps 3a-3b of clause 5.6.3.1 are executed. The Monitoring Event Report
indicates if the event was caused by the UE changing to connected mode or by
the UE becoming reachable for paging. If Idle Status Indication was not
requested during Monitoring Event configuration, then the flow stops here.
4\. UE transitions to idle mode as specified in TS 23.401 [7].
5\. If Idle Status Indication was requested during Monitoring Event
configuration, and the MME/SGSN supports Idle Status Indication, then MME
executes step 1a, and includes the time at which the UE transitioned into idle
mode, its granted active time (if PSM is enabled), the eDRX cycle length (if
extended idle mode DRX is enabled), the periodic TAU/RAU timer granted to the
UE by the MME and the Suggested number of downlink packets if a value was
provided to the S-GW in the message.
6\. The SCEF executes steps 3a-3b of clause 5.6.3.1, and includes additional
parameters specified in step 5 above.
#### 5.6.3.4 Reporting Event: Location Reporting
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the MME/SGSN detects that the UE changes location with the granularity
as requested by the monitoring event configuration.
2a. Step 2a of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed. Depending on operator configuration,
the SCEF either maps the reported 3GPP system specific location information to
the accepted Accuracy format, sent in step 9 of clause 5.6.1.5, or sends it
as-is to the SCS/AS.
#### 5.6.3.5 Reporting Event: Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV) association
1b. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1b of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the HSS receives from a serving node an IMEI(SV) that is different
from the IMEI(SV) stored by the HSS for the IMSI.
2b. Step 2b of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
#### 5.6.3.6 Reporting Event: Roaming Status
1b. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1b of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the HSS receives from a serving node a serving PLMN ID that is
different from the one stored by the HSS.
2b. Step 2b of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed. The monitoring information indicates
the ID of the serving PLMN and whether it is the home or a roaming PLMN.
Operator policies in the SCEF may restrict the report, e.g. to indicate only
whether the UE is in the home or in a roaming PLMN.
#### 5.6.3.7 Reporting Event: Communication failure
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the MME/SGSN becomes aware of a RAN or NAS failure event.
2a. Step 2a of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed. Based on operator configuration, the
SCEF reports either the received failure cause code(s) as-is or an abstracted
value.
#### 5.6.3.8 Reporting Event: Availability after DDN failure
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.3.1, which
is when the MME/SGSN becomes aware of UE availability after DDN failure.
2a. Step 2a of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.3.1 is executed.
### 5.6.4 Monitoring events configuration and reporting via PCRF
#### 5.6.4.1 Request of monitoring event reporting
Figure 5.6.4-1 illustrates the procedure to request monitoring events
reporting via PCRF with a reference to TS 23.203 [27]. The procedure is common
for any monitoring event defined in clause 4.5.6.3 \"Monitoring Events via
PCRF\".
Figure 5.6.4-1: Requesting monitoring via PCRF
1\. The SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Request to the SCEF, including the
information listed in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.
2\. The SCEF checks that the SCS/AS is authorised to send monitoring request
as defined in step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1. If an error is detected, then the
message of step 4 is sent to SCS/AS with Cause value appropriately indicating
the error and the flow stops at this step.
3\. If operator policies indicate that monitoring is performed via PCRF, for
the events listed in clause 4.5.6, the SCEF, acting as an Application
Function, triggers the PCRF initiated-IP-CAN session modification procedure
defined in TS 23.203 [27].
4\. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Response (Cause, Monitoring Event Report)
message to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF received a Monitoring Event Report then it
includes it in the Monitoring Response message.
#### 5.6.4.1a Request of monitoring event reporting for a group of UEs
Figure 5.6.4.1a-1 illustrates the procedure to request monitoring events
reporting via PCRF for a group of UEs with a reference to TS 23.203 [27].
For monitoring for a group of UEs, the SPR is configured with the External
Group Identifier the UE belongs to.
Figure 5.6.4.1a-1: Requesting monitoring via PCRF for a group of UEs
1\. The SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Request to the SCEF, including the
information listed in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1 in figure 5.6.1.1-1. Maximum
Number of Reports and Monitoring Duration shall not be included in the
request.
2\. The SCEF checks that the SCS/AS is authorised to send monitoring request
as defined in step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1 in figure 5.6.1.1-1. If an error is
detected, steps 3-4 are skipped, the message of step 5 is sent to SCS/AS with
Cause value appropriately indicating the error, and the flow stops.
3\. If operator policies indicate that monitoring is performed via PCRF, for
the events listed in clause 4.5.6 applicable for a group of UEs, the SCEF
triggers a Monitoring Request (SCEF Reference ID, External Group Identifier,
event to monitor) over Nt interface to each PCRF in the operator´s network.
4\. Each PCRF that serves a UE that is associated with the External Group
Identifier stores the External Group Identifier, the event to monitor, the
SCEF Reference ID, and the SCEF that sent the request and then sends a
Monitoring Response message to the SCEF. If a PCRF serves no UEs that are
associated with the External Group Identifier, the Monitoring Response
Indicates that the PCRF is not currently serving any of the group members, and
steps 6 and 7 are skipped for that PCRF.
5\. The SCEF stores an indication that monitoring has been requested for the
group of UEs for each PCRF that did not respond in step 4 with an indication
that it is serving no group members. and then Once all PCRFs have responded in
step 4, the SCEF and then sends a Monitoring Response (Cause) message to the
SCS/AS.
6\. Each PCRF that found a UE that has the External Group Identifier
associated with it performs the following steps:
\- For each UE that has an IP-CAN session established, the PCRF initiated-IP-
CAN session modification procedure is triggered as defined in TS 23.203 [27].
Note that if the UE has multiple IP-CAN session established, only one PCRF
initiated IP-CAN session modification is needed. The PCRF stored the SCEF
address to report monitoring events for this group.
7\. The PCRF sends a Monitoring Indication ((MSISDN or External ID, SCEF
Reference ID, Cause) message to the SCEF. The Monitoring Indication may
include reports for multiple UEs. If the Monitoring Indication does not
include information for all UEs in the group, then the PCRF may send multiple
Monitoring Indications to the SCEF. The PCRF indicates to the SCEF when the
result for the last UE in the group is sent. The same PCRF will not send
duplicate reports for the same UE to the SCEF.
NOTE: A UE may have established multiple IP-CAN sessions, each IP-CAN session
under control of a different PCRFs.
8a. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, MSISDN or External ID,
Cause) message to the SCS/AS. The Monitoring Indication may include reports
for multiple UEs. If the Monitoring Indication does not include information
for all UEs in the group, then the SCEF may send multiple Monitoring
Indications to the SCS/AS. The SCEF indicates to the SCS/AS when the result
for the last UE is sent. The SCEF may wait for Monitoring Indication messages
from multiple PCRFs so that it can send an aggregated response to the SCS/AS.
8b. For each Monitoring Indication message received in step 8a, the SCS/AS
sends a Monitoring Indication Response (Cause) message to the SCEF. Cause
value reflects successful or unsuccessful acknowledgement of Monitoring
Indication message.
#### 5.6.4.2 Common Parameters of the request reporting procedure
The following parameters are applicable when the procedure for monitoring via
PCRF is used: TLTRI, Monitoring Type, Priority and T8 Destination Address.
The Monitoring types are defined in clause 4.5.6. The Priority is relevant to
the SCEF, not transferred over Rx or Nt.
For single UE monitoring, the following parameters are not applicable when the
procedure for monitoring via PCRF is used: SCEF Address, SCEF Reference ID,
and Maximum Number of Reports. The SCEF address is not needed as Rx procedures
do not require the AF address to be sent. The Maximum Number of Reports is not
needed as only one time report is supported.
The following parameters are needed for the procedure for monitoring via PCRF
for a request for an individual UE: UE IP address and service information
(e.g. application identifier or media description or both).
The following parameters are needed for the procedure for monitoring via PCRF
for a request for group of UEs: External Group identifier.
NOTE: The UE IP address provided by the SCS/AS is assumed to not be NAT\'ed
from the PDN-GW or GGSN to the SCS/AS at user plane. The UE IP address does
not overlap with other UE IP addresses within the operator domain.
For monitoring for a group of UEs, the SPR is configured with the External
Group Identifier the UE belongs to and External Identifier and the SCEF is
configured with the list of PCRFs in the operator´s domain. The formats of the
External Group Identifier and External Identifier are defined in clause 4.6.
#### 5.6.4.3 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Location Reporting
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to request the Current Location. The
supported Accuracy may be at different levels which are described in clause
4.9.2. The Monitoring Event Report delivers the subscriber location and may
include a time stamp to indicate when the UE was last-known to be in that
location, i.e. if the current location or last-know location is provided.
NOTE: SCEF can map IP-CAN provided location to the location granularity
required by SCS/AS only if it is configured to do so.
The description below is applicable if SCS/AS request Monitoring Type to
\"Location Reporting\" for a single UE and Location Type is either \"current
location\" or \"last known location\".
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Location Reporting\", and adds
Location Type in a Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of 5.6.4.1.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of 5.6.4.1.
3\. The SCEF triggers PCRF initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure,
including the UE IP address and the Access Network information report request.
The PCRF provides the Access Network Information report to the SCEF.
4\. Based on operator policies, the SCEF either maps the location information
to a geo-location or sends the location information to the SCS/AS. If the time
stamp is included indicating that this is the last known location the SCEF
indicates in the location type that this is last known location.
The description below is applicable if SCS/AS request Monitoring Type to
\"Location Reporting\" for a group of UEs and Location Type is either
\"current location\" or \"last known location\".
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Location Reporting\", and adds
Location Type in a Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of 5.6.4.1a.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of 5.6.4.1a.
3\. The SCEF triggers a Monitoring Request (External Group Identifier, Access
Network information report request) to the PCRF over Nt interface to each PCRF
in the operator´s network.
4\. Each PCRF executes step 4 of 5.6.4.1a. If a PCRF serves no UEs that are
associated with the External Group Identifier, steps 6 and 7 are skipped for
that PCRF.
5\. The SCEF executes step 5 of 5.6.4.1a.
6\. The PCRF executes step 6 of 5.6.4.1a. For those UEs that have an IP-CAN
session established, the PCRF initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure,
including the Access Network information report request is performed. The PCRF
stores the received Access Network Information for each IP-CAN session
7\. The PCRF executes step 7 of 5.6.4.1a. The Monitoring Indication includes
Access Network Information for each UE.
8a. The SCEF executes step 8a of 5.6.4.1a. The response includes location
information for each group member UE. Based on operator policies, the SCEF
either maps the Access Network Information to a geo-location or sends the
Access Network Information to the SCS/AS. If the time stamp is included
indicating that this is the last known location the SCEF indicates in the
location type that this is last known location.
8b. The SCS/AS executes step 8b of 5.6.4.1a.
#### 5.6.4.4 Specific Parameters for Monitoring Event: Communication Failure
This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to be notified of communication
failure events, identified by RAN/NAS or TWAN/UWAN Release Cause codes, per TS
23.203 [27].
1\. The SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Communication Failure\" in the
Monitoring Request to the SCEF sent as in step 1 of 5.6.4.1.
2\. The SCEF executes step 2 of 5.6.4.1.
3\. The SCEF triggers PCRF initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure,
including the UE IP address and the dynamic session information. The PCRF
provisions PCC Rules according to the provided session information. If the
PCEF provides either RAN/NAS release code in GPRS/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, TWAN release
code in TWAN or Untrusted WLAN release code the PCRF sends it to the SCEF.
4\. Based on operation policies the SCEF may normalize the Release code to
acceptable values per SLA that the SCS/AS accepts.
### 5.6.5 Reporting of Monitoring Events from the PCRF
The following figure illustrates the procedure to report Monitoring Events via
PCRF. This procedure is applicable for reporting both user location
information and communication failure for a single UE. This procedure does not
apply to group monitoring. It is assumes that PCRF subscribes to Access
Network Information report.
Figure 5.6.5-1: Reporting event procedure
1\. The PCEF reports a monitoring event, either the location reporting stored
in MME at Detach or dedicated bearer deactivation or a communication failure
at dedicated bearer deactivation to the PCRF using PCEF initiated IP-CAN
session modification or termination procedure defined in TS 23.203 [27], then
the PCRF to the SCEF over Rx if the event was requested over Rx. Both events
terminate the AF session to the SCEF.
2a. The SCEF retrieves the TLTRI along with the address of SCS/AS intended for
Monitoring Indication message for the associated Rx session. The SCEF sends a
Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, UE IP Address, Monitoring Event Report) message
to the SCS/AS identified by T8 Destination Address stored in the SCEF.
2b. The SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Indication Response (Cause) message to the
SCEF. Cause value reflects successful or unsuccessful acknowledgement of
Monitoring Indication message.
### 5.6.6 Monitoring Event configuration and deletion via HSS for roaming
scenarios using an IWK-SCEF
#### 5.6.6.1 Configuration Procedure
Figure 5.6.6.1-1 illustrates the procedure of configuring monitoring events at
the HSS or the MME/SGSN. The procedure is common for various Monitoring Event
types. The steps and parameters specific to different Monitoring Event types
are detailed in clauses 5.6.6.3 to 5.6.6.9.
The procedure is also used for deleting a previously configured Monitoring
Event while configuring a new Monitoring Event between the same SCEF and the
same SCS/AS.
Figure 5.6.6.1-1: Monitoring event configuration and deletion via HSS
procedure
1-5. Steps of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed.
6\. If the MME/SGSN is configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the SCEF
and it is a One-time request and the Monitoring Event is available to the
MME/SGSN, then the MME/SGSN collects the Monitoring Event data and includes it
as Monitoring Event Report in step 10 so that the IWK-SCEF may perform
normalization of Monitoring Event Report(s) according to operator policies, if
required.
7-9. Steps 7-9 of clause 5.6.1.1.are executed.
10\. MME/SGSN may send an Inform IWK-SCEF (Monitoring Type, SCEF ID, SCEF
Reference ID, Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, SCEF Reference
ID for Deletion, Chargeable Party Identifier, Monitoring Event Report) message
to the IWK-SCEF.
11\. The IWK-SCEF may authorize the request, e.g. if the Monitoring Type is
covered by a roaming agreement and notes the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion if
available. If this authorization fails the IWK-SCEF follows step 12 and
provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the
MME/SGSN. Based on operator policies, the IWK-SCEF may also reject the request
due to other reasons (e.g. overload or MME/SGSN has exceeded its quota or rate
of submitting monitoring requests defined by an SLA).
If the request indicates deletion of a Monitoring Event Request, the IWK-SCEF
shall perform any final operations necessary, e.g., generation of final
charging information, delete any stored parameters, and send an
acknowledgement to the MME/SGSN in step 12.
If the request indicates continuous reporting (new or a modification), the
IWK-SCEF may authorize the request and, if authorization is successful, stores
the received parameters, sends an acknowledgement to the MME/SGSN in step 12,
and starts to watch for the indicated Monitoring Event(s).
If the request indicates One-time reporting, then the IWK-SCEF may authorize
the request and, if authorization is successful, may perform normalization of
the data according to operator policies, and sends an acknowledgement to the
MME/SGSN in step 12 that contains any such normalized data.
If the request included Monitoring Event Data then the IWK-SCEF may perform
normalization of the data according to operator policies.
12\. If the authorization is successful, the IWK-SCEF sends an Authorization
from IWK-SCEF (Cause, Monitoring Event Report) message to MME/SGSN.
The Monitoring Event Report is included in case it was a One-time request, the
MME/SGSN provided the Monitoring Event Report in the Inform IWK-SCEF message
and the IWK-SCEF is not reporting directly to the SCEF as described clause
5.6.8.1 step 2c.
13\. The MME/SGSN may verify the request, e.g. if the Monitoring Type is
covered by a roaming agreement when the request is from another PLMN or
whether it serves the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion and can delete it. If
this check fails the MME/SGSN follows step 14 and provides a Cause value
indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF. Based on operator
policies, the MME/SGSN may also reject the request due to other reasons (e.g.
overload or HSS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting monitoring
requests defined by an SLA).
The MME/SGSN starts to watch for the indicated Monitoring Event unless it is a
One-time request and the Monitoring Event is available to the MME/SGSN at the
time of sending Insert Subscriber Data Answer. The MME/SGSN deletes the
monitoring configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, if
provided.
NOTE 2: The MME/SGSN will transfer the parameters stored for every monitoring
task as part of its context information during an MME/SGSN change.
14\. If the monitoring event configuration status received from IWK-SCEF is
different than the result reported to the HSS in Step 7, the MME/SGSN shall
send the Notify Request to the HSS to inform the monitoring event
configuration status received from IWK-SCEF.
15\. The HSS send the Notify Answer to the MME/SGSN.
16\. If the HSS receives in step 14 the monitoring event configuration status
from the MME/SGSN, the HSS shall notify the SCEF that the configured
Monitoring Event is cancelled for the individual UE for those monitoring event
configurations for which the status received from the MME/SGSN is marked as
not accepted. The HSS shall subsequently locally delete the Monitoring Event
for the individual UE and for the individual group member UE if the Monitoring
Event is configured in the HSS, and steps 1-5 of clause 5.6.9 are executed.

sets the granularity based on operator configuration. The SCEF adds Location
Type and Accuracy prior to sending the Monitoring Request to the HSS as in
step 3 of clause 5.6.1.5.
4-5. Steps 4-5 clause 5.6.1.5 are executed.
6\. If the MME/SGSN is configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the SCEF
and it is a One-time request, the MME/SGSN starts watching for
cell/RA/TA/eNodeB changes, depending on requested Accuracy, and includes the
location information as part of the Monitoring Event Data to the IWK-SCEF in
step 7.

10\. If the MME/SGSN is configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the
SCEF, then the MME/SGSN either starts to watch for the indicated Monitoring
Event, or if the IWK-SCEF rejected the request the MME/SGSN rejects the
request with the cause provided by the IWK-SCEF.
If the MME/SGSN is not configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the SCEF,
then the MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1 and in addition perform
any actions required e.g. generating charging/accounting information.
11-13. Steps 7-9 of clause 5.6.1.1 are executed and include the report of the
current or last known location, depending on what was requested. The SCEF, if
not already done by the IWK-SCEF, maps eNodeB-ID/cell-ID/RAI/TAI to geo-
location before reporting to the SCS/AS.

### 5.6.7 Monitoring Events configuration and deletion directly at the
MME/SGSN for roaming scenarios
In this Release there is no support for Monitoring Events configuration and
deletion directly at the MME/SGSN for roaming scenarios.
### 5.6.8 Reporting of Monitoring Events from the HSS or the MME/SGSN for
roaming scenarios
#### 5.6.8.1 Reporting Procedure
The following figure illustrates the common procedure flow of reporting
Monitoring Events that are detected by the MME/SGSN or HSS for roaming
scenarios. The steps specific to different Monitoring Event types are detailed
in clauses 5.6.8.2 to 5.6.8.8.
Figure 5.6.8.1-1: Monitoring event reporting procedure for roaming scenarios
1a. A Monitoring Event is detected by the MME/SGSN at which the Monitoring
Event is configured.
1b. Either a Monitoring Event is detected by the HSS, or the HSS needs to
inform the SCEF about the change of status (suspend/resume/cancel) of an
ongoing monitoring if an event related with the change of monitoring support
at the serving node, (e.g. lack of monitoring support in MME/SGSN or
revocation of monitoring authorization) is detected in the HSS.
2a. If the MME/SGSN is not configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the
SCEF then the MME/SGSN executes step 2a in clause 5.6.3.1. The MME/SGSN in
addition generates any required charging/accounting information.
2b. The HSS executes step 2b in clause 5.6.3.1.
2c. If the MME/SGSN is configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the SCEF,
then the MME/SGSN sends a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID(s),
Monitoring Event Report, User Identity) message to the IWK-SCEF. If the
Monitoring Event configuration was triggered by a One-time Monitoring Request,
then the Monitoring Event configuration is deleted by the MME/SGSN upon
completion of this step. If the MME/SGSN has a Maximum Number of Reports
stored for this monitoring task, the MME/SGSN shall decrease its value by one.
If the value of remaining number of reports is zero, the MME/SGSN shall
locally remove the Monitoring Event Configuration. So that the SCEF can
determine what groups the report pertains to, multiple SCEF Reference IDs can
be included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same
monitoring indication.
The IWK-SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID(s), Monitoring
Event Report, User Identity) message to the SCEF. If the IWK-SCEF has a
Maximum Number of Reports stored for this monitoring task, the IWK-SCEF shall
decrease its value by one. When the maximum number of reports is reached for a
Continuous Monitoring Request or in case of a One-time Monitoring Request, the
IWK-SCEF ends the reporting on the SCEF Reference ID. So that the SCEF can
determine what groups the report pertains to, multiple SCEF Reference IDs can
be included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same
monitoring indication.
3\. The SCEF executes step 3 in clause 5.6.3.1.
When the Monitoring Duration expires for a continuous Monitoring Request in
the HSS, the MME/SGSN, the IWK-SCEF (if it is used in the visited PLMN) or the
SCEF, then each of these nodes shall locally delete the related Monitoring
Event configuration associated with the individual UE or group member UE.
#### 5.6.8.2 Reporting Event: Loss of connectivity
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.8.1, which
is when the mobile reachability timer expires, when an active UE is purged
(see TS 29.272 [31]), when ISR is disabled and a UE, MME, SGSN, or HSS
initiated detach occurs (see TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.060 [6]), or when ISR is
enabled and a UE, MME, SGSN, or HSS initiated detach occurs and the MME or
SGSN sends a Detach Notification message to the SGSN or MME with a Cause value
that indicates complete, see (TS 23.401 [7]).
2\. Dependent on MME/SGSN configuration step 2a or 2c of clause 5.6.8.1 is
executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.8.1 is executed.
#### 5.6.8.3 Reporting Event: UE reachability
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.8.1, which
is when the UE changes to connected mode or when the UE will become reachable
for paging (for a UE using extended idle mode DRX).
If Maximum Response Time was included in step 5 of clause 5.6.6.4, then the
MME/SGSN keeps the corresponding S1-U/Iu-PS connections of the UE for a
duration of at least the Maximum Response Time less the UE\'s PSM Active Timer
value. If the UE uses extended idle mode DRX, the MME/SGSN takes the Maximum
Response Time into account to determine when to report this monitoring event
before the next Paging Occasion occurs.
2\. Dependent on MME/SGSN configuration step 2a or 2c of clause 5.6.8.1 is
executed. The Monitoring Event Report indicates if the event was caused by the
UE changing to connected mode or by the UE becoming reachable for paging.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.8.1 is executed.
#### 5.6.8.4 Reporting Event: Location Reporting
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.8.1, which
is when the MME/SGSN detects that the UE changes location with the granularity
as requested by the monitoring event configuration.
2\. Dependent on MME/SGSN configuration step 2a or 2c of clause 5.6.8.1 is
executed. If step 2c is executed, then the IWK-SCEF maps the reported 3GPP
system specific location information to a geo-location and forwards it to the
SCEF.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.8.1 is executed. The SCEF may map the reported 3GPP
system specific location information to a geo-location and reports it.
#### 5.6.8.5 Reporting Event: Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV) association
This monitoring event is executes as in clause 5.6.3.5.
#### 5.6.8.6 Reporting Event: Roaming Status
This monitoring event is executes as in clause 5.6.3.6.
#### 5.6.8.7 Reporting Event: Communication failure
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.8.1, which
is when the MME/SGSN becomes aware of a RAN or NAS failure event.
2\. Dependent on MME/SGSN configuration step 2a or 2c of clause 5.6.8.1 is
executed. If step 2c is executed, then the IWK-SCEF either forwards the the
received failure cause code(s) as-is or an abstracted value to the SCEF.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.8.1 is executed. Based on operator configuration, the
SCEF reports either the received failure cause code(s) as-is or an abstracted
value.
#### 5.6.8.8 Reporting Event: Availability after DDN failure
1a. This monitoring event is detected as of step 1a of clause 5.6.8.1, which
is when the MME/SGSN becomes aware of UE availability after DDN failure.
2\. Dependent on MME/SGSN configuration step 2a or 2c of clause 5.6.8.1 is
executed.
3\. Step 3 of clause 5.6.8.1 is executed.
### 5.6.9 Network-initiated Explicit Monitoring Event Deletion Procedure
The procedure is used by the SCEF towards the SCS/AS to delete a previously
configured Monitoring Event.
Figure 6.5.9-1: Network-initiated Explicit Monitoring Event Deletion Procedure
0\. A Monitoring Event configuration procedure according to clause 5.6.1 or
clause 5.6.6 has already executed successfully.
1\. Due to certain conditions (e.g. for a single UE processing, a previously
set subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer from one SCS/AS is being overwritten by
another SCS/AS, or for group based processing, if a given External Group ID
for which a previous group request was accepted is now no longer valid) HSS
triggers a Monitoring Response message or Monitoring Indication message
towards the SCEF and includes SCEF Reference ID of a previously accepted
Monitoring Event which needs cancellation.
1b. The HSS also deletes the previously configured Monitoring Event in the
MME/SGSN, if applicable, e.g. at deletion of an External Group ID in the HSS.
2\. Based on the SCEF Reference ID for cancellation included in step 1a or
local context lookup in step 1b, the SCEF determines TLTRI of the configured
Monitoring Event which needs cancellation.
3\. The SCEF sends a Cancel Monitoring Event Request (TLTRI, Cause) message to
the T8 Destination Address. Cause value indicates the reason for cancellation
of the previously configured Monitoring Event.
4\. The SCS/AS sends a Cancel Monitoring Event Response (Cause) message to the
SCEF. The SCS/AS deletes T8 context associated with the TLTRI received in step
3. Cause indicates the result of the procedure.
5\. The SCEF deletes T8 context and the SCEF EPS Bearer context associated
with the TLTRI sent in step 3.
## 5.7 High latency communications procedures
### 5.7.1 Availability Notification after DDN Failure
#### 5.7.1.1 General
In this feature, the AS subscribes once and then gets notification only when
there has been some data delivery failure followed by the UE becoming
reachable.
This feature involves an entry in the subscription for a UE for \"network
application triggering when the UE is available after a DDN failure\". This is
a different monitoring event from the \"UE is reachable\" monitoring event.
This information is provided to the serving node (MME/SGSN) at registration.
The serving node notes this and sets a Notify-on-available-after-DDN-failure
flag after a DDN failure. If the flag is set when the UE next contacts the
network, the serving node notifies the SCEF that the UE is reachable, and will
clear the flag.
An important use case for this feature is the application that wants to
communicate with a UE that sleeps for a long time. If downlink packets from
the application are not delivered, the application recognizes that the UE is
not available by lack of response within a reasonable time from the UE, and
then await notification from the network (i.e. from the MME/S4-SGSN via the
SCEF) of UE reachability. This procedure does not apply to a Gn/Gp-SGSN.
NOTE: The solution is particularly suitable when there is just one SCS/AS.
#### 5.7.1.2 Event Configuration
The figure 5.7.1.2-1 below provides the Event configuration procedure.
Figure 5.7.1.2-1: Event Configuration - Availability Notification after DDN
Failure
1\. The SCS/AS executes step 1 of clause 5.6.1.9.
2\. The SCEF sends a Monitoring Request message to the HSS to request
notification when the UE becomes available after a DDN failure.
NOTE: The Monitoring Request message includes the parameters specified in
clause 5.6.1.2.
3\. The HSS provides the monitoring event request to the MME/SGSN according to
steps 5-7 in Figure 5.6.1.1-1.
4\. The HSS internally notes the request, and sends Monitoring Response
message to the SCEF.
5\. The SCEF executes step 9 of clause 5.6.1.9.
#### 5.7.1.3 Notification
The figure 5.7.1.3-1 below provides the notification procedure. This figure is
relative to EUTRAN, but the equivalent figure for UTRAN can be directly
derived from this.
Figure 5.7.1.3-1: Notification - Availability Notification after DDN Failure
1\. The application sends downlink data.
2\. The PGW forwards the data to the SGW. The SGW sends a Downlink Data
Notification (DDN) message to the MME requesting that UE be paged.
3\. The UE is in Power Saving Mode or Extended idle mode DRX, or the MME
initiates paging for the UE but receives no response.
4\. The MME sends a DDN failure indication to the SGW.
5\. The MME notes the subscription option for notification of availability
after DDN failure for the UE, and sets a Notify-on-available-after-DDN-failure
flag. Not every DDN failure triggers this event. This event may be triggered
only when the UE is in PSM or Extended idle mode DRX.
6\. At some later time, the UE contacts the network (e.g. to perform a TAU, or
a service request), or the UE becomes or is about to become reachable for
paging (e.g. an eDRX Paging Transmission Window is reached).
7\. The MME notes that UE is available and that the Notify-on-available-after-
DDN-failure flag for the UE is set.
8\. The MME sends a Monitoring Indication to the SCEF that the UE is
available, according to clause 5.6.3.1. The MME also resets the Notify-on-
available-after-DDN-failure flag for the UE.
9\. The SCEF notifies the application that the UE is available.
10\. The application may decide to resend data it has for the UE.
11\. UE transitions to idle mode according to TS 23.401 [7], e.g. CM-IDLE with
PSM or eDRX.
12\. If Idle Status Indication was requested during Monitoring Event
configuration, and the MME/SGSN supports Idle Status Indication, then MME
executes step 2a of clause 5.6.3.8, and includes the time at which the UE
transitioned into idle mode, its granted active time (if PSM is enabled), the
periodic TAU/RAU timer granted to the UE by the MME, the eDRX cycle length (if
extended idle mode DRX is enabled), and the Suggested number of downlink
packets if a value was provided to the S-GW in the message.
13\. The SCEF executes step 3 of clause 5.6.3.8, and includes additional
parameters specified in step 12 above.
14\. The application may send queued data toward the UE.
### 5.7.2 Notification using Monitoring Event \"UE Reachability\"
If an SCS/AS wants to send downlink packet(s), the SCS/AS can request a One-
time \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event by sending Monitoring Request
message indicating Reachability Type as \"Reachability for Data\". The SCS/AS
may send the packet data when it receives a notification that the UE has
changed to connected mode or the SCS/AS may send a device trigger when it
receives a notification that the UE will become reachable for paging. If the
SCS/AS optionally wants to fine-tune the delivery of the downlink data within
the time-window when the UE is reachable, the SCS/AS can configure optional
parameter \'Maximum Response Time\' with proper value, and/or request Idle
Status Indication (as detailed in clause 5.6.1.4).
## 5.8 Procedure for Informing about Potential Network Issues
### 5.8.1 General
This clause contains the detailed description and the procedures for the
service capability exposure feature Informing about Potential Network Issues.
An SCS/AS may request for being notified about the network status. The
following methods are supported:
\- The SCS/AS requests to be informed, one-time, about the network status by
providing a geographical area. This procedure is referred to as one-time
network status request;
\- The SCS/AS requests to be informed, continuously, about the network status
by providing a geographical area. This procedure is referred to as continuous
network status request.
The procedures described in this clause use the RAN Congestion Awareness
Function (RCAF) and corresponding features as defined in TS 23.401 [7] and TS
23.060 [6]. The SCEF communicates with the RCAF via the Ns reference point.
After receiving the request for network status notification from the SCS/AS,
the SCEF derives the RCAF(s) responsible for the indicated geographical area,
and requests congestion reporting from these RCAF(s).
NOTE 1: The SCEF needs to know the RCAF(s) available in the operator network
or the network of the RAN operator in case of RAN sharing. For every RCAF, the
SCEF needs to be configured with the RCAF address and the geographical area
the RCAF is responsible for. The Ns reference point does not support roaming.
The RCAF reports to the SCEF the following information from the RUCI (see TS
23.203 [27]) for every cell or eNodeB belonging to the indicated geographical
area:
\- Congestion level or an indication of the \"no congestion\" state;
\- ECGI, or eNodeB-ID, or SAI for which the congestion level is being
provided.
Based on the congestion information the SCEF receives from the identified
RCAF(s), the SCEF derives and reports the network status for the geographical
area as Network Status Indication (NSI) to the SCS/AS. When reporting to the
SCS/AS, the NSI shall not include any 3GPP location information.
NOTE 2: Either exact values for congestion status, as reported by RCAF(s) to
SCEF or abstracted values e.g. (High, Medium, Low) can be reported by the SCEF
to the SCS/AS. The calculation and the reporting of the NSI to the SCS/AS
depends on operator configuration (SLAs, network topology, usage etc.).
When an SCS/AS requests One-time Network Status from the SCEF, the SCEF can
optionally provide a time interval at which the SCS/AS is allowed to re-issue
the same request for network status.
NOTE 4: The time interval provided by SCEF can be ignored by the SCS/AS if the
subsequent request on network status is considerably different wrt. the
geographical area.
The request procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of network status
is described in clause 5.8.2 and the report procedure for continuous reporting
of network status in clause 5.8.3. Clause 5.8.4 contains the removal procedure
for the continuous reporting of network status.
### 5.8.2 Request procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of network
status
This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to retrieve Network Status Information
(NSI) from the network. This procedure can be used to request a one-time or
continuous reporting of network status. Figure 5.8.2-1 illustrates the
procedure.
Figure 5.8.2-1: Request procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of
network status
1\. When the SCS/AS needs to retrieve NSI, the SCS/AS sends a Network Status
Request (Geographical area, SCS/AS Identifier, Duration, Threshold) message to
the SCEF. Duration indicates the time for which a continuous reporting is
requested. The absence of Duration indicates a one-time reporting. Threshold
indicates a range at which the SCS/AS wishes to be informed of the network
status. Multiple Threshold values may be included. The SCEF assigns a TLTRI
that identifies the Network Status Request.
NOTE 1: Geographical area specified by SCS/AS could be at cell level
(CGI/ECGI), TA/RA level or other formats e.g. shapes (e.g. polygons, circles
etc.) or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts etc.) as referenced by OMA
Presence API [32].
2a. The SCEF authorizes the SCS/AS request for notifications about potential
network issues. The SCEF stores SCS/AS Address, TLTRI, Duration, if present,
and Threshold, if present. The SCEF assigns an SCEF Reference ID.
2b. The SCEF sends a Network Status Response (TLTRI, cause). The cause value
indicates that the network has accepted the request in step 1. Based on
operator policies, if either the SCS/AS is not authorized to perform this
request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or the SCS/AS has exceeded its
quota or rate of submitting requests, the cause value indicates the error and
the flow stops at this step.
3\. The SCEF assigns an SCEF Reference ID and identifies, based on local
configuration (as described in clause 5.8.1), the RCAF(s) responsible for the
provided Geographical Area. For every identified RCAF, the SCEF derives a
Location Area from the Geographical Area provided by the SCS/AS. The Location
Area is according to operator configuration either a 3GPP location area (e.g.
list of TA/RAs, list of cell(s), list of eNodeBs, etc.) or a sub-area of the
Geographical Area provided by the SCS/AS. The SCEF sends an Aggregated
Congestion Request (SCEF Reference ID, Location Area, Duration, Threshold)
message to the identified RCAF(s). Duration indicates the time for which a
continuous reporting is requested. The absence of Duration indicates a one-
time reporting. The SCEF, based on operator policies, may chose a different
Threshold value than the one indicated by the SCS/AS in step 1.
4\. The RCAF examines the Aggregated Congestion Request message. If the SCEF
provided a Duration, the RCAF stores the SCEF instructions and starts to
monitor the set of cells or eNodeBs belonging to the Location Area for a
change in the congestion status that is crossing a Threshold (if provided by
the SCEF). The RCAF sends an Aggregated Congestion Report to the SCEF
including the SCEF Reference ID and, depending on the operator configuration
and current RCAF knowledge, the congestion status for every cell or eNodeB
belonging to the Location Area requested by the SCEF.
5\. The SCEF verifies whether the Network Status Request identified via the
SCEF Reference ID is valid and active and stores the report. After receiving
reports from all the involved RCAF(s) to which step 3 was executed, the SCEF
derives the NSI for the requested Geographical Area by combining all reports
with the same SCEF Reference ID in an operator configurable way (governed by
SLAs, network topology, usage, etc.).
NOTE 2: Either exact values for congestion status, as reported by RCAF(s) to
SCEF or abstracted values e.g. (High, Medium, Low) can be reported by the SCEF
to the SCS/AS. The calculation and the reporting of the NSI to the SCS/AS
depends on operator configuration (SLAs, network topology, usage, etc.).
6\. The SCEF sends a Network Status Report (TLTRI, NSI) message to the SCS/AS.
7\. The SCS/AS sends a Network Status Acknowledgement to the SCEF.
### 5.8.3 Report procedure for continuous reporting of network status
This procedure is used by the SCEF to report a change of Network Status
Information (NSI) to the SCS/AS which requested a continuous reporting of
network status. Figure 5.8.3-1 illustrates the procedure.
Figure 5.8.3-1: Report procedure for continuous reporting of network status
1\. The RCAF detects a change in the congestion status that is crossing a
Threshold (if provided by the SCEF) for the set of cells or eNodeBs belonging
to the Location Area requested by the SCEF. An Aggregated Congestion Report
message is sent to this SCEF including the SCEF Reference ID and, depending on
the operator configuration, the congestion status for every cell or eNodeB
belonging to the Location Area requested by the SCEF.
2\. The SCEF acknowledges the report to the RCAF.
NOTE 1: Step 1 and 2 can happen multiple times and the Aggregated Congestion
Report message can be sent by any of the involved RCAFs.
3\. Whenever a new Aggregated Congestion Report message arrives, the SCEF
stores the report and derives a new NSI for the requested geographical area by
combining this report with all other reports having the same SCEF Reference ID
in an operator configurable way (governed by SLAs, network topology, usage
etc.).
NOTE 2: Either exact values for congestion status, as reported by RCAF(s) to
SCEF or abstracted values e.g. (High, Medium, Low) can be reported by the SCEF
to the SCS/AS. The calculation and the reporting of the NSI to the SCS/AS
depends on operator configuration (SLAs, network topology, usage etc.).
4\. Triggered by a NSI change (derived in step 3) that is crossing a Threshold
(if provided by the SCS/AS), the SCEF sends a Network Status Report (TLTRI,
NSI) message to the SCS/AS.
5\. The SCS/AS sends a Network Status Acknowledgement to the SCEF.
### 5.8.4 Removal procedure for continuous reporting of network status
This procedure is used for termination of the continuous reporting of network
status. It can be triggered by the SCS/AS at any time before the Duration is
over or if no Duration was provided. The SCEF will trigger this procedure when
the Duration is over. Figure 5.8.4-1 illustrates the procedure.
Figure 5.8.4-1: Removal procedure for continuous reporting of network status
1a. The SCEF detects that the requested Duration for an ongoing continuous
reporting of network status to an SCS/AS is over and identifies the
corresponding SCEF Reference ID.
1b. When the SCS/AS needs to terminate an ongoing continuous reporting of
network status, the SCS/AS sends a Cancel Network Status Request (SCS/AS
Identifier, TLTRI) message to the SCEF.
2b. If the SCS/AS requested to terminate an ongoing continuous reporting of
network status in step 1b, the SCEF authorizes the SCS/AS request and
identifies the corresponding SCEF Reference ID.
3b. If the SCS/AS requested to terminate an ongoing continuous reporting of
network status in step 1b, the SCEF sends a Cancel Network Status Response
(Cause) message to the SCS/AS.
4\. The SCEF identifies the RCAF(s) involved in the continuous reporting
represented by the SCEF Reference ID. The SCEF sends a Cancel Aggregated
Congestion Request (SCEF Reference ID) message to the identified RCAF(s).
5\. The RCAF removes the related SCEF instructions and stops monitoring the
set of cells or eNodeBs belonging to the Location Area for a change in the
congestion status. Afterwards, a Cancel Aggregated Congestion Response is sent
to the SCEF including the SCEF Reference ID.
6\. The SCEF removes all state information related to this continuous
reporting represented by the SCEF Reference ID.
## 5.9 Procedure for resource management of background data transfer
This clause describes the procedure for resource management of background data
transfer to a set of UEs, i.e. an SCS/AS requesting a time window and related
conditions from the SCEF via the Nt interface.
The UEs targeted for background data transfer may be served by a single PCRF
or may be spread across multiple PCRFs serving the same or different
geographic areas. The operator shall ensure that any of the PCRFs in the
network is able to make the decision about transfer policy for background data
transfer for non-roaming UEs.
The transfer policy will be stored in the SPR together with a Reference ID.
This ensures that the transfer policy is available to every PCRF responsible
for a UE which is subject to this background data transfer in the future. In
addition, other (or the same) PCRF can take this transfer policy into account
during subsequent decisions about transfer policies for background data
related to other SCS/AS.
At a later point in time, when the SCS/AS (acting as an AF), contacts the PCRF
for individual UEs, e.g. to request sponsored connectivity for background data
transfer, the SCS/AS needs to also provide the Reference ID together with the
SCS/AS session information via the Rx interface. Alternatively, the SCS/AS
activates the selected transfer policy via the SCEF, for each UE in the group,
by using the \"Set the chargeable party at session set-up\" or \"Change the
chargeable party during the session\" procedure from clauses 5.12.1 and 5.12.2
to provide the Reference ID to the same or different PCRF. The Reference ID
enables the PCRF to correlate the SCS/AS request (that is related to the UE)
with the transfer policy retrieved from the SPR (that is related to the
SCS/AS). The PCRF finally triggers PCC procedures according to TS 23.203 [27]
to provide the respective policing and charging information to the PCEF.
Figure 5.9-1: Resource management for background data transfer
1\. A 3rd party SCS/AS sends a Background data transfer request (SCS/AS
Identifier, Volume per UE, Number of UEs, Desired time window) message to the
SCEF. The Volume per UE describes the volume of data the SCS/AS expects to be
transferred per UE. Number of UEs describes the expected amount of UEs
participating in the data transfer. Desired time window describes the time
interval during which the SCS/AS wants to realize the data transfer.
Optionally, the SCS/AS can provide a geographic area information.
NOTE 1: The SCS/AS does not provide any information about the identity of the
UEs in this request.
2\. The SCEF authorizes the SCS/AS request.
NOTE 2: The SCEF notifies the SCS/AS at this point if the authorization fails.
3\. The SCEF selects any of the available PCRFs and triggers the Negotiation
for future background data transfer procedure with the PCRF. The SCEF forwards
the parameters provided by the SCS/AS. The PCRF responds to the SCEF with the
possible transfer policies and a Reference ID. Refer to TS 23.203 [27] clause
7.11.1.
4\. The SCEF forwards the Reference ID and the transfer policies to the 3rd
party SCS/AS by sending a Background data transfer response (Reference ID,
Possible transfer policies) message. The SCS/AS stores the Reference ID for
the future interaction with the PCRF.
5\. If more than one transfer policy was received, the 3rd party SCS/AS shall
select one of them and send another Background data transfer request (SCS/AS
Identifier, Selected transfer policy) message to inform the SCEF and PCRF
about the selected transfer policy.
NOTE 3: If there is only one transfer policy offered, the SCS/AS is not
required to confirm.
6\. The SCEF confirms the transfer policy selection to the 3rd party SCS/AS by
sending a Background data transfer response (Cause) message.
7\. The SCEF continues the Negotiation for future background data transfer
procedure with the PCRF. The PCRF stores the Reference ID and the new transfer
policy in the SPR. Refer to TS 23.203 [27] clause 7.11.1.
8\. The SCS/AS (acting as an AF) contacts the same or a different PCRF for
each individual UE (via the Rx interface), the SCS/AS shall provide the
Reference ID. Alternatively, the SCS/AS activates the selected transfer policy
via the SCEF, for each UE in the group, by using the \"Set the chargeable
party at session set-up\" or \"Change the chargeable party during the
session\" procedure from clauses 5.12.1 and 5.12.2 to provide the Reference ID
to the same or different PCRF. The PCRF correlates the SCS/AS or SCEF request
with the transfer policy retrieved from the SPR via the Reference ID. The PCRF
finally triggers PCC procedures according to TS 23.203 [27] to provide the
respective policing and charging information to the PCEF for the background
data transfer of this UE.
NOTE 4: The SCS/AS will typically request sponsored connectivity for the
background data transfer to individual UEs.
NOTE 5: The SCS/AS can contact the PCRF directly or interact with the PCRF via
the SCEF.
## 5.10 Communication Pattern parameters provisioning procedure
### 5.10.1 Communication Pattern parameters
A set of Communication Pattern (CP) parameters is defined in the table below.
All CP parameters are optional.
These CP parameters are specific for a UE or a group of UEs. Sets of these CP
parameters are provided by the SCEF to the HSS which distributes them to the
corresponding MME with relevant subscriber data. The MME considers the sets of
CP parameters (e.g. by merging per CP parameter if multiple sets are present),
before using the parameters. Each CP parameter set shall have an associated
validity time. The validity time indicates when the CP parameter set expires
and shall be deleted by the HSS/MME. The validity time may be set to a value
indicating that the particular CP parameter set has no expiration time. When
the validity time expires, the involved nodes (SCEF, HSS, and MME)
autonomously delete the associated CP parameter set with no additional
signalling between the involved nodes.
NOTE 1: It is expected that the format of validity time, to be defined by
Stage 3, is defined in a manner which allows SCEF, HSS and MME/SGSN to
consistently and uniformly interpret the expiration of the associated CP
parameters set.
Table 5.10.1-1: CP parameters
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | CP parameter | Description | +==================================+==================================+ | 1) Periodic communication | Identifies whether the UE | | indicator | communicates periodically or | | | not, e.g. only on demand. | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 2) Communication duration time | Duration interval time of | | | periodic communication | | | [optional, may be used together | | | with 1)] | | | | | | Example: 5 minutes | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 3) Periodic time | Interval Time of periodic | | | communication [optional, may be | | | used together with 1)] | | | | | | Example: every hour | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 4) Scheduled communication time | Time zone and Day of the week | | | when the UE is available for | | | communication [optional] | | | | | | Example: Time: 13:00-20:00, Day: | | | Monday | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 5) Stationary indication | Identifies whether the UE is | | | stationary or mobile | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 6) Battery indication | Identifies power consumption | | | criticality for the UE: if the | | | UE is battery powered with not | | | rechargeable/not replaceable | | | battery, battery powered with | | | rechargeable/replaceable | | | battery, or not battery powered. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | X) Traffic Profile | Identifies the type of data | | | transmission: single packet | | | transmission (UL or DL), dual | | | packet transmission (UL with | | | subsequent DL or DL with | | | subsequent UL), multiple packets | | | transmission. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
NOTE 2: The Traffic Profile is provided to the eNB for optimisation of RAN
resources and how it is used is specified in TS 23.401 [7].
### 5.10.2 Communication Pattern parameters provisioning to the MME
Figure 5.10.2-1: Signalling sequence for provisioning of CP Parameters
1\. The SCS/AS sends an Update Request (External Identifier or MSISDN or
External Group Identifier, SCS/AS Identifier, CP parameter Set Id(s), CP
parameter set(s), validity time(s), CP parameter Set Id(s) for Deletion, MTC
Provider Information) message to the SCEF. The CP parameter set(s) include the
parameters defined in Table 5.10.1-1. A CP parameter Set Id is assigned to
each CP parameter set by the SCS/AS.
NOTE 1: The SCS/AS uses this procedure to add, change or delete some or all of
the CP parameter sets of the UE, e.g. if the AS is aware that the UE has
started or stopped moving for a significant time period, especially if the AS
is instructing the UE to do so, then the SCS/AS provides the corresponding CP
parameter set(s) and its validity time(s) as well their CP parameter Set Id(s)
to the SCEF. If the SCS/AS wants to perform deletion of a previously
configured CP parameter set(s) together with configuring a new CP parameter
set(s), then it shall include both the new CP parameter set(s), and CP
parameter Set Id(s) for Deletion representing the CP parameter set(s) which
requires cancellation. If the SCS/AS wants to only perform deletion of a
previously configured CP parameter set(s), then it shall include CP parameter
Set Id(s) for Deletion.
2\. The SCEF checks if the SCS/AS is authorised to send CP requests to the UE
or to each UE in the identified group. The SCEF filters and the selects the CP
parameter set(s) for add/modify/delete based on operator policy or
configuration. The SCEF does not check for potential overlapping of CP
parameters if there are multiple CP parameter set(s) for the UE, but this is
handled in the MME.
In this release, to avoid receiving CP parameter sets from multiple SCEFs that
might be overlapping, the HSS shall accept CP parameter sets from only a
single SCEF for a given UE.
3\. The SCEF sends Update CP Parameter Request (External Identifier or MSISDN
or External Group Identifier, SCEF Reference ID(s), SCEF Address, CP parameter
set(s), validity time(s), SCEF Reference ID(s) for Deletion, MTC Provider
Information) message to the HSS for delivering the selected CP parameter
set(s) per UE. There may be multiple CP parameter sets included in this
message where each CP parameter set for addition or modification has been
determined to be non-overlapping with other CP parameter sets either included
in the message or already provisioned for a given UE. The SCEF derives the
SCEF Reference ID(s) for CP parameter sets to be sent to the HSS based on the
CP parameter Set Id(s) from the SCS/AS.
NOTE 2: A request for deletion of a CP parameter set from the SCS/AS may
result in a request for modification of the non-overlapping CP parameter set
by the SCEF.
NOTE 2a: The MTC Provider Information in step 1 is an optional parameter. The
SCEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it
to an SCEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the
SCEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present in step 1, is
left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting SCS/AS).
4\. The HSS examines the Update CP Parameter Request message, e.g. with regard
to the existence of External Identifier or MSISSN or External Group
Identifier. If the check fails, the HSS immediately sends a response message
back to the SCEF following step 5. The HSS resolves the External Identifier or
MSISDN to an IMSI or resolves the External Group Identifier to an IMSI-Group
Identifier and stores the CP parameter set(s) and their validity time(s) as
part of UE subscription data identified by the IMSI or IMSI-Group Identifier,
so that the CP parameter set(s) can be forwarded to the serving MME(s) when
the serving MME(s) are changed due to the mobility of the UE.
The HSS determines that a stored CP parameters set is to be modified by the
fact that the SCEF Reference ID associated with the CP parameters set matches
an SCEF Reference ID for a CP parameters set already stored for a given UE. If
the HSS determines that an existing CP parameter set is to be modified, the
HSS discards the already stored CP parameter set and stores the new CP
parameter set and validity time under the same SCEF Reference ID.
The HSS stores a new CP parameter set along with the associated SCEF Reference
ID and validity time.
If CP parameters sets are to be deleted, the HSS removes the CP parameters
sets from the subscription.
If the validity time for a CP parameter set stored in the HSS expires, the HSS
autonomously deletes the associated CP parameter set with no additional
signalling.
NOTE 3: The CP parameter set(s) are not provided to the SGSN.
NOTE 4: The HSS does not need to validate the content of the stored CP
parameters set(s).
5\. The HSS sends Update CP Parameter Response (SCEF Reference ID, Cause)
message to the SCEF. The cause value indicates successful subscription update
or the reason of failed subscription update.
6\. The SCEF sends the Update Response (CP parameter Set Id(s), Cause(s))
message to inform the SCS/AS whether the provision of the CP parameter set(s)
was successful.
7\. The HSS initiates an Insert Subscription Data procedure for each UE to
send the CP parameter set(s) with the corresponding validity time(s), SCEF
Reference ID(s), and SCEF Reference ID(s) for Deletion to the MME. Optionally,
the HSS allocates a Provider-Group-ID (different from the IMSI-Group-Id) based
on the MTC Provider Information and sends it to the MME to assist the serving
node(s) when selecting and differentiating configurations for a given MTC
Service Provider (e.g. to delete the CP Set Id(s) for a specific MTC Service
Provider at the MME).
The MME determines that a stored CP parameters set is to be modified by the
fact that the SCEF Reference ID associated with the CP parameters set matches
an SCEF Reference ID for a CP parameters set already stored for the UE. If the
MME determines that an existing CP parameter set is to be modified, the MME
discards the already stored CP parameter set and stores the received CP
parameter set with the associated validity time in the UE\'s (E)MM context
under the same SCEF Reference ID.
The MME stores a new CP parameter set along with the associated SCEF Reference
ID and validity time. The MME may use the CP parameter set(s) as described in
TS 23.401 [7].
If CP parameter sets are to be deleted, the MME removes the CP parameter sets
from the subscription.
If the validity time for a CP parameter set stored in the MME expires, the MME
autonomously deletes the associated CP parameter set with no additional
signalling.
## 5.11 Setting up an AS session with required QoS procedure
This clause describes the signalling flow for setting up a 3rd party AS
session with a specific QoS.
Figure 5.11-1: Setting up an AS session with required QoS
1\. When setting up the connection between SCS/AS and the UE with required QoS
for the service, the SCS/AS sends an On-demand QoS request message (UE IP
address, SCS/AS Identifier, Description of the application flows, QoS
reference) to the SCEF. Optionally, a period of time or a traffic volume for
the requested QoS can be included in the SCS/AS request. The SCEF assigns a
TLTRI to the On-demand QoS request.
2\. The SCEF authorizes the SCS/AS request and may apply policies to control
the overall amount of pre-defined QoS authorized for the SCS/AS. If the
authorisation is not granted, steps 3 and 4 are skipped and the SCEF replies
to the SCS/AS with a Result value indicating that the authorisation failed.
3\. The SCEF maps the UE IP address, the SCS/AS Identifier, the Description of
the application flows and the QoS reference to existing Rx parameters
(including the optionally received period of time or traffic volume which is
mapped to sponsored data connectivity information). The SCEF acts as an AF
defined in TS 23.203 [27].
NOTE: Before the QoS reference is mapped to Rx parameters, the SCEF can
perform a mapping from the name space of the 3rd party SCS/AS to the name
space of the operator.
4\. The SCEF interacts with the PCRF via the Rx interface and triggers a PCRF
initiated IP-CAN Session Modification as described in clause 7.4.2 of TS
23.203 [27]. The SCEF shall request to be notified about the transmission
resource status.
The PCRF derives the required QoS based on the information provided by the
SCEF and determines whether this QoS is allowed (according to the PCRF
configuration for this 3rd party SCS/AS), and notifies the result to the SCEF.
The PCRF notifies the SCEF whether the transmission resources corresponding to
the QoS request are established or not.
5\. The SCEF sends an On-demand QoS response message (TLTRI, Result) to the
SCS/AS. Result indicates whether the QoS request is granted or not.
6\. The PCRF may notify the SCEF about bearer level events for the Rx session
(e.g., transmission resources are released/lost) with a PCEF initiated IP-CAN
Session Modification as described in clause 7.4.1 of TS 23.203 [27].
7\. If the SCEF gets informed by the PCRF about bearer level events for the Rx
session (e.g., transmission resources are released/lost) the SCEF sends a
Status information message (SCS/AS Identifier, TLTRI, Status) to the SCS/AS.
The status indicates the bearer level event received from the PCRF.
## 5.12 Change the chargeable party at session set-up or during the session
procedure
### 5.12.1 Set the chargeable party at session set-up
This clause describes the signalling flow for setting the chargeable party at
AS session set-up. The SCS/AS may either request to sponsor the traffic from
the beginning or may request to become the chargeable party at a later point
in time.
Figure 5.12.1-1: Set the chargeable party at AS session set-up
1\. When setting up the connection between the AS and UE, the SCS/AS may
request to become the chargeable party for the session to be set up by sending
a Set chargeable party request message (SCS/AS Identifier, Description of the
application flows, sponsor information, Sponsoring Status, Reference ID) to
the SCEF, including optionally a usage threshold. The Sponsoring Status
indicates whether sponsoring is started or stopped, i.e. whether the 3rd party
service provider is the chargeable party or not. The Reference ID parameter
identifies a previously negotiated transfer policy for background data
transfer as defined in clause 4.5.9. The SCEF assigns a TLTRI to the Set
chargeable party request.
2\. The SCEF authorizes the SCS/AS request to sponsor the application traffic
and stores the sponsor information together with the SCS/AS Identifier and the
TLTRI. If the authorisation is not granted, step 3 is skipped and the SCEF
replies to the SCS/AS with a Result value indicating that the authorisation
failed.
NOTE 1: Based on operator configuration, the SCEF may skip this step. In this
case the authorization is performed by the PCRF in step 3.
3\. The SCEF interacts with the PCRF by triggering a PCRF initiated IP-CAN
Session Modification as described in clause 7.4.2 of TS 23.203 [27] and
provides IP filter information, sponsored data connectivity information (as
defined in TS 23.203 [27]), Reference ID (if received from the SCS/AS) and
Sponsoring Status (if received from the SCS/AS) to the PCRF.
NOTE 2: The SCEF maps the Sponsoring Status to existing Rx parameters.
The PCRF determines whether the request is allowed and notifies the SCEF if
the request is not authorized. If the request is not authorized, SCEF responds
to the SCS/AS in step 4 with a Result value indicating that the authorization
failed.
As specified in TS 23.203 [27], the PCRF determines the PCC rule(s) for the
specified session including charging control information. Charging control
information shall be set according to the Sponsoring Status (if received over
Rx), i.e. either indicating that the 3rd party service provider is the
chargeable party or not. The PCC rule(s) for the specified session shall then
be provided to the PCEF. In case of online charging and depending on operator
configuration, the PCEF may request credit when the first packet corresponding
to the service is detected or at the time the PCC Rule was activated.
The PCRF notifies the SCEF that the request is accepted.
4\. The SCEF sends a Set chargeable party response message (TLTRI, Result) to
the SCS/AS. Result indicates whether the request is granted or not.
### 5.12.2 Change the chargeable party during the session
This clause describes the signalling flow for changing the chargeable party
during an ongoing AS session, i.e. the SCS/AS starting or stopping to sponsor
the application traffic.
Figure 5.12.2-1: Change chargeable party during an AS session
1\. For the ongoing AS session, the SCS/AS may send a Change chargeable party
request message (SCS/AS Identifier, TLTRI, Sponsoring Status, Reference ID) to
the SCEF, including optionally a usage threshold. The Sponsoring Status
indicates whether sponsoring is enabled or disabled, i.e. whether the 3rd
party service provider is the chargeable party or not. The Reference ID
parameter identifies a previously negotiated transfer policy for background
data transfer as defined in clause 4.5.9. The TLTRI provided in the Change
chargeable party request message is set to the TLTRI that was assigned, by the
SCEF, to the Set chargeable party request.
2\. The SCEF authorizes the SCS/AS request of changing the chargeable party.
If the authorisation is not granted, step 3 is skipped and the SCEF replies to
the SCS/AS with a Result value indicating that the authorisation failed.
NOTE 1: Based on operator configuration, the SCEF may skip this step. In this
case the authorization is performed by the PCRF in step 3.
3\. Based on the SCS/AS Identifier and the TLTRI the SCEF determines the
relevant Rx session and interact with the PCRF by triggering a PCRF initiated
IP-CAN Session Modification as described in clause 7.4.2 of TS 23.203 [27].
The SCEF provides sponsored data connectivity information (as defined in TS
23.203 [27]), Reference ID (if received from the SCS/AS), and the Sponsoring
Status to the PCRF.
NOTE 2: The SCEF maps the Sponsoring Status to existing Rx parameters.
The PCRF determines whether the request is allowed and notifies the SCEF if
the request is not authorized. If the request is not authorized, SCEF responds
to the SCS/AS in step 4 with a Result value indicating that the authorization
failed.
The PCRF identifies the affected PCC rule(s) and reacts based on their current
status. If the traffic is subject to subscriber charging in the PCEF and the
PCRF receives a Sponsoring Status indicating that sponsoring is started, the
PCC rule(s) for the specified session shall be modified so that the charging
control information indicates that the 3rd party service provider is charged
for the traffic. If the traffic is subject to 3rd party charging in the PCEF
and the PCRF receives a Sponsoring Status indicating that sponsoring is
stopped, the PCC rule(s) for the specified session shall be modified so that
the charging control information indicates that the 3rd party service provider
is no longer charged for the traffic. As specified in TS 23.203 [27], PCRF
modifies the PCC rule(s) of the service data flow accordingly and provides
them to the PCEF. In case of online charging and depending on operator
configuration, the PCEF may request credit when the first packet corresponding
to the service is detected or at the time the PCC Rule was activated.
The PCRF notifies the SCEF that the request is accepted.
4\. The SCEF sends a Change chargeable party response message (Result) to the
SCS/AS. Result indicates whether the request is granted or not.
## 5.13 Non-IP Data Delivery procedures
### 5.13.1 T6a/T6b Connection Establishment
#### 5.13.1.1 General
When the UE performs the EPS attach procedure (see TS 23.401 [7]) with PDN
type of \"Non-IP\", and the subscription information corresponding to either
the default APN for PDN type of \"Non-IP\" or the UE requested APN includes
the \"Invoke SCEF Selection\" indicator, then the MME initiates a T6a/T6b
connection towards the SCEF corresponding to the \"SCEF ID\" indicator for
that APN.
#### 5.13.1.2 T6a/T6b Connection Establishment Procedure
Figure 5.13.1.2-1: T6a/T6b Connection Establishment Procedure
1\. UE performs steps 1-11 of the E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure or step 1
of the UE requested PDN Connectivity procedure (see TS 23.401 [7]) or PDP
Context Activation Procedure (see TS 23.060 [6]). The MME/SGSN receives
subscription information for a non-IP PDN connection to an APN that is
associated with an \"Invoke SCEF Selection\" indicator, and SCEF ID. If the
MSISDN is also associated with the user\'s subscription, then it is made
available as User Identity to the MME/SGSN by the HSS.
2\. If the subscription information corresponding to either the default APN
for PDN type of \"Non-IP\" or the UE requested APN includes \"Invoke SCEF
Selection\" indicator, then instead of step 12-16 of the E-UTRAN Initial
Attach procedure (see TS 23.401 [7]) clause 5.3.2.1) or instead of step 2-6 of
the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure (see TS 23.401 [7] clause 5.10.2)
or instead of step 4-8 of the PDP Context Activation procedure (see TS 23.060
[6] clause 9.2.2.1), the MME/SGSN shall create a PDN connection towards the
SCEF and allocate an EPS Bearer Identity (EBI) (see TS 23.401 [7]) to that PDN
connection. The MME/SGSN does so by sending a Create SCEF Connection Request
(User Identity, EPS Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, APN, Serving PLMN Rate Control,
PCO, Serving PLMN ID, IMEISV) message towards the SCEF (see. TS 23.401 [7],
clause 4.7.7). If the IWK-SCEF receives the Create SCEF Connection Request
message from the MME/SGSN, it shall forward it toward the SCEF.
NOTE 1: The combination of EPS Bearer Identity, APN, and User Identity allows
the SCEF to uniquely identify the PDN connection to the SCEF for a given UE.
NOTE 2: For further details of T6a/T6b interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
NOTE 3: The details of how the MME/SGSN and SCEF encode the PCO\'s information
on T6a/T6b are left to stage 3.
If an SCS/AS has performed the NIDD Configuration procedure (see clause
5.13.2) with the SCEF for User Identity received in step 2, then step 3 is
executed. If no SCS/AS has performed the NIDD Configuration procedure (see
clause 5.13.2) with the SCEF for the User Identity, then the SCEF may:
\- reject the T6a/T6b connection setup, or
\- initiate a NIDD Configuration procedure with SCS/AS configured in the SCEF
using implementation specific procedures.
For E-UTRAN, if provided by the MME, the SCEF may take the APN Rate Control
Status into account when encoding the APN Rate Control parameters in Protocol
Configuration Options and when enforcing the APN Rate Control as described in
clause 4.7.7.3 of TS 23.401 [7].
3\. The SCEF creates an SCEF EPS Bearer Context (see clause 5.3.2) for the
user identified via User Identity and EBI. The SCEF sends a Create SCEF
Connection Response (User Identity, EPS Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, APN, PCO,
NIDD Charging ID) message towards the MME/SGSN confirming establishment of the
PDN connection to the SCEF for the UE. If the IWK-SCEF receives the Create
SCEF Connection Response message from the SCEF, it shall forward it toward the
MME/SGSN.
NOTE 4: For further details of T6a/T6b interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
### 5.13.2 NIDD Configuration
Figure 5.13.2-1 illustrates the procedure of configuring necessary information
at the SCEF and HSS. A NIDD Configuration is associated with a single UE or a
group of UEs. The procedure can also be used for replacing and deleting
configuration information.
NOTE 1: In order to avoid MO NIDD failure, the NIDD configuration procedure
should be performed by the SCS/AS prior to the UE establishing a PDN
Connection that is served by the SCEF. MT non-IP data from the SCS/AS can be
contained in the NIDD Configuration Request message.
Figure 5.13.2-1: Configuration for NIDD procedure
1\. The SCS/AS sends an NIDD Configuration Request (External Group Identifier,
External Identifier or MSISDN, SCS/AS Identifier, NIDD Duration, T8
Destination Address, TLTRI, Requested Action, PDN Connection Establishment
Option, Reliable Data Service Configuration, MTC Provider Information) message
to the SCEF. PDN Connection Establishment Option an optional field that is
used to indicate what the SCEF should do if the UE, or group member UEs, has
not established the PDN connection and MT non-IP data needs to be sent (wait
for the UE to establish the PDN connection, respond with an error cause, or
send a device trigger; see step 2 of the MT NIDD Procedure in clause 5.13.3).
When PDN Connection Establishment Option is included in the Configuration of
NIDD procedure, the SCEF will use the value as the default preference from the
SCS/AS when handling all MT non-IP packets associated with the NIDD
connection. Reliable Data Service Configuration is an optional parameter that
is used to configure the Reliable Data Service (as defined in clause 4.5.14.3)
including port numbers for originator application(s) and receiver
application(s). TLTRI is included in the request if the Requested Action is
set to \"Update\" or \"Cancel\", otherwise TLTRI is not included in the
request and the SCEF assigns a TLTRI to the NIDD Configuration.
When MT non-IP data is included in the NIDD Configuration request message, the
SCEF can send the MT non-IP data to the UE only after a PDN connection to the
SCEF is established as defined in clause 5.13.1.2. In such cases, upon
successful completion of step 6 of the NIDD Configuration procedure, steps 2-9
from clause 5.13.3 are executed. When MT non-IP data is included in the
request, the SCS/AS should also provide the parameters in step 1 of clause
5.13.3 so that the SCEF can properly execute steps 2-9 from clause 5.13.3. MT
non-IP data shall not be included in the NIDD Configuration Request when the
procedure is performed on an External Group Identifier.
NOTE 2: It is up to the SCS/AS to determine whether and if NIDD Duration can
be set to never expire.
NOTE 3: The SCS/AS is expected to be configured to use the same SCEF as the
one selected by the MME/SGSN during the UE\'s attachment to the network.
NOTE 4: A relative priority scheme for the treatment of multiple SCS/AS NIDD
Configuration Requests, e.g. for deciding which requests to serve under
overload condition, can be applied. This priority scheme is an implementation
option that is used locally by the SCEF, i.e. it is neither used nor
translated in procedures towards other functions.
NOTE 5: When more than one SCS/AS is associated with a PDN connection, the
parameters that are provided in step 1 can be provisioned in the SCEF based on
operator policy or configuration. In which case, any parameters that are
provided in step 1 that conflict with the provisioned values are ignored.
2\. If the Requested Action is set to \"Cancel\" it indicates the purpose of
the request is to cancel the transaction identified by TLTRI and the flow
proceeds to step 6. If the Requested Action is set to \"Update\", the purpose
of the transaction is to update the parameters associated with the
configuration (i.e. Reliable Data Service, PDN Connection Establishment
Option). Otherwise, the request is for a new NIDD configuration and the SCEF
stores the External Group Identifier, External Identifier or MSISDN, TLTRI,
SCS/AS Identifier, T8 Destination Address, PDN Connection Establishment
Option, and NIDD Duration. If either the SCS/AS is not authorized to perform
this request (e.g. based on policies, if the SLA does not allow for it) or the
NIDD Configuration Request is malformed, the SCEF performs step 6 and provides
a Cause value appropriately indicating the error. Depending on the
configuration, the SCEF may change the NIDD Duration.
3\. The SCEF sends an NIDD Authorization Request (External Group Identifier,
External Identifier or MSISDN, APN, MTC Provider Information) message to the
HSS to authorize the NIDD configuration request for the UEs that belongs to
the External Group Identifier, received External Identifier or MSISDN, and to
receive necessary information for NIDD, if required.
NOTE 6: The SCEF uses the SCS/AS Identifier and External Group Identifier,
External Identifier or MSISDN that was obtained in step 1 to determine what
APN will be used to enable transfer of non-IP data between the UE and the
SCS/AS. This determination is based on local policies.
NOTE 7: The MTC Provider Information in step 1 is an optional parameter. The
SCEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it
to an SCEF selected MTC Provider Internal information based on configuration.
How the SCEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present in step
1, is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting SCS/AS).
4\. The HSS examines the NIDD Authorization Request message, e.g. with regards
to the existence of External Group Identifier, External Identifier or MSISDN.
If an External Identifier was included in the NIDD Authorization Request, the
HSS maps the external identifier to IMSI and/or MSISDN and updates the SCEF ID
field of the PDN subscription context for the provided APN with the requesting
SCEF\'s ID. Otherwise, if an External Group Identifier was included in the
NIDD Authorization Request, the HSS authorizes the NIDD configuration request
for the received External Group Identifier, resolves the External Group
Identifier to an IMSI-Group Identifier and an External Identifier and/or
MSISDN for each of the IMSIs in the IMSI-Group . If this check fails, the HSS
follows step 5 and provides a result indicating the reason for the failure
condition to the SCEF. If the SCEF ID is different from the one in the PDN
subscription contexts for the provided APN, the HSS updates the SCEF ID at the
MME/SGSN for the provided APN. If this update fails, the HSS follows step 5
and provides a result indicating the reason for the failure condition to the
SCEF.
NOTE 8: How the HSS selects an External ID when multiple External IDs are
associated with the same IMSI is left to implementation, e.g. based on the MTC
Provider Information (if received) or the default External ID (if not
received).
5\. The HSS sends an NIDD Authorization Response (with single value or list of
(IMSI and MSISDN or External Identifier), Result) message to the SCEF to
acknowledge acceptance of the NIDD Authorization Request. If the HSS
determines that the list size exceeds the message capacity, the HSS shall
segment the list and send it in multiple messages (for details on
segmentation, see TS 29.336 [45]). The IMSI(s) and, if available, the
MSISDN(s) (when NIDD Configuration Request contains an External Identifier) or
if available, External Identifier(s) (when NIDD Configuration Request contains
an MSISDN) are returned by the HSS in this message. This allows the SCEF to
correlate the SCS/AS request received in step 1 of this procedure to the
T6a/T6b Connection established (see clause 5.13.1.2) for each UE or each group
member UE.
6\. The SCEF sends an NIDD Configuration Response (TLTRI, Maximum Packet Size,
Reliable Data Service Indication, and Cause) message to the SCS/AS to
acknowledge acceptance of the NIDD Configuration Request and the deletion of
the identified NIDD configuration, if it was requested. If the NIDD
Configuration was accepted, the SCEF will create an association between the
TLTRI, External Group Identifier or External Identifier or MSISDN, IMSI, and
EBI of the non-IP PDN Connection. In the MT NIDD procedure, the SCEF will use
TLTRI and External Group Identifier or External Identifier or MSISDN to
determine the IMSI(s) and EBI(s) of the non-IP PDN Connection(s). In the MO
NIDD procedure, the SCEF will use the IMSI(s) and EBI(s) to obtain the TLTRI,
External Identifier or MSISDN. The Reliable Data Service Indication indicates
if the Reliable Data Service is enabled in the APN configuration. The Maximum
Packet Size is the maximum NIDD packet size that was transferred to the UE by
the SCEF in the PCO, see clause 4.5.14.1. If no maximum packet size was
provided to the UE by the SCEF, the SCEF sends a default configured max packet
size to SCS/AS.
### 5.13.3 Mobile Terminated NIDD procedure
Figure 5.13.3-1 illustrates the procedure using which the SCS/AS sends non-IP
data to a given user as identified via External Identifier or MSISDN. This
procedure assumes that procedures in clause 5.13.1 is completed.
Figure 5.13.3-1: Mobile Terminated NIDD procedure
1\. If SCS/AS has already activated the NIDD service for a given UE, and has
downlink non-IP data to send to the UE, the SCS/AS sends a MT NIDD Submit
Request (External Identifier or MSISDN, TLTRI, non-IP data, non-IP data
sequence number, Reliable Data Service Configuration, Maximum Latency,
Priority, PDN Connection Establishment Option) message to the SCEF. The
Maximum Latency is an optional field that is used to indicate maximum delay
acceptable for downlink data as described in clause 5.6.1.4 and may be used to
configure the buffer duration; a Maximum Latency of 0 indicates that buffering
is not allowed. If Maximum Latency is not provided, the SCEF determines the
acceptable delay based on local polices. Priority is an optional field that is
used to indicate the priority of the non-IP data packet relative to other non-
IP data packets. If Priority is not provided, the SCEF determines the
acceptable delay based on local polices. Reliable Data Service Configuration
is an optional parameter that is used to configure the Reliable Data Service
(as defined in clause 4.5.14.3); it may be used to indicate if a Reliable Data
Service acknowledgment is requested and port numbers for originator
application and receiver application. PDN Connection Establishment Option an
optional field that is used to indicate what the SCEF should do if the UE has
not established the PDN connection (wait for the UE to establish the PDN
connection, respond with an error cause, or send a device trigger; see step
2). If PDN Connection Establishment Option is not provided with the non-IP
packet, the SCEF uses the PDN Connection Establishment Option that was
provided during NIDD Configuration to decide how to handle the absence of a
PDN connection. Non-IP data sequence number is an optional field that refers
to earlier MT NIDD requests, it is only included if the purpose of the MT NIDD
Submit Request is to replace or purge data that is buffered in the SCEF. If an
MT NIDD Submit Request is received with non-IP data and a non-IP data sequence
that is equal to a request that is already buffered, then the buffered data is
replaced. If an MT NIDD Submit Request is received with no non-IP data and a
non-IP data sequence that is equal to a request that is already buffered, then
the buffered data is purged.
2\. The SCEF determines the EPS Bearer Context based on the APN associated
with the NIDD configuration and the User Identity. If an SCEF EPS bearer
context corresponding to the External Identifier or MSISDN included in step 1
is found, then the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD
requests and that the SCS/AS has not exceeded the quota (e.g. 200 bytes in
24hrs) or rate (e.g. 10 bytes / hour) of data submission to the SCEF EPS
bearer. When determining the quota and the rate of data submissions, the SCEF
considers the APN Rate Control pre-configured in the SCEF and the Serving PLMN
Rate Control parameter that was received from MME during the T6a/b connection
establishment. The SCEF considers already buffered data during the check of
whether the quota or the rate was exceeded. If the SCEF receives additional
NIDD request(s) while already buffering data, the SCEF considers the non-IP
data priority when checking the quota and the rate and deciding whether to
buffer the additional non-IP data. If this check is successful and SCEF
buffers the additional non-IP data, the SCEF continues with step 5. If this
check fails or if the non-IP packet size is larger than then the Maximum
Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration, the
SCEF sends a MT NIDD Submit Response (Cause) with a cause value indicating the
reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at this step. Otherwise,
the flow continues with step 3.
If no SCEF EPS bearer context is found, then the SCEF, depending on PDN
Connection Establishment Option, may either:
\- send a MT NIDD Submit Response (Cause) with appropriate error cause value.
The flow stops at this step; or
\- perform device triggering towards the UE to establish a PDN Connection of
type Non-IP to the default APN by using T4 SMS device triggering to a pre-
defined SMS Application Port ID (refer to clause 5.2.2). In this case, the
SCEF sends a MT NIDD Submit Response (non-IP data sequence, Buffered
Indication, Trigger Indication, cause) with an appropriate cause value. The
Buffered Indication indicates if the SCEF buffered the non-IP data. The non-IP
data sequence number is assigned by the SCEF and may be used by the SCS/AS to
overwrite or purge the buffered data at a later time. The Trigger Indication
is used to indicate that a trigger was sent in order to establish the PDN
connection. If data is not buffered, the flow stops at this step, otherwise,
it proceeds to step 6. The SCEF may use Priority to configure the priority of
the device trigger and may use Maximum Latency to configure the validity
period of the device trigger; or
NOTE 1: It is left to stage 3 to reserve the SMS Application Port ID number
that will be used to carry the trigger to the UE to indicate that the UE
should establish a PDN Connection of type Non-IP to the default APN.
\- accept the MT NIDD Submit Request, and execute step 5 with an appropriate
cause value, and wait for the UE to perform a procedure (see TS 23.401 [7])
causing the establishment of a PDN connection to the SCEF (see clause
5.13.1.2). If data is not buffered, the flow stops at step 5.
NOTE 2: The duration for which the SCEF may wait for establishment of a PDN
connection to the SCEF for the given UE is implementation dependent.
3\. If an SCEF EPS bearer context corresponding to the External Identifier or
MSISDN included in step 1 is found, then the SCEF sends a NIDD Submit Request
(User Identity, EPS Bearer ID, SCEF ID, non-IP data, SCEF Wait Time, Maximum
Re-transmission time) message toward the MME/SGSN. SCEF Wait Time indicates
how long the SCEF is prepared to wait for MME/SGSN response. Maximum Re-
transmission indicates how long the SCEF is prepared to re-transmit the
message.
If the IWK-SCEF receives a NIDD Submit Request message from the SCEF, it
relays the message to the MME/SGSN.
4\. If the MME/SGSN can immediately deliver the non-IP data to the UE e.g.
when UE is already in ECM_CONNECTED mode, or UE is in ECM_IDLE and MME/SGSN is
able to initiate paging procedure (see TS 23.401 [7]), the procedure proceeds
at step 8.
If the MME/SGSN is aware of the UE being temporarily unreachable, or if the
MME/SGSN knows that the UE is not scheduled to be reachable within the SCEF
Wait Time, while using power saving functions e.g. UE Power Saving Mode (see
clause 4.5.4) or extended idle mode DRX (see clause 4.5.13), then the MME/SGSN
may send a NIDD Submit Response (Cause, Requested Re-Transmission Time)
message towards the SCEF. The Cause parameter indicates that Non-IP data was
not delivered to the UE, as the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power
saving but the MME/SGSN will notify the SCEF when the MME/SGSN determines the
UE is reachable. The MME/SGSN sets the Not Reachable for NIDD flag in the EMM
context for this UE and stores the corresponding SCEF address. If the Maximum
Re-transmission Time was included in the Request, the MME may indicate in
Requested Re-Transmission time IE the time when the SCEF is expected to re-
transmit the DL data to the currently unreachable UE.
5\. The SCEF may send a MT NIDD Submit Response (Requested Re-Transmission
time, non-IP data sequence number, Buffered Indication, Cause) to the SCS/AS
informing of the received results from the MME/SGSN. If the SCEF receives from
the MME/SGSN a Cause value indicating that UE is temporarily not reachable due
to power saving, the SCEF can buffer the non-IP data requested at step 3 based
on the configuration and proceed to step 6. The Buffered Indication indicates
if the SCEF buffered the non-IP data. The non-IP data sequence number is
assigned by the SCEF and may be used by the SCS/AS to overwrite or purge the
buffered data at a later time. If, in step 2, the SCEF buffered the non-IP
data and is waiting for the UE to establish a PDN connection, then the SCEF
proceeds to step 7 after T6a Connection Establishment. The Requested Re-
Transmission tells the SCS/AS when the SCEF is expected to re-transmit the DL
data to the currently unreachable UE.
6\. When the MME/SGSN detects that the UE is reachable (e.g. when coming out
of PSM mode by performing TAU/RAU, when initiating MO communication etc.), or
when the UE is about to become reachable (e.g. extended idle mode DRX cycle
expiring, MME/SGSN anticipating MO communication pattern for the UE etc.), and
the MME/SGSN has the Not Reachable for NIDD flag set, then the MME/SGSN sends
a NIDD Submit Indication (User Identity) message towards the SCEF. The
MME/SGSN clears the Not Reachable for NIDD flag from its EMM context.
If the MME included the Requested Re-transmission-Time in the NIDD Submit
Response, the MME sends a NIDD Submit Indication (User Identity) message
towards the SCEF only if the UE becomes reachable before the Requested Re-
transmission Time. The MME shall clear the Not Reachable for NIDD flag when
the Requested Re-transmission Time expires and the UE has not become reachable
yet.
If the MME/SGSN sends the NIDD Submit Request message towards the SCEF as
described in clause 5.13.4 or an Update Serving Node Information Request
message towards the SCEF as described in clause 5.13.6, then the MME/SGSN
clears the Not Reachable for NIDD flag from its EMM context, but it need not
send the NIDD Submit Indication message. If the SCEF receives the NIDD Submit
Request message or an Update Serving Node Information Request from the
MME/SGSN for this UE, the SCEF may consider it an implicit NIDD Submit
Indication, and proceed with step 7.
7\. If the data has not been purged, the SCEF sends a NIDD Submit Request
(User Identity, EPS Bearer ID, SCEF ID, non-IP data, SCEF Wait Time, Maximum
Re-transmission time) message toward the MME/SGSN.
8\. If required, the MME/SGSN pages the UE and delivers the non-IP data to the
UE using data transfer via the MME procedure as described in clause 5.3.4B.3
of TS 23.401 [7] or the SGSN procedure as described in clauses 9.3 and 9.6 of
TS 23.060 [6]. Depending on operator configuration, the MME/SGSN may generate
the necessary accounting information required for charging.
9\. If the MME/SGSN was able to initiate step 8, then the MME/SGSN sends a
NIDD Submit Response (cause) message towards the SCEF acknowledging the NIDD
Submit Request from SCEF received in step 3 or step 7. If the eNodeB supports
acknowledgements of downlink NIDD delivery and if acknowledgements of downlink
NAS data PDUs are enabled in the subscription information for the UE and the
eNodeB has acknowledged successful delivery to the MME/SGSN (see TS 23.401
[7], clause 5.3.4B.3), the cause is set to \'Success Acknowledged Delivery\'
otherwise \'Success Unacknowledged Delivery\'. If the delivery failed, the
cause is \'Unsuccessful delivery\'.
If Reliable Data Service header indicates that acknowledgement is requested,
then the UE shall respond with an acknowledgement to the DL data that was
received in step 8 following the Mobile Originated NIDD Procedure in clause
5.13.4, steps 1 - 2 and 5.
NOTE 3: The \'Success Acknowledged Delivery\' implies reliable delivery to the
UE using RLC acknowledged mode. The \'Success Unacknowledged Delivery\' result
does not imply the data is successfully received at the UE, but just the
MME/SGSN has sent the non-IP data in NAS signalling to the UE. If the UE sends
UL data in response to the received DL data in step 8, then it follows the
Mobile Originated NIDD Procedure in clause 5.13.4.
10\. The SCEF sends an MT NIDD Submit Response (Reliable Data Service
Acknowledgement Indication, Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication, non-IP data
sequence number, Cause). The Reliable Data Service Acknowledgement Indication
is used to indicate if an acknowledgement was received from the UE for the MT
NIDD. If the Reliable Data Service was requested in step 1, then the MT NIDD
Submit Response is sent to the SCS/AS after the acknowledgement is received
from the UE or, if no acknowledgment is received, then the MT NIDD Submit
Response is sent to the SCS/AS with a cause value indicating that no
acknowledgement was received. When the Reliable Data Service was not requested
in step 1, the Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication may be sent to the SCS/AS
indicating the result of the Hop-by-Hop acknowledgment with a value of
\'Success Acknowledged Delivery\', \'Success Unacknowledged Delivery\' or
\'Unsuccessful delivery\'.
### 5.13.4 Mobile Originated NIDD procedure
Figure 5.13.4-1: Mobile Originated NIDD procedure
1\. The UE sends a NAS message with EPS bearer ID and non-IP data, the
Reliable Data Service header is included if the Reliable data service is
enabled, to the MME as per the procedure described in clause 5.3.4B.2 of TS
23.401 [7] (steps 0 - 2) or the UE sends data to the SGSN (see clause 9.3 and
9.6 of TS 23.060 [6]) on a PDP Context of PDN type Non-IP associated with a
T6b interface.
2\. The MME/SGSN sends NIDD Submit Request (User Identity, EBI, SCEF ID, non-
IP data, MO Exception data counter) message to the SCEF. In the roaming case,
the MME/SGSN sends the message to the IWK-SCEF which forwards the message to
the SCEF over T7. The MME only includes the MO Exception data counter if the
RRC establishment cause is set to \"MO exception data\" and the UE is
accessing via the NB-IoT RAT. The MME maintains the MO Exception Data Counter
and sends it to the SCEF as described in TS 29.128 [37].
3\. When the SCEF receives the non-IP data on the T6a/T6b (or T7) interface,
and finds an SCEF EPS bearer context and the related T8 Destination Address,
then it sends the non-IP data to the SCS/AS that is identified by the T8
Destination address in a MO NIDD Indication (External Identifier or MSISDN,
non-IP data, TLTRI, Reliable Data Service Configuration). The Reliable Data
Service Configuration is used to provide the SCS/AS with additional
information when the Reliable Data Service (as defined in clause 4.5.14.3) is
enabled (e.g. indicate if an acknowledgement was requested and port numbers
for originator application and receiver application). If no T8 Destination
address is associated with the UE\'s PDN connection, the data is discarded, MO
NIDD Indication is not sent, and the flow continues at step 5.
NOTE 1: It is left to stage 3 whether or not the SCEF aggregates MO NIDD
Indication messages to the SCS/AS.
4\. The SCS/AS responds to the SCEF with a MO NIDD Acknowledgement (Cause).
5\. The SCEF sends NIDD Submit Response to MME/SGSN. In the roaming case, the
SCEF sends the message to the IWK-SCEF over T7 and the IWK-SCEF forwards the
message to the MME/SGSN over T6a/T6b. If the SCEF cannot deliver the data,
e.g. due to missing SCS/AS configuration, the SCEF sends an appropriate error
code to the MME/SGSN. If the Reliable Data Service is enabled in the APN
configuration and the non-IP packet indicates that an acknowledgment is
requested, then the SCEF follows the Mobile Terminated NIDD Procedure in
clause 5.13.3, steps 3-9.
NOTE 2: If the SCS/AS has Downlink data to send (e.g. an application level
acknowledgement for the NIDD delivery), it follows the Mobile Terminated NIDD
Procedure in clause 5.13.3.
### 5.13.5 T6a/T6b Connection Release
#### 5.13.5.1 General
The MME releases the T6a connection(s) towards the SCEF(s) corresponding to
the \"SCEF ID\" indicator for that APN in the following cases:
\- UE-initiated Detach procedure for E-UTRAN, or
\- MME-initiated Detach procedure, or
\- the HSS-initiated Detach procedure, or
\- UE or MME requested PDN disconnection procedure.
The SGSN releases the T6b connection(s) towards the SCEF(s) corresponding to
the \"SCEF ID\" indicator for that APN in the following cases:
\- Detach Procedures (see TS 23.060 [6] clause 6.6), or
\- MS and network initiated PDP Deactivation Procedures (see TS 23.060 [6]
clause 9.2.4).
The SCEF releases the T6a/b connection(s) towards the MME/SGSN corresponding
to PDN connections in the following cases:
\- when an NIDD Authorization Update Request from the HSS indicates that the
User is no longer authorized for NIDD, or
\- failure of SCEF or failure of SCS/AS connection, or
\- based on a request from the SCS/AS, or
\- based on removal of the APN associated with the T6a/b connection from the
SCEF.
#### 5.13.5.2 MME/SGSN Initiated T6a/T6b Connection Release procedure
Figure 5.13.5.2-1: MME/SGSN Initiated T6a/T6b Connection Release procedure
1\. The UE performs step 1 of the UE-initiated Detach procedure for E-UTRAN
(see clause 5.3.8.2.1 TS 23.401 [7]), or the MME performs the MME-initiated
Detach procedure (see clause 5.3.8.3 of TS 23.401 [7]), or the HSS performs
step 1a of the HSS-initiated Detach procedure (see clause 5.3.8.4 of TS 23.401
[7]), or the UE/MME performs steps 1a-1b of the UE or MME requested PDN
disconnection procedure (see clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.401 [7]), or a Detach
Procedure specified in TS 23.060 [6] clause 6,6 is performed, or an MS or
network initiated Deactivation Procedure specified in TS 23.060 [6] clause
9.2.4 is performed, for which the PDN/PDP connection to an SCEF exists.
2\. If the MME/SGSN has an active EPS bearer context(s) or PDP Context(s)
corresponding to the PDN/PDP connection to the SCEF(s), then for each active
EPS bearer context/PDP Context, the MME/SGSN sends a Delete SCEF Connection
Request (User Identity, EPS Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, APN) message towards the
SCEF. The MME/SGSN deletes the EPS bearer context/PDP Context corresponding to
the PDN connection.
NOTE 1: For further details of T6a/T6b/T7 interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
NOTE 2: The SGSN uses the NSAPI of the PDP Context used for SCEF communication
as an EPS Bearer ID when T6b is used.
3\. The SCEF sends a Delete SCEF Connection Response (User Identity, EPS
Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, APN, PCO) message towards the MME/SGSN indicating
acceptance of the removal of SCEF Connection information for the UE. The SCEF
deletes the SCEF EPS bearer context corresponding to the PDN connection.
NOTE 3: For further details of T6a/T6b/T7 interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
If the last PDN Connection of a given APN is being released, the SCEF may send
to the MME the current APN Rate Control Status (see TS 23.401 [7], clause
4.7.7.3). The MME stores it in the MM context.
#### 5.13.5.3 SCEF Initiated T6a/T6b Connection Release procedure
Figure 5.13.5.3-1: SCEF Initiated T6a/T6b Connection Release procedure
1\. An NIDD Authorization Update request from the HSS indicates that the User
is no longer authorized for NIDD, the SCS/AS indicates that the User\'s NIDD
PDN connection is no longer needed, or the SCEF determines that it is needs to
release a T6a/b connection.
2\. The SCEF sends a Delete SCEF Connection Request (User Identity, EPS Bearer
Identity, SCEF ID) message towards the MME/SGSN. The SCEF deletes the SCEF EPS
bearer context corresponding to the PDN connection.
NOTE 1: For further details of T6a/T6b/T7 interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
If the last PDN Connection of a given APN is being released, the SCEF may send
to the MME the APN Rate Control Status (see TS 23.401 [7], clause 4.7.7.3).
The MME stores it in the MM context.
3\. The MME/SGSN sends a Delete SCEF Connection Response (User Identity, EPS
Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, APN) message towards the SCEF acknowledging the
removal of SCEF Connection information for the UE. The MME/SGSN deletes the
EPS bearer context/PDP Context corresponding to the PDN connection.
NOTE 2: For further details of T6a/T6b/T7 interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
NOTE 3: The SGSN uses the NSAPI of the PDP Context used for SCEF communication
as an EPS Bearer ID when T6b is used.
4\. The MME may perform the MME-initiated Detach procedure (see clause 5.3.8.3
of TS 23.401 [7]), or step 1b of the UE or MME requested PDN disconnection
procedure (see clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.401 [7]). An SGSN may perform SGSN-
Initiated Detach Procedure specified in TS 23.060 [6] clause 6.6.2.1, or a
network initiated Deactivation Procedure specified in TS 23.060 [6] clause
9.2.4, for which the PDN/PDP connection to an SCEF exists.
### 5.13.6 Serving node relocation procedure over T6a/T6b
#### 5.13.6.1 General
Mobility may happen with respect to a non-IP PDN connection via the SCEF as a
result of a TAU/RAU procedure. The following procedures apply:
\- Successful TAU/RAU on a new MME/SGSN,
\- Failed TAU/RAU.
#### 5.13.6.2 Successful TAU/RAU procedure with T6a/T6b
The procedure in Figure 5.13.6.2-1 applies when a T6a/T6b PDN/PDP connection
exists for a UE that executes a successful TAU procedure to a new MME or a
successful RAU procedure to a new SGSN.
Figure 5.13.6.2-1: T6a/T6b and successful TAU/RAU procedure
1\. UE performs a successful TAU/RAU procedure (see TS 23.401 [7] and TS
23.060 [6]) and the new MME/SGSN receives subscription information for a non-
IP PDN/PDP connection to an APN that is associated with an \"Invoke SCEF
Selection\" indicator and an associated SCEF ID.
2\. If the subscription information corresponding to either the default APN
for PDN type of \"Non-IP\" or the UE requested APN includes \"Invoke SCEF
Selection\" indicator, then the new MME/SGSN shall create a PDN/PDP connection
to the SCEF or to the IWK-SCEF, using the already allocated EBI. As for the
\"T6a/T6b Connection Establishment Procedure\", clause 5.13.1.2, the new
MME/SGSN does so by sending an Update Serving Node Information Request (User
Identity, EPS Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, APN, Serving PLMN ID, IMEISV) message
towards the SCEF. If the SCEF received the Reachable for NIDD flag for the UE
from old MME/SGSN but has yet to receive the NIDD Submit Indication message
from the old MME/SGSN, and the SCEF has buffered the Non-IP data, then the
SCEF may execute the procedure in clause 5.13.3 starting at step 7.
NOTE 1: For further details of T6a/T6b interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
If the IWK-SCEF receives the Update Serving Node Information Request message
from the MME/SGSN, it shall forward it to the SCEF.
3\. The SCEF creates an SCEF EPS Bearer Context (see clause 5.3.2) for the
user identified via User Identity. The SCEF sends Update Serving Node
Information Response (User Identity, EPS Bearer Identity, SCEF ID, Cause, NIDD
Charging ID) message toward the MME/SGSN confirming establishment of the PDN
connection to the SCEF for the UE. If the IWK-SCEF receives the Update Serving
Node Information Response message from the SCEF, it shall forward it to the
MME/SGSN.
NOTE 2: For further details of T6a/T6b interactions please refer to Stage 3
specifications.
### 5.13.7 Void
### 5.13.8 NIDD Authorisation Update
Figure 5.13.8-1 illustrates the procedure of updating or revoking an existing
NIDD Authorisation. The HSS may initiate the NIDD Authorisation Update
procedure with the SCEF to send updated Authorisation information to the SCEF.
Figure 5.13.8-1: NIDD Authorisation Update procedure
1\. The HSS may send an NIDD Authorisation Update Request (IMSI and MSISDN or
External Identifier, APN, Result) message to the SCEF to update a user\'s NIDD
authorisation. The HSS shall include in the NIDD Authorisation Update Request
the IMSI and either MSISDN or External Identifier or both. The SCEF initiates
the SCEF Initiated T6a/T6b Connection Release Procedure.
2\. The SCEF sends an NIDD Authorisation Update Response (cause) message to
the HSS to acknowledge the authorisation update. If the authorisation is
removed, the SCEF should release T6a/T6b connection as specified in clause
5.13.5.3.
3\. The SCEF informs the SCS/AS that the User\'s authorisation status has
changed by sending an NIDD Authorisation Notification Request (External
Identifier or MSISDN, TLTRI, Result) message to the SCS/AS.
4\. The SCS/AS responds to the SCEF with an NIDD Authorisation Notification
Response.
## 5.14 PFD management via SCEF
### 5.14.1 Procedure for PFD management via SCEF
This procedure is used by the 3rd Party SCS/AS to manage PFDs into the
operator network via SCEF. Figure 5.14.1-1 illustrates the procedure.
Figure 5.14.1-1: procedure for PFD management via SCEF
1\. The 3rd party SCS/AS sends a PFD Management Request (SCS/AS Identifier,
external Application Identifier(s) and one or more sets of PFDs and PFD
operation for each Application Identifier, Allowed Delay) message to the SCEF.
The external Application Identifier(s) should be provided by an 3rd party
SCS/AS that is known at the SCEF, so that the 3rd party SCS/AS and the MNO has
an SLA in place. PFD operation indicates that the PFD is to be created,
updated or removed in the operator\'s network. The Allowed Delay is an
optional parameter. If the Allowed Delay is included, it indicates that the
list of PFDs in this request should be deployed within the time interval
indicated by the Allowed Delay.
2\. Based on operator policies, if the 3rd party SCS/AS is not authorized to
perform this request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow it due to the Allowed
Delay is too short or other reasons), the SCEF performs step 6 and provides a
Cause value appropriately indicating the error. Otherwise, the SCEF translates
each external Application Identifier to the corresponding Application
Identifier known at the PFDF.
3\. The SCEF sends a PFD Management Request message (Application
Identifier(s), one or more sets of PFDs and PFD operation for each Application
Identifier, Allowed Delay) to the PFDF.
4\. The PFDF creates, updates or deletes the list of PFDs for each Application
Identifier into the PFDF as requested by the respective PFD operation.
5\. The PFDF sends a PFD Management Response (Application Identifier(s),
Cause) message to the SCEF to provide the feedback of the handling result for
the PFD Management Request.
6\. The SCEF sends a PFD Management Response (Cause) message to the 3rd party
SCS/AS to provide the feedback of the handling result for the PFD Management
Request.
### 5.14.2 PFD definition
PFD (Packet Flow Description) is a set of information enabling the detection
of application traffic including:
\- PFD id; and
\- one or more of the following:
\- 3-tuple(s) including protocol, server side IP address and port number;
\- the significant parts of the URL to be matched, e.g. host name;
\- a Domain name matching criteria and information about applicable
protocol(s).
NOTE 1: Based on the agreement between SCS/AS and mobile operator, the PFD can
be designed to convey proprietary extension for proprietary application
traffic detection mechanisms.
NOTE 2: How the PFD(s) are used in service data flow detection is specified in
TS 23.203 [27].
## 5.15 Procedure for MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4
Figure 5.15-1: MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4
1\. UE uses Short Message Mobile Originated procedure as specified in TS
23.040 [12] to delivery small data to SCS/AS. The service centre address
points to the SMS-SC which contain the function described in this procedure,
the destination SME address is set to short/long code of the SCS/AS, and
Application Port ID element of the TP-User-Data field is set to an the
appropriate value.
2\. For MSISDN-less subscription, the MSC/VLR/MME/SGSN/IP-SM-GW uses the dummy
MSISDN. This MSISDN and the IMSI of the UE are sent using existing SMS
delivery procedure (e.g., MAP MO forward SM operation) to SMS-SC.
3\. SMS-SC uses the destination SME address (long/short code of the SCS/AS) to
identify the corresponding MTC-IWF based on a pre-configured mapping table.
SMS-SC extracts the SMS payload, Application port ID, and IMSI of the UE and
deliver them to MTC-IWF via T4 along with the destination SME address
(long/short code of the SCS/AS).
4-5. Over S6m, MTC-IWF uses the IMSI of the UE and application port ID to
query the HSS/HLR for external ID.
6\. Over Tsp, a MTC-IWF forwards the SMS payload, external ID, and Application
Port ID to the SCS/AS. The SCS/AS is identified with the destination SME
address (long/short code of the SCS/AS) received from step 3. The payload is
delivered directly to the SCS/AS, not processed by MTC-IWF.
7\. Via T4, MTC-IWF returns a success or failure delivery indication to SMS-
SC.
8\. SMS-SC indicates success/failure back to UE using existing SMS delivery
report defined in TS 23.040 [12].
## 5.16 Procedure for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF
Figure 5.16-1 shows the procedures for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control
via SCEF.
Figure 5.16-1: Procedure for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF
1\. The SCS/AS sends an Enhanced Coverage Request (External Identifier or
MSISDN, SCS/AS Identifier, Request Type, Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data)
message to the SCEF. Request Type indicates if the request is to query the
status of, or to enable, or to disable the enhanced coverage restriction.
Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data provides data related to the Enhanced
Coverage Restriction. Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data is only present if
Request Type is to either enable or disable the enhanced coverage restriction.
2\. The SCEF stores the SCS/AS Identifier. The SCEF assigns an SCEF Reference
ID. Based on operator policies, if either the SCS/AS is not authorized to
perform this request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or the Enhanced
Coverage Request is malformed or the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota or rate of
submitting Enhanced Coverage requests, the SCEF performs step 9 and provides a
Cause value appropriately indicating the failure result.
3\. The SCEF sends an Enhanced Coverage Request (External Identifier or
MSISDN, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID, Type) message to the HSS.
4\. The HSS examines the Enhanced Coverage Request message, e.g. with regard
to the existence of External Identifier or MSISDN, whether any included
parameters are in the range acceptable for the operator, whether the Enhanced
Coverage restriction is supported by the serving MME/SGSN. If this check fails
the HSS follows step 8 and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for
the failure condition to the SCEF.
If the Request Type is to get the current status of enhanced coverage HSS
retrieves the value and procedure follows at Step 8. Else If the Type is to
enable or to disable the enhanced coverage, HSS sets Enhanced Coverage
Restricted parameter to the appropriate value and the procedure continues at
step 5.
5\. If required by the specific Enhanced Coverage Request Type and when
Enhanced Coverage is supported by the serving MME/SGSN, the HSS sends an
Insert Subscriber Data Request (Type, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID) message to
the MME/SGSN.
6\. Based on operator policies, the MME/SGSN may reject the request (e.g.
overload or HSS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting enhanced coverage
requests defined by an SLA).
The MME/SGSN updates Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameters in the MME/SGSN
context.
The MME/SGSN will transfer the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameters stored
as part of its context information during MME/SGSN change.
NOTE: UE is informed of the updated Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameters
value at next TAU/RAU, or based on the local policy, network can detach the UE
indicating re-attach is required.
7\. If the Enhanced Coverage restriction is updated successful, the MME/SGSN
sends an Insert Subscriber Data Answer (Cause) message to the HSS. MME/SGSN
may include the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter in the Insert
Subscriber Data Answer message.
8\. The HSS sends an Enhanced Coverage Response (SCEF Reference ID, Cause)
message to the SCEF. HSS includes result = success/failure and in case of
success may include Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data.
In the case of UE mobility, the HSS determines whether the new MME/SGSN
supports Enhanced Coverage restriction.
9\. The SCEF sends an Enhanced Coverage Response (Cause, Enhanced Coverage
Restriction Data) message to the SCS/AS. Cause indicates success or failure.
If in step 1 the Enhanced Coverage Request message is sent to query the status
of Enhanced Coverage Restricted, then Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data is
included (in case of success) in the Enhanced Coverage Response message.
## 5.17 Procedures for accessing MTC-IWF Functionality via SCEF
### 5.17.1 Device triggering procedure via T8
Figure 5.17.1-1 shows the procedure for Triggering via T8.
Figure 5.17.1-1: Device triggering procedure via T8
1\. The SCS/AS determines the need to trigger the device. If the SCS/AS has no
contact details for the SCEF, it may determine the IP address(es)/port(s) of
the SCEF by performing a DNS query using the External Identifier or using a
locally configured SCEF identifier.
2\. The SCS/AS sends the Trigger Submit Request (External Identifier or
MSISDN, SCS Identifier, trigger reference number, validity period, priority,
Application Port ID and trigger payload) message to the SCEF. The SCEF assigns
a TLTRI to the Trigger Submit Request.
3\. The SCEF/MTC-IWF executes steps 3-6 of the Device triggering over Tsp
procedure of clause 5.2.1, followed by steps 1-2 of the Trigger Delivery using
T4 procedure of clause 5.2.2.
4\. The SCEF sends a Trigger Submit Confirmation (TLTRI, Cause) to the SCS/AS
to confirm that the Device Trigger Request has been accepted for delivery to
the UE.
5\. Steps 4-9 of the Trigger Delivery using T4 procedure of clause 5.2.2 are
executed. In step 9 of the Trigger Delivery using T4 procedure, the SCEF/MTC-
IWF receives the Message Delivery Report from the SMS/SC.
6\. The SCEF sends the Trigger Delivery Report (TLTRI, cause) message to the
SCS/AS with a cause value indicating the trigger delivery outcome (e.g.
succeeded, unknown or failed and the reason for the failure).
### 5.17.2 Device triggering recall/replace procedures via T8
Figure 5.17.2-1 shows the procedures for recalling and replacing triggers over
T8.
Figure 5.17.2-1: Procedure for triggering recall/replace via T8
1\. The SCS/AS determines that it needs to recall/replace a trigger message
that it has previously submitted. The SCS/AS sends Trigger Modify Request (SCS
Identifier, TLTRI, action type, new trigger reference number, new validity
period, new priority, new Application Port ID, and new trigger payload)
message with action type set to \"Trigger Recall Request\" or \"Trigger
Replace Request\". The SCS needs to include a new trigger reference number,
new validity period, new priority, new Application Port ID and new trigger
payload for trigger replace request only. The SCEF uses the TLTRI to determine
the trigger reference number which was assigned to the previously submitted
trigger message that the SCS/AS wants to cancel.
2\. The SCEF/MTC-IWF executes steps 2-4 of the Device trigger recall/replace
procedure over Tsp of clause 5.2.3.1.
3\. The SCEF indicates trigger recall/replace success or failure in the
Trigger Modify Response (result) message to the SCS/AS.
### 5.17.3 Procedure for MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T8
Figure 5.17.3-1 shows the procedures for MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T8.
Figure 5.17.3-1: Procedure for MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T8
1\. The UE sends an SMS to the SCS/AS. The UE, MSC/MME/SGSN, and SMS-SC
execute steps 1 and 2 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 procedure of clause
5.15. SMS-SC uses the destination SME address (long/short code of the SCS/AS)
to identify the corresponding SCEF based on a pre-configured mapping table.
SMS-SC extracts the SMS payload, Application port ID, and IMSI of the UE and
deliver them to SCEF via T4 along with the destination SME address (long/short
code of the SCS/AS).
2\. The SCEF/MTC-IWF executes steps 4-5 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4
procedure of clause 5.15.
3\. The SCEF sends a MO SMS Submit Request (SMS payload, external ID, and
Application Port ID) to the SCS/AS. The SCS/AS is identified with the
destination SME address (long/short code of the SCS/AS) received from step 1.
The payload is delivered directly to the SCS/AS, it is not processed by SCEF.
4\. The SCS/AS sends a MO SMS Submit Response to the SCEF.
5\. The SCEF/MTC-IWF executes steps 7 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4
procedure of clause 5.15. The SMS Delivery or failure report is delivered to
the UE as shown in step 8 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 procedure of clause
5.15.
## 5.18 Procedure for Network Parameter Configuration via SCEF
Figure 5.18-1: Procedure for Network Parameter Configuration via SCEF
1\. The SCS/AS sends a T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Request
(External Identifier or MSISDN or External Group Identifier, SCS/AS
Identifier, Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time and Suggested Number of
Downlink Packets, Group Reporting Guard Time, TLTRI for Deletion) message to
the SCEF to request that the network consider setting Maximum Latency, Maximum
Response Time and Suggested Number of Downlink Packets to the requested
value(s); they are all optional fields. The SCEF assigns a TLTRI to the T8 Set
Suggested Network Configuration Request. If the SCS/AS wants to perform
deletion of a previously configured network parameter(s), then it shall
include TLTRI for Deletion.
2\. The SCEF stores the TLTRI and assigns it to an SCEF Reference ID. Based on
operator policies, if either the SCS/AS is not authorized to perform this
request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or the Set Suggested Network
Configuration Request is malformed, the SCEF skips steps 3-10 and provides a
Cause value appropriately indicating the error. The SCEF checks whether the
parameters are within the range defined by operator policies. If one or more
of the parameters are not within range, then, based on operator policies, the
SCEF may either reject the request by skipping steps 3-10 and providing a
cause value that indicates which parameters are out of range, discard the
value(s) that are out of range and proceed with the flow, or select different
value(s) that are in range and proceed with flow. If the SCEF decides on using
values, for the parameters provided in step 1, different to the ones provided
by the SCS/AS, then the SCS/AS is informed of it in step 11. If the SCEF
received a TLTRI for Deletion, the SCEF looks up the SCEF context pointed to
by the TLTRI for Deletion to derive the related SCEF Reference ID for
Deletion.
3\. The SCEF sends a Set Suggested Network Configuration Request (External
Identifier or MSISDN or External Group Identifier, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID,
Maximum Latency (if provided), Maximum Response Time (if provided), Suggested
Number of Downlink Packets (if provided), Group Reporting Guard Time, SCEF
Reference ID for Deletion) message to the HSS to configure the parameters on
the HSS and on the MME/SGSN. If the External Group Identifier is included,
External Identifier or MSISDN shall be ignored.
4\. The HSS examines the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request message,
e.g. with regard to the existence of External Identifier or MSISDN or External
Group Identifier or whether the included parameters are in the range
acceptable for the operator, if this check fails the HSS either skips steps
5-9 and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition
to the SCEF or selects different value(s) that are in range and proceeds with
flow. If the HSS decides on using values, for the parameters provided in step
3, different to the ones provided by the SCEF, then the SCEF is informed of it
in step 10. In addition, the HSS sets the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer
using the value of Maximum Latency, if it is provided. If the subscribed
periodic RAU/TAU timer was previously set by a Monitoring Request then,
depending on operator configuration, the flow skips steps 5-9 and the HSS
rejects the Network Configuration Request with an appropriate Cause indicating
the failure condition or accepts the request. In the case that the HSS accepts
this request, the HSS cancels the previously accepted Monitoring Request. The
cancelled monitoring request may be configured previously for a single UE or a
group of UEs. If the cancelled monitoring request was configured for a group
of UEs, then the monitoring event is cancelled for all UEs in the group. If
SCEF Reference ID for Deletion was provided, the HSS deletes the network
parameter configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion.
NOTE 1: If the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request message in step 4
includes a group of UEs, the HSS checks the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer
for each UE whether it was set by a different Monitoring Request and decides
either rejection or acceptance of the Monitoring Request based on operator
policy.
NOTE 2: In the present release an event subscription for a UE can be cancelled
due to conflict with a subsequent event subscription related to the Maximum
Latency setting of another UE as described above.
5\. For group based processing (if the HSS received the Set Suggested Network
Configuration Response with an External Group Identifier), the HSS sends a Set
Suggested Network Configuration Response (SCEF Reference ID, SCEF Reference ID
for Deletion, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the Set
Suggested Network Configuration Request before beginning the processing of
individual UEs indicating that Group processing is in progress.
6\. For group based processing (if the SCEF received the T8 Set Suggested
Network Configuration Response with an External Group Identifier), the SCEF
sends a T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (TLTRI, Cause) message
to the SCS/AS. The Cause value indicates progress of Group processing request.
7\. The HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request (Maximum Response Time (if
provided), subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), Suggested Number
of Downlink Packets (if provided)) message to the MME/SGSN for the individual
UE or for each individual group member UE. If the Set Suggested Network
Configuration Request message is for a group of UEs, the HSS sends an Insert
Subscriber Data Request message per UE to all the MME/SGSN(s) serving the
members of the group. If the HSS received a SCEF Reference ID for Deletion in
step 3, the HSS shall stop using the provisioned values and determine the
parameters that it notifies to the MME/SGSN as in the case when no externally
provisioned parameters apply.
8\. The MME/SGSN verifies the request, e.g. if the parameters are covered by a
roaming agreement when the request is from another PLMN. If this check fails,
the MME/SGSN follows step 9 and provides a Cause value indicating the reason
for the failure condition to the HSS. Based on operator policies, the MME/SGSN
may also reject the request due to other reasons (e.g. overload or HSS has
exceeded its quota or rate of submitting requests defined by an SLA).
If the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer was modified, at every subsequent
TAU/RAU procedure, the MME/SGSN applies the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer.
NOTE 3: The MME/SGSN will transfer the parameters stored as part of its
context information during an MME/SGSN change.
9\. The MME/SGSN sends an Insert Subscriber Data Answer (Cause) message to the
HSS.
10\. For single UE processing (if the HSS received the Set Suggested Network
Configuration Response without an External Group Identifier), the HSS sends
Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (SCEF Reference ID, SCEF
Reference ID for Deletion, Maximum Response Time (if modified), Maximum
Latency (if modified), Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if modified),
Cancelled SCEF Reference ID, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge
acceptance or indicate the rejection of the Set Suggested Network
Configuration Request. If the HSS modified any of the parameters that were
provided in step 3, the modified values are provided to the SCEF.
For group based processing, if the Group Reporting Guard Time was provided in
the Request, the HSS accumulates multiple responses for the UEs of the group
within the Group Reporting Guard Time. After the Group Reporting Guard Time
expiration, the HSS sends a Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (SCEF
Reference ID, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, Cause, list of (External
Identifier or MSISDN, Cancelled SCEF Reference ID, Cause)) with the
accumulated responses. The HSS includes UE identity(ies) and a Cause value
indicating the reason for the failure in the message if the monitoring
configuration of the group member failed.
If the HSS cancelled Monitoring Event(s) for UE(s) in step 4 and the cancelled
Monitoring Event(s) is subscribed by the SCEF which is the same as the one
sending the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request at step 1, Cancelled
SCEF Reference ID is included and set to the SCEF Reference ID of the
cancelled Monitoring Event(s).
10a. If the HSS cancelled a Monitoring Event(s) for UE in step 4 and the
cancelled Monitoring Event(s) is subscribed by the SCEF which is different
from the SCEF sending the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request at step
1, the HSS sends the Monitoring Indication message towards the SCEF which
subscribed the cancelled Monitoring Event(s) and includes SCEF Reference ID of
a cancelled Monitoring Event(s).
11\. For single UE processing (if the SCEF received the T8 Set Suggested
Network Configuration Response without an External Group Identifier), the SCEF
sends a T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (TLTRI, Maximum
Response Time (if modified), Maximum Latency (if modified), Suggested Number
of Downlink Packets (if modified), Cause) message to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF
or HSS modified any of the parameters that were provided in step 1, the
modified values are provided to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF discarded any of the
parameters that were provided in step 1, the cause value indicates which
values were discarded.
For group based processing, SCEF sends a T8 Set Suggested Network
Configuration Response (TLTRI Maximum Response Time (if modified), Maximum
Latency (if modified), Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if modified),
Cause, list of (External Identifier or MSISDN, Cause)) with the accumulated
responses received from the HSS in step 10. If the SCEF or HSS modified any of
the parameters that were provided in step 1, the modified values are provided
to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF discarded any of the parameters that were provided
in step 1, the cause value indicates which values were discarded.
12\. If the SCEF received Cancelled SCEF Reference ID in step 10 or 10a, the
steps 2-5 of Network-initiated Explicit Monitoring Event Deletion procedure
defined in clause 5.6.9 are performed with the TLTRI corresponding to the
Cancelled SCEF Reference ID.
###### ## Annex A (informative): MTC Deployment Scenarios
In the indirect and hybrid models, the deployment of a SCS may be inside or
outside the operator domain as illustrated in figures A-1 and A-2. When the
SCS is part of the operator domain (figure A-1 C and figure A-2), the SCS is
considered a mobile operator internal network function, is operator
controlled, and may provide operator value-added services. In this case,
security and privacy protection for communication between the MTC-IWF and SCS
is optional. When the SCS is deployed outside the operator domain (figure A-1
B and A-2), the SCS is MTC Service Provider controlled. In this case, security
and privacy protection for communication between the MTC-IWF and SCS is
needed. In the direct model (figure A-1 A), there may not be an external or
internal SCS in the communication path.
Figure A-1: Deployment scenarios for direct and indirect model
Figure A-2: Deployment scenarios for hybrid model
An operator may deploy the hybrid model with a combination of no internal and
external SCS (as in the Direct Model) and internal and/or external SCS (as in
the Indirect Model). As shown in Figure A-2, a UE may be in communications
with multiple SCSs in an HPLMN which can be made up of a combination of
operator controlled and MTC service provider controlled SCSs. In that
scenario, the MTC Service provider controlled SCS, and the 3GPP operator
controlled SCS may offer different capabilities to the MTC Applications.
Though not illustrated, it is also possible that the deployment of an AS may
be inside the operator domain and under operator control.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Void
###### ## Annex C (informative): Triggering with OMA Push
# C.1 General
The 3GPP Device Trigger function enables a transport of application defined
triggers to be delivered from a Service Capability Server (SCS) towards the
UE. One defined application trigger framework is OMA Push Architecture [20].
OMA Push defined messages can be carried as payload in the Device Trigger
message.
# C.2 Triggering flow using Service Loading
Figure C.2-1: Triggering flow using OMA Push
1\. The SCS generates content (e.g. an MTC application specific command) and a
URI towards the content (or receives a URI towards content from another
source) and then the SCS (performing OMA Push Proxy Gateway functionality)
generates a Push Message [19] with the PDU set according to Service Loading
[17], and sends a trigger request over Tsp according to clause 5.2.1.
2\. The MTC-IWF receives the trigger request and sends it according to clause
5.2.1.
3\. The UE SMS dispatcher receives the SMS and routes it to the OMA Push
Client which has registered for the triggering routing identifier (e.g. SMS
Application port). The OMA Push Client, optionally validates the source (using
white-list defined in OMA Push Management Object [18]) and then forwards the
trigger using the Application-Id (e.g. to the M2M Service Capability Layer).
4\. The UE activates a PDP/PDN connection.
5\. The content described as part of the URI is retrieved (retrieval of
content is mandatory for content type Service Loading [17]).
6\. Based on the content retrieved the addressed Application may perform
additional actions (e.g. the M2M Service Capability Layer may convey the
information to an M2M Application addressed as part of the \"command\"
retrieved, within the same or in a different physical device), but this is
outside scope of 3GPP standardisation.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Device triggering using direct model over
user plane
The following flow shows an example of device triggering using direct model
over user plane. In this example, an application in the UE explicitly
registers with a DT-AS/SCS (Device Trigger Application Server) in the home
operator\'s network using an existing PDN connection (e.g., default PDN
connection). The DT-AS uses the information from the application registration
(such as IP address, port, protocol, etc.) to deliver the incoming device
triggers, forwarded by another AS (e.g., third party AS) or itself, to the UE
through the user plane. Once the UE receives the trigger, the UE either uses
the existing PDN connection or the UE sets up a new PDN connection to the
appropriate APN to contact the third-party Application Server.
Figure D-1: Triggering flow using direct model over user plane
1\. The UE/MTC application registers with the DT-AS in an operator\'s network
using an existing PDN connection (for e.g., default PDN). The registration
information, for example, could include the IPv4/IPv6 address and the port
number where the application is reachable.
2\. The DT-AS receives a trigger from a third-party AS to reach the UE.
3\. The DT-AS delivers the trigger to the UE over the user plane.
4\. The UE either uses the existing PDN connection or sets up a new PDN
connection using the appropriate APN to contact the third-party AS.
