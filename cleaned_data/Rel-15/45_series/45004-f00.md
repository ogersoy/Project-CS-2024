identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

# 1 Scope
The modulator receives the bits from the encryption unit, see 3GPP TS 45.001,
and produces an RF signal. The filtering of the Radio Frequency (RF) signal
necessary to obtain the spectral purity is not defined, neither are the
tolerances associated with the theoretical filter requirements specified.
These are contained in 3GPP TS 45.005.
# 1.1 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

## 2.1 Modulating symbol rate
The modulating symbol rate is the normal symbol rate which is defined as 1/T =
1 625/6 ksymb/s (i.e. approximately 270.833 ksymb/s), which corresponds to 1
625/6 kbit/s (i.e. 270.833 kbit/s). T is the normal symbol period (see 3GPP TS
45.010).
## 2.2 Start and stop of the burst
Before the first bit of the bursts as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002 enters the
modulator, the modulator has an internal state as if a modulating bit stream
consisting of consecutive ones (_di = 1_) had entered the differential
encoder. Also after the last bit of the time slot, the modulator has an
internal state as if a modulating bit stream consisting of consecutive ones
(_di_ _= 1_) had continued to enter the differential encoder. These bits are
called dummy bits and define the start and the stop of the active and the
useful part of the burst as illustrated in figure 1. Nothing is specified
about the actual phase of the modulator output signal outside the useful part
of the burst. In case of EC operation, the phase during the useful part of
contiguous bursts, belonging to the same blind physical layer transmissions
within a TDMA frame, has a fixed relation, see subclauses 2.6 and 2.7.
Figure 1: Relation between active part of burst, tail bits and dummy bits. For
the normal burst the useful part lasts for 147 modulating bits
## 2.3 Differential encoding
Each data value _di_ _= [0,1]_ is differentially encoded. The output of the
differential encoder is:
${\hat{d}}_{i} = d_{i}{Åd}_{i - 1}(d_{i}Î\left{ 0,1 \right})$
where ⊕ denotes modulo 2 addition.
The modulating data value _αi_ input to the modulator is:
$\alpha_{i} = 1 - 2{\hat{d}}_{i}(\alpha_{i}Î\left{ - 1, + 1 \right})$
## 2.4 Filtering
The modulating data values _αi_ as represented by Dirac pulses excite a linear
filter with impulse response defined by:
$g(t) = h(t) \ast \text{rect}\left( \frac{t}{T} \right)$
where the function _rect(x)_ is defined by:
$\text{rect}\left( \frac{t}{T} \right) = \frac{1}{T}\text{for}\left| t \right|
 6 _T_.
\- A spectrally narrow pulse shape, c~0~(t), which is the linearised GMSK
pulse as defined in subclause 3.5 for the normal symbol period.
NOTE: The linearised GMSK pulse is not scaled to the reduced symbol period.
Hence its duration in terms of the reduced symbol period is 6T.
The base band signal is
The time reference t\' = 0 is the start of the active part of the burst as
shown in figure 3. This is also the start of the symbol period of symbol
number 0 (containing the first tail bit) as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002.
For the uplink, the pulse shape that shall be used when transmitting a burst
is dependent on the parameter \'Pulse format\' that is sent during assignment
(see 3GPP TS 44.060). For the downlink the spectrally narrow pulse shape shall
be used.
## 5.6 Modulation
The modulated RF carrier during the useful part of the burst is:
where _Es_ is the energy per modulating symbol, _f0_ is the centre frequency
and _ϕ0_ is a random phase and is constant during one burst.

## 6.1 Modulating symbol rate
The modulating symbol rate is the normal symbol rate which is defined as 1/T =
1 625/6 ksymb/s (i.e. approximately 270,833 ksymb/s), which corresponds to 2*1
625/6 kbit/s (i.e. 541,666 kbit/s). T is the normal symbol period (see 3GPP TS
45.010).
## 6.2 Symbol mapping
The modulating bits are mapped to the quaternary symbols according to Table 5.
Table 5: Mapping between modulating bits and quaternary symbols _._
+---------------------+--------------------------------+ | Modulating bits for | AQPSK symbol in polar notation | | | | | _a~i~, b~i~_ | _s~i~_ | +---------------------+--------------------------------+ | | | +---------------------+--------------------------------+ | (0,0) | | +---------------------+--------------------------------+ | (0,1) | | +---------------------+--------------------------------+ | (1,0) | | +---------------------+--------------------------------+ | (1,1) | | +---------------------+--------------------------------+
This is illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Mapping of modulating bits to AQPSK symbols
The ratio of power between the Q and I channels is defined as the Subchannel
Power Imbalance Ratio (SCPIR).
The value of the SCPIR is given by
$\text{SCPIR} = \text{20} \times \text{log}_{\text{10}}\left( \text{tan}\left(
\alpha \right) \right)\ \text{dB}$.
The value of $\alpha$shall be chosen such that $\left| \text{SCPIR} \right|
\leq \text{10}\ \text{dB}$.
## 6.3 Start and stop of the burst
Before the first bit of the burst as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002 enters the
modulator, the state of the modulator is undefined. Also after the last bit of
the burst, the state of the modulator is undefined. The tail symbols (see 3GPP
TS 45.002) define the start and the stop of the active and the useful part of
the burst as illustrated in Figure 6. Nothing is specified about the actual
phase of the modulator output signal outside the useful part of the burst.
Figure 6: Relation between active part of burst and tail symbols. For the
normal burst (see 3GPP TS 45.001) the useful part lasts for 147 modulating
symbols.
## 6.4 Symbol rotation
The symbols are continuously rotated with φ radians per symbol before pulse
shaping, where φ = π/2. The rotated symbols are defined as
## 6.5 Pulse shaping
The modulating symbols ${\hat{s}}_{i}$ as represented by Dirac pulses excite
the following linear pulse shaping filter:
• c0(t), which is the linearised GMSK pulse as defined in subclause 3.5 for
the normal symbol period.
The base band signal is
$y(t') = \sum_{i}^{}{{\hat{s}}_{i} \cdot c_{0}(t' - \text{iT} + 2T)}$
The time reference _t\'_ _= 0_ is the start of the active part of the burst as
shown in figure 6. This is also the start of the symbol period of symbol
number 0 (containing the first tail bit) as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002.
## 6.6 Modulation
The modulated RF carrier during the useful part of the burst is:
where _Es_ is the energy per modulating symbol, _f0_ is the centre frequency
and _ϕ0_ is a random phase and is constant during one burst.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Tx filter coefficients for the spectrally wide
pulse shape
For an oversampling factor of 16, i.e. 5200 ksamples/s, there are 97 Tx filter
coefficients _c_ ~1~ to _c_ ~97~ for the spectrally wide pulse shape. The
coefficients are symmetric to _c_ ~49~, i.e. _c_ ~49--_k_ ~ = _c_ ~49+_k_ ~.
