# 4 Nchf_SpendingLimitControl Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service, as defined in 3GPP TS23.502 [3] and
3GPP TS23.503 [6], is provided by the Charging Function (CHF).
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service enables the NF service consumer (i.e.
PCF) to retrieve policy counter status information per UE from the CHF by
subscribing to spending limit reporting (i.e. notifications of policy counter
status changes).
If the spending limit reporting is no more required the
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service enables the NF service consumer to
unsubscribe from the reporting.
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl Service applies to the cases where the PCF interacts
with the CHF in the non-roaming scenario, and the H-PCF interacts with the
H-CHF in the home-routed scenario.
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service is provided by the CHF and consumed by
the PCF, as shown in figure 4.1.2-1 for the SBI representation model and in
figure 4.1.2-2 for the reference point representation model.

representation
Figure 4.1.2-2: Nchf_SpendingLimitContol service architecture, reference point
representation
### 4.1.3 Network Functions
#### 4.1.3.1 Charging Function (CHF)
The Charging Function (CHF) is part of the Converged Charging System (CCS).
The CHF provides the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service and is specified in
3GPP TS 32.240 [7].
#### 4.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
The PCF is the known NF service consumer, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
The NF service consumer accesses policy counter status information relating to
the subscriber spending from the CHF and uses the status of each relevant
policy counter as input to its policy decision as required by the decision
logic.
## 4.2 Service Operations
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The service operations defined for the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service are
shown in table 4.2.1-1.
_Table 4.2.1-1: Nchf_SpendingLimitControl Service Operations_
* * *
**Service operation name** **Description** **Initiated by**
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe This service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to subscribe to notification of changes in the status of the
policy counters available and retrieval of the status of the policy counters
for which subscription is accepted. NF service consumer (PCF)
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe This service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to unsubscribe from notification of changes in the status of
all policy counters. NF service consumer (PCF)
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify This service operation is used by the CHF to
notify the NF service consumers about the change of the status of the
subscribed policy counters. Alternatively, it can be used by the CHF to notify
that the status for one or multiple subscribed policy counter will change in
the future, indicating the time when this change shall be applied.
Alternatively, it is also used to notify the NF service consumer of the
removal of a subscriber from the CHF system for the purpose that the NF
service consumer can terminate the subscriptions of all policy counters of the
subscriber. CHF
* * *
### 4.2.2 Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe service operation
#### 4.2.2.1 General
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe service operation is used by the NF
service consumer to subscribe to notification of changes in the status of the
policy counters available and to retrieve the status of the policy counters
for which the subscription is accepted. The following procedures are related
to the subscribe service operation:
\- initial spending limit retrieval; and
\- intermediate spending limit report retrieval.
#### 4.2.2.2 Initial spending limit retrieval
Figure 4.2.2.2-1 shows the scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the CHF to retrieve the status of policy counters available at the
CHF and to subscribe to spending limit reporting (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3],
figure 4.16.8.2.1).
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to retrieve policy counter
status and spending limit reporting
The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource
\"{apiRoot}/nchf-spendinglimitcontrol/v1/subscriptions\" representing the
\"Spending Limit Retrieval Subscriptions\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step
1, to create a subscription for retrieval of the policy counter status and
spending limit reporting.
The \"SpendingLimitContext\" data structure provided in the request body shall
include:
\- the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) encoded in the \"supi\"
attribute; and
\- the notification correlation target address encoded in the \"notifUri\"
attribute.
The \"SpendingLimitContext\" data structure provided in the request body may
include:
\- the General Public Subscription Identifier (GPSI) encoded in the \"gpsi\"
attribute; and
\- Event Filter information \"list of policy counter identifier(s)\" encoded
in the \"policyCounterIds\" attribute. The \"policyCounterIds\" attribute
shall contain the list of policy counter identifiers to be subscribed to. If
the \"policyCounterIds\" attribute is omitted, the subscription is to all
available policy counters.
If the CHF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to an
internal CHF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the CHF shall
send the HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the subscriber specified in the request is unknown to the CHF, the CHF
shall indicate in an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response the cause for the
rejection with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_UNKNOWN\".
If the CHF has no available policy counters specified for the subscriber, the
CHF shall indicate in an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response the cause for the
rejection with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"NO_AVAILABLE_POLICY_COUNTERS
\".
If one or more policy counters specified in the request in the
\"policyCounterIds\" attribute are unknown to the CHF, and the CHF is
configured to reject request, the CHF shall indicate in an HTTP \"400 Bad
Request\" response the cause for the rejection with the \"cause\" attribute
set to \"UNKNOWN_POLICY_COUNTERS\" and the unknown policy counter identifiers
within the \"invalidParams\" attribute.
Otherwise, upon the reception of an HTTP POST request the CHF shall:
\- create a new subscription resource, which contains the list of the policy
counters included in the \"policyCounterIds\" attribute, or if the
\"policyCounterIds\" attribute is omitted, all the policy counters of the
subscriber;
\- assign a subscriptionId; and
\- store the subscription resource.
After the CHF created an \"Individual Spending Limit Retrieval Subscription\"
resource, the CHF shall respond with \"201 Created\" response with a Location
header field containing the URI of the created subscription resource and the
message body containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown
in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2.
The SpendingLimitStatus data structure provided in the response body shall
include the status of the requested subscribed policy counters in the
\"statusInfos\" map, where every PolicyCounterInfo entry shall contain:
\- the policy counter identifier in the \"policyCounterId\" attribute; and
\- the policy counter status in the \"currentStatus\" attribute.
When a requested policy counter identifier is known by the CHF, but it is not
applicable to the subscriber (e.g. not provisioned), the CHF may include it in
the \"statusInfos\" map, and set the \"currentStatus\" attribute to an
operator configured policy counter status to indicate this to the NF service
consumer.
When one or more policy counters specified in the request in the
\"policyCounterIds\" attribute are unknown to the CHF, and the CHF is
configured to accept the request, the CHF may include the unknown policy
counters in the \"statusInfos\" map, and set the \"currentStatus\" attribute
to an operator configured policy counter status to indicate this to the NF
service consumer.
A PolicyCounterInfo data structure may include the list of the pending policy
counter statuses and their activation times within the attribute
\"penPolCounterStatuses\".
#### 4.2.2.3 Intermediate spending limit report retrieval
Figure 4.2.2.3-1 shows the scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the CHF to modify the existing subscription to the retrieval of
spending limit reports (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], figure 4.16.8.3.1). The
NF service consumer can add or remove policy counters to retrieve the status
of the counters.
Figure 4.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer modifies the subscription to retrieve
policy counter status and spending limit reporting
The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request to the resource
\"{apiRoot}/nchf-spendinglimitcontrol/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\"
representing an existing \"Individual Spending Limit Subscription\" resource,
as shown in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step 1, to modify the subscription for retrieval
of the policy counter status and spending limit reporting.
The \"SpendingLimitContext\" data structure provided in the request body:
\- shall include the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) encoded in the
\"supi\" attribute;
\- shall include the notification correlation target address encoded in the
\"notifUri\" attribute;
NOTE 1: If the notification correlation target address is not changed the
previously provided notification correlation target address is included in the
\"notifUri\" attribute.
\- if the General Public Subscription Identifier (GPSI) was provided within
the initial spending limit retrieval procedure, described in subclause
4.2.2.2, shall include the GPSI encoded in the \"gpsi\" attribute; and
\- may include Event Filter information as a \"list of policy counter
identifier(s)\" encoded in the \"policyCounterIds\" attribute. The
\"policyCounterIds\" attribute shall contain the updated list of policy
counter identifiers to be subscribed to. If the \"policyCounterIds\" attribute
is omitted, the subscription is updated to all available policy counters.
When the \"policyCounterIds\" attribute is present in the subscription
request, this list of policy counters overrides a previously provisioned list.
After the CHF modified an \"Individual Spending Limit Retrieval Subscription\"
resource, the CHF shall respond with \"200 OK\" response with the message body
containing a representation of the modified subscription, as shown in figure
4.2.2.3-1, step 2.
The SpendingLimitStatus data structure provided in the response body shall
include the status of the requested subscribed policy counters in the
\"statusInfos\" map, where every PolicyCounterInfo entry shall contain:
\- the policy counter identifier in the \"policyCounterId\" attribute; and
\- the policy counter status in the \"currentStatus\" attribute.
When a requested policy counter identifier is known by the CHF, but it is not
applicable to the subscriber (e.g. not provisioned), the CHF may include it in
the \"statusInfos\" map, and set the \"currentStatus\" attribute to an
operator configured policy counter status to indicate this to the NF service
consumer.
When one or more policy counters specified in the request in the
\"policyCounterIds\" attribute are unknown to the CHF, and the CHF is
configured to accept the request, the CHF may include the unknown policy
counters in the \"statusInfos\" map, and set the \"currentStatus\" attribute
to an operator configured policy counter status to indicate this to the NF
service consumer.
A PolicyCounterInfo data structure may include the list of the pending policy
counter statuses and their activation times within the attribute
\"penPolCounterStatuses\".
If the HTTP PUT request is not accepted by the CHF, it shall indicate the
appropriate cause for the rejection in the HTTP response code to the NF
service consumer as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the CHF has no available policy counters specified for the subscriber, the
CHF shall indicate in an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response the cause for the
rejection with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"NO_AVAILABLE_POLICY_COUNTERS
\".
If one or more policy counters specified in the request are unknown to the
CHF, and the CHF is configured to reject request, the CHF shall indicate in an
HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response the cause for the rejection with the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"UNKNOWN_POLICY_COUNTERS\" and the unknown policy
counter identifiers within the \"invalidParams\" attribute. The PUT request
shall not take effect, and the CHF shall maintain the Individual Spending
Limit Retrieval resource.
NOTE 2: In order to avoid misbehaviors due to the policy counters status
maintained in the CHF and the NF service consumer, the NF service consumer can
terminate the subscription invoking the Npcf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe
service operation in subclause 4.2.3.2.
NOTE 3: The NF service consumer can terminate the subscription invoking the
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe service operation in subclause 4.2.3.2,
or maintain subscription assuming that further available policy counters will
be notified.
### 4.2.3 Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe service operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe service operation is used by the NF
service consumer to cancel the subscription of status changes for all the
policy counters available at the CHF. That means the complete cancellation of
the spending limit reporting procedure.
#### 4.2.3.2 Unsubscribe from spending limit reporting
Figure 4.2.3.2-1 shows the scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the CHF to unsubscribe from spending limit reporting (see also 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.16.8.4.1).
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from spending limit
reporting
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe
service operation to unsubscribe from the spending limit reporting (status
change for all policy counters available is no more required). The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request to the resource \"{apiRoot}/nchf-
spendinglimitcontrol/v1/subscriptions /{subscriptionId}\", whereby the
\"{subscriptionId}\" is the identification of the existing subscription to be
deleted. Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request the CHF removes the
corresponding subscription.
If the HTTP DELETE request is accepted by the CHF, it shall respond with \"204
No Content\" as shown in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 2.
If the HTTP DELETE request is not accepted by the CHF (e.g. the HTTP DELETE
request is for a non-existent subscription), it shall indicate the appropriate
cause for the rejection in the HTTP response code to the NF service consumer.
### 4.2.4 Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify service operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify service operation is used by the CHF:
\- to notify the change of the status of the subscribed policy counters
available at the CHF for that subscriber; and/or
\- to provide one or more pending statuses for a subscribed policy counter
together with the time they shall be applied; and/or
\- to request the termination of the subscription of status changes for all
policy counters for a subscriber (e.g. the subscriber is removed from the CHF
system).
NOTE: The SUPI represents the subscription correlation Id.
#### 4.2.4.2 Spending limit report
Figure 4.2.4.2-1 shows the scenario where the CHF sends a notification to the
NF service consumer, when it detects that the status of a policy counter(s)
has changed and the NF service consumer has subscribed to notifications of
changes in the status of this policy counter(s). The CHF can also notify the
NF service consumer that the status for one or multiple subscribed policy
counter will change and indicate this by providing the time when this change
shall be applied (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], figure 4.16.8.5.1).
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Spending limit reporting
The CHF shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource notification target
address (notifUri) of the NF service consumer received in the subscription
creation or modification, and shall append the \"notify\" segment path at the
end of the URI, to indicate the NF service consumer the notification of a
policy counter status change.
The SpendingLimitStatus data structure provided in the request body shall
include:
\- Subscriber Identity in the \"supi\" attribute; and
\- Policy counters status in the \"statusInfos\" map, where every
PolicyCounterInfo entry shall include:
a. the \"policyCounterId\" attribute with the policy counter identifier; and
b. the \"currentStatus\" attribute with the new policy counter status when the
notification is triggered by a change in the policy counter status, or the
current policy counter status when the notification is triggered by a change
in the pending policy counter status(es).
When a policy counter identifier is no longer applicable to the subscriber
(e.g. becomes not provisioned), but still exists in the Individual Spending
Control Retrieval resource, the CHF may include it in the \"statusInfos\" map,
and set the \"currentStatus\" attribute to an operator configured policy
counter status to indicate this to the NF service consumer.
A PolicyCounterInfo data structure may include the list of pending policy
counter statuses and their activation times within the attribute
\"penPolCounterStatuses\".
If the HTTP POST notification request message is accepted by the NF service
consumer, it shall acknowledge the receipt of the event notification with a
\"204 No Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.4.2-1, step 2.
If the HTTP POST request is not accepted and the information received is not
considered by the NF service consumer, the NF service consumer shall indicate
the appropriate cause for the rejection in the HTTP response code to the CHF.
If the NF service consumer receives an HTTP POST notification request message
for an intermediate spending limit report transaction from the CHF in which no
pending policy counter statuses and their activation times are included for a
policy counter, i.e., the \"penPolCounterStatuses\" attribute is not included,
the NF service consumer shall cancel all previously provided pending policy
counter statuses and their activation times for this policy counter. If the NF
service consumer receives an HTTP POST notification request message for an
intermediate spending limit report transaction from the CHF containing pending
policy counter statuses and their activation times for a previously provided
policy counter, the NF service consumer shall replace the existing pending
policy counter statuses and their activation times if any.
#### 4.2.4.3 Subscription termination request by CHF
Figure 4.2.4.3-1 shows the scenario where the CHF sends a notification to the
NF service consumer, when it requests the termination of the subscription of
status changes for all policy counters for a subscriber.
Figure 4.2.4.3-1: Subscription termination request by CHF
The CHF shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource notification target
address (notifUri) of the NF service consumer received in the subscription
creation or modification and shall append the \"terminate\" segment path at
the end of the URI, to indicate the subscription termination and the removal
of the Individual Spending Limit Retrieval Subscription resource to the NF
service consumer.
The SubscriptionTerminationInfo data structure provided in the request body
shall includethe subscriber identification encoded in the \"supi\" attribute
and may include subscription termination information in the \"termCause\"
attribute.
NOTE: The CHF can request the termination of the subscription because of other
reasons than the ones specified in the TerminationCause data structure and
omit the \"termCause\" attribute.
When the termination request is because the subscriber identified by the SUPI
has been removed from the CHF, the CHF shall set the \"termCause\" attribute
to \"REMOVED_SUBSCRIBER\".
If the HTTP POST notification request message is accepted by the NF service
consumer, it shall remove the subscription to notifications of all policy
counters for a subscriber and shall acknowledge the receipt of the event
notification with a \"204 No Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.4.3-1,
step 2.
If the HTTP POST request is not accepted and the information received is not
considered by the NF service consumer, the NF service consumer shall indicate
the appropriate cause for the rejection in the HTTP response code to the CHF
as specified in subclause 5.7.

## 5.7 Error handling
### 5.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [4].
For the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service API, HTTP error responses shall be
supported as specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors
and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]
shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes
are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4]. In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall
apply.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service API.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service API
are listed in table 5.7.3-1. The CHF shall include in the HTTP status code a
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute indicating the
application error as listed in table 5.7.3-1.

request are not known at the CHF.
* * *
## 5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.8-1 are defined for the
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl Service API. They shall be negotiated using the
extensibility mechanism defined in subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [14] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nchf_SpendingLimitControl API, based on local configuration, may be authorized
by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [15]), using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [16])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [16], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service.
The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl API defines a single scope \"nchf-
spendinglimitcontrol\" for OAuth2 authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS
33.501 [14]) for the entire API, and it does not define any additional scopes
at resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [9] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl Service API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on the public 3GPP file server in the
following locations (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900 [17] for further
information):
