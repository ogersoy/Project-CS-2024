# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The present document provides a mechanism giving reliable transfer of
signalling messages between the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the data
base of a Visitors Location Register (VLR) for co-ordination between GSM
circuit switched services and GSM packet data services within the 3GPP system.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:

x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 Indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the specification;
# Introduction
The present document specifies or references the necessary information to
provide a reliable transfer of signalling messages between the Serving GPRS
Support Node (SGSN) and the Visitors Location Register (VLR). This reliable
transfer of messages is provided by the Network Service Part (NSP) of the
Signalling System No 7 (SS7). This documents specifies or references the
subset of MTP and SCCP to be used in the Gs interface.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies or references the subset of MTP and SCCP which
is used for the reliable transport of BSSAP+ messages in the Gs interface. The
present document references the 3GPP TS 29.202 which specifies alternative
transport layers that can be applied instead of the MTP. The present document
also specifies the SCCP addressing capabilities to be provided in the Gs
interface.
The present document is divided into two main parts, clause 5 dealing with the
use of MTP and clauses 6 and 7 dealing with the use of SCCP.
Clause 5 of the present document deals with the subset of the MTP that is
required between an SGSN and a VLR. It is intended that this implementation of
MTP is compatible with a full MTP implementation. Clause 4 references the 3GPP
TS 29.202 which specifies alternatives to the MTP.
The SCCP is used to provide message routing between the SGSN and the VLR. The
SCCP routing principles specified in the present document allow to connect one
SGSN to several VLR. No segmentation at SCCP level is needed on the Gs
interface. Only SCCP class 0 is used on the Gs interface. Clauses 6 and 7
identify the SCCP subset that should be used between an SGSN and an VLR.
# 2 References

3GPP TR 21.905 and 3GPP TS 23.060.
# 4 Configuration of the Gs interface
The Gs interface connects the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) to the Visitors
Location Register (VLR). This interface is defined in the 64 kbit/s for E1
interface and for 64 kbit/s or 56 kbit/s for T1 interface boundary of an SGSN
to a VLR or of a VLR to an SGSN. The configuration of the Gs interface shall
not impose any restriction on the number of VLRs or SGSNs to be connected by
the Gs interface. The Gs interface definition shall support an early
implementation of GPRS when one SGSN may be connected to several VLRs or a
more mature implementation when several SGSNs may be connected to one VLR.
Therefore the interface shall support the use of an STP.
The level of resilience in the Gs interface is determined by the operator,
however it is recommended that the operator considers the use of more than one
multiplex system between the SGSN and the VLR. Each multiplex system should be
used to carry one signalling link and routing diversity should be provided
among the signalling links to increase the resilience of the system.
## 4.1 Use of Protocol Stacks
BSSAP+ shall be transported over SCCP and the transport layers specified in
3GPP TS 29.202. The protocol stack is shown in figure 4.1.
When MTP is used to transport BSSAP+ then the conformance rules specified in
clause 5 shall apply.

## 5.1 General
The MTP functions as specified in ITU-T Recommendations Q.702, Q.703, Q.704
and Q.707 for E1 interface and ANSI T1.111 Recommendations for the T1
interface are applicable. However, the following subclauses provide a minimum
set of MTP requirements that shall be implemented at a SGSN or VLR to support
the functionality required by the BSSAP+ protocol in the Gs interface. The set
of exceptions and modifications to those recommendations maintain
compatibility with the implementation of a full specification of the MTP. The
ITU-T recommendations for E1 interface and ANSI recommendation for T1
interface concerning the MTP shall be taken as requirements unless covered by
a statement in the present document.
## 5.2 MTP Level 1
The MTP level 1 exceptions and modifications to ITU-T Recommendation Q.702 and
ANSI T1.111 Recommendation can be found in 3GPP TS 48.006 subclause 3.2.

# 6 Conformance to SCCP
## 6.1 Overview
The purpose of this clause is to identify the subset of the SCCP functions
which are necessary to provide addressing, error detection and segmentation
facilities in the Gs interface. If this subset of SCCP functions is
implemented, compatibility with a full ITU-T or ANSI SCCP shall be maintained.
Only the needs of the user of SCCP (refer to 3GPP TS 29.018) are taken into
account in this clause: the operations and maintenance requirements about SCCP
functions are outside the scope of the present document.
No SCCP translation function is required in the VLR or the SGSN between the
national and the local MTP. The Destination Point Code and Subsystem Number
would allow direct routing by the local SCCP and MTP. Global Title addressing
is supported on the Gs interface to provide flexibility in the addressing
scheme implementation (note that the SGSN is assigned a global title in order
to communicate with an HLR across an inter PLMN boundary).
Only connectionless class 0 SCCP services are used on the Gs interface. These
simplifications are applicable to the signalling between an SGSN and a VLR in
GSM PLMNs.
The minimum set of SCCP functions which apply are specified in the ITU-T
Recommendations Q.711, Q.712, Q.713 and Q.714, for E1 interface and ANSI
T1.112 for T1 interface with the qualifications specified in this
Recommendation.

# 7 Use of the SCCP (E1/T1 Interface)
The underlying transport stack and the SCCP are used to support signalling
messages between the SGSN and the MSC. The BSSAP+ protocol specified in 3GPP
TS 29.018 is the user of the SCCP. 3GPP TS 29.018 only uses the services of
the class 0 of the SCCP.
The Gs interface connects an SGSN to a VLR within the same PLMN. The use of
point codes or global titles is allowed for routing of SCCP messages.
The format and coding of address parameters carried by the SCCP for routing
purpose shall comply with ITU-T Recommendation Q.713 for E1 interface and ANSI
T1.112.3 T1 interface with the following restrictions:
\- The called party address shall include:
\- an SSN (see subclause 6.4.1 E1 interface and subclause 6.4.2 for T1
interface);
\- all other aspects of the SCCP signalling are specified in 3GPP TS 29.002.
\- The calling party address shall include:
\- an SSN (see subclause 6.4.1 E1 interface and subclause 6.4.2 for T1
interface);
\- all other aspects of the SCCP signalling are specified in 3GPP TS 29.002.
When an SCCP message is sent, the Called Party Address is derived from the
Called Address of the N-UNITDATA-REQUEST primitive issued by the local SCCP
user.
When an SCCP message is received, the Calling Address within the N-UNITDATA-
INDICATION primitive is derived from the Calling Party Address of the SCCP
UNITDATA message received.
Only address information belonging to the E.164 numbering plan is allowed to
be included as Global Title in the Called and Calling Party Address. The SGSN
and the VLR store the address of the other entity using the format received in
the Calling Party Address field or the address information received in the
application part of the message.
