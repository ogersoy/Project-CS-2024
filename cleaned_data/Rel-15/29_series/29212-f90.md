# 1 Scope
The present document provides the stage 3 specification of the Gx, Gxx and Sd
reference points for the present release. The present document also provides
the Diameter variant of St reference point for the present release. The
functional requirements and the stage 2 specifications of the Gx, Gxx, Sd and
St reference points are contained in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. The Gx reference
point lies between the Policy and Charging Rule Function and the Policy and
Charging Enforcement Function. The Gxx reference point lies between the Policy
and Charging Rule Function and the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting
Function. The Sd reference point lies between the Policy and Charging Rule
Function and the Traffic Detection Function. The St reference point lies
between the Policy and Charging Rule Function and the Traffic Steering Support
Function.
Whenever it is possible the present document specifies the requirements for
the protocol by reference to specifications produced by the IETF within the
scope of Diameter. Where this is not possible, extensions to Diameter are
defined within the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
**Application detection filter:** A logic used to detect packets generated by
an application based on extended inspection of these packets, e.g., header
and/or payload information, as well as dynamics of packet flows. The logic is
entirely internal to a TDF or a PCEF enhanced with ADC, and is out of scope of
this specification.
**Application identifier:** An identifier, referring to a specific application
detection filter.
**ADC decision:** A decision consists of references to ADC rules, associated
enforcement actions (for dynamic ADC rules) and TDF session attributes and is
provided by the PCRF to the TDF for application detection and control.
**ADC rule:** A set of information enabling the detection of application
traffic and associated enforcement actions. ADC rules are directly provisioned
into the TDF and referenced by the PCRF.
**Bit rate:** The number of bits (denoted in units of bits, kbits, etc.) that
are conveyed or processed per unit of time. The bit rate in bit/s can be
abbreviated with bps. This specification uses SI (International System of
Units) prefixes as unit prefixes, which strictly refer to the power of 10, and
shall not be used for the power of 2. For example, 1 kbit/s represents 1000
bit/s or 1 Mbit/s represents 1000 kbit/s and so on.
**Detected application traffic:** An aggregate set of packet flows that are
generated by a given application and detected by an application detection
filter.
**IP-CAN bearer:** IP transmission path of defined capacity, delay and bit
error rate, etc.\ See 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] for the definition of bearer.
**IP-CAN session:** association between a UE and an IP network.\ The
association is identified by one or more UE Ipv4 addresses/ and/or Ipv6 prefix
together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN represented
by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or more IP-CAN
bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is IP-CAN
specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.
**IP flow:** unidirectional flow of IP packets with the same source IP address
and port number and the same destination IP address and port number and the
same transport protocol.\ Port numbers are only applicable if used by the
transport protocol.
**IP Flow mapping:** IP flow mapping is used in Network-initiated NBIFOM mode
when the UE wants to request the network to apply specific mapping of IP flows
to 3GPP access or WLAN access. It applies to the same parameters as the NBIFOM
routing rule.
**Gateway Control Session:** An association between a BBERF and a PCRF (when
GTP is not used in the EPC), used for transferring access specific parameters,
BBERF events and QoS rules between the PCRF and BBERF. In the context of this
specification this is implemented by use of the Gxx procedures.
**GC1 signalling:** Signalling between the GCS AS and the application client
on the UE over the GC1 reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [50].
**Monitoring key** : Identifies a usage monitoring control instance.
**Multi-access IP-CAN session:** An IP-CAN session **whose traffic can be
routed** over **either a** 3GPP **access or** a WLAN access or both. **Each IP
flow is routed at any single time only over one access**.
**TDF session:** An association between an IP-CAN session and the assigned TDF
for the purpose of application detection and control by the PCRF. The
association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix together
with optionally a PDN represented by a PDN ID and a set of ADC rules to be
applied by the TDF.
**Usage monitoring control instance** : the monitoring and reporting of the
usage threshold for input, output or total data volume or time of usage for
the IP-CAN session/TDF session or the service data flows/application\'s
traffic associated with the same monitoring key.
**Presence Reporting Area:** An area defined within 3GPP Packet Domain for the
purposes of reporting of UE presence within that area due to policy control
and/or charging reasons. There are two types of **Presence Reporting Area** :
\"UE-dedicated **Presence Reporting Area** \", and \"Core Network pre-
configured **Presence Reporting Area** \".
**Packet Flow Description (PFD)** : A set of information enabling the
detection of application traffic provided by a 3^rd^ party service provider
(from 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]).
**RAN rules:** In this specification, RAN rules refers to the set of RAN
assistance parameter and RAN steering command handling for the steering of
traffic between E-UTRAN or UTRAN and WLAN associated with RAN-controlled LTE-
WLAN interworking or RAN-assisted WLAN interworking.
**RAN user plane congestion:** RAN user plane congestion occurs when the
demand for RAN resources exceeds the available RAN capacity to deliver the
user data for a prolonged period of time.
**Service data flow:** An aggregate set of packet flows carried through the
PCEF that matches a service data flow template (from 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]).
**Service data flow filter:** a set of packet flow header parameter
values/ranges used to identify one or more of the packet flows (from 3GPP TS
23.203 [7]).
**Service data flow template:** The set of service data flow filters in a PCC
rule or an application identifier in a PCC rule referring to an application
detection filter, required for defining a service data flow (from 3GPP TS
23.203 [7]).
**(S)Gi-LAN:** The network infrastructure connected to the 3GPP network over
the SGi or Gi reference point that provides various IP-based services.
**(S)Gi-LAN service function:** A function located in the (S)Gi-LAN that
provides value-added IP-based services e.g. NAT, anti-malware, parental
control, DDoS protection.

# 4 Gx reference point
## 4.1 Overview
The Gx reference point is located between the Policy and Charging Rules
Function (PCRF) and the Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF). The
Gx reference point is used for provisioning and removal of PCC rules from the
PCRF to the PCEF and the transmission of traffic plane events from the PCEF to
the PCRF. The Gx reference point can be used for charging control, policy
control or both by applying AVPs relevant to the application. The Gx reference
point can also be used for application\'s traffic detection and control.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Gx reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7].
Signalling flows related to the both Rx and Gx interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
The definition of case 1, case 2a and case 2b is specified in clause 4.0 in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the Gx interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the Gx interface.
Refer to Annex K of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter load control procedures

connected via the Sx reference point. The Sx reference point and interactions
between the Gx and Sx reference points are not considered in the present
specification, but are specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [63].
## 4.2 Gx Reference model
The Gx reference point is defined between the PCRF and the PCEF. The
relationships between the different functional entities involved are depicted
in figure 4.2.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in subclause 3a of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].

NOTE 2: PCEF is located in the Gateway node implementing the IP access to the
PDN. Refer to Annexes of TS 23.203 [7] for application to specific IP-CAN
types.
NOTE 3: The PCEF can be decomposed into a User Plane Function and a Control
Plane Function connected via the Sx reference point specified in 3GPP TS
29.244 [63]. If the PCEF is decomposed, the Gx reference point terminates in
the Control Plane Function.

## 4.3 PCC Rules
### 4.3.1 PCC Rule Definition
The purpose of the PCC rule is to:
\- Detect a packet belonging to a service data flow.
\- The service data flow templates within the PCC rule are used for the
selection of downlink IP CAN bearers.
\- The service data flow filters within the PCC rule are used for the
enforcement that uplink IP flows are transported in the correct IP CAN bearer.
NOTE 1: For aPCC rule that contains an application identifier referencing an
application detection filter, the PCRF can inspect traffic on multiple bearers
in the uplink direction. Such detected traffic counts as detection by that PCC
rule.
\- Identify the service the service data flow contributes to.
\- Provide applicable charging parameters for a service data flow.
\- Provide policy control for a service data flow.
The PCEF shall check each received packet against the service data flow
filters of each PCC rule in the order of the precedence of the PCC rules. When
a packet matches a service data flow filter, the packet matching process for
that packet is completed, and the corresponding PCC rule shall be applied. For
PCC rules that contain an application identifier referencing an application
detection filter, the precedence is only relevant for the rule enforcement,
i.e. when the detected application packet matches multiple PCC rules, only the
enforcement, reporting of application starts and stops, usage monitoring, and
charging actions of the PCC rule with the highest precedence shall be applied.
There are two different types of PCC rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]:
\- Dynamic PCC rules. Dynamically provisioned by the PCRF to the PCEF via the
Gx interface. These PCC rules may be either predefined or dynamically
generated in the PCRF. Dynamic PCC rules can be installed, modified and
removed at any time.
\- Predefined PCC rules. Preconfigured in the PCEF. Predefined PCC rules can
be activated or deactivated by the PCRF at any time. Predefined PCC rules
within the PCEF may be grouped allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set
of PCC rules over the Gx reference point.
NOTE 2: The operator can define a predefined PCC rule, to be activated by the
PCEF. Such a predefined rule is not explicitly known in the PCRF.
A PCC rule consists of:
\- a rule name;
\- service identifier;
\- service data flow filter(s);
\- application identifier;
\- precedence;
\- gate status;
\- QoS parameters;
\- indication for PS to CS session continuity;
\- charging key (i.e. rating group);
\- other charging parameters;
\- monitoring key;
\- sponsor identity;
\- application service provider identity;
\- indication of access network information reporting;
\- redirect.
\- traffic steering policy identifier(s).
The rule name shall be used to reference a PCC rule in the communication
between the PCEF and the PCRF.
The service identifier shall be used to identify the service or the service
component the service data flow relates to.
The service data flow filter(s) or the application detection filter shall be
used to select the traffic for which the rule applies. Either service data
flow filter(s) or application identifier shall exist in a PCC rule. It shall
be possible to define wildcarded service data flow filter(s), both for the
dynamic and predefined PCC rules.
The application identifier shall be used to reference an application detection
filter, which is predefined in the PCEF. The same application identifier value
can occur in more than one PCC rule. If so, the PCRF shall ensure that there
is at most one PCC rule active per application identifier value and IP CAN
session at any time.
NOTE 3: The application identifier can only be used for PCEF enhanced with
ADC. The same application identifier value could be used for a dynamic PCC
rule and a pre-defined PCC rule or for multiple pre-defined PCC rules.
NOTE 4: The configuration of the application detection filter in the PCEF can
include the set of information required for encrypted detection as defined in
Annex X of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7].
The gate status indicates whether the service data flow may pass (gate is
open) or shall be discarded (gate is closed) in uplink and/or in downlink
direction.
The QoS information includes the QoS class identifier (authorized QoS class
for the service data flow), the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) and
authorized bitrates for uplink and downlink.
The PS to CS session continuity indicates that the service data flow may be
handed over to the CS domain as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [40].
The charging parameters define whether online and offline charging interfaces
are used, what is to be metered in offline charging, on what level the PCEF
shall report the usage related to the rule, etc.
For different PCC rules with overlapping service data flow filter, the
precedence of the rule determines which of these rules is applicable. For PCC
rules with application detection filter, the precedence of the rule is only
relevant for the enforcement or charging of the detected application.When a
dynamic PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same precedence, the
dynamic PCC rule takes precedence. For dynamic PCC rules that contain an
application identifier, the precedence shall be either preconfigured at the
PCEF or provided dynamically by the PCRF within the PCC Rules.
NOTE 5: Whether precedence for dynamic PCC rules that contain an application
identifier is preconfigured in PCEF or provided in the PCC rule from the PCRF
depends on network configuration.
PCC rule also includes Application Function record information for enabling
charging correlation between the application and bearer layer if the AF has
provided this information via the Rx interface. For IMS this includes the IMS
Charging Identifier (ICID) and flow identifiers.
The monitoring key for a PCC rule identifies a monitoring control instance
that shall be used for usage monitoring control of the service data flows
controlled by the predefined PCC rule or dynamic PCC rule.
If sponsored data connectivity is supported, the sponsor identity for a PCC
rule identifies the 3^rd^ party organization (the sponsor) willing to pay for
the operator\'s charge for connectivity required to deliver a service to the
end user.
If sponsored data connectivity is supported, the application service provider
identity for a PCC rule identifies the 3^rd^ party organization (the ASP) that
is delivering the service to the end user.
If Access Network Information Reporting is supported, the value of Required-
Access-Info AVP for a PCC rule identifies the Access Network Information
parameters requested by the AF.
The redirect indicates whether the uplink part of the detected application
traffic shall be redirected to a controlled address. The target redirect
address may also be included.
NOTE 6: The redirect is applicable when application identifier exists in the
PCC rule.
The traffic steering policy identifier(s) is a reference to a pre-configured
traffic steering policy at the PCEF as defined in clause 4.4.2.
### 4.3.2 Operations on PCC Rules
For dynamic PCC rules, the following operations are available:
Installation: to provision a PCC rules that has not been already provisioned.
Modification: to modify a PCC rule already installed.
Removal: to remove a PCC rule already installed.
For predefined PCC rules, the following operations are available:
Activation: to allow the PCC rule being active.
Deactivation: to disallow the PCC rule.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4.5.2.0.
## 4.3a IP flow mobility routing rules
### 4.3a.0 General
The clause 4.3a refers to S2c-based IP flow mobility as described in 3GPP TS
23.261 [35].
### 4.3a.1 Functional entities
The PCEF shall provide IP flow mobility routing rules and report IP flow
mobility routing rules related events to the PCRF via the Gx reference point.
The PCRF shall select either the PCEF or any applicable BBERF as the bearer
binding function for each service data flow based on the Routing Address
included in the IP flow mobility routing rules received from the PCEF.
### 4.3a.2 IP flow mobility routing rule definition
The IP flow mobility routing rule is used by the PCRF to select the applicable
BBF (BBERF or PCEF) for a service data flow in flow mobility scenarios and in
turn provision QoS rules related to the service data flow to the selected
BBERF.
The PCRF shall evaluate the service data flow filters against the routing
filter contained in the IP flow mobility routing rule in the order of the
precedence of the IP flow mobility routing rules. When a routing filter
matches the service data flow filter, the routing address contained in the
matching IP flow mobility routing rule shall be applied to the service data
flow.
An IP flow mobility routing rule consists of:
\- a rule identifier;
\- routing filter(s);
\- precedence;
\- routing address;
The rule identifier is assigned by the PCEF and shall be unique within an IP-
CAN session. It is used to reference an IP flow mobility routing rule in the
communication between the PCEF and the PCRF.
The IP flow mobility routing rule shall comprise one or more routing filters,
containing information for matching service data flows. A default packet
filter is specified by using wild card filters. The default packet filter is
used to indicate the default route for service data flows without explicit
route assignment. An IP flow mobility routing rule containing a default packet
filter shall not contain any other packet filters.
The precedence defines in what order the IP flow mobility routing rules are
used by the PCRF to determine where to route a service data flow. The
precedence of the IP flow mobility routing rules not containing the default
packet filter is derived from the priority assigned to the routing filters
included in the Binding Update as specified in 3GPP TS 23.261 [35]. The PCEF
shall assign the lowest evaluation precedence to the IP flow mobility routing
rule containing the default packet filter.
The routing address identifies the IP address and thus the BBF to be used for
all service data flows matching the routing filters contained in IP flow
mobility routing rules. The routing address can be equal to a care-of address
or to the home address of the UE. In case 1 and case 2b the routing address
contains the home address and in case 2a the routing address contains the
care-of address.
NOTE: IP flow mobility routing rules can be defined in case 1 only for 3GPP
access where GTP-based S5/S8 are employed or case 2b only for PMIP-based 3GPP
accesses.
### 4.3a.3 Operations on Routing rules
If IP flow mobility is supported as specified in 3GPP TS 23.261 [35], the PCEF
shall derive IP flow mobility routing rules based on the IP flow mobility
binding information provided by the UE. The rule contains information required
by the PCRF to install the PCC/QoS rules for a service data flow at the
correct BBF in flow mobility scenarios.
For IP flow mobility routing rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: the PCEF provides a new IP flow mobility routing rule to the
PCRF.
\- Modification: the PCEF modifies an existing IP flow mobility routing rule
already installed at the PCRF.
\- Removal: the PCEF removes an IP flow mobility routing rule already
installed at the PCRF.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4.3a.4.
### 4.3a.4 PCC procedures for IP flow mobility routing rule over Gx reference
point
#### 4.3a.4.1 Provisioning of IP flow mobility routing rules
When provisioning IP flow mobility routing rules, the PCEF executes the same
procedure as for a Request for PCC Rules as described in clause 4.5.1.
The PCEF may install IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-CAN session
establishment.
NOTE: PCEF installs IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-CAN session
establishment only in case 2a.
If the PCEF installs IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-CAN session
establishment:
\- In addition to the parameters defined in clause 4.5.1, the PCEF shall also
include in the CC-Request, IP flow mobility routing rules within the Routing-
Rule-Install AVP with one ore more Routing-Rule-Definition AVPs.
\- the PCEF shall include a default route within the Routing-Rule-Definition
AVP by including wildcarded filters within Routing-Filter AVP.
The PCEF may install, modify, and remove IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-
CAN session modification.
\- In such a case in addition to the parameters defined in clause 4.5.1, for
IP flow mobility routing rule installation and modification, the PCEF shall
include in the CC-Request the Routing-Rule-Install AVP with one or more
Routing-Rule-Definition AVPs containing the new and updated IP flow mobility
routing rules.
\- For IP flow mobility routing rule removal, the PCEF shall include the
Routing-Rule-Remove AVP with the Routing-Rule-Identifier of the rules to be
removed.
\- The PCEF shall also include the Event-Trigger AVP set to
ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE.
At IP-CAN session termination as described in 4.5.7, the PCRF removes
instantly all IP flow mobility routing rules related to the terminated IP-CAN
session.
To install a new or modify an already installed IP flow mobility routing rule,
the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If an IP flow mobility routing
rule with the same rule identifier, as supplied in the Routing-Rule-Identifier
AVP within the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP, already exists at the PCRF, the
new IP flow mobility routing rule shall update the currently installed rule.
If the existing IP flow mobility routing rule already has attributes also
included in the new IP flow mobility routing rule definition, the existing
attributes shall be overwritten. Any attribute in the existing IP flow
mobility routing rule not included in the new IP flow mobility routing rule
definition shall remain valid.
## 4.3b Void
## 4.3c NBIFOM routing rules
### 4.3c.1 General
Clause 4.3c refers to NBIFOM as described in 3GPP TS 23.161 [51].
### 4.3c.2 NBIFOM routing rule definition
The NBIFOM routing rule is used by the PCRF to identify the applicable access
type for a service data flow as provided by the UE and in turn provide PCC
Rules related to the service data flow indicating the applicable access.
NOTE 1: The PCEF derives the NBIFOM routing rules based on the NBIFOM routing
rules created/replaced/deleted by the UE in the UE-initiated NBIFOM mode or
when the UE requests the IP flow mapping in the Network-initiated NBIFOM mode
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
An NBIFOM routing rule consists of:
\- a rule identifier;
\- routing filter;
\- precedence;
\- routing access information;
The rule identifier is assigned by the PCEF or the PCRF and shall be unique
within an IP-CAN session. It is used to reference an NBIFOM routing rule in
the communication between the PCEF and the PCRF. The PCEF shall keep the
mapping between rule identifier of NBIFOM routing rule used over Gx interface
and the rule identifier of NBIFOM routing rule carried in the GTP signalling
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
NOTE 2: In the UE-initiated IP flow mobility procedure, for creating a new
NBIFOM routing rule, the rule identifier used in communication with UE is
assigned and provided by the UE. In the UE requested IP Flow Mapping
procedure, for creating a new NBIFOM routing rule, no rule identifier is
assigned and provided by the UE, in this case the rule identifier to be used
in communication with the UE is assigned by the PCEF. In both cases, the
routing rule identifier to be used in communication with the PCRF is assigned
by the PCEF.
NOTE 3: For Network-initiated NBIFOM mode the PCRF assigns and includes the
NBIFOM routing rule identifier to be used in Gx to every packet filter, in the
Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP within the Flow-Information AVP of the PCC rule.
The PCEF includes the routing rule identifier in a new NBIFOM routing rule if
the UE initiates an IP flow mapping request for the packet filter.
The NBIFOM routing rule shall comprise of one routing filter, containing
information for matching a service data flow. The routing filter of the NBIFOM
routing rule is derived from the routing filter included in the routing rule
carried in the GTP signalling as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
NOTE 4: There is a one to one mapping between NBIFOM routing rules in GTP and
NBIFOM routing rules in Gx.
The precedence defines in what order the NBIFOM routing rules are used by the
PCRF to determine where the PCEF routes a service data flow. The precedence of
the NBIFOM routing rule is derived from the priority assigned to the routing
rule included in the GTP signalling defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
The routing access information identifies the access type that is to be used
for the transfer of traffic determined by the UE. The routing access
information shall be equal to 3GPP-EPS or Non-3GPP-EPS in this release.
### 4.3c.3 Operations on NBIFOM Routing rules
If NBIFOM is supported as specified in 3GPP TS 23.161 [51], the PCEF shall
derive NBIFOM routing rules based on the NBIFOM routing rules or the IP flow
mapping provided by the UE. The rule contains information required by the PCRF
to determine the access type that is to be used for the transfer of traffic in
NBIFOM scenarios.
For NBIFOM routing rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: the PCEF provides a new NBIFOM routing rule to the PCRF.
\- Modification: the PCEF modifies an existing NBIFOM routing rule already
installed at the PCRF.
\- Removal: the PCEF removes an NBIFOM routing rule already installed at the
PCRF.
## 4.4 Functional elements
### 4.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element
that encompasses policy control decision and flow based charging control
functionalities. These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6
logical entities PDF and CRF respectively. The PCRF provides network control
regarding the service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging
(except credit management) towards the PCEF. The PCRF receives session and
media related information from the AF and informs AF of traffic plane events.
The PCRF shall provision PCC Rules to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.
Particularities for the Gxx reference point are specified in clause 4a.4.1.
Particularities for the Sd reference point are specified in clause 4b.4.1.
If IP flow mobility applies, the PCRF shall, based on IP flow mobility routing
rules received from the PCEF, provide the authorized PCC/QoS rules to the
applicable BBF.
If NBIFOM applies, the PCRF takes the decisions as described in subclause
4.5.25.1.1.
The PCRF PCC Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- Information obtained from the AF via the Rx reference point, e.g. the
session, media and subscriber related information.
\- Information obtained from the PCEF via the Gx reference point, e.g. IP-CAN
bearer attributes, request type, subscriber related information, IP flow
mobility routing rules (if IP flow mobility is supported), NBIFOM routing rule
and change of usability of an access (if NBIFOM is supported), detected
application\'s traffic information (if the PCEF supports Application Detection
and Control feature) and 3GPP PS Data Off status (if the PCEF supports 3GPP PS
Data Off feature).
\- Information obtained from the SPR via the Sp reference point, e.g.
subscriber and service related data.
\- Information obtained from the TDF via the Sd reference point, e.g. report
on application\'s traffic detection start/stop.
NOTE 1: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
\- Information obtained from the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
\- Own PCRF pre-configured information.
If the information from the PCEF contains traffic mapping information not
matching any service data flow filter known to the PCRF, and the PCRF allows
the UE to request enhanced QoS for services not known to the PCRF, the PCRF
shall add this traffic mapping information as service data flow filters to the
corresponding authorized PCC Rule. The PCRF may wildcard missing filter
parameters, e.g. missing uplink TFT address and port information in case of
GPRS.
The PCRF shall report events to the AF via the Rx reference point.
The PCRF shall inform the PCEF through the use of PCC rules on the treatment
of each service data flow that is under PCC control, in accordance with the
PCRF policy decisions.
The PCRF shall be able to select the bearer control mode that will apply for
the IP-CAN session and provide it to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.
Upon subscription to loss of AF signalling bearer notifications by the AF, the
PCRF shall request the PCEF to notify the PCRF of the loss of resources
associated to the PCC Rules corresponding with AF Signalling IP Flows, if this
has not been requested previously.
If permitted by the subscriber\'s profile configuration received from the SPR,
the PCRF may invoke the application\'s traffic detection and control at the
PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, by providing the
corresponding PCC Rules.
The PCRF may use one or more pieces of information defined in the clause as
input for the selection of traffic steering policies used to control the
steering of the subscriber\'s traffic to appropriate (S)Gi-LAN service
functions.
NOTE 2: In order to allow the PCRF to select and provision an application
based traffic steering policy, the reporting of detected applications to the
PCRF or any other information defined in this clause can be used.
If 3GPP PS Data Off applies, the PCRF shall behave as described in subclause
4.5.29.
If UE-Status-Change applies, the PCRF shall behave as described in subclause
4.5.32.
### 4.4.2 PCEF
The PCEF (Policy and Charging Enforcement Function) is the functional element
that encompasses policy enforcement and flow based charging functionalities.
These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6 logical entities PEP
and TPF respectively. This functional entity is located at the Gateway (e.g.
GGSN in the GPRS case, P-GW in the EPS case and PDG in the WLAN case). It
provides control over the user plane traffic handling at the Gateway and its
QoS, and provides service data flow detection and counting as well as online
and offline charging interactions.
For a service data flow that is under policy control the PCEF shall allow the
service data flow to pass through the Gateway if and only if the corresponding
gate is open.
For a service data flow that is under charging control the PCEF shall allow
the service data flow to pass through the Gateway if and only if there is a
corresponding active PCC rule and, for online charging, the OCS has authorized
the applicable credit with that Charging key. The PCEF may let a service data
flow pass through the Gateway during the course of the credit re-authorization
procedure.
If requested by the PCRF, the PCEF shall report to the PCRF when the status of
the related service data flow changes. This procedure can be used to monitor
an IP-CAN bearer dedicated for AF signalling traffic.
In case the SDF is tunnelled at the BBERF, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF
about the mobility protocol tunnelling header of the service data flows at IP-
CAN session establishment or IP-CAN session modification when the tunnelling
header information is changed.
If requested by PCRF, a PCEF, which supports Application Detection and Control
feature, shall:
\- Perform application\'s traffic detection and control.
\- Report the detected application\'s traffic start/stop events to the PCRF
along with TDF application instance identifier and service data flow
descriptions when service data flow descriptions are deducible.
NOTE: The application detection filter can be pre-configured and/or extended
with the PFDs by the PFDF as described in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and 3GPP TS
29.251 [62].
A PCEF shall ensure that an IP packet, which is discarded at the PCEF as a
result of PCC rule enforcement, is neither reported for offline charging nor
cause credit consumption for online charging.
If requested by the PCRF, a PCEF, which supports policy provisioning and
enforcement of authorized QoS for service data flows that share resources,
shall:
\- For PCC rules bound to the same bearer perform resource sharing among PCC
rules marked for resource sharing.
When the PCRF provides a traffic steering policy identifier(s) in a PCC rule,
the PCEF shall behave as specified in clause 6.2.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7].
If NBIFOM applies, the PCEF takes the actions as described in subclause
4.5.25.1.2.
If 3GPP PS Data Off applies, the PCEF shall behave as described in subclause
4.5.29.
If UE-Status-Change applies, the PCEF shall behave as described in subclause
4.5.32.
## 4.5 PCC procedures over Gx reference point
### 4.5.1 Request for PCC rules
The PCEF shall indicate, via the Gx reference point, a request for PCC rules
in the following instances.
1) At IP-CAN session establishment:
If the PCEF is being requested via IP-CAN specific signaling not to establish
the Gx session, the PCEF shall not establish the Gx session.
NOTE 1: The decision to not establish the Gx session applies for the life time
of the IP-CAN session.
NOTE 2: The indicator to not establish the Gx session is configured in the
HSS. It is delivered to the PCEF within the Charging Characteristics. The
indicator is operator specific, therefore it can only be used in non-roaming
and home routed roaming cases.
\- Otherwise, the PCEF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to
the value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". The PCEF shall supply user identification
within the Subscription-Id AVP and other attributes to allow the PCRF to
identify the rules to be applied. The PCEF shall also provide IMEI(SV) (if
available) within the User-Equipment-Info AVP to the PCRF. The other
attributes shall include the type of IP-CAN within the IP-CAN-Type AVP, the
type of the radio access technology, if available, within the RAT-Type AVP,
the PDN information, if available, within the Called-Station-Id AVP, the PDN
connection identifier, if available, within the PDN-Connection-ID AVP, the UE
Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address and/or the UE Ipv6 prefix within the
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP and the UE time zone information within 3GPP-MS-
TimeZone AVP, if available. The PCEF may also include the Accessâ€‘Network-

user equipment information (if IMEI (SV) not available) within User-Equipment-
Info AVP, AN-Trusted AVP if available and the charging characteristics within
3GPP-Charging-Characteristics AVP in the CC-Request. Furthermore, if
applicable for the IP-CAN type, the PCEF may indicate the support of network-
initiated bearer request procedures by supplying the Network-Request-Support
AVP. The PCEF shall also include the APN-AMBR if available using the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL/UL AVPs or both the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL/UL
AVPs and the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL/UL AVPs(as specified in subclause 4.5.30).
If available, the PCEF shall also provide an indication if the default bearer
is requested to be used for IMS signalling using the Bearer-Usage AVP. If UE
provides information of IP flow mobility change, the PCEF includes IP flow
mobility routing rules as defined in clause 4.3a.4 . The PCEF may provide TDF-
Information AVP, if available. The PCEF, based on its local configuration, may
additionally provide its control plane address(es) within 3GPP-GGSN-Address
AVP and/or 3GPP-GGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, 3GPP-Selection-Mode AVP indicating how
the APN was selected, Dynamic-Address-Flag AVP and Dynamic-Address-Flag-
Extension AVP defining whether IP address(es) where statically or dynamically
allocated and PDN-Connection-Charging-ID AVP containing the charging
identifier to identify different records belonging to the same PDN connection.
When the PCEF supports the detection and handling of the late arriving
requests, the PCEF shall also include the origination time stamp (if
available) within the Origination-Time-Stamp AVP and the Maximum Wait Time (if
available) within the Maximum-Wait-Time AVP as specified in subclause 4.5.26.
For IP-CAN types that support multiple IP-CAN bearers, the PCEF may provide
the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the ARP and QCI values corresponding
to the Default EPS Bearer QoS.
For 3GPP-EPS and 3GPP2 accesses, the PCEF shall provide the IP address(es)
(Ipv4 or Ipv6, if available) of the SGW/AGW within the AN-GW-Address AVP.
For xDSL IP-CAN Type the PCEF may provide the Subscription-Id AVP and shall
not provide the RAT Type AVP, The Logical-Access-ID AVP and the Physical-
Access-ID AVP shall be provided.
2) At IP-CAN session modification:
\- IP-CAN session modification with PCEF-requested rules can occur for various
reasons, e.g. when:
\- a request to establish or terminate an IP-CAN bearer occurs;
\- a request for resource modification occurs;
\- an Event trigger is met.
The PCEF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\". The PCEF may include the Accessâ€‘Network-Charging-Address
and Accessâ€‘Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVPs in the CC-Request. For an IP-
CAN Session modification where an existing IP-CAN Bearer is modified, the PCEF
shall supply within the PCC rule request the specific event which caused the
IP-CAN session modification (within the Event-Trigger AVP) and any related
data affected by the IP-CAN session modification. Any change in PCC rule
status shall be supplied to PCRF within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP. If UE
provides information of IP flow mobility change, the PCEF includes IP flow
mobility routing rules to the PCRF as specified in clause 4.3a.4.
In the case that the UE initiates a resource modification procedure, the PCEF
shall include within the CC-Request the Event-Trigger AVP set to
RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST and shall include the Packet-Filter-Operation
AVP set as follows, with the amendments as specified in Annex A and Annex B:
\- When the UE requests to add filters without any link to existing bearer or
existing packet filter, the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to
\"ADDITION\", and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter requested for
addition;
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the new packet
filters.
\- When the UE requests to add filters, including a link to an existing packet
filter, the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"ADDITION\",
and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter requested for
addition; and
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP, set to the value for the linked existing filter; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the new packet
filters and the PCC rule containing the linked packet filter.
\- When the UE requests to modify existing packet filter the PCEF shall set
the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP, including its Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP
value, for each modified packet filter; and
\- if the UE request includes modified QoS information the PCEF shall also
include the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the updated QoS for the affected
PCC rule(s).
\- When the UE requests to modify the QoS associated with existing packet
filter(s), without modifying the filter(s), the PCEF shall set the Packet-
Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include:
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP, set to the value for each of the affected packet filter(s); and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the updated QoS for the affected PCC
rule(s).
\- When the UE requests to delete existing packet filter the PCEF shall set
the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\", and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter deleted by the UE.
Each Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include a packet filter identifier as
provided by the PCRF in the PCC rule within the Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP
identifying the previously requested packet filter being deleted; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the updated QoS for the affected PCC
rule(s).
The PCEF shall calculate the requested GBR, for a GBR QCI, as the sum of the
previously authorized GBR for the set of affected PCC rules, containing one or
more affected packet filter, adjusted with the difference between the
requested GBR for the bearer and previously negotiated GBR for the bearer. For
the UE request to add filters, without providing any link to an existing
filter, the GBR as requested by the UE for those filters shall be used.
If the request covers all the PCC rules with a bearer binding to the same
bearer, then the PCEF may request a change to the QCI for existing packet
filters.
A PCC rule is affected if one or more previously assigned packet filter
identifiers for filters within the rule are included with the Packet-Filter-
Identifier AVP within the request.
For the purpose of adding or modifying a packet filter, the Packet-Filter-
Information AVP shall include the packet filter precedence information within
the Precedence AVP and the Packet-Filter-Content, ToS-Traffic-Class, Security-
Parameter-Index, Flow-Label and Flow-Direction AVPs set to the value(s)
describing the packet filter provided by the UE.
PCC rules can also be requested as a consequence of a failure in the PCC rule
installation/activation or enforcement without requiring an Event-Trigger. See
clause 4.5.12.
NOTE 3: The UE signalling with the network is governed by the applicable NAS
signalling TS. The NAS 3GPP TS for a specific access may restrict the UE
possibilities to make requests compared to what is stated above.
If the PCRF is, due to incomplete, erroneous or missing information (e.g. QoS,
SGSN address, RAT type, TFT, subscriber information) not able to provision a
policy decision as response to the request for PCC rules by the PCEF, the PCRF
may reject the request using a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140). If the PCEF receives a CC Answer
with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session establishment or
modification that initiated the CC Request.
If the PCRF detects that the packet filters in the request for new PCC rules
received from the PCEF is covered by the packet filters of outstanding PCC
rules that the PCRF is provisioning to the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the
request using a CC-Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFLICTING_REQUEST (5147). If the PCEF receives a CC-Answer
with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session modification that
initiated the CC-Request.
If the PCRF does not accept one or more of the traffic mapping filters
provided by the PCEF in a CC Request (e.g. because the PCRF does not allow the
UE to request enhanced QoS for services not known to the PCRF), the PCRF shall
reject the request using a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144). If the PCEF receives a CC
Answer with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session establishment
or modification that initiated the CC Request.
The PCRF shall not combine a rejection with provisioning of PCC rule
operations in the same CC Answer.
### 4.5.2 Provisioning of PCC rules
#### 4.5.2.0 Overview
The PCRF shall indicate, via the Gx reference point, PCC rules to be applied
at the PCEF. This may be using one of the following procedures:
\- PULL procedure (Provisioning solicited by the PCEF): In response to a
request for PCC rules being made by the PCEF, as described in the preceding
section, the PCRF shall provision PCC rules in the CC-Answer; or
\- PUSH procedure (Unsolicited provisioning): The PCRF may decide to provision
PCC rules without obtaining a request from the PCEF, e.g. in response to
information provided to the PCRF via the Rx reference point, or in response to
an internal trigger within the PCRF. To provision PCC rules without a request
from the PCEF, the PCRF shall include these PCC rules in an RA-Request
message. No CCR/CCA messages are triggered by this RA-Request. The PCRF should
NOT send a new RA-Request command to the PCEF until the previous RA-Request
has been acknowledged for the same IP-CAN session.
For each request from the PCEF or upon the unsolicited provision the PCRF
shall provision zero or more PCC rules. The PCRF may perform an operation on a
single PCC rule by one of the following means:
\- To activate or deactivate a PCC rule that is predefined at the PCEF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this PCC rule within a Charging-Rule-Name
AVP and indicate the required action by choosing either the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP or the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned PCC rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding Charging-Rule-Definition AVP within a Charging-Rule-Install
AVP.
\- To remove a PCC rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF, the
PCRF shall provision the name of this PCC rule as value of a Charging-Rule-
Name AVP within a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- If, for certain accesses, the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF
may move previously installed or activated PCC rules from one IP CAN bearer to
another IP CAN bearer. See annex A for further details.
As an alternative to providing a single PCC rule, the PCRF may provide a
Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP or the
Charging-Rule-Remove AVP as a reference to a group of PCC rules predefined at
the PCEF. With a Charging-Rule-Install AVP, a predefined group of PCC rules is
activated. With a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of PCC rules is
deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above PCC rule operations in a single
command.
When the UE initiates a resource modification procedure, the PCRF shall
provision PCC rule(s) that are only related to the UE\'s resource modification
in the corresponding CCA command.
To activate a predefined PCC rule at the PCEF, the rule name within a
Charging-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP as
a reference to the predefined rule. To activate a group of predefined PCC
rules within the PCEF (e.g. gold users or gaming services) a Charging-Rule-
Base-Name AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP as a
reference to the group of predefined PCC rules.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined PCC rule, the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If a PCC rule with the same rule
name, as supplied in the Charging-Rule-Name AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP, already exists at the PCEF, the new PCC rule shall update the
currently installed rule. If the existing PCC rule already has attributes also
included in the new PCC rule definition, the existing attributes shall be
overwritten. Any attribute in the existing PCC rule not included in the new
PCC rule definition shall remain valid.
If no PCC rule(s) with uplink packet filters that are provided to the UE are
bound to a bearer which requires traffic mapping information (according to the
rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]), the PCEF shall derive traffic
mapping information based on implementation specific logic (e.g. traffic
mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in
uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]) and
shall provide it to the UE.
NOTE 1: For GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.060 [17], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one
bearer with no traffic mapping information TFT packet filter for the uplink
direction.
NOTE 2: For a default bearer, the PCEF will not add traffic mapping
information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink
direction on its own.
Upon installation or activation of a PCC rule, the PCEF shall then perform the
bearer binding according to clause 5.4 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] and use the
select IP CAN bearer for the new PCC rule.
Upon the same modification of the QCI and/or ARP of all the PCC rules bound to
the same bearer, the PCEF should modify the QCI and/or ARP for that bearer.
Provisioning of predefined PCC rules upon invocation/revocation of an MPS
service shall be done according to clause 5.3 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Further details of the binding mechanism can be found in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
For deactivating single predefined or removing PCRF-provided PCC rules, the
Charging-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
For deactivating a group of predefined PCC rules, the Charging-Rule-Base-Name
AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
NOTE 3: When deactivating a predefined PCC rule that is activated in more than
one IP-CAN bearers, the predefined PCC rule is deactivated simultaneously in
all the IP-CAN bearers where it was previously activated.
The PCRF may request the PCEF to confirm that the resources associated to a
PCC rule are successfully allocated. To do so the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (22) if the
event trigger is not previously set. In addition the PCRF shall install the
rules that need resource allocation confirmation by including the Resource-
Allocation-Notification AVP with the value ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0) within the
corresponding Charging-Rule-Install AVP. If a Charging-Rule-Install AVP does
not include the Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP, the resource allocation
shall not be notified by the PCEF even if this AVP was present in previous
installations of the same rule.
NOTE 4: The PCEF reporting the successful installation of PCC rules using RAA
command means that the PCC rules are installed but the bearer binding or QoS
resource reservation may not yet be completed, see 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
If Enh-RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the PCRF may request the PCEF to
report the outcome of the release of resources related to a PCC rule. To do so
the PCRF shall provide the Event-Trigger AVP with the value RESOURCE_RELEASE
(53) if the event trigger is not previously set. In addition the PCRF shall
provide the Resource-Release-Notification AVP with the value
ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0) with the corresponding Charging-Rule-Remove AVP. If a
Charging-Rule-Remove AVP does not include the Resource-Release-Notification
AVP, the outcome of the resource release shall not be notified by the PCEF.
The PCRF shall maintain the PCC rules for which release confirmation is
required until the PCEF notifies about the resource release outcome.
If the provisioning of PCC rules fails, the PCEF informs the PCRF as described
in clause 4.5.12 PCC Rule Error Handling. Depending on the cause, the PCRF may
decide if re-installation, modification, removal of PCC rules or any other
action applies.
If the PCRF is unable to create a PCC rule for the response to the CC Request
by the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the request as described in clause 4.5.1.
If the PCRF receives a request for PCC rules for an IP-CAN session from the
PCEF, or a request for QoS rules for a gateway control session from the BBERF,
while no suitable authorized PCC rules are configured in the PCRF or can be
derived from service information provisioned by an AF, the PCRF shall check
the set of services the user is allowed to access.
If the user is not allowed to access AF session based services, the PCRF shall
check whether the user is allowed to request resources for services not known
to the PCRF and whether the requested QoS and/or packet filters can be
authorized. If this is the case, the PCRF shall provide a PCC rule to
authorize the UE requested QoS and packet filters that were received as part
of the request for PCC/QoS rules. The service data flow description shall be
derived from the packet filter information. If the user is not allowed to
request resources for services not known to the PCRF, the PCRF shall reject
the request.
If the user is allowed to access AF session based services, the PCRF may,
depending e.g. on the user\'s subscription details or operator policy,
authorise the requested QoS for a timer supervised grace period (the timer
started by the PCRF either by the request from the PCEF or from the BBERF) to
wait for AF service information. If an AF session bound to the same IP-CAN
session is ongoing and only preliminary service information was received
within this AF session, the PCRF shall base the authorization of the requested
QoS on the preliminary service information.
NOTE 5: This scenario can for instance be encountered for a UE terminated IMS
session establishment or modification with UE initiated resource reservation,
refer to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]. If the PCRF does not authorize a request for
PCC/QoS rules in this scenario, the IMS session setup can fail.
NOTE 6: During the grace period, the QoS and packet filters requested by the
UE need to be authorized even if the user is not allowed to request for
resources for services not known to the PCRF or if the requested QCI is not
allowed for services not known to the PCRF as it is not clear at this point in
time whether the UE resource request belongs to an AF session or to a service
not known to the PCRF.
If the preliminary service information is insufficient to construct
appropriate PCC rules or no preliminary service information is available, the
PCRF shall provide preliminary PCC rules to authorize the UE requested QoS and
packet filters. Therefore, the preliminary PCC rules shall contain wildcarded
flow description or flow description derived from possible packet filters
received as part of the request for PCC/QoS rules. The PCRF may apply a
dedicated charging key value to indicate to the charging subsystem that the
charging key is preliminary and may be corrected later on.
NOTE 7: With the dedicated charging key, the PCRF instructs the charging
subsystem to recalculate the applicable charge for the time when the dedicated
charging key value was applied once the dedicated charging key value is
replaced with some other value in a new provisioning of PCC rules. For
example, if online charging applies, Session Charging with Unit Reservation
(SCUR) can be used .When the charging key changes, the PCEF will return
initially reserved credit units and the OCS then can recalculate the consumed
credit units applying the rate derived from the new other charging key value
and update the user\'s credit accordingly.
NOTE 8: A preliminary PCC rule is a normal PCC rule containing preliminary
information.
If the PCRF receives AF service information while the timer-supervised grace
period is running, the PCRF shall stop the timer and may derive authorized PCC
rules from this service information and update or replace the preliminary PCC
rules that were previously provided for the UE requested QoS and packet
filters, for instance by choosing service specific QoS parameters and charging
keys.
NOTE 9: The dedicated preliminary charging key value that was previously
provided by the PCRF instructs the charging subsystem to recalculate the
applicable charge when the new service specific charging key is provided. The
recalculation covers the time when the previous dedicated charging key value
was active. The new service specific charging key is applied from that time
onwards.
If the timer expires and the PCRF has not received any AF service information,
the PCRF should apply the policy for services not known to the PCRF and may
downgrade or revoke the authorization for the preliminary PCC/QoS rules
(previously provided for the UE requested QoS and packet filters) in
accordance with the policy for services not known to the PCRF. The PCRF should
adjust the charging keys within the PCC rules and should downgrade the
authorized QoS to the allowed value for the services not known to the PCRF, if
required.
For the case where the BBERF requests QoS rules from the PCRF, the PCRF
derives the QoS rules from the PCC rules and provisions the QoS rules to the
BBERF according to clause 4a.5.2.
If the IP flow mobility is supported and the tariff depends on what access
network is in use for the service data flow, then the PCRF may set the
charging key of the PCC rule in accordance with the access network in use.
If the PCRF retrieves the corresponding transfer policy from the SPR based on
the Reference Id provided by the AF, the PCRF shall take the transfer policy
as input for policy decisions (e.g. setting the charging key equal to the
charging key of the transfer policy, rule activation/deactivation time
according to the time window).
If the PCRF receives IMS service information (e.g. codec) over the Rx
interface and the QoS mapping procedures defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]
subclause 6.3 for the received service information result in a QCI of 1
associated with the corresponding flows, then if the RAN-Support-Info feature
is supported and if local policy allows, the PCRF shall, for those flows
associated with QCI of 1, send the downlink maximum packet loss rate (i.e. the
Max-PLR-DL AVP) and/or the uplink maximum packet loss rate (i.e. the Max-PLR-
UL AVP) within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP to the PCEF.
NOTE 10: Based on local configuration, the PCRF sets the downlink and uplink
maximum packet loss rates corresponding to either the most robust codec mode
or the least robust codec mode of the negotiated set in each direction.
#### 4.5.2.1 Selecting a PCC rule for Uplink IP packets
If PCC is enabled, the PCEF shall select the applicable PCC rule for each
received uplink IP packet within an IP CAN bearer by evaluating the packet
against uplink service data flow template of PCRF-provided or predefined
active PCC rules assigned to this IP CAN bearer.
PCC rules shall be assigned to an IP CAN bearer via bearer binding; PCC Rules
that contain an application identifier may be assigned to other bearer(s) with
non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in addition to the bearer where the PCC
rule is bound to.
NOTE 1: The PCEF uses implementation specific logic to assign PCC Rules that
contain an application identifier to additional bearer(s) for uplink bearer
binding verification, i.e. to determine for what bearers the uplink service
data flow detection applies. When PCC rules with application detection filters
cannot be used to generate traffic mapping information for the UE, the
application detection may need to inspect traffic on multiple bearers. The
uplink traffic will get the QoS of the bearer carrying the traffic. The QCI of
the bearer may therefore be different than the QCI of the PCC rule detecting
the service data flow. The charging and other enforcement functions performed
by the PCEF will still be carried out based on parameters of the PCC rule
detecting the service data flow. In case the PCC rule contains a GBR QCI, the
GBR resource reservation will only apply on the bearer where the PCC rule is
bound to. The PCRF can prevent that uplink GBR resources are reserved by
providing an uplink GBR value of zero in the PCC rule.
For PCC rules that contain service data flow filters, the evaluation of
packets against the service data flow templates shall be done in the order of
the precedence of the PCC rules. When a packet matches a service data flow
template, the packet matching process for that packet is completed, and the
PCC rule for that filter shall be applied.
For PCC rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an
application detection filter), the order and the details of the application
detection are implementation specific. Once an application has been detected,
the PCC rule shall however be applied under consideration of the PCC rule
precedence, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap (regardless of whether they
contain service data flow filters or an application identifier), only the PCC
rule with the highest precedence shall be applied and the packet matching
process for that packet is completed.
When a PCRF-provided PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same
precedence, the uplink service data flow templates of the PCRF-provided PCC
rule shall be applied.
Uplink IP packets which do not match any PCC rule assigned to the
corresponding IP CAN bearer shall be silently discarded.
#### 4.5.2.2 Selecting a PCC rule and IP CAN Bearer for Downlink IP packets
If PCC is enabled, the PCEF shall select a PCC rule for each received downlink
IP packet within an IP CAN session by evaluating the packet against downlink
service data flow templates of PCRF-provided or predefined active PCC rules of
all IP CAN bearers of the IP CAN session.
In case tunnelling from the TDF is used, the downlink packets marked with the
corresponding DL DSCP value carried in the inner IP header, as specified in
clause 4b.5.14, shall be evaluated against downlink service data flow
templates of PCRF-provided or predefined active PCC rules of all IPâ€‘CAN
bearers of the IPâ€‘CAN session.
For PCC rules that contain service data flow filters, the evaluation of
packets against the service data flow templates shall be done in the order of
the precedence of the PCC rules. When a packet matches a service data flow
template, the packet matching process for that packet is completed, and the
PCC rule for that template shall be applied.
For PCC rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an
application detection filter), the order and the details of the application
detection are implementation specific. Once an application has been detected,
the PCC rule shall however be applied under consideration of the PCC rule
precedence, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap (regardless of whether they
contain service data flow filters or an application identifier), only the PCC
rule with the highest precedence shall be applied and the packet matching
process for that packet is completed.
When a PCRF-provided PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same
precedence, the downlink service data flow template of the PCRF-provided PCC
rule shall be applied.
The Downlink IP Packet shall be transported within the IP CAN bearer where the
selected PCC rule is mapped.
Downlink IP packets which do not match any PCC rule of the IP CAN session
shall be silently discarded.
#### 4.5.2.3 Gate function
The Gate Function represents a user plane function enabling or disabling the
forwarding of IP packets belonging to a service data flow. A gate is described
within a PCC rule. If the PCC rule contains Flow-Information AVP(s) applicable
for uplink IP flows, it shall describe a gate for the corresponding uplink IP
flows. If the PCC rule contains Flow-Information AVP(s) applicable for
downlink IP flows, it shall describe a gate for the corresponding downlink IP
flows. If the PCC rule contains the application identifier, it shall describe
a gate for the corresponding detected application traffic. The Flow-Status AVP
of the PCC rule shall describe if the possible uplink and possible downlink
gate is opened or closed.
The commands to open or close the gate shall lead to the enabling or disabling
of the passage for corresponding IP packets. If the gate is closed all packets
of the related IP flows shall be dropped. If the gate is opened the packets of
the related IP flows are allowed to be forwarded.
#### 4.5.2.4 Policy enforcement for \"Authorized QoS\" per PCC Rule
The PCRF can provide the authorized QoS for a PCC rule to the PCEF. The
Provisioning of authorized QoS per PCC Rule shall be performed using the PCC
rule provisioning procedure. For a PCRF-provided PCC rule, the \"Authorized
QoS\" shall be encoded using a QoS-Information AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP of the PCC rule. If \"Authorized QoS\" is provided for a PCC
rule, the PCEF shall enforce the corresponding policy.
The PCRF may indicate that the PCEF may apply resource sharing for one or more
PCC rules with a GBR QCI.
See also clause 4.5.5.
#### 4.5.2.5 Usage Monitoring Control
Usage monitoring may be performed for service data flows associated with one
or more PCC rules.
The provisioning of usage monitoring control per PCC rule shall be performed
using the PCC rule provisioning procedure. For a PCRF-provided PCC rule, the
monitoring key shall be set using the Monitoring-Key AVP within the Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP of the PCC rule. For a predefined PCC rule, the monitoring
key shall be included in the rule definition at the PCEF. Usage monitoring
shall be activated both for service data flows associated with predefined PCC
rules and dynamic PCC rules, including rules with deferred activation and/or
deactivation times while those rules are active.
NOTE: It is recommended that the same traffic is not monitored by both PCC
rules in the PCEF and ADC rules in the TDF with active usage monitoring at the
same time. This avoids double counting.
#### 4.5.2.6 Redirect function
The PCRF may provide the redirect instruction for a dynamic PCC rule to the
PCEF enhanced with ADC. The Provisioning shall be performed using the PCC rule
provisioning procedure. The redirect instruction shall be encoded using a
Redirect-Information AVP within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP of the
dynamic PCC rule.
For a dynamic PCC rule, the redirect address may be provided as part of the
dynamic PCC rule or may be preconfigured in the PCEF. A redirect destination
provided within the Redirect-Server-Address AVP in a dynamic PCC Rule shall
override the redirect destination preconfigured in the PCEF for this PCC rule.
NOTE: The PCEF uses the preconfigured redirection address only if it can be
applied to the application traffic being detected, e.g. the redirection
destination address could be preconfigured on a per application identifier
basis.
If Redirect-Information AVP is provided for a dynamic PCC rule, the PCEF shall
implement the redirection for the detected application\'s uplink traffic. If
the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is provided within the Redirect-Information
AVP and the Redirect-Support AVP is not set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED, the PCEF
shall redirect the detected application\'s uplink traffic to this address. In
this case, the redirect address type (e.g. Ipv4, Ipv6 or URL) shall be defined
by the Redirect-Address-Type AVP. If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not
provided, the redirection address preconfigured in the PCEF shall be used
instead. If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not provided and the
redirection address is not preconfigured in the PCEF for this PCC rule, the
PCEF shall perform PCC Rule Error Handling as specified in clause 4.5.12.
When the PCRF wants to disable the redirect function for an already installed
PCC Rule, the PCRF shall update the PCC rule including the Redirect-
Information AVP with Redirect-Support AVP set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED.
#### 4.5.2.7 Support for DSCP marking of downlink packets at the TDF
In order to support policy and charging control in the downlink direction by
the PCEF for an application detected and marked by the TDF as specified in
clause 4b.5.14, the PCRF may either install a corresponding dynamic PCC Rule
or activate a pre-defined PCC rule, which identifies traffic based on the
corresponding DSCP value (provided by the ToS-Traffic Class AVP within the
Flow-Information AVP).
NOTE: This solution is particularly useful for QoS enforcement in the downlink
direction procedures performed by the PCEF. The TDF may still perform
application detection and control as per received ADC Rules, including
application detection reporting to the PCRF, enforcement control, usage
monitoring control and charging, while applying DSCP marking. The PCEF may
also perform then policy and charging control in the downlink direction.
#### 4.5.2.8 Traffic Steering Control support
This procedure takes place if the TSC feature as defined in subclause 5.4.1 is
supported.
The PCRF may instruct the PCEF to apply a traffic steering control which
consists of applying a specific (S)Gi-LAN traffic steering policy for the
traffic detected based on application level information or service data flow
level information. The PCRF achieves this by providing the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP (s) with the corresponding
parameters as follows:
\- either the application to be detected is identified by the TDF-Application-
Identifier AVP or
\- the service data flow to be detected is identified by the Flow-Information
AVP(s)
\- and the traffic steering policy identifier(s) within the Traffic-Steering-
Policy-Identifier-DL AVP and/or Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP.
The PCRF may also provision the traffic steering control information by
activating the pre-defined PCC rule(s) in the PCEF.
When a combination of PCEF with traffic steering control feature and TSSF is
deployed, the PCEF shall behave as specified in subclause 6.1.17 of 3GPP TS
23.203 [7]. In this case, the PCRF shall include the packet marking
information within the Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-DL AVP and/or
Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP included within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP. The PCRF shall ensure that the value included in these AVP(s)
is aligned with the traffic detection information provided over the St
reference point. That is, it shall ensure that the value is the same as the
applicable value provided as part of the service data flow information or as
the value(s) configured in the TSSF referred by the application identifier.
See subclause 4c.4.1 in this Technical Specification for the details in the
Diameter based St reference point. See 3GPP TS 29.155 [52] for the details in
the REST based St reference point.
NOTE: The PCRF and the PCEF are configured with the packet marking and
forwarding mechanism to be applied in the PCEF. This information will be
aligned with the information configured in the TSSF for traffic detection. The
flow information provided over St reference point can be used for traffic
detection at the TSSF when the PCEF is configured to do packet marking and
forwarding using e.g. ToS value in the IP header. The Application Identifier
provided over St reference point can be used when the PCEF is configured to do
packet marking and forwarding using e.g. GRE or NSH.
The PCEF shall enforce the traffic steering policy as defined in subclause
4.4.2.
### 4.5.3 Provisioning of Event Triggers
The PCRF may provide one or several event triggers within one or several
Event-Trigger AVP to the PCEF using the PCC rule provision procedure. Event
triggers may be used to determine which IP-CAN session modification or
specific event causes the PCEF to re-request PCC rules. Although event trigger
reporting from PCEF to PCRF can apply for an IP CAN session or bearer
depending on the particular event, provisioning of event triggers will be done
at session level. The Event-Trigger AVP may be provided in combination with
the initial or subsequent PCC rule provisioning.
NOTE 1: There are event triggers that will only take effect when additional
information is provided. The PCRF may provide the additional information
together with the event trigger or in subsequent PCC rule provisioning.The
PCEF will only report those event triggers when the related data is available.
The PCRF may add new event triggers or remove the already provided ones at
each request from the PCEF or upon the unsolicited provision from the PCRF. In
order to do so, the PCRF shall provide the new complete list of applicable
event triggers including the needed provisioned Event-Trigger AVPs in the CCA
or RAR commands.
The PCRF may remove all previously provided event triggers by providing the
Event-Trigger AVP set to the value NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS. When an Event-Trigger
AVP is provided with this value, no other Event-Trigger AVP shall be provided
in the CCA or RAR command. Upon reception of an Event-Trigger AVP with this
value, the PCEF shall not inform PCRF of any event except for those events
that are always reported and do not require provisioning from the PCRF.
If no Event-Trigger AVP is included in a CCA or RAR operation, any previously
provisioned event trigger will be still applicable. Unless otherwise stated
for a certain event trigger, the PCRF shall be able to modify the data related
to an event trigger without providing again a previously provisioned event
trigger if such event trigger is still armed.
There are event triggers that are required to be unconditionally reported from
the PCEF to the PCRF as specified in clause 5.3.7 even though the PCRF has not
provisioned them to the PCEF.
### 4.5.4 Provisioning of charging related information for the IP-CAN session
#### 4.5.4.1 Provisioning of Charging Addresses
In combination with the initial PCC rule provisioning only, the PCRF may
provide OFCS and/or OCS addresses within a Charging-Information AVP to the
PCEF defining the offline and online charging system addresses respectively.
These shall overwrite any predefined addresses at the PCEF. Both primary and
secondary addresses for OFCS and/or OCS shall be provided simultaneously.
Provisioning OFCS or OCS addresses without PCC rules for offline or online
charged service data flows, respectively, shall not be considered as an error
since such PCC rules may be provided in later provisioning.
If no OCS address is available at the PCEF (i.e. no predefined OCS addresses,
and no OCS addresses supplied by the PCRF and/or by the Charging
Characteristics), the PCEF shall use the IMSI (MNC and MCC values) of the user
to construct the OCS Home network domain name as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003
[25], clause 25.
#### 4.5.4.2 Provisioning of Default Charging Method
The default charging method indicates what charging method shall be used for
every PCC rule where the charging method is omitted. The PCEF may have a pre-
configured Default charging method.
Upon the initial interaction with the PCRF, the PCEF shall provide the pre-
configured Default charging method if available within the Online AVP and/or
Offline AVP embedded directly within the CCR command to the PCRF.
Upon the initial interaction with the PCEF, the PCRF may provide default
charging method within the Online AVP or Offline AVP embedded directly within
the CCA command to the PCEF. The default charging method provided by the PCRF
shall overwrite any predefined default charging method at the PCEF.
#### 4.5.4.3 Void
#### 4.5.4.4 Provisioning of Access Network Charging Identifier
When the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP is unknown for an AF
session to the PCRF, the PCRF may request the PCEF to provide the Access-
Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP associated to dynamic PCC rules. To do so,
the PCRF shall provide the Event-Trigger AVP with the value
CHARGING_CORRELATION_EXCHANGE (28) if the event trigger is not previously set
and the Charging-Correlation-Indicator AVP indicating
CHARGING_IDENTIFIER_REQUIRED within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
The PCRF shall interpret that the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP is
known as follows:
\- For case 1, when the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP is received
and includes the IP-CAN-Session-Charging-Scope AVP;
\- For case 2a and case 2b when the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP
is received.
If the Event-Trigger AVP with the value CHARGING_CORRELATION_EXCHANGE (28) has
been provided to the PCEF, the PCEF shall include the access network charging
identifier that the PCEF has assigned for the dynamic PCC Rules within the
Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx where the Charging-Correlation-Indicator
AVP indicated CHARGING_IDENTIFIER_REQUIRED.
NOTE: The PCRF indicates CHARGING_IDENTIFIER_REQUIRED in the Charging-
Correlation-Indicator AVP for the dynamic PCC rules related to the flows for
which the AF has requested a notification about Access Network Charging
Information, according to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].
### 4.5.5 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
#### 4.5.5.0 Overview
The PCRF may provide authorized QoS to the PCEF.
The authorized QoS shall be provisioned within a CCA or RAR Diameter message
as QoS-Information AVP. The provisioning of the authorized QoS (which is
composed of QCI, ARP and bitrates) is performed from the PCRF to the PCEF. The
authorized QoS can refer to a PCC rule, to an IP CAN bearer, to a QCI or to an
APN.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to an IP CAN bearer, it shall be
provisioned outside a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and it shall also include
the Bearer-Identifier AVP to indicate what bearer it applies to.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to a PCC rule, it shall be provisioned
within the corresponding PCC rule by including the QoS-Information AVP within
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP. The QoS-Information AVP shall not contain a
Bearer-Identifier AVP.
\- When the authorized QoS for a PCC rule with a GBR QCI is candidate for
resource sharing an instruction on the allowed sharing may be provisioned
within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP by including Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or
Sharing-Key-DL AVP.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to QCI, authorised MBR per QCI is supplied.
In such a case the authorized QoS shall be provisioned outside a Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP at the command level. This case applies only for IP-CAN
types that support non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR (i.e. 3GPP-GPRS
access). Its applicability is specified in annex A.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to an APN, authorised APN-Aggregate-Max-
Bitrate-UL/DL AVPs or Extended-APN-AMBR-UL/DL AVPs (see subclause 4.5.30)is
supplied. In such a case the authorized QoS shall be provisioned outside a
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP at command level.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to the default EPS bearer it shall be
provisioned within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP.
Authorized QoS at IP-CAN bearer level is access specific. See Annex A for
further details.
The authorized QoS provides appropriate values for the resources to be
enforced.
The authorized QoS for a PCC rule is a request for allocating the
corresponding resources, and the authorized QoS for a QCI is a request for an
upper limit for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to non-GBR bearers with that
QCI.
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per PCC rule is a part of PCC rule
provisioning procedure.
If the PCEF cannot allocate any of the resources as authorized by the PCRF,
the PCEF informs the PCRF and acts as described in clause 4.5.12 PCC Rule
Error handling.
The PCEF is responsible for enforcing the policy based authorization.
QoS authorization information may be dynamically provisioned by the PCRF or it
can be a pre-defined PCC rule in the PCEF. Moreover, all the parameters of the
authorized QoS can be changed, but no order is defined for QCI.
NOTE 1: A change of QCIs cannot be described as an upgrade or downgrade and
also no QCI can be referred to as the higher or lower.Whether the QCI is
permitted to be changed or not is subject to both operator policies and normal
restrictions on changing from a non-GBR QCI value to GBR QCI value on a
default bearer.
NOTE 2: All attributes of the ARP QoS parameter can be changed but only the
ARP priority level represents an ordered range of values. The ARP priority
level attribute represents the actual priority for the service/user with the
value 1 as the highest and can thus be upgraded and downgraded.
The PCEF shall make sure that the total QoS information of the PCC rules for
one IP-CAN bearer does not exceed the authorized QoS information, i.e. the
information received from the PCRF.
If the PCRF is unable to make a decision for the response to the CC-Request by
the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the request as described in clause 4.5.1.
#### 4.5.5.0a Provisioning of authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is used if the bearer binding is
performed by the PCRF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]). Provisioning of
authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is access specific. See Annex A for further
details.
#### 4.5.5.1 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The PCEF is responsible for enforcing the policy based authorization, i.e. to
ensure that the requested QoS is in-line with the \"Authorized QoS\" per IP
CAN Bearer. Policy enforcement of authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is access
specific. See Annex A for further details.
#### 4.5.5.2 Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per service data flow is a part of PCC rule
provisioning procedure, as described in clause 4.5.2.0.
The authorized QoS per service data flow shall be provisioned within the
corresponding PCC rule by including the QoS-Information AVP within the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA or RAR commands. This QoS-Information
AVP shall not contain a Bearer-Identifier AVP.
If the PCRF wants to ensure that a PCC Rule is always bound to the default
bearer, the policy provisioning for the related authorized QoS shall be done
as described in subclause 4.5.5.13.
#### 4.5.5.3 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per service data flow
If an authorized QoS is defined for a PCC rule, the PCEF shall limit the data
rate of the service data flow corresponding to that PCC rule not to exceed the
maximum authorized bandwidth for the PCC rule by discarding packets exceeding
the limit.
NOTE 1: In order to support services that generate media with variable bitrate
(e.g. video), the policing function in the PCEF could need to measure the
enforced MBR with a sliding window that averages over a suitable time period.
For example, for MTSI media, 3GPP TS 26.114 [57] recommends a default period
of 2 seconds and provides further considerations regarding suitable time
periods for speech and video.
The PCEF shall reserve the resources necessary for the guaranteed bitrate for
the PCC rule upon receipt of a PCC rule provisioning including QoS
information. For GBR bearers the PCEF should set the bearer\'s GBR to the sum
of the GBRs of all PCC rules that are active/installed and bound to that GBR
bearer. For GBR bearers the PCEF should set the bearer\'s MBR to the sum of
the MBRs of all PCC rules that are active/installed and bound to that GBR
bearer.
NOTE 2: Since the PCRF controls the GBR value in the PCC rule, the PCRF can
prevent that uplink GBR resources are reserved by providing an uplink GBR
value of zero for that PCC rule This may be useful e.g. for a PCC rule with
application identifier as the uplink traffic can be received in other bearers
than the one the PCC rule is bound to.
For non-GBR bearers, when the IP-CAN type supports non-GBR bearers that have a
separate MBR (i.e. 3GPP-GPRS), the PCEF may also set the bearer\'s MBR to the
sum of the MBRs of all PCC rules that are active and bound to that non-GBR
bearer unless that sum exceeds a possibly provisioned authorized QoS per QCI
for the bearer\'s QCI (see clause 4.5.5.6). If an authorized QoS per QCI has
been provisioned for the bearer\'s QCI, the PCEF should set the bearer\'s MBR
to the corresponding MBR. The access-specific BS Manager (as included in 3GPP
TS 29.213 [8]) within the PCEF receives the authorised access-specific QoS
information from the Translation/mapping function. Then the PCEF shall start
the needed procedures to ensure that the provisioned resources are according
to the authorized values. This may imply that the PCEF needs to request the
establishment of new IP CAN bearer(s) or the modification of existing IP CAN
bearer(s). If the enforcement is not successful, the PCEF shall inform the
PCRF as described in clause 4.5.5.0.
Upon deactivation or removal of a PCC rule, the PCEF shall free the resources
reserved for that PCC rule.
If the PCRF has indicated that a service data flow needs to be bound to the
default bearer, the policy enforcement for the authorized QoS for the
corresponding service data flow shall be done according to subclause 4.5.5.13.
#### 4.5.5.4 Coordination of authorized QoS scopes in mixed mode
Coordination of authorized QoS scopes in mixed mode is access specific. See
Annex A for further details.
#### 4.5.5.5 Provisioning of authorized QoS per QCI
When the IP-CAN type supports non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR (i.e.
3GPP-GPRS) the PCRF may provision an authorized QoS per QCI for non-GBR bearer
QCI values. The PCRF shall not provision an authorized QoS per QCI for GBR
bearer QCI values.
The authorized QoS per QCI shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA command level
using the QoS-Information AVP with the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and the
Maximum-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP and/or the Maximum-Requested-Bandwidth-DL
AVP. The Guaranteed Bitrate values shall not be filled up. Multiple QoS-
Information AVPs can be used for assigning authorized QoS for several QCIs
with one command. The authorized QoS per QCI may be provisioned before or in
connection with the activation of the first PCC rule with a certain QCI. The
PCRF may also provision a changed authorized QoS per QCI at any time.
#### 4.5.5.6 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per QCI
The PCEF can receive an authorized QoS per QCI for non GBR-bearer QCI values
for those IP-CAN types that support non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR
(i.e. 3GPP-GPRS). It sets an upper limit for the MBR that the PCEF may assign
to a non-GBR bearer with that QCI. If the PCEF receives an authorized QoS per
QCI for a non-GBR bearer QCI value, it shall not set a higher MBR for that
bearer than the provisioned MBR. The PCEF should assign the authorized MBR per
QCI to a non-GBR bearer with that QCI to avoid frequent IP-CAN bearer
modifications as PCC rules can be dynamically activated and deactivated.
If multiple IP-CAN bearers within the same IP-CAN session are assigned the
same QCI, the authorized MBR per QCI applies independently to each of those
IP-CAN bearers.
The access-specific BS Manager (as included in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]) within the
PCEF receives the authorized access-specific QoS information from the
Translation/mapping function.
#### 4.5.5.7 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS per APN as part of the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure and may modify it at any time as long as there
is an IP-CAN session active for that APN. The authorized QoS per APN may be
modified as part of the IP-CAN session establishment or modification of any of
the IP-CAN sessions active for a UE within that APN. To do so, the PCRF shall
provision the authorized QoS per APN for each IP-CAN session for that APN.
The authorized QoS per APN, if provisioned by the PCRF, shall be provisioned
at RAR or CCA command level using the QoS-Information AVP via one or both of
the following mechanisms:
\- **Unconditional APN policy info** : The APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrateâ€‘UL AVP
and/or the APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrateâ€‘DL AVP, or the Extended-APN-AMBR-UL AVP
and/or the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL AVP (see subclause 4.5.30) shall be included.
\- **Conditional APN policy info** : Support of ConditionalAPNPolicyInfo
feature is required. While providing conditional APN policy info one or more
instances of the Conditionalâ€‘APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Max-Bitrate AVP shall be included.
Each instance includes APN policy related info, i.e. the
APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrateâ€‘UL AVP and/or the APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrateâ€‘DL AVP,
or the Extended-APN-AMBR-UL AVP and/or the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL AVP (see
subclause 4.5.30). Additionally, a list of the applicable RATâ€‘Type and/or
IPâ€‘CANâ€‘Type AVP(s), defining the condition for enforcing the APN policy info,
shall also be included. If the PCEF receives one or more instances of the
Conditional APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrate AVP(s), then it shall replace all the
existing instances of Conditionalâ€‘APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrate AVP(s), i.e.
received earlier for the APN of this user, with the newly received
instance(s). The PCRF shall provide the QoS-Information AVP excluding the
Conditionalâ€‘APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrate AVP to remove the previously provisioned
conditional APN policy info.\ If the PCEF receives the QoSâ€‘Information AVP
without Conditionalâ€‘APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrate AVP, it shall delete the
previously provisioned instance(s) of Conditionalâ€‘APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrate
AVP(s).
NOTE 1: The QoS per APN limits the aggregate bit rate of all Nonâ€‘GBR bearers
of the same APN, i.e. the GBR bearers are outside the scope of QoS per APN.
In order to provide authorized QoS per APN, the QoS-Information AVP shall not
include any other AVP than the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate UL AVP, the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP, the Extended-APN-AMBR-UL AVP, the Extended-APN-
AMBR-DL AVP (see subclause 4.5.30) and/or the Conditional-APN-Aggregate-Max-
Bitrate AVP.
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS per APN, based on information
obtained from the SPR or internal policies.
NOTE 2: When looking up policies for an APN from the SPR or internal storage,
the PCRF can apply the APN matching procedures in Annex H of 3GPP TS 29.213
[8].
For the case that BBF is located at the PCEF, if the modification of the QoS
per APN fails, the PCEF shall retain the existing QoS per APN without any
modification and send to the PCRF a new CCR command with the Event Trigger set
to APNâ€‘AMBR_MODIFICATION_FAILURE providing the retained value within the
APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrateâ€‘UL AVP and/or the APNâ€‘Aggregateâ€‘Maxâ€‘Bitrateâ€‘DL AVP,
or the Extended-APN-AMBR-UL AVP and/or the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL AVP (see
subclause 4.5.30) included in QoS-Information AVP. Additionally, the current
RAT-Type and IP-CAN-Type of the UE shall be included if the failure
corresponds to a conditional QoS per APN.
NOTE 3: The access network can reject the modification of the bearer if the
APNâ€‘AMBR does not comply with the roaming agreement. Refer to 3GPP TS 23.401
[32].
For provisioning of time conditioned authorized QoS per APN, see subclause
4.5.5.12.
#### 4.5.5.8 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per APN
The PCEF shall be able to enforce the AMBR per APN.
The PCEF may receive an authorized QoS per APN at IP-CAN session establishment
and also at IP-CAN session modification. It sets an upper limit for the
bandwidth usage for all the non-GBR bearers for that APN. The PCEF shall limit
to that value the aggregated traffic of all SDFs of the same APN that are
associated with Non-GBR QCIs.
The authorized QoS per APN shall be enforced by the PCEF in the following way:
\- **Unconditional APN policy info** : the PCEF enforces the APN AMBR values
for every current RAT type and IPâ€‘CAN type for which no conditional APN policy
info applies.
\- **Conditional APN policy info** : The PCEF enforces the APN AMBR values
corresponding to the RATâ€‘Type and IPâ€‘CANâ€‘Type matching the current RATâ€‘Type
and IPâ€‘CANâ€‘Type of the UE for the given APN.
If there is an Unconditional APN policy info provided or if it has been
previously provisioned and there is also a Conditional APN policy info
provided, then the Conditional APN policy info where the conditions specified
by the Conditional APN policy info are met shall be enforced. Otherwise, the
Unconditional APN policy info shall be enforced.
If conditions from multiple Conditional APN policy info are met at the same
time then the APN policy related to the most strict matching condition is
enforced, e.g. APNPolicy1 specifies IP CAN Type only and APNPolicy2 specifies
IP CAN Type (with the value same as in APNPolicy1) and an RAT Type, both, then
the APNPolicy2 shall be enforced when the UE\'s current IP CAN Type and RAT-
Type matches with the condition specified by APNPolicy2.
If conditions from multiple APN policy info are met at the same time and all
of these APN policies are equally applicable, e.g. APNPolicy1 specifies IP CAN
Type only and APNPolicy2 specifies RAT-Type only and if the UE\'s current IP-
CAN-Type matches with APNPolicy1 and the UE\'s current RAT-Type matches with
APNPolicy2, then the PCEF should apply the APN policy with APNPolicy2.
NOTE: The scenario of multiple APN policies such that all of them are equally
applicable, e.g. as mentioned above, can be prevented by ensuring a proper
configuration at the PCRF.
For enforcement of time conditioned authorized QoS per APN, see subclause
4.5.5.12.
#### 4.5.5.9 Provisioning of authorized QoS for the Default EPS Bearer
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS for the default EPS bearer. The
authorized QoS may be obtained upon interaction with the SPR.
The default EPS bearer QoS information shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA
command level using the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the QoS-Class-
Identifier AVP and the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP. The provided QoS-
Class-Identifier AVP shall include a non-GBR corresponding value.
For provisioning of time conditioned authorized EPS Bearer QoS information,
see subclause 4.5.5.12.
#### 4.5.5.10 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS of the Default EPS Bearer
The PCEF may receive the authorized QoS for the default bearer over Gx
interface. The PCEF enforces it which may lead to the change of the subscribed
default EPS Bearer QoS.
If the modification of the default EPS bearer QoS information fails, the PCEF
shall retain the existing default EPS bearer QoS without any modification and
send the PCRF a new CCR command and include with Event Trigger set to DEFAULT-
EPS-BEARER-QOS _MODIFICATION_FAILURE providing the retained values within the
Allocation-Retention-PriorityAVP and QoS-Class-Identifier AVP included in
Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP.
NOTE: The access network can reject the modification of the default bearer if
the default beaer QoS does not comply with the roaming agreement. Refer to
3GPP TS 23.401 [32].
For enforcement of time conditioned authorized default EPS bearer QoS
information, see subclause 4.5.5.12.
#### 4.5.5.11 Policy provisioning and enforcement of authorized QoS for
service data flows that share resources
If the ResShare feature is supported by both the PCEF and PCRF as described in
clause 5.4.1, the PCRF may indicate that the PCEF should commonly reserve
resources for a set of PCC rules. The PCEF shall then, for PCC rules bound to
the same bearer and the same sharing key value , use the highest GBR value
among those PCC rules as input for calculating the common GBR value when
reserving bearer resources. The GBR value for each direction shall be
considered separately, so that the uplink and downlink GBR values may
originate from different PCC rules.
The PCEF may based on internal logic use the highest MBR value among the
provided PCC rules indicated to share resources, when determining the MBR for
the bearer. Each individual PCC rule is still subject to data rate policing
based on its own MBR values.
The PCRF shall provide the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in order to indicate that the related PCC
rule may share resources with other PCC rules bound to the same bearer.\ The
PCEF shall apply resource sharing if at least two PCC rules bound to the same
bearer share the same value in the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL
AVP.
If Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP with a modified value is
received in the PCEF it will replace any previously provided value for the
specified PCC rule. If Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP is
omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is still valid.
When modifying the value of Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP to a
PCC rule that is subject to resource sharing the PCEF may adjust the resource
sharing of the remaining PCC rules.
NOTE 1: A PCC rule that is deleted is also removed from the resource sharing,
while the remaining PCC rules continue their sharing relationship.
NOTE 2: The state of resource sharing ends when less than two of the PCC rules
in the set remains.
#### 4.5.5.12 Provisioning and enforcement of time conditioned policy
information
##### 4.5.5.12.1 General
Up to four Conditional-Policy-Information AVPs may be provisioned by the PCRF
in an RAR or CCA command to change the authorized QoS per APN (if the
CondPolicyInfo feature is supported) and/or the authorized default EPS bearer
QoS (if the CondPolicyInfo-DefaultQoS feature is supported) based on time
conditions.
NOTE 1: The same instance of the Conditional-Policy-Information AVP can convey
information related to the authorized QoS per APN and authorized default EPS
bearer QoS when the same time condition applies to both.
If the PCRF wants to provide time conditioned APN policy info(s) and/or
authorized default EPS bearer QoS, each instance of the Conditional-Policy-
Information AVP shall include an Execution-Time AVP. At the time indicated in
the Execution-Time AVP, the PCEF shall perform the requested change without
interaction with the PCRF.
NOTE 2: The PCEF retains remaining time conditioned APN policy information
that have an Execution-Time in the future.
To replace a set of time conditioned policy info(s), the PCRF shall include a
complete set of Conditional-Policy-Information AVP(s) describing all time
conditioned policy info(s) applicable from that point onward. The new set of
time conditioned policy info(s) shall replace all previously provided time
conditioned policies.
To delete the set of time conditioned policy info(s) the following procedures
apply:
\- If the CondPolicyInfo feature is supported, but the CondPolicyInfo-
DefaultQoS feature is not supported, the PCRF shall send a command excluding
the Conditional-Policy-Information AVP and including the QoS-Information AVP
with new authorized APN policy info.
\- If CondPolicyInfo-DefaultQoS feature is supported the PCRF shall provide a
command containing the Conditional-Policy-Information AVP with no AVPs within.
NOTE 3: For services that depend on specific APN policy info and/or authorized
default EPS bearer QoS (e.g. MPS session), the PCRF is responsible to ensure
that no time conditioned policy info(s) interfere with the service (e.g. by
removing the time conditioned APN policy info or time conditioned authorized
default EPS bearer QoS before the respective change time is reached).
##### 4.5.5.12.2 Time conditioned authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF shall only apply the procedures in the present subclause if the the
CondPolicyInfo feature is supported.
If the time conditioned APN policy info includes Conditional APN policy info,
then ConditionalAPNPolicyInfo feature is required to be supported in addition.
The procedures in subclause 4.5.5.12.1 apply with clarifications in the
present subclause.
The Conditional-Policy-Information AVP shall include the Unconditional APN
policy info and/or Conditional APN policy info as defined in subclause
4.5.5.7.
NOTE: Time conditioned APN policy info for the APN-AMBR change helps reducing
the signaling load over Gx. However the APN-AMBR change needs to be
communicated to the UE. Consequently a simultaneous change of the APN-AMBR for
many UE(s) may introduce a signaling storm in the EPC (e.g. over
S5/S8/S2a/S2b). The PCRF can avoid this simultaneous change of the APN-AMBR
(e.g. spread the time conditioned change over time for many UEs).
The PCEF shall after applying a time conditioned instruction to change the
authorized QoS per APN enforce the authorized QoS per APN as defined in
subclause 4.5.5.8.
If the PCRF deletes time conditioned authorized QoS per APN, it shall within
the same command provide a QoS-Information AVP with new authorized APN policy
info.
If Conditional-Policy-Information AVP(s) to change the authorized QoS per APN
are received by the PCEF and the earliest Execution-Time is in the past, then
the PCEF shall immediately enforce the most recent time conditioned instance
containing an authorized QoS per APN that is not in the future.
##### 4.5.5.12.3 Time conditioned authorized default EPS bearer QoS
The PCRF shall only apply the procedures in the present subclause if the the
CondPolicyInfo-DefaultQoS feature is supported.
The time conditioned authorized default EPS bearer QoS is only applicable for
IP CAN types where the Provisioning of authorized QoS for the Default EPS
Bearer procedure in subclause 4.5.5.9 is applicable.
The procedures in subclause 4.5.5.12.1 apply with clarifications in the
present subclause.
The Conditional-Policy-Information AVP shall include the default EPS bearer
QoS info in the Default-EPS-bearer-QoS AVP as described in subclause 4.5.5.9.
NOTE: Time conditioned default EPS bearer QoS info change helps reducing the
signaling load over Gx. However the default EPS Bearer QoS info change needs
to be communicated to the UE. Consequently a simultaneous change of the
default EPS bearer QoS for many UE(s) may introduce a signaling storm in the
EPC (e.g. over S5/S8/S2a/S2b). The PCRF can avoid this simultaneous change of
the default EPS bearer QoS (e.g. spread the time conditioned change over time
for many UEs).
The PCEF shall after applying a time conditioned instruction to change the
authorized default EPS bearer QoS enforce the authorized default EPS bearer
QoS as defined in subclause 4.5.5.10. If the Rule-Bound-to-Default-Bearer
feature is supported by both the PCEF and PCRF as described in clause 5.4.1,
all PCC rule(s) with the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP set to
BIND_TO_DEF_BEARER (0) shall remain bound to the default bearer as described
in subclause 4.5.5.12. For any other PCC rule previously bound to the default
bearer, PCEF shall then perform the bearer binding according to clause 5.4 in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
If the PCRF deletes time conditioned authorized default EPS bearer QoS, it
shall within the same command provide a Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP with new
authorized default EPS bearer QoS.
If Conditional-Policy-Information AVP(s) to change the authorized default EPS
bearer QoS are received by the PCEF and the earliest Execution-Time is in the
past, then the PCEF shall immediately enforce the most recent time conditioned
instance containing an authorized default EPS bearer QoS that is not in the
future.
#### 4.5.5.13 Policy provisioning and enforcement of authorized QoS for
service data flows that shall be bound to the default bearer
If the Rule-Bound-to-Default-Bearer feature is supported by both the PCEF and
PCRF as described in clause 5.4.1, the PCRF may indicate to the PCEF that a
PCC rule shall be bound to the default bearer and shall remain on the default
bearer. The PCEF shall then, for the indicated PCC rule bind it to the default
bearer until the PCC rule is removed or until the PCRF modifies the PCC rule
to set the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP to the value
BIND_TO_APPLICABLE_BEARER(1). The PCEF in this second case shall evaluate the
full QoS information within the QoS-Information AVP and follow normal policy
enforcement procedures for authorized QoS per service data flow as descibed in
subclause 4.5.5.3.
NOTE: QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP within
QoS-Information AVP included in the PCC rule are only used by the PCEF for
bearer binding purposes when the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP is not included
in the PCC rule or it is set to BIND_TO_APPLICABLE_BEARER (1).
The PCRF shall provide the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP within the Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP set to BIND_TO_DEF_BEARER (0) in order to indicate that
the related PCC rule shall be bound to the default bearer.
If the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP set to BIND_TO_DEF _BEARER (0) within the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP is received in the PCEF, the PCEF shall bind the
related PCC rule to the default bearer. This remains valid until the PCC rule
is removed or if the PCRF indicates to the PCEF that the binding to the
default bearer no longer applies.\ The PCEF shall ignore any values included
in QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP within the
QoS-Information AVP of the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP if the Default-Bearer-
Indication AVP set to BIND_TO_DEF _BEARER (0) is included in the same
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP.If the PCRF has previously indicated to the PCEF
that a PCC rule shall be bound to the default bearer, to indicate that the
binding to the default bearer no longer applies the PCRF shall initiate a PCC
rule modification as descibed in subclause 4.5.5.2, including the Default-
Bearer-Indication AVP set to BIND_TO_APPLICABLE_BEARER (1). The PCEF in this
case shall evaluate the full QoS information within the QoS-Information AVP
and follow normal policy enforcement procedures for authorized QoS per service
data flow as descibed in subclause 4.5.5.3.
If the PCRF has not previously indicated to the PCEF that a PCC rule shall be
bound to the default bearer (i.e. it may be bound to another bearer) in order
to indicate that the binding to the default bearer applies, the PCRF shall
initiate a PCC rule modification as described in subclause 4.5.5.2, including
the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP set to BIND_TO_DEF_BEARER (0). The PCEF in
this case shall follow the procedures described in this subclause.
### 4.5.6 Indication of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications
This procedure applies to those IP-CAN networks that support multiple bearers.
This procedure applies only to dedicated bearers. For 3GPP-GPRS IP-CAN
network, see annex A.
If the last IP CAN bearer within an IP CAN session is being terminated, the
PCEF shall apply the procedures in clause 4.5.7 to indicate the IP CAN session
termination.
When the PCEF detects that a dedicated IP-CAN bearer could not be activated or
has been terminated it shall remove the affected PCC rules and send a CCR
command to the PCRF with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\", including the Charging-Rule-Report AVP specifying the
affected PCC rules with the PCC-Rule-Status set to inactive and including the
Rule-Failure-Code AVP assigned to the value RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_FAILURE (10).
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the PCEF shall provide the
available access network information within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP
(if available), TWAN-Identifier (if available and Trusted-WLAN feature is
supported), User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if available) and 3GPP-MS-TimeZone
AVP (if available). Additionally, if the PCEF receives from the access network
the RAN cause and/or the NAS cause, the TWAN cause or the untrusted WLAN cause
due to bearer termination the PCEF shall provide the received cause(s) in the
RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP included in the Charging-Rule-Report AVP.
This shall be done whenever one of these conditions applies:
\- The PCEF is requested by the IP-CAN to initiate the deactivation of a
bearer,
\- PCC rule(s) are removed/deactivated by the PCEF without PCRF request (e.g.
due to unsuccessful reservation of resources to satisfy the bearer binding).
NOTE: The PCEF will not initiate the deactivation of the bearer upon reception
of the UE-initiated resource modification procedure indicating packet filter
deletion. If all the PCC rules associated to a bearer have been deleted as a
consequence of the PCRF interaction, the PCEF will initiate the bearer
termination procedure towards the IP-CAN network.
Signalling flows for the IP-CAN bearer termination and details of the binding
mechanism are presented in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
### 4.5.7 Indication of IP-CAN Session Termination
The PCEF shall contact the PCRF when the IP-CAN session is being terminated.
The PCEF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\".
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the PCEF shall provide the
available access network information within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP
(if available), TWAN-Identifier (if available and Trusted-WLAN is supported),
User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if available) and 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if
available). Additionally, if the PCEF receives from the access network the RAN
cause and/or the NAS cause, the TWAN cause or the untrusted WLAN cause due to
IP-CAN session termination the PCEF shall provide the received cause(s) in the
RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP at command level.
If the PCEF needs to send an IP-CAN session termination request towards a PCRF
which is known to have restarted since the IP-CAN session establishment, the
PCEF should not send CC-Request to inform the PCRF.
NOTE: When a PCRF is known to have restarted, the PCC contexts and Diameter
sessions affected by the failure are lost in the PCRF, the PCEF does not need
to inform the PCRF for this case.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the PCEF.
NOTE: According to DCC procedures, the Diameter Credit Control session is
being terminated with this message exchange.
Signalling flows for the IP-CAN session termination are presented in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
### 4.5.8 Request of IP-CAN Bearer Termination
This procedure applies to those IP-CAN networks that support multiple bearers.
This procedure applies only to dedicated bearers. For 3GPP-GPRS IP-CAN
network, see annex A.
As a consequence of the removal of PCC rules initiated by the PCRF, the PCEF
may require the termination of an existing bearer. The PCRF may not be aware
that it requests the termination of an IP-CAN bearer by removing certain PCC
rules.
The PCRF may request the removal of the PCC rules by using the PCC rule
provisioning procedures in clause 4.5.2 to remove all PCRF-provisioned PCC
rules and deactivate all PCC rules predefined within the PCEF. The PCRF may
either completely remove these PCC rules from the IP CAN session or reinstall
them (e.g. by changing the QoS or charging information) within the IP CAN
session. When all the PCC rules applied to one bearer have been deleted and/or
deactivated, the PCEF will instantly start the bearer termination procedure.
When Enh-RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the PCRF removing PCC rules using
the RAR command shall maintain locally the PCC rules that were marked as
requiring release confirmation until the the PCEF reports RESOURCE_RELEASE
(53) event trigger as described in subclause 5.3.7.
NOTE: This is done to allow the PCRF to notify the AF when there is an
abnormal termination of the bearer. The PCRF does not have to retry the
removal of these PCC Rules.
When Enh-RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the PCEF shall maintain locally
the PCC rules that were included in the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP with the
Resource-Release-Notification AVP set to the value ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0)
until it reports RESOURCE_RELEASE (53) event trigger as described in subclause
5.3.7 upon reception of the resource release outcome from the network.
If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-only, and the PCRF receives a
trigger for the removal of all PCC rules from the AF, the following steps
apply. In order to avoid race conditions, the PCRF should start a timer to
wait for the UE-initiated resource release message. If a UE-initiated resource
release is performed before timer expiry, the PCRF will receive an Indication
of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications according to clause 4.5.6 and shall
then not perform the removal of the PCC rules. Otherwise, if the timer
expires, the PCRF shall remove/deactivate the affected PCC rules that have
been previously installed/activated.
If the selected BCM is UE-only, and the PCRF decides to remove one or more PCC
rules due to an internal trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall
instantly remove/deactivate the affected PCC rules that have been previously
installed/activated.
If the selected BCM is UE/NW, and the PCRF removes/deactivates at the PCEF,
all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN bearer (due to any trigger), the PCEF shall
instantly start the procedures to terminate the related IP-CAN bearer.
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN bearer, the PCEF shall apply IP
CAN specific procedures to terminate the IP CAN bearer, if such procedures
exist for this IP CAN type.
If the Enh-RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and the bearer is terminated as
a consequence of the removal of one or more PCC rules, the PCEF shall inform
the PCRF about the completion of the bearer procedure related to the removal
of PCC rules that indicated resource release notification by including the
Resource-Release-Notification AVP with the value ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0)
within the corresponding Charging-Rule-Remove AVP. by reporting the
RESOURCE_RELEASE (53) event trigger.If the PCEF received from the access
network some RAN/NAS release cause(s), TWAN release cause(s) or untrusted WLAN
release cause(s), the PCEF shall also provide the received cause(s) in the
Charging-Rule-Report AVP. The PCEF shall also provide the available access
network information within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if available),
TWAN-Identifier (if available and Trusted-WLAN is supported), User-Location-
Info-Time AVP (if available) and 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if available).
### 4.5.9 Request of IP-CAN Session Termination
The PCRF may request the IP-CAN session termination in the following
instances:
\- If the PCRF decides to terminate an IP CAN session due to an internal
trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall send an RAR command including
the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the PCEF. The PCEF shall acknowledge the
command by sending an RAA command to the PCRF.
\- The PCRF may also decide to terminate an IP CAN session upon receiving CCR
command with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\" from
the PCEF (e.g. when usage quota reached). In that case, the PCRF shall send a
CCA command including the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the PCEF.
The PCEF shall instantly remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been
previously installed or activated on that IP-CAN session. The PCEF shall apply
IP CAN specific procedures to terminate the IP CAN session. Furthermore, the
PCEF shall apply the indication of IP CAN Session Termination procedure in
clause 4.5.7.
See Annex A for 3GPP-GPRS access type.
### 4.5.10 Bearer Control Mode Selection
The PCEF may indicate, via the Gx reference point, a request for Bearer
Control Mode (BCM) selection at IP-CAN session establishment or IP-CAN session
modification (e.g. as a consequence of an SGSN change). It will be done using
the PCC rule request procedure.
NOTE 1: For the cases where Gxx is deployed in the network, the Bearer Control
Mode selection may occur either in the Gxx reference point or Gx reference
point, depending on the IP-CAN type. See access specific annexes.
When applicable for the IP-CAN type, if information about the support of
network-initiated procedures is available, the PCEF shall supply at IP-CAN
Session Establishment, the Network-Request-Support AVP in the CC-Request with
a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". At IP-CAN Session
Modification, the PCEF shall supply, if available, the Network-Request-Support
AVP in the CC-Request with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\". The Network-Request-Support AVP indicates the access
network support of the network requested bearer control.
The PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. If the selected bearer control mode is UE_NW,
the PCRF shall decide what mode (UE or NW) shall apply for every PCC rule.
NOTE 2: For operator-controlled services, the UE and the PCRF may be
provisioned with information indicating which mode is to be used.
When applicable for the IP-CAN type, at IP-CAN session establishment, if the
PCEF provided the Network-Request-Support AVP, the selected bearer control
mode shall be provided within the Bearer-Control-Mode AVP to the PCEF using
the PCC Rules provision procedure. At IP-CAN session modification, if the PCEF
provided the Network-Request-Support AVP, the PCRF shall also provide the
Bearer-Control-Mode AVP with the new value if the selected bearer control mode
has changed. The selected value will be applicable for the whole IP-CAN
session.
When the bearer binding function is changed from the BBERF to the PCEF, the
PCEF may indicate, via the Gx reference point, a request for Bearer Control
Mode (BCM) selection at IP-CAN session modification as described above.
NOTE 3: The bearer binding function can be changed from the BBERF to the PCEF
when the UE moves from a case 2a) system or a case 2b) system to a case 1)
system (see 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]).
### 4.5.11 Provisioning of Event Report Indication
For the cases where Gxa and/or Gxc are deployed in the network, the PCEF may
indicate the PCRF to be informed about specific changes occurred in the access
network. In this case, the PCRF shall subscribe to the appropriate event
triggers in the BBERF according to clause 4a.5.8. After receiving the reply of
the event subscription from the BBERF, the PCRF shall send the event related
information to the PCEF by using a RAR command. The Event Report concept is
defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] clause 3.1.
When PCRF is notified that an event is triggered in the BBERF, if the PCEF has
previously requested to be informed of the specific event, the PCRF shall
notify the PCEF about the event occurred together with additional related
information. This notification will be done by using the Event-Report-
Indication AVP. There may be neither PCC Rule provisioning nor Event Trigger
provisioning together with event report indication in this message.
Whenever the PCEF subscribes to an event report indication by using the CCR
command, the PCRF shall only send the corresponding currently applicable
values which have been updated (e.g. 3GPP-User-Location-Info, 3GPP2-BSID,
etc.) to the PCEF in the CCA if available. In this case, the Event-Trigger
AVPs shall not be included.
NOTE: The PCRF can get the currently applicable values during the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure or during the information reporting from the
BBERF when the BBERF gets event subscription from the PCRF as defined in
clause 5.3.7.
When multiple BBERFs exist as in flow mobility case, the PCEF may subscribe to
different event triggers at different BBERFs. In this case, the PCEF shall
include the Routing-IP-Address AVP within the Event-Report-Indication AVP to
identify the BBERF for which the event triggers are to be installed. If the
PCEF did not include Routing-IP-Address AVP within the Event-Report-Indication
AVP, then the Event-Report-Indication AVP applies to all the BBERFs and the
same event triggers will be installed on all of them.
### 4.5.12 PCC Rule Error Handling
If the installation/activation of one or more PCC rules fails, the PCEF shall
include one or more Charging-Rule-Report AVP(s) in either a CCR or an RAA
command as described below for the affected PCC rules. Within each Charging-
Rule-Report AVP, the PCEF shall identify the failed PCC rule(s) by including
the Charging-Rule-Name AVP(s) or Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), shall
identify the failed reason code by including a Rule-Failure-Code AVP, and
shall include the PCC-Rule-Status AVP as described below:
\- If the installation/activation of one or more PCC rules fails using a PUSH
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using RAR command), the PCEF
shall communicate the failure to the PCRF in the RAA response to the RAR if
the validation of the PCC Rule was unsuccessful or in a CCR command if the
resource allocation for the PCC Rule was unsuccessful.
\- If the installation/activation of one or more PCC rules fails using a PULL
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using a CCA command) the PCEF
shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and include the Rule-Failure-Code AVP.
If the installation/activation of one or more new PCC rules (i.e., rules which
were not previously successfully installed) fails, the PCEF shall set the PCC-
Rule-Status to INACTIVE for both the PUSH and the PULL modes.
The removal of a PCC rule shall not fail, even if the IP-CAN session
procedures with the UE fail. The PCEF shall retain information on the removal
and conduct the necessary IP-CAN session procedures with the UE when it is
possible.
If the modification of a currently active PCC rule using PUSH mode fails, the
PCEF shall retain the existing PCC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing PCC rule.
The PCEF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the RAA
command when the validation of the PCC Rule installation was unsuccessful or
using the CCR command when the resource allocation for the corresponding PCC
Rule was unsuccessful.
If the modification of a currently active PCC rule using PULL mode fails, the
PCEF shall retain the existing PCC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing PCC rule.
The PCEF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the CCR
command.
If the RuleVersioning feature is supported and the PCRF included a Content-
Version AVP as part of the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP when installing or
modifying a PCC rule for both the PULL and PUSH modes, then if the resource
allocation for the corresponding PCC rule was unsuccessful, the PCEF shall
include the Content-Version AVP as part of the Charging-Rule-Report AVP.
Depending on the value of the Rule-Failure-Code AVP, and when applicable,
depending also on the value of the Content-Version AVP, for PULL and PUSH
mode, the PCRF may decide whether retaining of the old PCC rule, re-
installation, modification, removal of the PCC rule or any other action
applies.
If a PCC rule was successfully installed/activated, but can no longer be
enforced by the PCEF, the PCEF shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and
include a Charging-Rule-Report AVP. The PCEF shall include the Rule-Failure-
Code AVP within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP, and shall set the PCC-Rule-
Status to INACTIVE and include the rule content version within the Content-
Version AVP if it was included when the PCC rule was provisioned.
NOTE: When the PCRF receives PCC-Rule-Status set to INACTIVE, the PCRF does
not need request the PCEF to remove the inactive PCC rule.
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and as part of any of the procedures
described in this clause the PCEF receives from the access network some
RAN/NAS release cause(s), TWAN release cause(s) or untrusted WLAN release
cause(s), the PCEF shall also provide the received cause(s) in the Charging-
Rule-Report AVP. If RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported the PCEF shall provide
the available access network information within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info
AVP (if available), TWAN-Identifier (if available and Trusted-WLAN is
supported), User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if available) and 3GPP-MS-TimeZone
AVP (if available).
### 4.5.13 Time of the day procedures
PCEF shall be able to perform PCC rule request as instructed by the PCRF. To
do so, the PCRF shall provide the Event-Trigger AVP with the value
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT (17) if the event trigger is not previously set and in
addtition the Revalidation-Time AVP when set by the PCRF. This shall cause the
PCEF to trigger a PCRF interaction to request PCC rules from the PCRF for an
established IP CAN session. The PCEF shall stop the timer once the PCEF
triggers an REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event. The PCEF should send the PCC rule
request during a preconfigured period before the indicated revalidation time.
NOTE 1: The PCRF is expected to be prepared to provide a new policy, as
desired for the revalidation time, during a preconfigured period before the
revalidation time.The preconfigured periods in the PCEF and PCRF need to be
aligned.
PCRF shall be able to provide a new value for the revalidation timeout by
including Revalidation-Time AVP in CCA or RAR. The PCRF may provide the
Revalidation-Time AVP together with the event trigger REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT or
in a subsequent PCC rule provisioning.
PCRF shall be able to stop the revalidation timer by disabling the
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event trigger.
NOTE 2: By disabling the REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT the revalidation time value
previously provided to the PCEF is not applicable anymore.
The PCRF may control at what time the status of a PCC rule changes.
1) If Rule-Activation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the PCEF shall set the PCC rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Rule-Activation-Time has passed, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC
rule active.
2) If Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the PCEF shall set the PCC rule active and make it inactive at that time. If
Rule-Deactivation-Time has passed, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC
rule inactive.
3) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, and also
when the PCC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, the PCEF shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then as
defined in 2).
4) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, and also
when the PCC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Activation-Time, the PCEF shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as
defined in 1).
5) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has already occurred for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before
the Rule-Deactivation-Time, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC rule
inactive.
6) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the
Rule-Activation-Time, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC rule active.
PCC Rule Activation or Deactivation will not generate any CCR commands with
Charging-Rule-Report since PCRF is already aware of the state of the rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified in the
Charging-Rule-Install then it will replace the previously set values for the
specified PCC rules. If Rule-Activation-Time AVP, Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP
or both AVPs are omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is no
longer valid.
The 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available, may be used by the PCRF to derive the
Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time.
If the PCC rule(s) that include the Rule-Activation-Time AVP are bound to a
bearer that will require traffic mapping information to be sent to the UE, the
PCEF shall report the failure to the PCRF by including the Charging-Rule-
Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code set the value \"NO_BEARER_BOUND (15)\"
for the affected PCC rule(s) identified by the Charing-Rule-Name AVP in either
a CCR or an RAA command.
NOTE 3: This limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed
traffic mapping information towards the UE.
The PCC rules including Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time shall
not be applied for changes of the QoS or service data flow filter information.
The PCRF may modify a currently installed PCC rule, including setting,
modifying or clearing its deferred activation and/or deactivation time. When
modifying a dynamic PCC rule with a prior and/or new deferred activation
and/or deactivation time, the PCRF shall provide all attributes of that rule
in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP, including attributes that have not
changed.
NOTE 4: In this case, the PCRF omission of an attribute that has a prior value
will erase that attribute from the PCC rule.
### 4.5.14 Trace activation/deactivation
Trace activation/deactivation at the P-GW takes place via the PCRF and is
3GPP-EPS access specific. See Annex B for further information.
### 4.5.15 IMS Emergency Session Support
#### 4.5.15.1 Functional Entities
The PCRF shall store a configurable list of Emergency APNs that are valid for
the operator to which the PCRF belongs to.
For emergency APNs, the IMSI may not be present. The PCEF, BBERF and PCRF
shall support request for PCC/QoS Rules that do not include an IMSI.
#### 4.5.15.2 PCC procedures for Emergency services over Gx reference point
##### 4.5.15.2.1 Request for PCC Rules for Emergency services
The PCEF executes the same procedure as for a Request for PCC Rules unrelated
to Emergency Services described in clause 4.5.1.
A PCEF that requests PCC Rules at IP-CAN Session Establishment shall send a
CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the
Called-Station-Id AVP including the Emergency APN. The PCEF may include the
IMSI within the Subscription-Id AVP and if the IMSI is not available the PCEF
shall include the IMEI within the User-Equipment-Info AVP. The PCEF may
include the rest of the attributes described in clause 4.5.1. The PCEF may
also include the MSISDN if available within the Subscription-Id AVP.
Any PCEF-initiated requests for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service that
include the \"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\" Event-Trigger AVP shall be
rejected by the PCRF with the error
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
If the PCRF detects that the initial or subsequent CCR command shall be
rejected, it shall execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental
result code described in clause 4.5.1.
##### 4.5.15.2.2 Provisioning of PCC Rules for Emergency services
###### 4.5.15.2.2.1 Provisioning of PCC Rules at Gx session establishment
The PCRF shall detect that a Gx session is restricted to IMS Emergency
services when a CCR command is received with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the Called-Station-Id AVP includes a PDN
identifier that matches one of the Emergency APNs from the configurable list.
The PCRF:
\- shall provision PCC Rules restricting the access to Emergency Services
(e.g. P-CSCF(s), DHCP(s) and DNS (s) and SUPL(s) addresses) as required by
local operator policies in a CCA command according to the procedures described
in clause 4.5.2.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to the default EPS bearer
within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP in a CCA command according to the
procedures described in clause 4.5.5.10 except for obtaining the authorized
QoS upon interaction with the SPR. The value for the Priority-Level AVP shall
be assigned as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an IMS Emergency
session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a value that is
reserved for an operator domain use of IMS Emergency sessions). If the IP-CAN-
Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" or \"3GPP-GPRS\" the values for Pre-
emption-Capability AVP and the Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall be assigned
as required by local operator policies.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to an APN in a CCA command
according to the procedures described in clause 4.5.5.7.
\- shall always assign NW mode to the PCC Rules that are bound to an IP-CAN
session restricted to Emergency services.
When the PCEF detects that the provisioning of PCC Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4.5.2.
###### 4.5.15.2.2.2 Provisioning of PCC Rules for Emergency Services
When the PCRF receives IMS service information from the AF for an Emergency
service and derives authorized PCC Rules from the service information, the
Priority-Level AVP in the QoS information within the PCC Rule shall be
assigned a priority as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an IMS
Emergency session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a value
that is reserved for an operator domain use of IMS Emergency session). If the
IP-CAN Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" or \"3GPP-GPRS\" and the Pre-
emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP were received within
the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP in the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP in the
initial CCR command, the values of the Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-
emption-Vulnerability AVP shall also be assigned as required by local operator
policies.
The PCRF shall immediately initiate a PUSH procedure as described in clause
4.5.2.0 to provision PCC Rules and the procedures described in clause 4.5.5.2
to provision the authorized QoS per service data flow.
The provisioning of PCC Rules at the PCEF that require the establishment of a
dedicated bearer for emergency services shall cancel the inactivity timer in
the PCEF, if running.
Any PCEF-initiated request for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service
triggered by Event-Trigger AVP assigned to \"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\"
(i.e. UE-initiated resource reservation) shall be rejected by the PCRF with
the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED. If the Bearer Control
Mode is assigned to \"UE_ONLY\" and the PCRF receives a request for PCC Rules
that are associated with an Emergency service, it shall provision PCC Rules as
described in clause 4.5.2 and the authorized QoS per service data flow as
described in clause 4.5.2.2.
The PCEF shall execute the procedures described in clause 4.5.2.0 and clause
4.5.5.3 to ensure that a new IP-CAN bearer is established for the Emergency
service.
When the PCEF detects that the provisioning of PCC Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4.5.12.
##### 4.5.15.2.3 Removal of PCC Rules for Emergency Services
The reception of a request to terminate an AF session for an IMS Emergency
service by the PCRF triggers the removal of PCC Rules assigned to the
terminated IMS Emergency Service from the PCEF by using a RAR command with
Charging-Rule-Remove AVP including the removed PCC Rules.
At reception of a RAR that removes one or several PCC Rules from an IP-CAN
Session restricted to emergency services the PCEF shall:
\- when all PCC Rules bound to an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer termination procedure as defined in clause 4.5.8.
\- when not all PCC Rule bound an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer modification procedure as defined in clause 4.5.2 and clause
4.5.5.1.
In addition, the PCEF shall initiate an inactivity timer if all PCC Rules with
a QCI other than the default bearer QCI or the QCI used for IMS signalling
were removed from the IP-CAN session restricted to Emergency Services. When
the inactivity timer expires the PCEF shall initiate an IP-CAN session
termination procedure as defined in clause 4.5.7.
##### 4.5.15.2.4 Removal of PCC Rules at Gx session termination
The reception of a request to terminate the IP-CAN session restricted to IMS
Emergency session shall trigger the termination of the Gx session for IMS
Emergency session as defined in clause 4.5.7.
### 4.5.16 Requesting Usage Monitoring Control
The PCRF may indicate, via the Gx reference point, the need to apply
monitoring control for the accumulated usage of network resources on an IP-CAN
session basis. Usage is defined as volume or time of user plane traffic.
Monitoring for traffic volume and traffic time can be performed in parallel.
The data collection for usage monitoring control shall be performed per
monitoring key, which may apply for a single service data flow, a set of
service data flows or for all the traffic in an IP-CAN session. If the usage
monitoring of an IP-CAN session level is enabled, the PCRF may request the
PCEF to exclude a single service data flow or a set of service data flows from
the usage monitoring of IP-CAN session level.
If the PCRF requests usage monitoring control and if at this time, the PCRF is
not subscribed to the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger, the PCRF shall include
the Event-Trigger AVP, set to the value \"USAGE_REPORT\", in a CC-Answer or
RA-Request. The PCRF shall not remove the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger AVP
while usage monitoring is still active in the PCEF.
At IP-CAN session establishment and modification, the PCRF may provide the
applicable thresholds, volume threshold, time threshold or both volume
threshold and time threshold, for usage monitoring control to the PCEF,
together with the respective monitoring keys. To provide the initial threshold
for one or more monitoring key(s), the PCRF may include the threshold in
either RA-Request or in the response of a CC-Request initiated by the PCEF.
During the IP-CAN session establishment, the PCRF may receive information
about total allowed usage per PDN and UE from the SPR, i.e. the overall amount
of allowed traffic volume and/or time of usage that are to be monitored per
PDN and UE and/or total allowed usage for Monitoring key(s) per PDN and UE.
NOTE: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in
this Release.
In order to provide the applicable threshold for usage monitoring control, the
PCRF shall include a Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key. The
threshold level shall be provided in its Granted-Service-Unit AVP. Threshold
levels may be defined for:
\- the total volume only; or
\- the uplink volume only; or
\- the downlink volume only; or
\- the uplink and downlink volume; or
\- the time.
The PCRF shall provide the applicable volume threshold(s) in the CC-Total-
Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs and/or time threshold in the
CC-Time AVP of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP. The monitoring key shall be
provided in the Monitoring-Key AVP. The PCRF may provide multiple usage
monitoring control instances. The PCRF shall indicate if the usage monitoring
instance applies to the IP-CAN session or to one or more PCC rules. For this
purpose, the Usage-Monitoring-Level AVP may be provided with a value
respectively set to SESSION_LEVEL or PCC_RULE_LEVEL. The PCRF may provide one
usage monitoring control instance applicable at IP-CAN session level and one
or more usage monitoring instances applicable at PCC Rule level. If the IP-CAN
level usage monitoring is enabled and if the service data flow(s) need to be
excluded from IP-CAN session level usage monitoring, the PCRF shall provide an
indication of exclusion from session level monitoring associated with the
respective PCC rule(s) by including the Monitoring-Flags AVP with the bit 0
set in the corresponding Charging-Rule-Install AVP when the PCRF installs or
updates the PCC rule(s). If the exclusion is enabled, the PCRF may disable the
exclusion again by including the Monitoring-Flags AVP with the bit 0 not set
in the corresponding Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
The PCRF may provide a Monitoring-Time AVP to the PCEF for the monitoring
keys(s) in order to receive reports for the accumulated usage before and after
the monitoring time occurs within the report triggered by the events defined
in 4.5.17.1-4.5.17.5. In such a case, there may be two instances of Granted-
Service-Unit AVP within Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key.
One of them indicates the threshold levels before the monitoring time occurs,
and the other one, which includes Monitoring-Time AVP, indicates the
subsequent threshold levels after the monitoring time occurs. The detailed
functionality in such a case is defined by 4.5.17.6.
If the PCRF wishes to modify the threshold level for one or more monitoring
keys, the PCRF shall provide the thresholds for all the different levels
applicable to the corresponding monitoring key(s).
If the PCRF wishes to modify the monitoring key for the session level usage
monitoring instance, it shall disable the existing session level monitoring
usage instance following the procedures defined in 4.5.17.3 and shall provide
a new session level usage monitoring instance following the procedures defined
in this clause. The PCRF may enable the new session level usage monitoring
instance and disable the existing session level usage monitoring instance in
the same command.
When the accumulated usage is reported in a CCR command, the PCRF shall
indicate to the PCEF if usage monitoring shall continue for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as follows:
\- If monitoring shall continue for specific level(s), the PCRF shall provide
the new thresholds for the level(s) in the CC-Answer using the same AVP as
before (CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets, CC-Output-Octets AVP or CC-Time AVP
within the Granted-Service-Unit AVP);
\- otherwise, if the PCRF wishes to stop monitoring for specific level(s) the
PCRF shall not include an updated threshold in the CCA command for the stopped
level(s) i.e. the corresponding CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets, CC-Output-
Octets or CC-Time AVPs shall not be included within Granted-Service-Units AVP.
If both volume and time thresholds were provided and the threshold for one of
the measurements is reached, the PCEF shall report this event to the PCRF and
the accumulated usage since last report shall be reported for both
measurements.
When usage monitoring is enabled, the PCRF may request the PCEF to report
accumulated usage for one or more enabled monitoring keys regardless if a
usage threshold has been reached by sending to the PCEF within the Usage-
Monitoring-Information AVP the Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to the value
USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED. The PCRF shall only require PCEF to report
accumulated usage for one or more monitoring keys in a CC-Answer when the PCEF
has not provided accumulated usage in the CC-Request for the same monitoring
key(s).
To specify the usage monitoring key for which usage is requested the PCRF
shall include the usage monitoring key within the Monitoring-Key AVP within
the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. To request usage be reported for all
enabled usage monitoring keys the PCRF shall omit the Monitoring-Key.
The PCRF shall process the usage reports and shall perform the actions as
appropriate for each report.
Refer to subclause 4.5.25.2.9 for usage monitoring control support for NBIFOM.
### 4.5.17 Reporting Accumulated Usage
#### 4.5.17.0 General
When usage monitoring is enabled, the PCEF shall measure the volume and/or the
time of usage of the IP-CAN session or the volume and/or the time of usage of
the applicable service data flows. The PCEF shall be able to support volume
and time measurements simultaneously for a given IP-CAN session or service
data flows. If the PCC rule is installed or updated with the Monitoring-Flags
AVP with the bit 0 set, the PCEF shall not include the corresponding service
data flow in the volume and/or time measurement on IP-CAN session level.
When the time based usage monitoring is supported, the PCRF may optionally
indicate to the PCEF, along with other usage monitoring information provided,
the Inactivity Detection Time within the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP. This
value represents the time interval after which the time measurement shall stop
for the Monitoring Key, if no packets are received belonging to the
corresponding Monitoring Key. Time measurement shall resume again on receipt
of a further packet belonging to the Monitoring Key.
Time measurement for a Monitoring key shall also be stopped when time based
usage monitoring is disabled, if this happens before the Inactivity Detection
Time is reached.
If an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity
Detection Time is present within the usage monitoring information provided by
the PCRF, the time measurement shall be performed continuously from the point
at the first packet is received matching the applicable Monitoring Key and
until time based usage monitoring is disabled.
The PCEF shall report accumulated usage to the PCRF in the following
conditions:
\- when a usage threshold is reached;
\- when all PCC rules for which usage monitoring is enabled for a particular
usage monitoring key are removed or deactivated;
\- when usage monitoring is explicitly disabled by the PCRF;
\- when an IP-CAN session is terminated;
\- when requested by the PCRF.
To report accumulated usage for a specific monitoring key the PCEF shall send
a CC-Request with the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
accumulated usage since the last report. For each of the enabled monitoring
keys to be reported, the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP shall include the
monitoring key in the Monitoring-Key AVP and the accumulated volume usage in
the Used-Service-Unit AVP. Accumulated volume reporting shall be done for the
total volume, the uplink volume or the downlink volume as requested by the
PCRF, and set in CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs of
Used-Service-Unit AVP respectively. Accumulated time reporting shall be set in
the CC-Time AVP of Used-Service-Unit AVP. The PCEF shall continue to perform
volume and/or time measurement after the report until instructed by the PCRF
to stop the monitoring. If both volume and time measurements are requested by
the PCRF and the threshold for one of the measurements is reached, the PCEF
shall report this event to the PCRF and the accumulated usage since last
report shall be reported for both measurements.
In case a Monitoring-Time AVP was provided by the PCRF within one instance of
the Granted-Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information
AVP for the usage monitoring control request, the PCEF shall report as defined
in 4.5.17.6.
For cases where the PCRF indicates in a CC-Answer command whether the usage
monitoring shall continue as a response to the reporting of accumulated usage
in a CCR command, the PCEF shall behave as follows
\- if the PCRF provisions an updated usage threshold in the CCA command, the
monitoring continues using the updated threshold value provisioned by the
PCRF;
\- otherwise, if the PCRF does not include an updated usage threshold in the
CCA command, the PCEF shall not continue usage monitoring for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as applicable.
NOTE: When the PCRF indicates that usage monitoring shall not continue in the
CCA, the PCEF does not report usage which has accumulated between sending the
CCR and receiving the CCA.
Upon receiving the reported usage from the PCEF, the PCRF shall deduct the
value of the usage report from the total allowed usage for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as applicable, and the PCRF may also
derive the PCC rules based on the remaining allowed usage or reported usage
and provision them to the PCEF.
Additional procedures for each of the scenarios above are described in the
following clauses of 4.5.17.
#### 4.5.17.1 Usage Threshold Reached
When usage monitoring is enabled for a particular monitoring key, the PCEF
shall measure the volume and/or the time of usage of all traffic for the IP-
CAN session or the corresponding service data flows and notify the PCRF when a
usage threshold for that monitoring key is reached and report the accumulated
usage for that monitoring key and include the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger
in a CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\"
by following the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause
4.5.17.
#### 4.5.17.2 PCC Rule Removal
When the PCRF removes or deactivates the last PCC rule associated with a usage
monitoring key in an RAR or CCA command in response to a CCR command not
related to reporting usage for the same monitoring key, the PCEF shall send a
new CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\"
including the Event-Trigger set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report accumulated
usage for the usage monitoring key within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP
using the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause 4.5.17.
When the PCEF reports that the last PCC rule associated with a usage
monitoring key is inactive, the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage for
that monitoring key within the same CCR command if the Charging-Rule-Report
AVP was included in a CCR command; otherwise, if the Charging-Rule-Report AVP
was included in an RAA command, the PCEF shall send a new CCR command to
report accumulated usage for the usage monitoring key.
#### 4.5.17.3 Usage Monitoring Disabled
Once enabled, the PCRF may explicitly disable usage monitoring as a result of
receiving a CCR from the PCEF which is not related to reporting usage, other
external triggers (e.g., receiving an AF request, subscriber profile update),
or a PCRF internal trigger. When the PCRF disables usage monitoring, the PCEF
shall report the accumulated usage which has occurred while usage monitoring
was enabled since the last report.
To disable usage monitoring for a monitoring key, the PCRF shall send the
Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including only the applicable monitoring key
within the Monitoring-Key AVP and the Usage-Monitoring-Support AVP set to
USAGE_MONITORING_DISABLED.
When the PCRF disables usage monitoring in a RAR or CCA command, the PCEF
shall send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report
accumulated usage for the disabled usage monitoring key(s).
#### 4.5.17.4 IP-CAN Session Termination
At IP-CAN session termination the PCEF shall send the accumulated usage
information for all monitoring keys for which usage monitoring is enabled in
the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" using the procedures to report accumulated usage
defined in clause 4.5.17.
If all IP-CAN sessions of a user to the same APN are terminated, the PCRF may
store the remaining allowed usage, i.e. the information about the remaining
overall amount of resources, in the SPR.
#### 4.5.17.5 PCRF Requested Usage Report
When the PCEF receives the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to the value USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED,
the PCEF shall send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the
value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to
report accumulated usage for the monitoring key received in the Usage-
Monitoring-Information AVP using the procedures to report accumulated usage
defined in clause 4.5.17.1. If the volume threshold and time threshold were
provided, the PCEF shall report both the volume usage and time of usage. If
the Monitoring-Key AVP was omitted in the received Usage-Monitoring-
Information AVP, the PCEF shall send the accumulated usage for all the
monitoring keys that were enabled at the time the Usage-Monitoring-Information
was received.
#### 4.5.17.6 Report in case of Monitoring Time provided
If Monitoring-Time AVP was provided within one instance of the Granted-
Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP by the
PCRF, and if the PCEF needs to report the accumulated usage when one of the
events defined in subclauses 4.5.17.1-4.5.17.5 occurs before the monitoring
time, the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage as defined in subclauses
4.5.17.1-4.5.17.5 and the PCEF shall not retain the monitoring time;
otherwise,
\- If two instances of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP are provided by the
PCRF,then the PCEF shall, at the monitoring time, reset the usage threshold to
the value of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP with the Monitoring-Time AVP.
\- If only one instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP is provided by the
PCRF, then the PCEF shall, at the monitoring time, reset the usage threshold
to the remaining value of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP previously sent by the
PCRF (i.e. excluding the accumulated volume or time usage).
\- For both cases, the usage report from the PCEF shall include two instances
of the Used-Service-Unit AVP, one of them to indicate the usage before the
monitoring time and the other one accompanied by the Monitoring-Time AVP under
the same Used-Service-Unit AVP to indicate the usage after the monitoring
time.
When the PCRF receives the accumulated usage report in a CCR command, the PCRF
shall indicate to the PCEF if usage monitoring shall continue as defined in
clause 4.5.16. The PCRF may provide the Monitoring-Time AVP again within one
instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP if reports for the accumulated usage
before and after the provided monitoring time are required.
### 4.5.18 IMS Restoration Support
In order to support IMS Restoration procedures (refer to 3GPP TS 23.380 [33]),
PCRF needs to convey the AF address to the PCEF. In order to do so, in case AF
provisions information about the AF signalling flows between the UE and the
AF, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] Section 4.4.5a, the PCRF shall install
the corresponding dynamic PCC rules (if not installed before) by triggering a
RAR message. The PCRF shall provide the Charging-Rule-Install AVP including
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP(s). The Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall
include in the Flow-Information AVP the signalling flows between UE and the
AF. The Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall also include the AF-Signalling-
Protocol AVP set to the value corresponding to the signalling protocol used
between the UE and the AF.
The PCEF shall acknowledge the command by sending an RAA command to the PCRF
and shall initiate the corresponding bearer procedure if required. The PCEF
shall extract the AF address from the PCC rules and use it for the monitoring
procedure as defined for the different access types. See Annex A & B.
NOTE 1: The PCEF can use the extracted AF address from the PCC rule to check
if, the monitoring procedure has to be started for the corresponding AF.
In case AF de-provisions information about the AF signalling flows between the
UE and the AF, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] Section 4.4.5a, the PCRF
shall remove the corresponding dynamic PCC rules by triggering a RAR message.
The PCRF shall provide the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP including the
corresponding Charging-Rule-Name AVP(s).
The PCEF shall acknowledge the command by sending a RAA command to the PCRF.
NOTE 2: The PCEF can use the AF address associated with the removed rule to
check if it can stop monitoring the corresponding AF.
### 4.5.18a P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement Support
This clause is applicable when the PCRF-based P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement,
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.380 [33], is supported by both PCRF and PCEF.
If the PCRF receives a request for P-CSCF restoration from the P-CSCF as
defined in clause 4.4.7 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall send a Gx RAR
command including the PCSCF-Restoration-Indication AVP set to value 0
(PCSCF_RESTORATION) to the PCEF for the corresponding Gx session.
The PCEF shall acknowledge the RAR command by sending an RAA command to the
PCRF and shall initiate the corresponding bearer procedure for the IMS PDN
connection as defined in 3GPP TS 23.380 [33].
### 4.5.19 Multimedia Priority Support
#### 4.5.19.1 PCC Procedures for Multimedia Priority services over Gx
reference point
##### 4.5.19.1.1 Provisioning of PCC Rules for Multimedia Priority Services
The provision of PCC Rules corresponding to both MPS and non-MPS service shall
be performed as described in clause 4.5.2.0.
When the PCRF derives PCC Rules corresponding to MPS service, the ARP and QCI
shall be set as appropriate for the prioritized service, e.g. an IMS
Multimedia Priority Service.
When the PCRF derives PCC Rules corresponding to non-MPS service, the PCRF
shall generate the PCC Rules as per normal procedures. At the time the
Priority EPS Service is invoked (i.e.MPS EPS Priority and MPS Priority Level
are set), the PCRF shall upgrade the ARP and/or change QCI also for the PCC
Rules corresponding to non-MPS service. The PCRF shall change the ARP and/or
QCI modified for the Priority EPS Bearer service to an appropriate value
according to PCRF decision.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the PCRF shall check whether any of these parameters is
stored in the SPR: MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling
Priority. The PCRF shall derive the applicable PCC rules and default bearer
QoS based on that information. If the IMS Signalling Priority is set and the
Called-Station-Id AVP corresponds to an APN dedicated for IMS, the PCRF shall
assign an ARP corresponding to MPS for the default bearer and for the PCC
Rules corresponding to the IMS signalling bearer. If the Called-Station-Id AVP
does not correspond to an APN dedicated for IMS, the ARP shall be derived
without considering IMS Signalling Priority.
NOTE 1: Subscription data for MPS is provided to PCRF through the Sp reference
point.
Once the PCRF receives a notification of a change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority from the SPR, the PCRF shall
make the corresponding policy decisions (i.e. ARP and/or QCI change) and, if
applicable, shall initiate a RAR command to provision the modified data.
NOTE 2: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 3: The MPS Priority Level is one among other input data such as operator
policy for the PCRF to set the ARP.
Whenever one or more AF sessions of an MPS service are active within the same
PDN connection, the PCRF shall ensure that the ARP priority level of the
default bearer is at least as high as the highest ARP priority level used by
any authorized PCC rules belonging to an MPS service. If the ARP pre-emption
capability is enabled for any of the authorized PCC rules belonging to an MPS
service, the PCRF shall also enable the ARP pre-emption capability for the
default bearer.
NOTE 4: This ensures that services using dedicated bearers are not terminated
because of a default bearer with a lower ARP priority level or disabled ARP
pre-emption capability being dropped during mobility events.
NOTE 5: This PCRF capability does not cover interactions with services other
than MPS services.
##### 4.5.19.1.2 Invocation/Revocation of Priority EPS Bearer Services
When a Priority EPS Bearer Service is invoked, the PCRF shall
\- Derive the corresponding PCC Rules with the ARP and QCI set as appropriate
for a prioritized service.
\- Set the ARP of the default bearer as appropriate for a Priority EPS Bearer
Service under consideration of the requirement described in clause 4.5.19.1.1.
\- Set the QCI of the default bearer as appropriate for the Priority EPS
Bearer Service.
\- Set the ARP of PCC Rules installed before the activation of the Priority
EPS Bearer Service to the ARP as appropriate for the Priority EPS Bearer
Service under the consideration of the requirements described in clause
4.5.19.1.1.
\- Set the QCI of the PCC Rules installed before the activation of the
Priority EPS Bearer Service to the QCI as appropriate for the Priority EPS
Bearer Service if modification of the QCI of the PCC Rules is required.
When a Priority EPS Bearer Service is revoked, the PCRF shall
\- Delete the PCC Rules corresponding to the Priority EPS Bearer Service if
they were previously provided.
\- Set the ARP of the default bearer to the normal ARP under the consideration
of the requirements described in clause 4.5.19.1.1.
\- Set the QCI of the default bearer as appropriate for PCRF decision.
\- Set the ARP of all active PCC Rules as appropriate for the PCRF under the
consideration of the requirements described in clause 4.5.19.1.1.
\- Set the QCI to an appropriate value according to PCRF decision if
modification of the QCI of PCC Rules is required.
NOTE: The activation/deactivation of a Priority EPS Bearer Service requires
explicit invocation/revocation via SPR MPS user profile (MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level). An AF for MPS Priority Service can also be used to provide
Priority EPS Bearer Services using network-initiated resource allocation
procedures (via interaction with PCC) for originating accesses.
The PCRF shall provision the PCEF with the applicable PCC Rules upon Priority
EPS Bearer Service activation and deactivation as described in clause 4.5.2.0.
The provision of the QoS information applicable for the PCC Rules shall be
performed as described in clause 4.5.5.2. The provision of QoS information for
the default bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4.5.5.9.
##### 4.5.19.1.3 Invocation/Revocation of IMS Multimedia Priority Services
If the PCRF receives service information including an MPS session indication
and the service priority level from the P-CSCF or at reception of the
indication that IMS Signalling Priority is active for the IP-CAN session, the
PCRF shall under consideration of the requirements described in clause
4.5.19.1.1:
\- set the ARP of the default bearer as appropriate for the prioritized
service;
\- if required, set the ARP of all PCC rules assigned to the IMS signalling
bearer as appropriate for IMS Multimedia Priority Services;
\- derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the IMS Multimedia Priority Service
and set the ARP of these PCC Rules based on the information received over Rx.
If the PCRF detects that the P-CSCF released all the MPS session and the IMS
Signalling Priority has been deactivated for the IP-CAN session the PCRF shall
under consideration of the requirements described in clause 4.5.19.1.1:
\- delete the PCC Rules corresponding to the IMS Multimedia Priority Service;
\- set the ARP of the default bearer as appropriate for the IMS Multimedia
Priority set to inactive;
\- replace the ARP of all PCC Rules assigned to the IMS signalling bearer as
appropriate when the IMS Multimedia Priority is inactive.
The PCRF shall provision the PCEF with the applicable PCC Rules upon MPS
session initiation and release as described in clause 4.5.2.0. The provision
of the QoS information applicable for the PCC Rules shall be performed as
described in clause 4.5.5.2. The provision of QoS information for the default
bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4.5.5.9.
### 4.5.20 Sponsored Data Connectivity
Sponsored data connectivity may be performed for service data flows associated
with one or more PCC rules if the information about the sponsor, the
application service provider and optionally the threshold values are provided
by the AF and if the AF has not indicated to disable/not enable sponsored data
connectivity as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] subclauses 4.4.1 and 4.4.2.
The provisioning of sponsored data connectivity per PCC rule shall be
performed using the PCC rule provisioning procedure. The sponsor identity
shall be set using the Sponsor-Identity AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP of the PCC rule. The application service provider identity
shall be set using the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP within the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP of the PCC rule. Sponsor-Identity AVP and
Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP shall be included if the Reporting-
Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL.
When receiving the usage thresholds from the AF, the PCRF shall use the
sponsor identity to generate a monitoring key and request usage monitoring
control for the monitoring key by following the procedures specified in
subclauses 4.5.2.5 and 4.5.16.
When the AF disables sponsoring a service (See 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] subclause
4.4.2), the PCRF
\- may modify the PCC rules in order to set the Reporting-Level AVP to
SERVICE_IDENTIFIER_LEVEL or RATING_GROUP_LEVEL and not include the Sponsor-
Identity AVP and Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP if they were
included previously.
\- may modify the PCC rules to update the charging key.
NOTE 1: A specific charging key can be applied to the sponsored data
connectivity for online charging.
\- shall disable the usage monitoring for the sponsored data connectivity
according to subclause 4.5.17.3 if it was enabled previously. As a result,
PCRF gets the accumulated usage of the sponsored data connectivity.
NOTE 2: It depends on the implementation whether the solutions defined in
Annex F can be used to disable the usage monitoring.
### 4.5.21 PCRF Failure and Restoration
If the PCEF needs to send an IP-CAN session modification request towards a
PCRF which is known to have restarted since the IP-CAN session establishment,
the PCEF should not send the IP-CAN session modification request towards a
PCRF and the PCEF may tear down the associated PDN connection based on
operator policy, by initiating PDN connection deactivation procedure.
Emergency and eMPS sessions should not be torn down.
NOTE 1: This mechanism enables the clean up of PDN connections affected by the
PCRF failure and leads the UE to initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure for the same APN.
NOTE 2: The method the PCEF uses to determine that a PCRF has restarted is not
specified in this release.
### 4.5.22 Reporting Access Network Information
When the NetLoc feature is supported, if the AF requests the PCRF to report
the access network information and if the PCRF cannot determine that access
network information cannot be provided as described in subclause 4.4.6.7 of
3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall provide the requested access network
information indication (e.g. user location and/or user timezone information)
to the PCEF as follows:
\- If the PCRF is installing or modifying a PCC rule, the PCRF shall include
the Required-Access-Info AVP within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP of an
appropriate installed or modified PCC rule;
\- Otherwise, if the PCRF is removing PCC rules based on the AF requests, the
PCRF shall include the Required-Access-Info AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Remove AVP associated with the corresponding PCC rules being removed.
The PCRF shall also provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger
within Event-Trigger AVP (if this event trigger is not yet set).
For those PCC Rule(s) based on preliminary service information as described in
3GPP TS 29.214 [10] the PCRF may assign the QCI and ARP of the default bearer
to avoid signalling to the UE. These PCC Rules shall not include the Packet-
Filter-Usage AVP within the Flow-Information AVP included in the Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] provides further information about appropriate PCC
rules in subclause 6.2.1.0.
If the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, upon installation,
modification and removal of any PCC rule(s) with the Required-Access-Info AVP
in a Gx RAR command, and if the PCEF determines that the access network does
not support the access network information reporting based on the currently
used IP-CAN type or the RAT type and the value of AN-Trusted AVP, the PCEF
shall immediately inform the PCRF by including the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP
with the value of 0 (NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) in the RAA command.
Otherwise, the PCEF shall apply appropriate IP CAN specific procedures to
obtain this information. When the PCEF then receives access network
information through those IP CAN specific procedures, the PCEF shall provide
the required access network information to the PCRF as follows:
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was provided
to the PCEF, the PCEF shall provide the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP and the time when it was last known within User-
Location-Info-Time AVP (if available).
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was not
provided to the PCEF, the PCEF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP.
\- If the time zone was requested by the PCRF, the PCEF shall provide it
within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
NOTE 2: The PCEF does not support time zone reporting if the access network is
untrusted WLAN.
In addition, the PCEF shall provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event
trigger within Event-Trigger AVP. The kind of user location retrieved in the
access network is defined in the corresponding annex.
During bearer deactivation, when the NetLoc feature is supported, the PCEF
shall provide the access network information to the PCRF by including the user
location information within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if requested by
the PCRF and if provided to the PCEF), the information on when the UE was last
known to be in that location within User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if user
location information was requested by the PCRF and if the corresponding
information was provided to the PCEF), the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-
SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was requested by the PCRF
but it is not provided to the PCEF) and the timezone information within the
3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if requested by the PCRF and available).
During IP-CAN session termination procedure, the PCEF shall, if
ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, provide the access network
information to the PCRF by including the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if it was provided to the PCEF), the information
on when the UE was last known to be in that location within User-Location-
Info-Time AVP (if it was provided to the PCEF), the PLMN identifier within the
3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was not provided to
the PCEF) and the timezone information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if
available).
The PCEF shall not report any subsequent access network information updates
received from the IP-CAN without any previous provisioning or removal of
related PCC rules unless the associated IP-CAN bearer or connection has been
released.
### 4.5.23 Application Detection Information
The PCRF may instruct the PCEF to detect application (s) by providing the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP (s) with the corresponding parameters as follows:
the application to be detected is identified by the TDF-Application-Identifier
AVP, which is either provided under Charging-Rule-Definition AVP for dynamic
PCC Rules or pre-provisioned for the corresponding predefined PCC Rule, and in
such a case only Charging-Rule-Name/Charging-Rule-Base-Name is provided. If
the PCRF requires to be reported about when the application start/stop is
detected, it shall also subscribe to the APPLICATION_START and
APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers. The PCRF may also mute such a notification
about a specific detected application by providing Mute-Notification AVP
within the PCC Rule.
The PCEF applies the PCC rule to the whole IP-CAN session traffic for the
application detection and control. When the start or stop of the
application\'s traffic, identified by TDF-Application-Identifier, is detected,
if PCRF has previously subscribed to the APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP
Event-Triggers, unless a request to mute such a notification (Mute-
Notification AVP) is part of the corresponding PCC Rule, the PCEF shall report
the information regarding the detected application\'s traffic in the
Application-Detection-Information AVP in the CCR command even if the
application traffic is discarded due to enforcement actions of the PCC rule.
The corresponding TDF-Application-Identifier AVP shall be included under
Application-Detection-Information AVP. When the Event trigger indicates
APPLICATION_START, the Flow-Information AVP for the detected application may
be included under Application-Detection-Information AVP, if deducible. The
Flow-Information AVP, if present, shall contain the Flow-Description AVP and
Flow-Direction AVP. The TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier, which is
dynamically assigned by the PCEF in order to allow correlation of
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers to the specific Flow-
Information AVP, if service data flow descriptions are deducible, shall also
be provided when the Flow-Information AVP is included. Also, the corresponding
Event-Trigger (APPLICATION_START or APPLICATION_STOP) shall be provided to
PCRF. When the TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier is provided along with the
APPLICATION_START, it shall also be provided along with the corresponding
APPLICATION_STOP. The PCRF then may make policy decisions based on the
information received and send the corresponding updated PCC rules to the PCEF,
and corresponding QoS rules to the BBERF, if applicable.
When a PFD provisioned by the PFDF is removed/modified and the
removed/modified PFD was used to detect application traffic related to an
application identifier in a PCC Rule installed or activated for an IP-CAN
session, if the removed/modified PFD in PCEF results in that the stop of an
application or an application instance is not able to be detected, and if the
PCEF has reported the application start as described in this subclause to the
PCRF for the application or application instance represented by this PFD, the
PCEF shall report the application stop to the PCRF for the corresponding
application or the corresponding application instance.
NOTE: Multiple PFDs can be associated with the application identifier. When
the removed/modified PFD is the last one which is used to detect traffic
identified by TDF-Application-Identifier AVP, the PCEF reports application
stop.
### 4.5.24 Group Communication Service Support
If the PCRF receives service information for a prioritized GC session
including a GCSE session indication and service priority level from the GCSE
AS as described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [50], the PCRF shall:
\- Derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the Group Communication Service and
set the ARP (priority level, pre-emption capability and pre-emption
vulnerability) of these PCC Rules based on the information received over Rx
and operator policies.
\- Ensure that the ARP (priority level, pre-emption capability, pre-emption
vulnerability) of the default bearer is assigned a prioritized value.
\- If a dedicated bearer is established for GC1 signalling, ensure that the
ARP (priority level, pre-emption capability, pre-emption vulnerability) in all
the PCC/QoS rules that describe the GC1 signalling traffic is assigned a
prioritized value.
If the PCRF receives a request to change the service priority level for a
prioritized GC session from the GCSE AS, the PCRF shall modify the PCC Rules
corresponding to the Group Communication Service in order to set the ARP
(priority level, pre-emption capability and pre-emption vulnerability) of
these PCC Rules based on the information received over Rx.The PCRF shall
ensure that the ARP (priority level, pre-emption capability, pre-emption
vulnerability) of the default bearer is assigned the appropriate prioritized
value.
If the PCRF receives a request to terminate a prioritized GC session, the PCRF
shall remove the PCC Rules corresponding to the Group Communication Service.
If the PCRF detects that all prioritized GC sessions within the same IP-CAN
session are released, the PCRF shall set the ARP of the default bearer as
appropriate.
The PCRF shall provision the PCEF with the applicable PCC Rules upon GC
session initiation and release as described in clause 4.5.2.0. The provision
of the QoS information applicable for the PCC Rules shall be performed as
described in clause 4.5.5.2. The provision of QoS information for the default
bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4.5.5.9.
### 4.5.25 NBIFOM Support
#### 4.5.25.1 General
Clause 4.5.25 refers to Network Based IP Flow Mobility as described in 3GPP TS
23.161 [51].
##### 4.5.25.1.1 PCRF procedures
The PCRF takes the following decisions:
\- The PCRF shall decide whether NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session.
\- The PCRF shall decide which NBIFOM mode applies to the IP-CAN session as
defined in subcluase 5.4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.161 [51].
\- The PCRF shall decide the default NBIFOM access that applies to the IP-CAN
session.
\- In UE-initiated mode or in network-initiated mode when UE requested IP flow
mapping, the PCRF shall authorize the NBIFOM routing rules received from the
PCEF based on user subscription and operator\'s policy and determine the
allowed access type for the corresponding PCC rule(s) when the PCC rule(s) is
installed.
\- The PCRF shall determine the allowed access type for the PCC rule when the
PCC rule is installed in the Network-initiated mode.
\- In the network-initiated mode, the PCRF shall provide a NBIFOM routing rule
identifier to every packet filter included in a PCC rule.
\- In the UE-initiated IP flow mobility within a PDN connection procedure and
UE Requested IP Flow Mapping procedure, the PCRF shall map PCC rules one to
one with corresponding NBIFOM routing rules received from the PCEF.
\- In network-initiated mode, the PCRF shall decide whether RAN rule handling
applies to the IP-CAN session.
\- The PCRF may indicate to the PCEF that one access is removed from a
multiple access IP-CAN session.
\- The PCRF shall ensure that there is at least one PCC Rule that can be bound
to the default bearer of each access.
\- In the UE-initiated NBIFOM mode, if a new PCC rule is created due to the
request from the network (e.g. request from the AF or application detection
information from the PCEF/TDF), the PCRF determines that the new PCC rule
shall be bound to the default access for NBIFOM.
##### 4.5.25.1.2 PCEF procedures
The PCEF takes the following actions:
\- PCEF shall negotiate the support of NBIFOM and of the NBIFOM mode with the
PCRF when the UE requests PDN connectivity over the first access.
\- PCEF shall negotiate the support of NBIFOM and of the default access for
NBIFOM with the PCRF when the UE requests PDN connectivity over an additional
access.
\- PCEF shall negotiate the default access for NBIFOM with the PCRF when the
UE requests IP flow mobility in the UE-initiated mode.
NOTE: The negotiation of the default access in the UE-initiated IP flow
mobility procedure only happens when the single connection mode is used via
trusted WLAN access network.
\- PCEF shall derive the NBIFOM routing rules transferred via the Gx interface
based on the NBIFOM routing rules or IP flow mapping carried via the GTP
signalling.
\- For Network-initiated mode when a new NBIFOM routing rule carried in GTP
needs to be created by the PCEF due to a Network-initiated IP flow mobility
within a PDN connection request, the PCEF shall keep the mapping between the
NBIFOM routing rule identifier received in the PCC rule and the NBIFOM routing
rule identifier used in GTP signalling.
\- When a new NBIFOM routing rule over Gx interface is created by a UE-
requested IP Flow Mapping request to create a new IP flow mapping in Network-
initiated mode or UE-requested IP flow mobility in UE-initiated mode, the PCEF
shall assign the NBIFOM rule identifier to the new NBIFOM routing rule and
keep the mapping with the routing rule identifier used in GTP signalling.
\- When a new NBIFOM routing rule over Gx interface is created by a UE-
requested IP Flow Mapping request to modify an existing IP flow mapping in
Network-initiated mode, the PCEF shall include the NBIFOM routing rule
identifier assigned by the PCRF for the packet filter of the PCC rule
corresponding to the routing rule identifier received in GTP signalling in the
new NBIFOM routing rule.
\- In a multi access IP-CAN session, PCEF shall associate the PCC rules to the
allowed access within the IP-CAN session. The allowed access may be either
explicitly included in the PCC Rule or the default NBIFOM access for the
traffic on the IP-CAN session.
\- PCEF shall associate the PCC rules to an IP-CAN bearer within the allowed
access by performing the bearer binding.
\- PCEF shall derive the NBIFOM routing rules transferred via the GTP
signalling based on the received PCC rules from the PCRF in the Network-
initiated mode.
\- The PCEF may provide the user location information and RAT type for each
allowed access type to the PCRF.
\- The PCEF may provide the Access stratum information or access availability
information received via the GTP signalling to the PCRF.
\- Route the IP flow(s) by using the routing access information which is part
of the NBIFOM routing rules.
#### 4.5.25.2 NBIFOM impacts on PCC procedures over Gx
##### 4.5.25.2.1 IP-CAN session establishment
The PCC procedures over Gx reference point defined in clause 4.5.1 shall
apply. In addition, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF about the UE and network
support of NBIFOM within the NBIFOM-Support AVP with the value
NBIFOM_SUPPORTED (1) and the requested NBIFOM mode within the NBIFOM-Mode AVP
in the CCR command when the PCEF receives both data as defined in 3GPP TS
29.274 [22].
The PCRF shall take a policy decision on whether NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN
session. If the PCRF determines that NBIFOM does not apply to the IP-CAN
session, the PCRF shall set the NBIFOM-Support AVP to the value
NBIFOM_NOT_SUPPORTED (0); otherwise, the PCRF shall set the NBIFOM-Support AVP
to the value NBIFOM_SUPPORTED (1). When NBIFOM is supported, the PCRF shall
select the applicable NBIFOM mode for the IP-CAN session and include the value
within NBIFOM-Mode AVP.
The PCRF shall provide NBIFOM-Support AVP, NBIFOM-Mode AVP (if applicable) and
the support of RAN rule indication within the RAN-Rule-Support AVP if the
network supports the RAN rule indication in the CCA command.
##### 4.5.25.2.2 Addition of an access
When the PCEF receives both a handover request and an NBIFOM indication from
the UE as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], the PCEF shall send a CCR command to
the PCRF, to:
\- Notify the PCRF about the addition of an access to the IP-CAN session by
including the Event-Trigger AVP set to the value ADDITION_OF_ ACCESS and the
IP-CAN-Type AVP and the RAT-Type AVP set to the value of this access.
\- If the UE-initiated NBIFOM mode was selected at IP-CAN session
establishment the notification contains also the default NBIFOM access
selected by the UE by including the type of default access within the Default-
Access AVP.
\- Notify the PCRF with the NBIFOM routing rules if the PCEF received the
NBIFOM routing rule from the UE by including the NBIFOM routing rule within
the Routing-Rule-Install AVP if UE-initiated NBIFOM mode was selected at IP-
CAN session establishment.
The PCRF shall take following policy decisions and send the CCA command to the
PCEF:
\- The PCRF shall reject the addition of the access if the multi-access PDN
connection would correspond to an invalid combination of IP-CAN and RAT Types
or is not allowed by the subscription by including the result code set to
value DIAMETER_ERROR_NBIFOM_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5149).
NOTE: In this release of the specification the only allowed combination
corresponds to the UE using a 3GPP access and a WLAN access.
\- If the network-initiated NBIFOM mode was selected at IP-CAN session
establishment, the PCRF shall indicate the default NBIFOM access to the PCEF
by including the type of default access within the Default-Access AVP.
\- If the UE-initiated NBIFOM mode was selected at IP-CAN session
establishment, the PCRF shall verify whether the default NBIFOM access
provided by the UE complies with the subscription. The PCRF shall indicate the
default NBIFOM access by including the type of default access within the
Default-Access AVP.
\- In UE-initiated NBIFOM mode, the PCEF may notify the PCRF about the NBIFOM
routing rules. The PCRF may reject NBIFOM Routing Rules received from the UE
by including the Routing-Rule-Report AVP with the rejected NBIFOM routing rule
identifier within the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP and the Routing-Rule-
Failure-Code AVP set to the corresponding value. Otherwise the PCRF determines
the impacted PCC rules and provides or modifies these PCC rules by including
the PCC rules within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
##### 4.5.25.2.3 Removal of an access
###### 4.5.25.2.3.1 UE/PCEF-initiated removal of an access
When the PCEF is informed of the removal of an access of a multi access IP-CAN
session by the UE or if the PCEF detects a change in the support of NBIFOM due
to the inter PLMN mobility as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], the PCEF shall
send the CCR command to notify the PCRF about the removal of the access by
including:
\- the Event-Trigger AVP set to REMOVAL_OF_ ACCESS,
\- IP-CAN-Type AVP set to the values of this removed access,
\- the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the Charging-Rule-Name AVPs for the
affected PCC rules,
\- the PCC-Rule-Status AVP set to the value ACTIVE and
\- the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to the value NO_BEARER_BOUND, when the PCEF
is informed of the removal of an access of a multi access by the UE, or
\- the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to the value NO_NBIFOM_SUPPORT, when the PCEF
detects a change in the support of NBIFOM due to the inter PLMN mobility.
. When the PCRF receives the CCR command, the PCRF shall modify or remove the
affected PCC rules accordingly.
When the PCEF detects a change in the support of NBIFOM due to the inter PLMN
mobility and the PCRF modifies the PCC rules, the PCRF shall not include any
NBIFOM related AVPs.
###### 4.5.25.2.3.2 PCRF-initiated removal of an access
The PCRF may remove one access from a multi access IP-CAN session due to
change of operator policy or user subscriptions. In order to do so, PCRF shall
include the Removal-Of-Access AVP set to the value REMOVAL_OF_ACCESS (0) and
the IP-CAN-Type AVP set to the value of removed access in the CCA or RAR
command. The PCEF shall delete corresponding PCC rules automatically locally
and initiate the procedure to remove one access as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274
[22].
NOTE: The PCRF can also decide to trigger the removal of an access by updating
or removing all PCC rules that are bound to this access. The removal of all
PCC Rules bound to an access removes the access unless there are PCC Rules not
known to the PCRF defined in the PCEF for this particular access.
##### 4.5.25.2.4 Network-initiated IP flow mobility within a PDN connection
(Network-initiated NBIFOM mode)
When a multi access IP-CAN session has been set-up in Network-initiated mode,
the PCRF may at any time determine that flows should be moved from a source
access to a target access. In that case, the PCRF shall send a RAR or respond
with a CCA to the PCEF including Charging-Rule-Install AVP which includes the
updated PCC Rules within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP(s) with the new
allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the PCRF shall also assign
and include the NBIFOM routing rule identifier in the Routing-Rule-Identifier
AVP(s) within the Flow-Information AVP(s). The PCEF shall derive the NBIFOM
routing rules from the PCC rules and send them to the UE as defined 3GPP TS
29.274 [22].
The PCRF may also at any time determine that flows need to be
created/modified/deleted. In that case, the PCRF shall send a RAR or respond
with a CCA .\ For creation/modification the PCRF shall include within the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP the allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP
(if new or changed), the new/modified PCC Rules within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP(s) and the NBIFOM routing rule identifier in the Routing-Rule-
Identifier AVP within the Flow-Information AVP(s).
NOTE 1: If a PCC rule is intended to be bound to the default access, the
allowed access type can be omitted when the PCC rule is installed or modified.
The PCEF shall derive the NBIFOM routing rules from the PCC rules and send
them to the UE as defined 3GPP TS 29.274 [22] and keep the mapping between the
NBIFOM routing rule identifier provided by the PCRF and the routing filter
identifier of the corresponding NBIFOM routing rule in GTP.
Additionally, the PCEF shall perform the bearer binding in the access as
indicated by the allowed access of the PCC rule.
For deletion the PCRF shall include the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP with the
Charging-Rule-Name AVP(s) containing the identity of the PCC rule(s) to be
removed.
The UE may reject the NBIFOM routing rule provided by the PCRF due to local
radio conditions. In that case, the PCEF shall report the rejection to the
PCRF by including the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the Charging-Rule-
Identifier AVP and the Rule-Failure-Code set to the value according to the
cause received from the GTP as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
NOTE 2: The UE is not allowed to request modification or deletion of NBIFOM
routing filters initiated by the network. The UE can request to modify the
access type of NBIFOM routing rules initiated by the network.
##### 4.5.25.2.5 UE-initiated IP flow mobility within a PDN connection (UE-
initiated NBIFOM mode)
When the PCEF receives a decision from the UE to create/replace/delete NBIFOM
routing rules as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], the PCEF shall send a CCR
command to the PCRF including the Event-Trigger AVP set to
ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE. Additionally,
\- if the UE requested to create new NBIFOM routing rules, the PCEF shall
include the Routing-Rule-Install AVP with one or more Routing-Rule-Definition
AVPs containing the new NBIFOM routing rule in the CCR command.The PCEF shall
assign NBIFOM routing rule identifier value(s) for each received NBIFOM
routing rule identifier in GTP and include that in the Routing-Rule-Identifier
AVP(s) within the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP(s).
\- if the UE requested to modify existing NBIFOM routing rules, the PCEF shall
include the Routing-Rule-Install AVP with one or more Routing-Rule-Definition
AVPs containing updated NBIFOM routing rule(s). The PCEF shall include the
NBIFOM routing rule identifier(s) corresponding to each received NBIFOM
routing rule identifier in GTP in the Routing-Rule-IdentifierAVP(s) within the
Routing-Rule-Definition AVP(s).
\- if the UE requested to delete existing NBIFOM routing rules, the PCEF shall
include the Routing-Rule-Remove AVP(s) with the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP(s)
corresponding to each received NBIFOM routing rule identifier in GTP.
NOTE 1: If UE initiates a resource modification procedure to add a new packet
filter, modify an existing packet filter or delete an existing packet filter
which has the same packet filter as the packet filter of the NBIFOM routing
rule in the non-default access, the UE provides a corresponding NBIFOM routing
rule in the same request, the PCEF performs the procedure as defined in
subclause 4.5.1 in the same CCR command. The UE does not need to provide the
NBIFOM Routing rule in the same request if the UE wants to request the network
to allocate resources for one IP flow in the default access.
\- if the UE requested the default NBIFOM access, the PCEF shall indicate the
default NBIFOM access selected by the UE by including the type of default
access within the Default-Access AVP.
The PCRF may reject NBIFOM routing rules received from the UE by including the
Routing-Rule-Report AVP with the rejected NBIFOM routing rule identifier
within the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP and the Routing-Rule-Failure-Code AVP
set to the corresponding value in the CCA command. Otherwise the PCRF shall
behave as follows:
\- If the PCRF receives the Event-Trigger AVP set to
RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST in the same command as the UE-initiated IP flow
mobility procedure,
\- for creation of an NBIFOM routing rule, the PCRF shall derive a new PCC
rule as defined in sublcause 4.5.1 and determine the allowed access for the
PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM rule. The PCRF shall include the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the allowed access type within the IP-
CAN-Type AVPand the PCC rule within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the
CCA command,
\- for modification of an NBIFOM routing rule, the PCRF shall update the PCC
rule as defined in subclause 4.5.1 and determine the new allowed access type
of the corresponding PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM routing rule.
The PCRF shall include the Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the new
allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the PCC rule within the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA command,or
\- for deletion of an NBIFOM routing rule, the PCRF shall remove the
corresponding PCC rule and include the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP with Charging-
Rule-Name AVP containing the identity of the PCC rules to be removed in the
CCA command.
\- Otherwise,
\- for creation of an NBIFOM routing rule, the PCRF shall check if there is a
PCC Rule with a corresponding service data flow template installed in the
PCEF. If it is so, the PCRF shall determine the allowed access type for the
PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM routing rule; otherwise, the PCRF
shall derive a new PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM rule and local
policies, i.e. it will set the service data flow filter equal to the Routing
Filter, the precedence according to the precedence of received NBIFOM routing
rule, QoS parameter based on the local policy and the allowed access type
according to the NBIFOM routing rule. The PCRF shall include the Charging-
Rule-Install AVP containing the allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP
and the PCC rule within one Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA command,
\- for modification of an NBIFOM routing rule, the PCRF shall determine the
new allowed access type of the corresponding PCC rule according to the
received NBIFOM routing rule. The PCRF shall include the Charging-Rule-Install
AVP containing the new allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the
PCC rule within one Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA command, and/or
\- for deletion of an NBIFOM routing rule, if the PCC rule creation was
triggered by this NBIFOM routing rule. the PCRF shall remove the corresponding
PCC rule. The PCRF shall remove the corresponding PCC rule by including the
Charging-Rule-Remove AVP with the Charging-Rule-Name AVP containing the
identity of the PCC rules to be removed in the CCA command; otherwise, the
PCRF shall remove only the allowed access type for this PCC Rule. The PCRF
shall remove the allowed access type for the corresponding PCC rules by
including the Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing one PCC rule within
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and without the IP-CAN-Type AVP.
NOTE 2: If a PCC rule is intended to be bound to the default access, the
allowed access type can be omitted when the PCC rule is installed or modified.
\- If the UE requested the default NBIFOM access, the PCRF shall verify
whether the default NBIFOM access provided by the UE complies with the
subscription. The PCRF shall indicate the default NBIFOM access by including
the type of default access within the Default-Access AVP.
The PCEF shall respond to the UE by initiating the procedure as defined in
3GPP TS 29.274 [22] and perform the bearer binding in the access as indicated
by the allowed access of the PCC rule.
##### 4.5.25.2.6 UE Requested IP Flow Mapping (Network-initiated NBIFOM mode)
This procedure is only used in Network-initiated NBIFOM mode when the UE wants
to request the network to apply specific mappings of IP flows to an access as
defined 3GPP TS 23.161 [51].
When the PCEF receives a decision from the UE to create/modify/delete UE
Requested IP Flow Mapping as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], the PCEF shall
send a CCR command to the PCRF including the Event-Trigger AVP set to
ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE. Additionally,
\- if the UE requested to create a new UE Requested IP Flow Mapping, the PCEF
shall include the, Routing-Rule-Install AVP with one or more Routing-Rule-
Definition AVPs that containing the new and updated NBIFOM routing rule(s) in
the CCR command. The PCEF shall include a new assigned NBIFOM routing rule
identifier in the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP(s) within the Routing-Rule-
Definition AVP(s).
\- if the UE requested to modify a UE Requested IP Flow Mapping and there is
corresponding NBIFOM routing rule(s) over Gx interface, the PCEF shall include
the Routing-Rule-Install AVP with one or more Routing-Rule-Definition AVP(s)
containing the NBIFOM routing rule(s).The PCEF shall include NBIFOM routing
rule identifier(s) corresponding to the received NBIFOM routing rule
identifier(s) in GTP in the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP(s) within the Routing-
Rule-Definition AVP(s).
\- if the UE requested to modify a UE Requested IP Flow Mapping(s) for
changing the allowed access type and there is no corresponding NBIFOM routing
rule(s) over Gx interface, the PCEF shall include the Routing-Rule-Install AVP
with one or more Routing-Rule-Definition AVP(s) containing the NBIFOM routing
rule(s) with the IP-CAN-Type AVP containing the requested access type in the
IP Flow Mapping.The PCEF shall include NBIFOM routing rule identifier(s)
corresponding to the received NBIFOM routing rule identifier(s) in GTP in the
Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP(s) within the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP(s).
\- if the UE requested to remove a UE Requested IP Flow Mapping the PCEF shall
include NBIFOM routing rule identifier(s) corresponding to the received NBIFOM
routing rule identifier(s) in GTP in the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP(s) within
the Routing-Rule-Remove AVP.
NOTE 1: For the case when the PCEF receives a decision from the UE to create
UE Requested IP Flow Mapping no rule identifier(s) is provided by the UE. In
this case the rule identifier to be used in communication with the UE is
assigned by the PCEF.
NOTE 2: If UE initiates a resource modification procedure to add a new packet
filter,modify an existing packet filter or delete an existing packet filter
which has the same packet filter as the packet filter of the NBIFOM routing
rule in the non-default access, the UE provides a corresponding IP flow
mapping, the PCEF performs the procedure as defined in subclause 4.5.1 in the
same CCR command. The UE does not need to provide the IP flow mapping in the
same request if the UE wants to request the network to allocate resources for
one IP flow in the default access.
The PCRF may reject NBIFOM routing rules received from the PCEF by including
the NBIFOM-Routing-Rule-Report AVP with the rejected NBIFOM routing rule
identifier within the Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP and the Routing-Rule-
Failure-Code AVP set to the corresponding value in the CCA command.\ Otherwise
the PCRF shall behave as follows:
\- If the PCRF receives the Event-Trigger AVP set to
RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST in the same command as the UE-requested IP flow
mapping procedure,
\- and if creation of a new NBIFOM routing rule with NBIFOM routing rule
identifier provided by the PCEF is received, the PCRF shall derive a new PCC
rule as defined in sublcause 4.5.1 and determine the allowed access for the
PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM rule. The PCRF shall include the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the new allowed access type within the
IP-CAN-Type AVP and the new PCC rule within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP
in the CCA command.
\- and if modification of an existing NBIFOM routing rule with NBIFOM routing
rule identifier provided by the PCEF is received, the PCRF shall update the
PCC rule as defined in subclause 4.5.1 and determine the new allowed access
type of the corresponding PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM routing
rule. The PCRF shall include the Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the new
allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the PCC rule within
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA command, or
\- if removal of NBIFOM routing rule is received for an NBIFOM routing rule
with the NBIFOM routing rule identifier provided by the PCEF, the PCRF shall
remove the corresponding PCC rule by including the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP
with the Charging-Rule-Name AVP containing the identity of the PCC rule to be
removed in the CCA command.
\- Otherwise,
\- and if creation of new NBIFOM routing rule with NBIFOM routing rule
identifier provided by the PCEF is received, the PCRF shall check if there is
a PCC rule with a corresponding service data flow template installed in the
PCEF. If it is so, the PCRF shall determine the allowed access type for the
PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM routing rule; otherwise, the PCRF
shall derive a new PCC rule according to the received NBIFOM rule and local
policies, i.e. it will set a service data flow filter equal to the Routing
Filter, a precedence according to the precedence of NBIFOM routing rule, QoS
parameter based on the local policy and the allowed access type according to
the NBIFOM routing rule. The PCRF shall include the Charging-Rule-Install AVP
containing the new allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and new PCC
rule within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA command.
\- and if creation of a new NBIFOM routing rule or modification of an existing
NBIFOM routing rule with NBIFOM routing rule identifier provided by the PCRF
is received, the PCRF shall check whether only one packet filter exists in the
corresponding PCC rule, If so, the PCRF shall include the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP containing the new allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP
and updated PCC rule within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP;\ Otherwise, the
PCRF shall include one Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the existing
allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and updated PCC rule which
removes the packet filter identified by the NBIFOM routing rule identifier
within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and one Charging-Rule-Install AVP
containing the new allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the PCC
rule which includes the packet filter identified by the NBIFOM routing rule
identifier.
\- If modification of a existing NBIFOM routing rule with NBIFOM routing rule
identifier provided by the PCEF is received, the PCRF shall include the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the new allowed access type within the
IP-CAN-Type AVP and updated PCC rule within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP.
\- If removal of an NBIFOM routing rule is received for an NBIFOM routing rule
with the NBIFOM routing rule identifier provided by the PCEF, and if the PCC
rule creation was triggered by this NBIFOM routing rule. the PCRF shall remove
the corresponding PCC rule. The PCRF shall remove the corresponding PCC rule
by including the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP with the Charging-Rule-Name AVP
containing the identity of the PCC rule to be removed in the CCA command;
otherwise,the PCRF shall remove only the allowed access type for this PCC
Rule. The PCRF shall remove the allowed access type for the corresponding PCC
rules by including the Charging-Rule-Install AVP containing the PCC rule
within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and without the IP-CAN-Type AVP.
NOTE 3: In Network-initiated NBIFOM mode the PCRF can initiate a creation,
modification and/or deletion of additional PCC rules in the same response. If
the PCRF does that, the PCEF initiates additional IP-CAN specific procedures
to provide the NBIFOM routing rules derived from the additional PCC rules.
NOTE 4: If a PCC rule is intended to be bound to the default access, the
allowed access type can be omitted when the PCC rule is installed or modified.
The PCEF shall respond to the UE by initiating the procedure as defined in
3GPP TS 29.274 [22] and perform the bearer binding in the access as indicated
by the allowed access of the PCC rule.
##### 4.5.25.2.7 An access becomes not available/available again
When the PCEF receives an indication that an access becomes not available as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], PCEF shall send a CCR command to the PCRF
including the Event-Trigger AVP set to UNAVAILABLITY_OF_ ACCESS to the PCRF.
The access type information of the unavailable access shall be provided within
the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the reason causing the access to be unavailable shall
be provided within the Access-Availability-Change-Reason AVP in the same CCR
command. The PCRF may update or remove the PCC rule by sending a CCA command
including the Charging-Rule-Install AVP with one or more Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP containing the new allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type
AVP or by including the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP with one or more Charging-
Rule-Name AVP(s) containing the identity of the PCC rule(s) to be removed.
When the PCEF receives an indication that an access becomes available again as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], PCEF shall send a CCR command to the PCRF
including the Event-Trigger AVP set to AVAILABLITY_OF_ACCESS to the PCRF. The
access type information on available again access shall be provided within the
IP-CAN-Type AVP and the reason causing the access to be available again shall
be provided within the Access-Availability-Change-Reason AVP in the same CCR
command. The PCRF may update the PCC rule and send a CCA command including the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP with one or more Charging-Rule-Definition AVP
contains the new allowed access type within the IP-CAN-Type AVP.
NOTE: This procedure can be triggered by the procedure \"Access becomes
Unusable and Usable\" and by the procedure \"IP flow mobility triggered by
Access stratum indication\" defined in 3GPP TS 23.161 [51].
##### 4.5.25.2.8 Access Network Information Reporting
When the PCRF has received a request to report access network information from
the AF and PCC rules related with the AF request are bound to multiple
accesses, the PCRF should first select the PCC rule bound to the 3GPP access
to request the access network information. If the PCRF cannot get the access
network information from the 3GPP access side when the PCRF receives the
NetLoc-Access-Support AVP set to the value of 0 (NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED),
the PCRF may try to get the access network information from the non-3GPP side.
##### 4.5.25.2.9 Usage monitoring control
As described in subcause 4.5.16, during the IP-CAN session establishment, the
PCRF may receive information about total allowed usage for Monitoring key(s)
per PDN and UE from the SPR. In addition, if NBIFOM applies for an IP-CAN
session, the PCRF may receive an individual Monitoring key per access from the
SPR. The PCRF may include the corresponding monitoring key in the PCC rule and
calculate the threshold per access according to the information received from
the SPR.
NOTE: IP-CAN session level usage monitoring is not dependent on the access
used to carry a service data flow.
##### 4.5.25.2.10 UE resource request for a multi-access IP-CAN session
For the UE-initiated IP flow mobility in the UE-initaited NBIFOM mode, if the
PCEF receives the resource request and NBIFOM routing rule for the same packet
filter in the same request, the PCEF and the PCRF shall behave as defined in
subclause 4.5.25.2.5.
For the UE-requested IP flow mapping in the network-initiated NBIFOM mode, if
the PCEF receives the resource request and IP flow mapping request for the
same packet filter in the same request, the PCEF and the PCRF shall behave as
defined in subclause 4.5.25.2.6.If the PCEF only receives the resource request
from the default access, the PCEF shall perform the UE-initiated resource
modification procedure as defined in subclause 4.5.1. The PCRF shall derive a
new PCC rule as defined in subclause 4.5.1 and determine the default access as
the allowed access. The PCRF shall provide the PCC rule to the PCEF as defined
in subclause 4.5.25.2.5 or 4.5.25.2.6.
### 4.5.26 Detection and handling of late arriving requests
#### 4.5.26.1 General
This subclause is only applicable for the IP-CAN session establishment
procedure. The detection and handing of the late arriving requests are
optional for the PCEF and PCRF.
The support of the detection and handing of the late arriving requests by PCEF
and PCRF is optional. When supported, the PCEF and PCRF shall comply with the
procedures specified in this subclause 4.5.26.
The procedure specified in subclause 4.5.26.2 can be used and supported with
or without the procedure specified in subclause 4.5.26.3. The procedure
specified in subclause 4.5.26.3 shall only be used and supported in
conjunction with the procedure specified in subclause 4.5.26.2.
#### 4.5.26.2 Detection and handling of requests which collide with an
existing session context
The PCEF shall send the CC-Request to the PCRF which includes the origination
time stamp received from the originating entity (see subclause 13.2 of 3GPP TS
29.274 [22]), within the Origination-Time-Stamp AVP, if available.
Upon receiving a new CC-Request colliding with an existing IP-CAN session
context, for the same UE (i.e. the same Subscription-Id AVP) and the same APN
(i.e. the same Called-Station-Id AVP) and from a different PCEF (i.e.
different Origin-Host AVP), the PCRF shall accept the new CC-Request only if
it contains a more recent timestamp within the Origination-Time-Stamp AVP than
the origination timestamp stored for the existing IP-CAN session. If the PCRF
detects that the timestamp within the Origination-Time-Stamp AVP included in
the new CC-Request is less recent than the origination timestamp stored for
the existing IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall reject the new CC-Request by
setting the Experimental-Result-Code to
DIAMETER_ERROR_LATE_OVERLAPPING_REQUEST.
NOTE 1: When the PCRF accepts the new CC-Request that contains a more recent
timestamp within the Origination-Time-Stamp AVP than the origination timestamp
stored for the existing IP-CAN session, the PCRF locally deletes the existing
IP-CAN session context.
The PCRF shall accept a new CC-Request which collides with an existing IP-CAN
session context, for the same UE (i.e. the same Subscription-Id AVP) and the
same APN (i.e. the same Called-Station-Id AVP) and from a different PCEF (i.e.
different Origin-Host AVP), if the origination timestamp is not provided for
at least one of the IP-CAN sessions for the same UE and the same APN.
NOTE 2: It is implementation specific how the PCRF handles the existing IP-CAN
session context in this case.
#### 4.5.26.3 Detection and handling of requests which have timed out at the
originating entity
The PCEF shall send the CC-Request to the PCRF which includes the origination
time stamp and the Maximum Wait Time received from the originating entity (see
subclause 13.3 of 3GPP TS 29.274 [22]) within the Origination-Time-Stamp AVP
and the Maximun-Wait-Time AVP, if available.
Upon receiving a CC-Request which contains the origination time stamp within
Origination-Time-Stamp AVP and the maximum wait time within the Maximun-Wait-
Time AVP, the PCRF should check that the request has not already timed out at
the originating node. The PCRF may perform additional similar check before
sending the answer. The PCRF should reject the CC-Request that has timed out
by setting the Experimental-Result-Code to DIAMETER_ERROR_TIMED_OUT_REQUEST.
### 4.5.27 Resource reservation for services sharing priority
When the PCRF derives PCC Rules corresponding to a service related to an AF
that has indicated that priority sharing is allowed for that service over Rx
interface, it derives the corresponding PCC Rules according to current
procedures as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8], subclause 5.3. The PCRF may
additionally take the suggested pre-emption capability and vulnerability
values into account if they were provided by the AF when the PCRF determines
the ARP pre-emption capability and vulnerability. The ARP derived at this
point and the priority sharing indicator provided over Rx reference point (see
3GPP TS 29.214 [10] for further information) related to these derived PCC
Rules are stored for later use.
For PCC Rules related to the same IP-CAN session with the same assigned QCI
and with the priority sharing indicator enabled (see 3GPP TS 29.214 [10],
subclause 4.4.8), the PCRF shall rederive the ARP into a shared ARP for these
PCC Rules as follows:
\- The Priority Level shall be set to the lowest value (i.e. highest priority)
among the Priority Level values derived for the PCC rules that include the
priority sharing indicator;
\- The Pre-emption Capability shall be set to ENABLED if any of the original
derived PCC Rules have the Pre-emption-Capability value set to ENABLED.
\- The Pre-emption Vulnerability shall be set to ENABLED if all the original
derived PCC Rules have the Pre-emption Vulnerability value set to ENABLED.
NOTE 1: Having the same setting for the ARP parameter in the PCC Rules with
the priority sharing indicator set enables the usage of the same bearer.
Furthermore, a combined modification of the ARP parameter in the PCC rules
ensures that a bearer modification is triggered when a media flow with higher
service priority starts.
If the QCI and/or ARP related to any of the PCC Rules that share priority is
changed (e.g. based on local policies), the PCRF shall rederive the ARP for
the impacted PCC Rules following the same procedure as defined in this
subclause.
The PCRF shall provision the PCC Rules according to the rederived ARP
information as described in subclause 4.5.2.0.
If the PCRF receives a report that a PCC rule provisioning or modification
failed due to the resource reservation failure as defined in subclause 4.5.12
and if the PCRF supports the MCPTT-Preemption feature as defined in subclause
5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall check if pre-emption control
based on the pre-emption control information provided by the AF as defined in
subclause 4.4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] applies.
NOTE 2: The PCRF determines that pre-emption control applies based on the
presence of the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP received over Rx reference point
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] and operator policies.
If pre-emption control applies, the PCRF shall check the corresponding derived
PCC Rules (before applying priority sharing procedures). If the Pre-emption
Capability of the derived PCC Rule is disabled the PCRF shall notify that
resource allocation has failed for this PCC rule to the AF as defined in
subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]. Otherwise, if the Pre-emption
Capability of the derived PCC Rule is enabled, the PCRF shall perform the pre-
emption control as follows:
For all the active PCC rule(s) that applied priority sharing mechanism, the
PCRF shall identify the PCC Rules that have the Pre-emption Vulnerability
enabled. For those selected PCC Rule(s), the PCRF shall check the Priority
Level value.
\- If there is only one PCC Rule with the Priority Level value higher (i.e.
lower priority) than the derived Priority Level value of new or modified PCC
Rule, the PCRF shall remove this PCC rule. The PCRF shall retry the PCC rule
provisioning or modification procedure for the PCC rule that failed.
\- Otherwise, if there are more than one PCC Rule with the Priority Level
value higher (i.e. lower priority) than the derived Priority Level value of
new or modified PCC Rule, the PCRF shall remove the PCC Rule with the highest
Priority Level from the PCEF. The PCRF shall retry the PCC rule provisioning
or modification procedure for the PCC rule that failed; If more than one PCC
Rule have the same highest Priority Level, the PCRF shall check the Pre-
emption-Control-Info AVP received over Rx interface as defined in 3GPP TS
29.214 [10] and remove the PCC Rule that matches the condition.
\- Otherwise, if there is at least one PCC Rule with the same Priority Level
value than the derived Priority Level value of new or modified PCC Rule, the
PCRF shall check the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP received over Rx interface
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] for these PCC Rules and remove the PCC Rule
that matches the condition.
\- Otherwise, the PCRF shall notify that resource allocation has failed for
this PCC rule to the AF as defined in subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS
29.214 [10].
If there is no active PCC Rule with the Pre-emption Vulnerability enabled, the
PCRF shall notify that resource allocation has failed for this PCC rule to the
AF as defined in subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].
NOTE 3: If the PCRF receives a report that a PCC rule provisioning or
modification failed due to the resource reservation failure as defined in
subclause 4.5.12 and the PCRF does not support the MCPTT-Preemption feature as
defined in subclause 5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF can apply pre-
emption and remove active PCC rules from the PCEF and then retry the PCC rule
provisioning or modification procedure. Otherwise, the PCRF will notify it to
the AF as defined in subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]. How the
PCRF applies the pre-emption depends on the implementation.
### 4.5.28 Support for PCC rule versioning
The support of PCC rule versioning is optional. When the RuleVersioning
feature is supported, the PCEF and PCRF shall comply with the procedures
specified in this subclause.
If required by operator policies, the PCRF shall assign a content version for
each generated PCC rule and include the version within the Content-Version AVP
included within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP. Upon each PCC rule
modification, if the content version was assigned to a PCC rule, the PCRF
shall assign a new content version. In this case, all the content related to
that PCC rule shall be included. The content version is unique for the
lifetime of the PCC rule.
NOTE 1: The PCRF will include all the content of the PCC rule in each
modification of the PCC rule in order to ensure that the rule is installed
with the proper information regardless of the outcome of the bearer procedure
related to previous rule provisioning versions that are not reported yet.
NOTE 1a: The operation policies can take into account whether the AF provides
the related content version information over Rx reference point (see subclause
4.4.9 in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]).
Whenever the PCEF provides a PCC rule report for rules that were provisioned
with a content version, the PCEF shall include the Content-Version AVP(s) as
part of the Charging-Rule-Report AVP for those corresponding PCC rules. The
PCEF may include more than one Content-Version AVP for the same PCC Rule
within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP (e.g. The PCEF has combined multiple PCC
rule versions enforcement into one bearer operation). In this case, the PCC-
Rule-Status AVP shall indicate the final status of the PCC rule.
NOTE 2: The PCRF will use the content version to identify the PCC rule version
that failed or succeeded when multiple provisions of the same PCC rule occur
in a short period of time. If required by the AF, the PCRF will inform the AF
according to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], subclause 4.4.9 about the failure or success
for the media component version associated to the PCC rule version.
### 4.5.29 3GPP PS Data Off Support
When the 3GPP-PS-Data-Off feature is supported, the PCEF and PCRF shall comply
with the procedures specified in this subclause. This feature is used to
prevent downlink traffic and may prevent uplink traffic via 3GPP access except
for 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services when activated by the user. The list of
3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services shall be configured in the PCRF. If the
network supports the multiple IP-CAN types and the user is allowed to access
multiple access types, the PCRF shall subscribe the IP-CAN_CHANGE event
trigger to the PCEF in order to support this feature.
NOTE 1: The PCRF can be configured with a list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services per APN. The list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for an APN can
also be empty, or can allow for any service within that APN, according to
operator policy.
NOTE 2: For the PDN connection used for IMS services, the 3GPP Data Off Exempt
Services are enforced in the IMS domain as specified 3GPP TS 23.228 [31].
Policies configured in the PCRF need to ensure that IMS services are allowed
when the 3GPP Data Off status of the UE is set to \"activated\", e.g. by
treating any service within a well-known IMS APN as 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services.
If the PCEF is informed that the 3GPP PS Data Off status of the UE is set to
active for the IP-CAN session establishment, it shall set the 3GPP-PS-Data-
Off-Status AVP set to ACTIVE (0) within the initial CCR command.
If the PCRF receives that initial CCR command with a 3GPP-PS-Data-Off-Status
AVP set to ACTIVE (0) and the IP-CAN type of the IP-CAN session indicated as
\"3GPP-EPS\", the PCRF shall configure the PCEF to block any downlink and
optionally uplink IP flows not relating to a service within the list of 3GPP
PS Data Off Exempt Services, for instance by not installing any related
dynamic PCC rule(s) or by not activating related predefined PCC rule(s) such
as PCC rule(s) with wild-carded service data flow filters. The PCRF may also,
subject to its normal policies, provide the Charging-Rule-Install AVP to
install or activate PCC rule (s) for service(s) from the list of 3GPP PS Data
Off Exempt Services.
If the PCEF is informed that the 3GPP PS Data Off status of the UE changes,
the PCEF shall provide the 3GPP_PS_DATA_OFF_CHANGE event trigger within the
Event-Trigger AVP and the 3GPP-PS-Data-Off-Status AVP set to the value
indicated by the UE within a CCR command.
Upon receipt of a CCR with the 3GPP_PS_DATA_OFF_CHANGE , the IP-CAN_CHANGE,
or, (if the NBIFOM feature is supported) the ADDITION_OF_ACCESS, the
REMOVAL_OF_ACCESS, the UNAVAILABLITY_OF_ACCESS, or the AVAILABLITY_OF_ACCESS
value within the Event-Trigger AVP the PCRF shall determine whether the 3GPP
PS Data Off handling functionality (as described below) becomes active or
inactive. The 3GPP PS Data Off handling functionality is active if, and only
if,
\- the latest received 3GPP-PS-Data-Off-Status AVP is set to ACTIVE (0), and
NOTE 3: If the 3GPP_PS_DATA_OFF_CHANGE event trigger is received, the latest
received value is the one received in the CCR command. Otherwise it
corresponds to the stored value.
\- the UE uses an access with IP-CAN Type set to \"3GPP-EPS\".
NOTE 4: If NBIFOM supported feature applies the UE can uses additional
accesses.
If the PCRF determines that the 3GPP PS Data Off handling functionality
becomes active, the PCRF shall configure the PCEF in such a way that (if
NBIFON is active, only for the \"3GPP-EPS\" access type):
\- only packets for services belonging to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services are forwarded; and
\- all other downlink packets and optionally uplink packets are discarded by
modifying or removing any related dynamic PCC rule(s) or by deactivating any
related predefined PCC rule(s).
NOTE 5: In order for the PCEF to prevent the services that do not belong to
the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempted Services, if such services are
controlled by dynamic PCC rules, PCRF can either close gates for the downlink
and optionally the uplink direction via the Flow-Status AVP in related dynamic
PCC rules or remove those dynamic PCC rules. If the services are controlled by
predefined PCC rules, PCRF needs to deactivate those PCC rules. PCC rule(s)
with wild-carded service data flow filters can be among the PCC rules that are
modified. removed or disabled in that manner. It can then be necessary that
the PCRF at the same time installs or activates PCC rules for data-off exempt
services. The network configuration can ensure that at least one PCC Rule is
bound to the default bearer when Data Off is activated in order to avoid a
deletion of an existing PDN connection or in order to not fail a PDN
connection establishment.
When the PCRF receives service information from the AF while the 3GPP PS Data
Off handling functionality is active, the following applies:
\- If the corresponding IP-CAN session is active over only one access, the
PCRF shall check whether the corresponding service is a 3GPP PS Data Off
Exempt Service and permissible according to the userÂ´s subscription and the
policies of the PCRF. If so, the PCRF shall install, modify or delete
corresponding PCC rules. Otherwise, the PCRF shall reject the service
information from the AF.
\- If the corresponding IP-CAN session is active over multiple accesses, and
\- the corresponding service is a 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service and
permissible according to the userÂ´s subscription and the policies of the PCRF;
or
\- the corresponding service is no 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service but
according to the userÂ´s subscription and the policies of the PCRF it is
permissible and will not be routed via the IP-CAN Type \"3GPP-EPS\".
> \- then the PCRF shall install, modify or delete corresponding PCC rules.
> Otherwise, the PCRF shall reject the service information from the AF.
If the PCRF determines that the 3GPP PS Data Off handling functionality
becomes inactive, the PCRF shall perform policy control decision and perform
PCC rule operations to make sure that services are allowed according to the
user's subscription and operator policy (irrespective of whether they belong
to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services).
NOTE 6: The PCRF can then open gates via the Flow-Status AVP for active PCC
associated to services not within the list 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services.
The PCRF can also install PCC rules or activate predefined PCC rules for some
services not belonging to the list 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. If the
PCRF activates or installs a PCC rule with wildcarded filters, it can remove
or de-activate PCC rules for 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services that are made
redundant by this PCC rule.
### 4.5.30 Extended bandwidth support for EPC supporting Dual Connectivity
(E-UTRAN and 5G NR)
When the Extended-BW-NR feature is supported, extended bandwidth AVPs
representing bitrates in kbps shall be used to support bandwidth values higher
than 2\^32-1 bps instead of the bandwidth AVPs representing bitrates in bps.
That is:
\- Extended-Max-Requested-BW-DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of Max-
Requested-Bandwidth-DL/UL AVPs.
\- Extended-GBR-DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of Guaranteed-Bitrate-DL/UL
AVPs.
\- Extended-APNâ€‘AMBRâ€‘DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of APN-Aggregate-Max-
Bitrate-UL/DL AVPs.
For values lower or equal to 2\^32-1 bps AVPs representing bitrates in bps
shall be used.
When the IP-CAN session is being established, if the PCEF supports the
Extended-BW-NR feature and for bandwidth values higher than 2\^32-1 bps, AVPs
representing bitrate in bps (i.e. APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL/DL AVPs) shall
be provided with value set to 2\^32-1 bps and bandwidth AVPs representing
bitrate in kbps (i.e. Extended-APN-AMBR-UL/DL AVPs) shall be provided with the
actual required bandwidth.
NOTE: When the Diameter session is being established, the originator node does
not know yet the features supported by the peer node.
## 4.5.31 Policy update When UE suspends
When the UE-Status-Change feature is supported, the PCEF and the PCRF shall
comply with the procedures specified in this subclause. During IP-CAN session
establishment or modification procedure, the PCRF shall subscribe to the
\"UE_STATUS_RESUME\" Event-Trigger if not subscribed yet, in a CC-Answer or
RA-Request.
When the PCRF sends a RAR or CCA command with policy decisions for a PDN
connection maintained when the UE's status is suspend state, the PCEF shall
act as follows:
\- If the policy decisions were received in a RAR command, the PCEF shall send
an RAA command including,
\- the Experimental-Result-Code sets to DIAMETER_UE_STATUS_SUSPEND which
indicates the failure to enforce the corresponding policy decision, except if
the RAR command is initiated for the PCC rule removal only.
\- if the policy decision includes the installation of one or more PCC rules,
the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code AVP sets to
UE_STATUS_SUSPEND and with the PCC-Rule-Status sets to INACTIVE to indicate
the failure to enforce those PCC rules.
\- if the policy decision includes the modification of one or more PCC rules,
the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code AVP sets to
UE_STATUS_SUSPEND with the PCC-Rule-Status sets to ACTIVE to indicate the
failure to enforce those PCC rules.
\- If the PCRF sends a CCA including policy decisions, the PCEF shall send a
CCR command including,
\- if the policy decision is applicable for the session level, the event
trigger related with the failure to enforce the corresponding policy decision
and the UE-Status AVP sets to UE_STATUS_SUSPEND.
\- if the policy decision includes the installation of one or more PCC rules,
the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code AVP sets to
UE_STATUS_SUSPEND and with the PCC-Rule-Status sets to INACTIVE to indicate
the failure to enforce those policy decisions.
\- if the policy decision includes the modification of one or more PCC rules,
the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code AVP sets to
UE_STATUS_SUSPEND and with the PCC-Rule-Status set to ACTIVE to indicate the
failure to enforce those PCC rules.
Upon reception of the Rule-Failure-Code AVP sets to UE_STATUS_SUSPEND, the
Experimental-Result-Code sets to DIAMETER_UE_STATUS_SUSPEND or the UE-Status
AVP set to UE_STATUS_SUSPEND, the PCRF shall not initiate any IP-CAN Session
Modification procedure, except if it is initiated for the PCC rule removal
only, for the given IP-CAN session over Gx untill the UE's status is resumed.
If the UE's status is resumed from suspend state, the PCEF shall inform the
PCRF of the UE status including the Event-Trigger AVP sets to
\"UE_STATUS_RESUME\". The PCRF shall after this update the PCEF with PCC Rules
if necessary.

# 4a Gxx reference points
## 4a.1 Overview
The Gxx reference point is located between the Policy and Charging Rules
Function (PCRF) and the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF).
Gxc applies when the BBERF is located in the S-GW and Gxa applies when the
BBERF is located in a trusted non-3GPP access. The Gxx reference point is used
for:
\- Provisioning, update and removal of QoS rules from the PCRF to the BBERF
\- Transmission of traffic plane events from the BBERF to the PCRF.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Gxx reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [23].
Signalling flows related to Rx, Gx and Gxx interfaces are specified in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
Gxx reference point does not apply for 3GPP-GPRS Access Type.
The definition of case 1, case 2a and case 2b is specified in clause 4.0 in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the Gxx interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the Gxx interface.
Refer to Annex K of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter load control procedures
over the Gxx interface.
## 4a.2 Gxx Reference model
The Gxx reference point is defined between the PCRF and the BBERF. The BBERF
is located in the AN-Gateway. The AN-Gateway is the S-GW when Gxc applies and
it is the trusted non-3GPP access gateway when Gxa applies. The relationships
between the different functional entities involved are depicted in figure
4a.2.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in subclause 3a of 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].

## 4a.3 Quality of Service Control Rules
### 4a.3.1 Quality of Service Control Rule Definition
The purpose of the Quality of Service Control rule (QoS rule) for the BBERF is
to:
\- Detect a packet belonging to a service data flow.
\- The service data flow filters within the QoS rule are used for the
selection of downlink IP CAN bearers.
\- The service data flow filters within the QoS rule are used for the
enforcement that uplink IP flows are transported in the correct IP CAN bearer.
\- Identify the service the service data flow contributes to.
For an IP-CAN session, the QoS rules are derived from the PCC rules. The QoS
rule shall contain the same service data flow template, precedence and QoS
information as the corresponding PCC rule. For case 2a (as defined in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8]), the QoS rules that are derived from a PCC rule shall contain the
applicable tunnelling header information.
NOTE 1: During the course of a BBERF relocation procedure, the QoS rules in
the non-primary BBERF might not be consistent with the PCC rules in the PCEF.
For case 2a (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]) there can be also QoS rules
that do not apply to the IP-CAN session and that are local to the access
system, thus not having any corresponding PCC rule. These QoS rules shall not
have any associated tunnelling header information.
The BBERF shall select a QoS rule for each received packet by evaluating
received packets against in this order:
\- if present, the tunnelling header information
\- the service data flow filters of QoS rules, associated with the matching
tunnelling header information, in their order of the precedence.
\- service data flow filters of QoS rules not associated with any tunnelling
header info.
When a packet matches a service data flow filter, the packet matching process
for that packet is completed, and the QoS rule for that filter shall be
applied.
There are two different types of QoS rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]:
\- Dynamic Qos rules. Dynamically provisioned by the PCRF to the BBERF via the
Gxx interface. These QoS rules are dynamically generated in the PCRF according
to the corresponding PCC rules.
\- Predefined QoS rules. Preconfigured in the BBERF. Predefined QoS rules can
be activated or deactivated by the PCRF along with the corresponding
predefined PCC rules. Predefined QoS rules within the BBERF may be grouped
allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of QoS rules over the Gxx
reference point.
NOTE 2: The mechanism for configuring pre-defined QoS rules at the BBERF and
PCRF and corresponding pre-defined PCC rules at the PCEF and PCRF are outside
the scope of this specification.
A QoS rule consists of:
\- a rule name;
\- service data flow filter(s);
\- precedence;
\- QoS parameters.
The rule name shall be used to reference a QoS rule in the communication
between the BBERF and the PCRF.
The service data flow filter(s) shall be used to select the traffic for which
the rule applies.
The QoS information includes the QoS class identifier (authorized QoS class
for the service data flow), the ARP and authorized bitrates for uplink and
downlink.
For different QoS rules with overlapping service data flow filter, the
precedence of the rule determines which of these rules is applicable. When a
dynamic QoS rule and a predefined QoS rule have the same precedence, the
dynamic QoS rule takes precedence.
### 4a.3.2 Operations on QoS Rules
For dynamic QoS rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: to provision a QoS rule that has not been already
provisioned.
\- Modification: to modify a QoS rule already installed.
\- Removal: to remove a QoS rule already installed.
For predefined QoS rules, the following operations are available:
\- Activation: to allow the QoS rule being active.
\- Deactivation: to disallow the QoS rule.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4a.5.2.
## 4a.4 Functional elements
### 4a.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF has been already specified in clause 4.4.1. Particularities for the
Gxx reference point are specified in this clause.
The PCRF shall provision QoS Rules to the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
The PCRF shall provide QoS rules with identical service data flow templates as
provided to the PCEF in the PCC rules. If the service data flow is tunnelled
at the BBERF, the PCRF shall provide the BBERF with mobility protocol
tunnelling header information received from the PCEF to enable the service
data flow detection in the mobility tunnel at the BBERF.
If IP flow mobility applies, the PCRF shall, based on IP flow mobility routing
rules received from the PCEF, provide the authorized QoS rules to the
applicable BBERF.
The PCRF QoS Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- Information obtained from the AF via the Rx reference point, e.g. the
session, media and subscriber related information.
\- Information obtained from the PCEF via the Gx reference point, e.g. IP-CAN
bearer attributes, request type, subscriber related information and IP flow
mobility routing rules (if IP flow mobility is supported).
\- Information obtained from the SPR via the Sp reference point, e.g.
subscriber and service related data.
\- Information obtained from the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
The PCRF shall inform the BBERF through the use of QoS rules on the treatment
of each service data flow that is under PCC control, in accordance with the
PCRF policy decision(s).
Upon subscription to loss of AF signalling bearer notifications by the AF, the
PCRF shall request to BBERF to be notified of the loss of resources associated
to the QoS Rules corresponding with AF Signalling IP Flows, if this has not
been requested previously to the BBERF. In this case, PCRF will not subscribe
to this event in the PCEF.
The PCRF shall, based on information reported from BBERF and PCEF, determine
the Gx session(s) that shall be linked with a Gateway Control session.
### 4a.4.2 BBERF
The BBERF (Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function) is a functional
element located in the S-GW when Gxc applies and in a trusted non-3GPP access
when Gxa applies. It provides control over the user plane traffic handling and
encompasses the following functionalities:
\- Bearer binding: For a service data flow that is under QoS control, the
Bearer Binding Function (BBF) within BBERF shall ensure that the service data
flow is carried over the bearer with the appropriate QoS class. The ARP, GBR,
MBR and QCI are used by the BBERF in the same way as in the PCEF for resource
reservation.
\- Uplink bearer binding verification.
\- Event reporting: The BBERF shall report events to the PCRF based on the
event triggers installed by the PCRF.
\- Service data flow detection for tunnelled and untunnelled SDFs: The BBERF
uses service data flow filters received from the PCRF for service data flow
detection.
\- Service data flow detection for tunnelled SDFs: For the selection of the
service data flow filters to apply the BBERF shall use a match with the
tunnelling associated tunnelling header information received from the PCRF as
a prerequisite.
If requested by the PCRF, the BBERF shall report to the PCRF when the status
of the related service data flow changes.
If requested by the PCRF, a BBERF, which supports policy provisioning and
enforcement of authorized QoS for service data flows that share resources,
shall:
\- For QoS rules bound to the same bearer perform resource sharing among QoS
rules marked for resource sharing.
## 4a.5 PCC procedures over Gxx reference points
### 4a.5.1 Gateway control and QoS Rules Request
The BBERF shall indicate, via the Gxx reference point, a request for QoS rules
in the following instances:
1) At Gateway Control Session Establishment:
The BBERF shall send a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". The CCR command shall include the IMSI within the
Subscription-Id AVP and the access network gateway address within the AN-GW-
Address AVP. If available and applicable, the BBERF shall supply one or more
of the following additional parameters to allow the PCRF to identify the rules
to be applied : the type of IP-CAN within the IP-CAN-Type AVP, the type of the
radio access technology within the RAT-Type AVP, the PDN information within
the Called-Station-Id AVP, the PDN connection identifier within the PDN-
Connection-ID AVP, if multiple PDN connections for the same APN are supported,
the PLMN id within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP, the UE Ipv4 address within the
Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or the UE Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix
AVP, information about the user equipment within User-Equipment-Info AVP, QoS
information within QoS-Information-AVP, user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP or 3GPP2-BSID AVP, the access network gateway
address, and the UE time zone information within 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
Furthermore, if applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF may indicate the
support of network-initiated bearer request procedures by supplying the
Network-Request-Support AVP. The BBERF shall also send the APN-AMBR if
available using the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL/UL AVPs or both the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL/UL AVPs and the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL/UL AVPs (see
subclause 4a.5.19).
For case 2b, the BBERF may provide the Session-Linking-Indicator AVP to
indicate whether the PCRF shall perform the linking of the new Gateway Control
Session with an existing Gx session immediately or not.
For IP-CAN types that support multiple IP-CAN bearers, the BBERF may provide
the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the ARP and QCI values corresponding
to the Default EPS Bearer QoS.
2) At Gateway Control Session Modification:
The BBERF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\". For a Gateway Control and QoS Rules request where an
existing IP-CAN resource is modified, the BBERF shall supply within the QoS
rule request the specific event which caused such request (within the Event-
Trigger AVP) and any previously provisioned QoS rule(s) affected by the
gateway control and QoS Rules request. The affected QoS Rules and their status
shall be supplied to the PCRF within the QoS-Rule-Report AVP.
In the case that the UE initiates a resource modification procedure, the BBERF
shall include within the CC-Request the Event-Trigger AVP set to
\"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\" and shall include the Packet-Filter-
Operation AVP set as follows:
\- When the UE requests to allocate new resources the BBERF shall set the
Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"ADDITION\", and shall include within the CC-
Request a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter requested by
the UE and the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the
affected packet filters. Each Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include the
packet filter precedence information within the Precedence AVP and the Packet-
Filter-Content AVP set to the value of the packet filter provided by the UE.
If the UE has specified a reference to an existing packet filter, the BBERF
shall include an additional Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the
Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP, set to the value for the referred existing
filter. If the QoS rule is generated for a GBR QCI, the PCRF shall update the
existing QoS rule by adding the new packet filter(s).
\- When the UE requests to modify existing resources the BBERF shall set the
Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include within the
CC-Request a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each affected packet filter. A
packet filter is affected by the modification if QoS associated with it is
modified or if its filter value or precedence is modified. If the UE request
includes modified QoS information the BBERF shall also include the QoS-
Information AVP within the CC-Request to indicate the updated QoS for the
affected packet filters. Each Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include a
packet filter identifier as provided by the PCRF in the QoS rule within the
Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP identifying the previously requested packet
filter being modified and, if the precedence value is changed, shall include
packet filter precedence information within the Precedence AVP. For each
packet filter that the UE has requested to modify the filter value (if any),
the BBERF shall provide the Packet-Filter-Content AVP set to the value of the
updated packet filter provided by the UE.
\- When the UE requests to delete resources the BBERF shall set the Packet-
Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\", and shall include within the CC-Request
a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter deleted by the UE. Each
Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include a packet filter identifier as
provided by the PCRF within the QoS rule within the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP identifying the previously requested packet filter being deleted. If the
deletion of the packet filters changes the QoS associated with the resource,
the BBERF shall include the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the QoS associated
with the deleted packet filters to allow the PCRF to modify the QoS
accordingly.
QoS rules can also be requested as a consequence of a failure in the QoS rule
installation or enforcement without requiring an Event-Trigger. See clause
4a.5.4.
If the PCRF is, due to incomplete, erroneous or missing information (e.g.
subscription related information not available or authorized QoS exceeding the
subscribed bandwidth) not able to provision a policy decision as response to
the request for QoS Rules by the BBERF, the PCRF may reject the request using
a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140). If the BBERF receives a CC Answer
with this code, the BBERF shall reject the access network specific request
that has resulted in this gateway control and QoS Rules request.
If the PCRF detects that the packet filters in the request for new QoS rules
by the BBERF is covered by the packet filters of outstanding PCC/QoS rules
that the PCRF is provisioning to the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF may reject the
request using a CC-Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFLICTING_REQUEST (5147). If the BBERF receives a CC-Answer
with this code, the BBERF shall reject the modification that initiated the CC-
Request.
### 4a.5.2 Gateway control and QoS Rules Provision
#### 4a.5.2.1 Overview
The PCRF may decide to operate on QoS Rules without obtaining a request from
the BBERF, e.g. in response to information provided to the PCRF via the Rx
reference point, or in response to an internal trigger within the PCRF, or
from a trigger by the SPR. To operate on QoS Rules without a request from the
BBERF, the PCRF shall include these QoS Rules in an RA-Request message within
either the QoS-Rule-Install AVP or the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP.
The BBERF shall reply with an RA-Answer. If the corresponding IP-CAN resource
cannot be established or modified to satisfy the bearer binding, then the
BBERF shall reject the activation of a QoS rule using the Gxx experimental
result code DIAMETER_BEARER_EVENT (4142) and a proper Event-Trigger value.
Depending on the cause, the PCRF can decide if re-installation, modification,
removal of QoS Rules or any other action apply.
The PCRF shall indicate, via the Gxx reference point, QoS rules to be applied
at the BBERF. This may be using one of the following procedures:
\- PULL procedure (Provisioning solicited by the BBERF): In response to a
request for QoS rules being made by the BBERF, as described in the preceding
section, the PCRF shall provision QoS rules in the CC-Answer; or
\- PUSH procedure (Unsolicited provisioning): The PCRF may decide to provision
QoS rules without obtaining a request from the BBERF, e.g. in response to
information provided to the PCRF via the Rx reference point, or in response to
an internal trigger within the PCRF, or from a trigger by the SPR. To
provision QoS rules without a request from the BBERF, the PCRF shall include
these QoS rules in an RA-Request message. The PCRF should NOT send a new RA-
Request command to the PCEF until the previous RA-Request has been
acknowledged for the same IP-CAN session.
For each request from the BBERF or upon the unsolicited provision the PCRF
shall provision zero or more QoS rules. The PCRF may perform an operation on a
single QoS rule by one of the following means:
\- To activate or deactivate a QoS rule that is predefined at the BBERF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this QoS rule within a QoS-Rule-Name AVP
and indicate the required action by choosing either the QoS-Rule-Install AVP
or the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned QoS rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding QoS-Rule-Definition AVP within a QoS-Rule-Install AVP.
\- To remove a QoS rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF, the
PCRF shall provision the name of this rule as value of a QoS-Rule-Name AVP
within a QoS-Rule-Remove AVP.
As an alternative to providing a single QoS rule, the PCRF may provide a QoS-
Rule-Base-Name AVP within a QoS-Rule-Install AVP or the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP as
a reference to a group of QoS rules predefined at the BBERF. With a QoS-Rule-
Install AVP, a predefined group of QoS rules is activated or moved. With a
QoS-Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of QoS rules is deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above QoS rule operations in a single CC-
Answer command or RA-Request command.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined QoS rule, the
QoS-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If a QoS rule with the same rule name,
as supplied in the QoS-Rule-Name AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP,
already exists at the BBERF, the new QoS rule shall update the currently
installed rule. If the existing QoS rule already has attributes also included
in the new QoS rule definition, the existing attributes shall be overwritten.
Any attribute in the existing QoS rule not included in the new QoS rule
definition shall remain valid.
If no QoS rule(s) with uplink packet filters that are provided to the UE that
are bound to a bearer which requires traffic mapping information (according to
the rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]), the BBERF shall derive traffic
mapping information based on implementation specific logic (e.g. traffic
mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in
uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]) and
shall provide it to the UE.
NOTE 1: For GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.060 [17], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one
bearer with no traffic mapping information for the uplink direction.
NOTE 2: For a default bearer, the BBERF will not add traffic mapping
information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink
direction on its own.
Upon the same modification of the QCI and/or ARP of all the QoS rules bound to
the same bearer, the BBERF should modify the QCI and/or ARP for that bearer.
Provisioning of predefined QoS rules upon invocation/revocation of an MPS
service shall be done according to clause 5.3 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
In case 2a, if the PCRF has received the access network charging identifier
information within Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP from the PCEF,
the PCRF shall include the Accessâ€‘Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP within
the QoS-Rule-Install AVP to inform the BBERF about the charging identifier
information for the related QoS rules. The charging identifier information is
used by the BBERF for charging correlation.
The PCRF may request the BBERF to confirm that the resources associated to a
QoS rule are successfully allocated. To do so the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (22). In
addition the PCRF shall install the rules that need resource allocation
confirmation by including the Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP with the
value ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0) within the corresponding Charging-Rule-Install
AVP. If a Charging-Rule-Install AVP does not include the Resource-Allocation-
Notification AVP, the resource allocation shall not be notified by the BBERF
even if this AVP was present in previous installations of the same rule.
NOTE 3: The BBERF reporting the successful installation of QoS rules using RAA
command means that the QoS rules are installed but the bearer binding or QoS
resource reservation may not yet be completed, see 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]. The
BBERF informs the PCRF about the successful resource reservation only if the
PCRF has provided the Event-Trigger AVP indicating
SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (22).
If the provisioning of QoS rules fails or provisioning of QoS rules succeed
and then QoS resource reservation failed, the BBERF informs the PCRF as
described in clause 4a.5.4 QoS Rule Error Handling. Depending on the cause,
PCRF can decide if re-installation, modification, removal of QoS rules or any
other action apply.
If the PCRF is unable to create a QoS rule for the response to the CC Request
by the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the request as described in clause 4a5.1.
#### 4a.5.2.2 Support for DSCP marking of downlink packets at the TDF
In order to support QoS control in the downlink direction by the BBERF for an
application detected and marked by the TDF as specified in clause 4b.5.14, the
PCRF may either install a corresponding dynamic QoS Rule or activate a pre-
defined QoS rule, which identifies traffic based on the corresponding DSCP
value (provided by the ToS-Traffic Class AVP within the Flow-Information AVP).
NOTE: This solution is particularly useful for QoS enforcement in the downlink
direction procedures performed by the BBERF. The TDF may still perform
application detection and control as per received ADC Rules, including
application detection reporting to the PCRF, enforcement control, usage
monitoring control and charging, while applying DSCP marking. The BBERF may
also perform then QoS control in the downlink direction.
### 4a.5.3 Gateway Control Session Termination
The BBERF shall contact the PCRF when the gateway control session is being
terminated (e.g. detach). The BBERF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-
Type AVP set to the value \"TERMINATION_REQUEST\".
If the BBERF needs to send a Gateway Control Session termination request
towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the Gateway Control
Session establishment, the BBERF should not send CC-Request to inform the
PCRF.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the BBERF.
### 4a.5.4 Request of Gateway Control Session Termination
The PCRF may request the termination of a gateway control session.
If the PCRF decides to terminate a gateway control session due to an internal
trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall send an RAR command including
the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the BBERF. When the BBERF receives the RAR
Command, it shall acknowledge the command by sending an RAA command to the
PCRF and instantly remove/deactivate all the QoS rules that have been
previously installed or activated on that gateway control session. And then
the BBERF shall apply the gateway control session termination procedure in
clause 4a.5.3.
### 4a.5.5 QoS Control Rule error handling
The same error handling behaviour as defined in clause 4.5.12 shall apply for
QoS control rules. However, QoS-Rule-Report AVP shall be used to report the
affected QoS rules instead of Charging-Rule-Report AVP.
### 4a.5.6 Gateway Control session to Gx session linking
For the cases where Gxx is deployed in the network, the PCRF shall determine
at IP-CAN session establishment, which open Gateway Control session applies to
the new established IP-CAN session.
If the already established Gateway Control session for that subscriber is not
related with a PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP was not received
at Gateway Control Session Establishment), the PCRF shall determine that the
IP-CAN session being established corresponds to that Gateway Control Session
if the following conditions are fulfilled:
\- The CoA-IP-Address AVP received in the IP-CAN session establishment matches
the Framed-IP-Address or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix received during the Gateway
Control Session Establishment and
\- Optionally, the Subscription-Id AVP received in the IP-CAN session
establishment matches the Subscription-Id AVP received during the Gateway
Control Session Establishment
In this case, the PCRF may have more than one IP-CAN Gx session linked to the
Gateway Control session.
When the PCRF checks if APNs within Called-Station-Id AVPs match each other,
the PCRF shall apply the APN matching procedures in Annex H of 3GPP TS 29.213
[8].
If the already established Gateway Control session for that subscriber is
related with a PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP was received
during the Gateway Control Session Establishment), the PCRF shall determine
that the IP-CAN session being established corresponds to that Gateway Control
Session if the following conditions are fulfilled:
\- The Called-Station-Id AVP received in the IP-CAN session establishment
matches the Called-Station-Id AVP received during the Gateway Control Session
Establishment and
\- The Subscription-Id AVP received in the IP-CAN session establishment
matches the Subscription-Id AVP received during the Gateway Control Session
Establishment and
\- If received, the PDN-Connection-ID AVP received in the IP-CAN session
establishment matches the PDN-Connection-ID AVP received during the Gateway
Control Session Establishment.
In this case, the PCRF shall have only one IP-CAN Gx session linked to the
Gateway Control session.
Upon reception of a Gateway Control Session Establishment where there are
already active Gx sessions for that UE in the PCRF (i.e. BBERF relocation,
BBERF pre-registration and flow mobility), the PCRF may be able to determine
the Gx session(s) that apply to the new established Gateway Control session as
follows:
\- If the new Gateway Control session for that subscriber is not related with
a PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP was not received at Gateway
Control Session Establishment), the PCRF shall determine the Gx session(s)
that correspond to that Gateway Control Session upon reception of IP-CAN
session modification. In this case, the same conditions as for the IP-CAN
session establishment need to be fulfilled.
\- If the new Gateway Control session for that subscriber is related with a
PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP is received) the PCRF shall
check the Session-Linking-Indicator AVP. If it is not received, or it
indicates SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE the PCRF shall determine the Gx session
that corresponds to the Gateway Control Session as follows:
If multiple PDN connections for the same APN are not supported:
\- The Called-Station-Id AVP is received in the Gateway Control Session
Establishment and it matches the APN of the Gx session and
\- The Subscription-Id AVP received in the Gateway Control Session
Establishment matches the Subscription-Id for the IP-CAN session(s) and
\- If received, the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP
included in the Gateway Control Session Establishment matches the Framed-IP-
Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, of the Gx session. If both Framed-
IP-Address AVP and Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are present in the Gateway Control
Session Establishment, both of them also need to be present in the Gx session.
NOTE: The Subscription-Id AVP used for the session linking may be in the form
IMSI or IMSI based NAI as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [25].
If multiple PDN connections for the same APN are supported:
\- If the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are received
during the Gateway Control Session Establishment, the PCRF links the Gateway
Control Session to the existing Gx session where Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are equal and the PDN ID are matched.
\- If the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are not received
during the Gateway Control Session Establishment, the PCRF has to defer the
linking with existing Gx session until an IP-CAN Session modification is
received with matching UE Identity, PDN Connection ID, and PDN ID.
In this case, the PCRF shall link the Gateway Control Session to the Gx
session.
When the Session-Linking-Indicator AVP is received and indicates
SESSION_LINKING_DEFERRED, the PCRF shall keep the new Gateway Control Session
pending and shall defer linking until an IP-CAN Session Establishment or
Modification is received including the Subscription-Id AVP, Called-Station-Id
AVP and IP-CAN-Type AVP with the same values as those received during the
Gateway Control Session establishment.
### 4a.5.7 Multiple BBF support
#### 4a.5.7.1 General
After the PCRF has linked the new established Gateway Control session with the
active Gx session as specified in clause 4a.5.6, if the PCRF receives the
indication of IP flow mobility applying (e.g. ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE (37) event
trigger) from the active Gx session, then the clause 4a.5.7.3 will apply,
otherwise the clause 4a.5.7.2 will apply.
#### 4a.5.7.2 Handling of two BBFs associated with the same IP-CAN session
during handover
This procedure takes place during the handover situations where one or more
BBF can be part of a pre-registration procedure. The two BBFs can be located
in two separate BBERFs, or one BBF is located in the PCEF and the other one in
a BBERF.
The PCRF, based on IP-CAN type information received from the BBERF and PCEF,
shall identify the BBERF as primary or non-primary.
Upon receiving a Gateway Control Session Establishment request from a new
BBERF and if the PCRF identifies multiple Gateway Control sessions involved
for a particular IP-CAN session (i.e. multiple BBERF connections during
handovers) the PCRF shall carry out the following procedures:
\- The PCRF shall identify the Gateway Control session that reported the same
IP-CAN type as reported by PCEF and classify the BBERF that initiated that
Gateway Control session as \"primary\".
\- In the case where more that one Gateway Control sessions reported the same
IP-CAN type as reported by PCEF the PCRF shall classify the BBERF that
initiated the last Gateway Control session as \"primary\".
\- The remaining BBERF connections shall be classified by the PCRF as \"non-
primary\".
Additionally, the PCRF may update the PCC rules, derive corresponding QoS
rules and provide the updated QoS rules to the new BBERF to accommodate the
capabilities of the target access network (e.g. based on RAT and IP-CAN
types).
During the Gateway Control and QoS Rule Request, the PCRF shall act as follows
with regards to the Gxx reference point:
\- In the response to a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\", if the BCM selected by the PCRF for that BBERF
(primary/non-primary) indicates UE_NW, the PCRF shall provision the applicable
active QoS rules for the linked IP-CAN session in the QoS-Rule-Install AVP in
the CC-Answer command. In the case of non-primary BBERF, only those that do
not require any modification for the active PCC rules will be provided.
\- In the response of a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", if the BCM selected by the PCRF for that BBERF
(primary/non-primary) that initiated the Gateway Control session indicates
UE_ONLY, the PCRF shall only include QoS rules applicable to the default
bearer in the CC-Answer command.
\- In the response to a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" initiated by a BBERF that the PCRF has classified as non-
primary, indicating UE-initiated resource modification request as described in
clause 4a.5.1, the PCRF shall create the QoS rules based on the traffic
mapping information received in the request and check whether there are
aligned PCC rules installed in the PCEF. If the aligned PCC rules active in
the PCEF require no modification, the PCRF shall provision the QoS rules
within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP to the non-primary BBERF that created the
request. Otherwise, the PCRF shall reject the request using the Gxx
experimental result code DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144).
\- In the response to a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" initiated by a BBERF including any other event trigger
within the Event-Trigger AVP, the PCRF shall provision/modify/remove the
applicable QoS rules in the CC-Answer command when the BBERF is selected as
primary. Otherwise, only QoS rules with aligned active PCC rules will be
provided.
NOTE: The PCRF operates on the PCC rules towards the PCEF when the CCR command
was received from a primary BBERF.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" initiated by a BBERF, the PCRF shall apply the
procedure described in clause 4a.5.3.
For unsolicited provisioning of QoS rules, the PCRF shall provision the
applicable QoS rules (those that are Nw-init) to those BBERFs where the Bearer
Control Mode is UE_NW.
For the case where the primary BBERF rejects the installation of one or more
QoS rule(s) in a RA-Answer command, the PCRF shall remove the impacted QoS
rules from all the non-primary BBERFs in a RAR message including the removed
QoS rules in the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP. If a non-primary BBERF rejects the
installation of one or more QoS rules the PCRF shall not take any action
towards the PCEF and BBERFs regarding the rejected rules.
If a primary BBERF reported the failure in a new CC-Request command, the PCRF
shall remove the impacted QoS rules in the CC-Answer command and shall
initiate a RA-Request command towards all the non-primary BBERFs including the
removed QoS rules in the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP. If the BBERF that reported the
failure is a non-primary BBERF, the PCRF shall acknowledge the Diameter CCR
with a CCA command and shall not take further action towards the PCEF and
BBERFs regarding the failed rules.
Upon reception of a CCR command over the Gx interface indicating
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" with Event-Trigger AVP value indicating IP-CAN_CHANGE and
AN_GW_CHANGE, the PCRF shall reclassify the BBERFs based on the classification
procedures described above. After re-classification of the BBERFs, the PCRF
shall perform necessary update to the QoS rules in the new primary BBERF based
on the status of the PCC rules and the Bearer Control Mode supported.
When the PCEF subscribes to events by using the Event-Report-Indication AVP,
the PCRF shall provision those events only in the primary BBERF.
#### 4a.5.7.3 Handling of multiple BBFs with flow mobility within IP-CAN
session
This procedure takes place during S2c-based flow mobility situations where
more than one BBF exist within the same IP-CAN session. The multiple BBFs can
be located in separate BBERFs, or one BBF is located in the PCEF and the other
one in separate BBERFs.
For flow mobility within IP-CAN session, the PCRF does not differentiate
between primary and non-primary BBFs. Based on the IP flow mobility routing
rule information received from the PCEF, the PCRF may associate the default
route with one of the BBFs. The default route is identified by the IP flow
mobility routing rule containing a wild card routing filter.
Upon an IP-CAN Session Establishment or IP-CAN Session Modification that
includes one or more Routingâ€‘Rule- Definition AVP(s), the PCRF shall store the
IP flow mobility routing rule information.
Upon an IP-CAN Session Modification that includes one or more Routing-Rule-
Definition AVP(s), the PCRF shall check whether there are service data flow(s)
for active PCC Rules that can be associated with one BBF based on the routing
information by comparing the Flow-Information AVP of the PCC Rules with the
Routing-Filter AVP of the Routingâ€‘Ruleâ€‘Definition AVP. If they match, the PCRF
determines that the bearer binding for a service data flow is located in a BBF
comparing the Routing-IP-address AVP contained in the IP flow mobility routing
rule against the Framed-IP-Address/Framed-Ipv6-Prefix and CoA-IP-Address
received during the IP-CAN session establishment/modification. The matching IP
address will identify the BBF to be used for the related service data flows.
When the BBF corresponds to a BBERF, the PCRF shall, if required, create the
QoS rules, and provide the QoS rules to the identified BBERF.
If the PCRF creates new PCC Rules or modifies the Flow-Information AVP of an
existing one (e.g. as a consequence of an AF interaction, or Bearer Resource
Modification Request), the PCRF shall check if the new service data flow
information matches any of the IP flow mobility routing rule information. If
they match, the PCRF determines that the bearer binding for a service data
flow is located in a BBF comparing the Routing-IP-address AVP contained in the
IP flow mobility routing rule against the Framed-IP-Address/Framed-Ipv6-Prefix
and CoA-IP-Address received during the IP-CAN session
establishment/modification. The matching IP address will identify the BBF to
be used for the related service data flows. If the PCRF determines that the
bearer binding for a service data flow is located in the BBERF, the PCRF
shall, if required, create the QoS rules, and provide the QoS rules to the
identified BBERF.
NOTE: For IP flow mobility, the address/prefix contained in the CoA-IP-Address
AVP identifies the BBERF set up for case 2a; the address/prefix contained in
the Framed-IP-Address or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP identifies the BBF located in
the PCEF or in the BBERF of the 3GPP access.
The PCRF may select different bearer control mode for different BBFs based on
the procedures described in clause 4.5.10 for PCEF and clause 4a.5.9 for
BBERF. Provision of PCC/QoS rules to a specific BBF follows the rule provision
procedures based on the bearer control mode selected for that BBF.
When the route of a service data flow changes from one source BBF to another
target BBF, the PCRF shall:
\- if the source BBF is located in a BBERF, remove the QoS rules related to
the service data flow from the source BBERF following the Gateway control and
QoS rules provision procedures described in clause 4a.5.2;
\- if the target BBF is located in a BBERF, and the BCM is NW_UE, provision
the QoS rules related to the service data flow to the target BBERF following
the Gateway control and QoS rules provision procedures described in clause
4a.5.2.
The PCRF supporting IFOM that has received an IP-CAN type associated to an
established IP-CAN session, upon reception of an IP-CAN type AVP from a PCEF
as part of an IP-CAN session modification procedure, if the IP-CAN type is
different from the one stored for that IP-CAN session and the IP-CAN session
modification contains the ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE event trigger, shall associate
the new received IP CAN type to the IP-CAN session (i.e. multiple IP-CAN types
are associated to the IP-CAN session).
### 4a.5.8 Provisioning of Event Triggers
The PCRF may provide one or several event triggers within one or several
Event-Trigger AVP to the BBERF using the Gateway Control and QoS rule
provision procedure. Event triggers may be used to determine which specific
event causes the BBERF to re-request QoS rules. Provisioning of event triggers
will be done at Gateway Control session level. The Event-Trigger AVP may be
provided either in combination with the initial or subsequent QoS rule
provisioning.
The PCEF may request the PCRF to be informed about specific changes occurred
in the access network as indicated in clause 4.5.11. In this case, the PCRF
shall additionally subscribe to the corresponding event triggers at the BBERF.
The PCRF may add new event triggers or remove the already provided ones at
each request from the BBERF or upon the unsolicited provision from the PCRF.
In order to do so, the PCRF shall provide the new complete list of applicable
event triggers related to the Gateway Control session including the needed
provisioned Event-Trigger AVPs in the CCA or RAR commands.
The BBERF shall include the initial information related to the event trigger
that has been provisioned in the Event-Trigger AVP in the response to the
Gateway Control and QoS rule provisioning procedure. The initial information
related to the event trigger is included within a RAA command.
The PCRF may remove all previously provided event triggers by providing the
Event-Trigger AVP set to the value NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS. When an Event-Trigger
AVP is provided with this value, no other Event-Trigger AVP shall be provided
in the CCA or RAR command. Upon reception of an Event-Trigger AVP with this
value, the BBERF shall not inform PCRF of any event that requires to be
provisioned from the PCRF except for those events that are always reported and
do not require provisioning from the PCRF.
If no Event-Trigger AVP is included in a CCA or RAR operation, any previously
provisioned event trigger will be still applicable.
### 4a.5.9 Bearer Control Mode Selection
When bearer binding is performed at the BBERF, the BBERF may indicate, via the
Gxx reference point, a request for Bearer Control Mode (BCM) selection at
Gateway Control session establishment. It will be done using the Gateway
Control and QoS rule request procedure.
When applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF shall supply at Gateway Control
Session Establishment, if information about the support of network initiated
procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support AVP in the CC-Request
with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". The Network-
Request-Support AVP indicates the access network support of the network
requested bearer control.
The PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. If the selected bearer control mode is UE_NW,
the PCRF shall decide what mode (UE or NW) shall apply for every QoS rule.
NOTE: For operator-controlled services, the UE and the PCRF may be provisioned
with information indicating which mode is to be used.
If the BBERF provided the Network-Request-Support AVP, the PCRF shall provide
the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP to the BBERF using the Gateway Control
and QoS Rules provision procedure at Gateway Control session establishment.
The selected value will be applicable for the whole Gateway Control session.
When the bearer binding function is changed from the PCEF to the BBERF, the
BBERF may indicate, via the Gxx reference point, a request for Bearer Control
Mode (BCM) selection at Gateway Control Session Establishment as described
above.
In multiple BBERFs case, each BBERF may indicate a request for Bearer Control
Mode selection independently and the BCM selected for each BBERF may be
different.
### 4a.5.10 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
#### 4a.5.10.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS for the Default EPS Bearer
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS for the default EPS bearer. The
authorized QoS may be obtained upon interaction with the SPR.
The default EPS bearer QoS information shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA
command level using the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the QoS-Class-
Identifier AVP and the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP. The provided QoS-
Class-Identifier AVP shall include a non-GBR corresponding value.
#### 4a.5.10.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS of the Default EPS Bearer
The BBERF may receive the authorized QoS for the default bearer over Gxx
interface. The BBERF enforces it which may lead to the change of the
subscribed default EPS Bearer QoS.
#### 4a.5.10.3 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS per APN as part of the Gateway
Control and QoS rules provision procedure.
The authorized QoS per APN may be modified at Gateway Control session
establishment and also at Gateway Control session modification. To do so, the
PCRF shall provision the authorized QoS per APN for each IP-CAN session for
that APN.
The authorized QoS per APN shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA command level
using the QoS-Information AVP including the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP
and/or the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP, or the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL AVP
and/or the Extended-APN-AMBR-UL AVP (see subclause 4a.5.19). When APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP and/or the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP or
the Extended-APN-AMBR-DL AVP and/or the Extended-APN-AMBR-UL AVP (see
subclause 4a.5.19) are provided, the Max-Requested-Bandwidth values, and the
Guaranteed Bitrate values shall not be included.
NOTE: The QoS per APN limits the aggregate bit rate of all Nonâ€‘GBR bearers of
the same APN, i.e. the GBR bearers are outside the scope of QoS per APN.
Upon receiving the subscribed AMBR per APN from the BBERF, the PCRF shall be
able to provision the AMBR per APN to the PCEF for enforcement using the
provisioning of authorized QoS per APN procedure specified in clause 4.5.5.7.
#### 4a.5.10.4 Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per service data flow is a part of QoS rule
provisioning procedure, as described in clause 4a.5.2.
The authorized QoS per service data flow shall be provisioned within the
corresponding QoS rule by including the QoS-Information AVP within the QoS-
Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA or RAR commands. This QoS-Information AVP shall
not contain a Bearer-Identifier AVP.
#### 4a.5.10.5 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per service data flow
The BBERF shall reserve the resources necessary for the guaranteed bitrate for
the QoS rule upon receipt of a QoS rule provisioning including QoS
information. The BBERF shall start the needed procedures to ensure that the
provisioned resources are according to the authorized values. This may imply
that the BBERF needs to request the establishment of new IP CAN bearer(s) or
the modification of existing IP CAN bearer(s). If the enforcement is not
successful, the BBERF shall inform the PCRF as described in clause 4a.5.5.
Upon deactivation or removal of a QoS rule, the BBERF shall free the resources
reserved for that QoS rule.
#### 4a.5.10.6 Policy provisioning and enforcement of authorized QoS for
service data flows that share resources
If the ResShare feature is supported by both the BBERF and PCRF as described
in clause 5a.4.1, the PCRF may indicate that the BBERF should commonly reserve
resources for a set of QoS rules. The BBERF shall then, for QoS rules bound to
the same bearer and the same sharing key value, use the highest GBR value
among those QoS rules as input for calculating the common GBR value when
reserving bearer resources. The GBR value for each direction shall be
considered separately, so that the uplink and downlink GBR values may
originate from different QoS rules.
The BBERF may based on internal logic use the highest MBR value among the
provided QoS rules indicated to share resources, when determining the MBR for
the bearer. Each individual QoS rule is still subject to data rate policing
based on its own MBR values.
The PCRF shall provide the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within
the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP in order to indicate that the related QoS rule may
share resources with other QoS rules bound to the same bearer.\ The BBERF
shall apply resource sharing if at least two QoS rules bound to the same
bearer share the same value in the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL
AVP.
If Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP with a modified value is
received in the BBERF it will replace any previously provided value for the
specified QoS rule. If Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP is
omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is still valid.
When modifying the value of Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP to a
QoS rule that is subject to resource sharing the BBERF may adjust the resource
sharing of the remaining QoS rules.
NOTE 1: A QoS rule that is deleted is also removed from the resource sharing,
while the remaining QoS rules continue their sharing relationship.
NOTE 2: The state of resource sharing ends when less than two of the QoS rules
in the set remains.
### 4a.5.11 Trace activation/deactivation
Trace activation/deactivation at the P-GW takes place via the PCRF and is
3GPP-EPS access specific. See Annex B for further information.
### 4a.5.12 IMS Emergency Session Support
#### 4a.5.12.1 PCC procedures for Emergency services over Gxx reference point
##### 4a.5.12.1.1 Gateway control and QoS Rules request for Emergency services
The BBERF executes the same procedure as for a Gateway control and QoS Rules
request unrelated to Emergency Services described in clause 4a.5.1.
A BBERF that requests QoS Rules at Gateway Control Session Establishment shall
send a CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\".
For case 2b the BBERF shall send the Called-Station-Id AVP including the
Emergency APN. The BBERF may include the IMSI within the Subscription-Id AVP
and if the IMSI is not available the BBERF shall include the IMEI within the
User-Equipment-Info AVP. The BBERF may include the rest of the attributes
described in clause 4a.5.1.
If the PCRF detects that the initial or subsequent CCR command shall be
rejected, it shall execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental
result code described in clause 4a.5.1.
##### 4a.5.12.1.2 Provisioning of QoS Rules for Emergency services
###### 4a.5.12.1.2.1 Provisioning of QoS Rules at Gxx session establishment
The PCRF shall detect that a Gxx session is restricted to IMS Emergency
services when a CCR command is received with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the Called-Station-Id AVP includes a PDN
identifier that matches one of the Emergency APNs from the configurable list.
The PCRF:
\- shall provision QoS Rules restricting the access to Emergency Services
(e.g. P-CSCF(s), DHCP(s) and DNS (s) and SUPL(s) addresses) as required by
local operator policies in a CCA command according to the procedures described
in clause 4a.5.2.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to the default EPS bearer
within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP in a CCA command according to the
procedures described in clause 4a.5.10.1 except for obtaining the authorized
QoS upon interaction with the SPR. The value for the Priority-Level AVP shall
be assigned as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an IMS Emergency
session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a value that is
reserved for an operator domain use of IMSEmergency sessions). If the IP-CAN
Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" the values for Pre-emption-Capability AVP
and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall be assigned as required by local
operator policies.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to an APN within the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate UL/DL in a CCA command according to the procedures
described in clause 4a.5.10.3.
When the PCEF detects that the provisioning of QoS Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4a.5.5.
###### 4a.5.12.1.2.2 Provisioning of QoS Rules for Emergency services
When the PCRF receives IMS service information from the AF for an Emergency
service and derives authorized QoS Rules from the service information, the
priority in the Priority-Level AVP in the QoS information within the QoS Rule
shall be assigned a value as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an
IMS Emergency session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a
value that is reserved for an operator domain use of IMSEmergency sessions).
If the IP-CAN Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" the values for the Pre-
emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall also be
assigned as required by local operator policies.
The PCRF shall derive authorized QoS Rules from the PCC Rules that are bound
to an IP-CAN session restricted to Emergency services and immediately initiate
a PUSH procedure as described in clause 4a.5.2.1 to provision QoS Rules and
the procedures described in clause 4.5.5.2 to provision the authorized QoS per
service data flow.
Any BBERF-initiated request for QoS Rules for an IMS Emergency service
triggered by Event-Trigger AVP assigned to \"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\"
(i.e. UE-initiated resource reservation) shall be rejected by the PCRF, with
the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
The BBERF shall execute the procedures described in clause 4a.5.2.1 and clause
4.5.5.3 to ensure that a new IP-CAN bearer is established for the Emergency
service.
When the BBERF detects that the provisioning of QoS Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4a.5.5.
#### 4a.5.12.2 Gateway Control Session to Gx session linking
If the Subscription-Id AVP was not received, the PCRF shall perform Gateway
Control Session to Gx session linking by using the User-Equipment-Info AVP.
#### 4a.5.12.3 Removal of QoS Rules for Emergency Services
The reception of a request to terminate an AF session for an IMS Emergency
service by the PCRF triggers the removal of QoS Rules assigned to the
terminated IMS Emergency Service from the BBERF by using the clause 4a.5.2.1
to provision QoS Rules.
At reception of a RAR that removes one or several QoS Rules from an IP-CAN
Session restricted to emergency services the BBERF shall:
\- when all QoS Rules bound to an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer termination procedure.
\- when not all QoS Rules bound an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer modification procedure.
#### 4a.5.12.4 Termination of Gateway Control session for Emergency Services
The procedure to terminate a Gateway Control Session defined for case 2b) in
4a.5.3 and for case 2a) in 4a.5.4 applies.
### 4a.5.13 Time of the day procedures
BBERF shall be able to perform PCC rule request as instructed by the PCRF. To
do so, the PCRF shall provide the Event-Trigger AVP with the value
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT (17) if the event trigger is not previously set, and in
addition the Revalidation-Time AVP when set by the PCRF. This shall cause the
BBERF to trigger a PCRF interaction to request QoS rules from the PCRF for an
established gateway control session. The BBERF shall stop the timer once the
BBERF triggers a REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event. The BBERF should send the PCC
rule request during a preconfigured period before the indicated revalidation
time.
NOTE 1: The PCRF is expected to be prepared to provide a new policy, as
desired for the revalidation time, during a preconfigured period before the
revalidation time.The preconfigured periods in the BBERF and PCRF need to be
aligned.
PCRF shall be able to provide a new value for the revalidation timeout by
including Revalidation-Time AVP in CCA or RAR. The PCRF may provide the
Revalidation-Time AVP together with the event trigger REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT or
in a subsequent QoS rule provisioning.
PCRF shall be able to stop the revalidation timer by disabling the
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event trigger.
NOTE 2: By disabling the REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT the revalidation time value
previously provided to the BBERF is not applicable anymore.
If the PCRF includes the activation time in Rule-Activation-Time and/or the
deactivation time in Rule-Deactivation-Time when the PCRF provision the PCC
rules to the PCEF, the PCRF shall set the same activation time in Rule-
Activation-Time and/or the deactivation time in Rule-Deactivation-Time when
the PCRF provision the corresponding QoS rules to the BBERF.
The PCRF may control at what time the status of a QoS rule changes.
1) If Rule-Activation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the BBERF shall set the QoS rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Rule-Activation-Time has passed, then the BBERF shall immediately set the QoS
rule active.
2) If Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the BBERF shall set the QoS rule active and make it inactive at that time. If
Rule-Deactivation-Time has passed, then the BBERF shall immediately set the
QoS rule inactive.
3) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, and also
when the QoS rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, the BBERF shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then
as defined in 2).
4) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, and also
when the QoS rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Activation-Time, the BBERF shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as
defined in 1).
5) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has already occurred for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before
the Rule-Deactivation-Time, then the BBERF shall immediately set the QoS rule
inactive.
6) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the
Rule-Activation-Time, then the BBERF shall immediately set the QoS rule
active.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified in the QoS-
Rule-Install then it will replace the previously set values for the specified
QoS rules. If Rule-Activation-Time AVP, Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP or both
AVPs are omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is no longer
valid.
The 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available, may be used by the PCRF to derive the
Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time.
If the QoS rule(s) that include the Rule-Activation-Time AVP are bound to a
bearer that will require traffic mapping information to be sent to the UE, the
BBERF shall report the failure to the PCRF by including the QoS-Rule-Report
AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code set the value \"NO_BEARER_BOUND (15)\" for the
affected QoS rule(s) identified by the QoS-Rule-Name AVP in either a CCR or an
RAA command.
NOTE 3: This limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed
traffic mapping information towards the UE.
The QoS rules including Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time shall
not be applied for changes of the QoS or service data flow filter information.
### 4a.5.14 Multimedia Priority Support
#### 4a.5.14.1 PCC Procedures for Multimedia Priority services over Gxx
reference point
##### 4a.5.14.1.1 Provisioning of QoS Rules for Multimedia Priority Services
The provision of QoS Rules corresponding to both MPS and non-MPS services
shall be performed as described in clause 4a.5.2.
The QoS Rules applicable for MPS and non-MPS services shall be derived from
the PCC Rules generated as described in clause 4.5.191.2.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the PCRF shall check whether any of these parameters are
stored in the SPR: MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling
Priority. The PCRF shall derive the QoS Rules from the generated PCC Rules and
default bearer QoS based on that information. If the IMS Signalling Priority
is set and the Called-Station-Id AVP is received and corresponds to an APN
dedicated for IMS, the PCRF shall assign an ARP corresponding to MPS for the
default bearer and for the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding to the IMS signalling
bearer. If the Called-Station-Id AVP does not correspond to an APN dedicated
for IMS, the ARP shall be derived without considering IMS Signalling Priority.
NOTE 0: Subscription data for MPS is provided to PCRF through the Sp reference
point.
Once the PCRF receives a notification of a change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority from the SPR, the PCRF shall
make the corresponding policy decisions (i.e. ARP and/or QCI change) and, if
applicable, shall initiate a RAR command to provision the modified data.
NOTE 1: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 2: The MPS Priority Level is one among other input data such as operator
policy for the PCRF to set the ARP.
The PCRF shall derive the ARP of the default bearer as described in clause
4.5.19.1.1.
##### 4a.5.14.1.2 Invocation/Revocation of Priority EPS Bearer Services
When a Priority EPS Bearer Service is invoked or revoked, the PCRF shall
behave as described in clause 4.5.19.1.2. The PCRF shall derive the QoS Rules
from the applicable PCC Rules.
The PCRF shall provision the BBERF with the applicable QoS Rules upon Priority
EPS Bearer Service activation and deactivation as described in clause 4a.5.2.
The provision of the QoS information applicable for the QoS Rules shall be
performed as described in clause 4a.5.10.4. The provision of QoS information
for the default bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4a.5.10.1.
##### 4a.5.14.1.3 Invocation/Revocation of IMS Multimedia Priority Services
If the PCRF receives service information including an MPS session indication
and the service priority level from the P-CSCF or detects that the P-CSCF
released all the MPS Session, the PCRF shall behave as described in clause
4.5.19.1.3. The PCRF shall derive the QoS Rules from the applicable PCC Rules.
The PCRF shall provision the BBERF with the applicable QoS Rules upon MPS
session initiation and release as described in clause 4a.5.2. The provision of
the QoS information applicable for the QoS Rules shall be performed as
described in clause 4a.5.10.4. The provision of QoS information for the
default bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4a.5.10.1.
### 4a.5.15 PCRF Failure and Restoration
If the BBERF needs to send a Gateway Control Session modification request
towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the Gateway Control
Session establishment, the BBERF should not send the Gateway Control Session
modification request towards a PCRF and the BBERF may tear down the associated
PDN connection based on operator policy, by initiating PDN connection
deactivation procedure. Emergency and eMPS sessions should not be torn down.
NOTE 1: This mechanism enables the clean up of PDN connections affected by the
PCRF failure and leads the UE to initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure for the same APN.
NOTE 2: The method the BBERF uses to determine that a PCRF has restarted is
not specified in this release.
### 4a.5.16 Reporting Access Network Information
If the AF requests the PCRF to report the access network information and if
the PCRF cannot determine that access network information cannot be provided
as described in clause 5.5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall provide
the requested access network information indication (e.g. user location and/or
user timezone information) to the BBERF as follows:
\- If the PCRF is installing or modifying a QoS rule, the PCRF shall include
the Required-Access-Info AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP of an
appropriate installed or modified QoS rule;
\- Otherwise, if the PCRF is removing QoS rules based on the AF requests, the
PCRF shall include the Required-Access-Info AVP within the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP
associated with the corresponding QoS rules being removed.
The PCRF shall also provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger
within Event-Trigger AVP (if this event trigger is not yet set).
For the QoS Rule(s) based on preliminary service information as described in
3GPP TS 29.214 [10] the PCRF may assign the QCI and ARP of the default bearer
to avoid signalling to the UE. These QoS Rules shall not include the Packet-
Filter-Usage AVP within the Flow-Information AVP included in the QoS-Rule-
Definition AVP. These QoS rule(s) may be provisioned by the PCRF without
corresponding PCC rule(s).
NOTE: 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] provides further information about appropriate QoS
rules in clause 6.2.1.0.
If the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, upon installation,
modification and removal of any QoS rule(s) with the Required-Access-Info AVP
in a Gxx RAR command, the BBERF shall determine if it can obtain the required
location information for the used IP CAN type. If the BBERF determines that
the IP CAN type does not support such procedures, the BBERF shall immediately
inform the PCRF by including the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP with the value of 0
(NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) in the RAA command. Otherwise, the BBERF shall
apply appropriate IP CAN specific procedures to obtain this information. When
the BBERF then receives access network information through those IP CAN
specific procedures, the BBERF shall provide the corresponding access network
information to the PCRF as follows:
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was provided
to the BBERF, the BBERF shall provide the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP and the time when it was last known within User-
Location-Info-Time AVP (if available).
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was not
provided to the BBERF, the BBERF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP.
\- If the time zone was requested by the PCRF, the BBERF shall provide it
within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
In addition, the BBERF shall provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event
trigger within Event-Trigger AVP.
During bearer deactivation, the BBERF shall provide the access network
information to the PCRF by including the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if requested by the PCRF and provided to the
BBERF), the information on when the UE was last known to be in that location
within User-Location-Info-Time AVP ( if user location information was
requested by the PCRF and the corresponding information was provided to the
BBERF) the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC (if the user location
information was requested by the PCRF but was not provided to the BBERF) and
the timezone information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if requested by the
PCRF).
During IP-CAN session termination procedure, the BBERF shall, if
ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, provide the access network
information to the PCRF by including the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if it was provided to the BBERF), the information
on when the UE was last known to be in that location within User-Location-
Info-Time AVP (if it was provided to the BBERF), the PLMN identifier within
the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was not provided
to the BBERF) and the timezone information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
TheBBERF shall not report any subsequent access network information updates
received from the IP-CAN without any previous provisioning or removal of
related QoS rules unless the associated IP-CAN bearer or connection has been
released.
### 4a.5.17 Resource reservation for services sharing priority
When the PCRF derives QoS Rules corresponding to a service related to an AF
that has indicated that priority sharing is allowed for that service over Rx
interface, it derives the corresponding QoS Rules according to current
procedures as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8], subclause 5.3. The PCRF may
additionally take the suggested pre-emption capability and vulnerability
values into account if they were provided by the AF when the PCRF determines
the ARP pre-emption capability and vulnerability. The ARP derived at this
point and the priority sharing indicator provided over Rx reference point (see
3GPP TS 29.214 [10] for further information) related to these derived QoS
Rules are stored for later use.
For QoS Rules related to the same IP-CAN session with the same assigned QCI
and with the priority sharing indicator enabled (see 3GPP TS 29.214 [10],
subclause 4.4.8), the PCRF shall rederive the ARP into a shared ARP for these
QoS Rules as follows:
\- The Priority Level shall be set to the lowest value (i.e. highest priority)
among the Priority Level values derived for the QoS rules that include the
priority sharing indicator;
\- The Pre-emption Capability shall be set to ENABLED if any of the original
derived QoS Rules have the Pre-emption-Capability value set to ENABLED.
\- The Pre-emption Vulnerability shall be set to ENABLED if all the original
derived QoS Rules have the Pre-emption Vulnerability value set to ENABLED.
NOTE 1: Having the same setting for the ARP parameter in the QoS rules with
the priority sharing indicator set enables the usage of the same bearer.
Furthermore, a combined modification of the ARP parameter in the QoS Rules
ensures that a bearer modification is triggered when a media flow with higher
service priority starts.
If the QCI and/or ARP related to any of the QoS Rules that share priority is
changed (e.g. based on local policies), the PCRF shall rederive the ARP for
the impacted QoS Rules following the same procedure as defined in this
subclause.
The PCRF shall provision the QoS Rules according to the rederived ARP
information as described in subclause 4a.5.2.1.
If the PCRF receives a report that a QoS rule provisioning or modification
failed due to the resource reservation failure as defined in subclause 4a.5.5
and if the PCRF supports the MCPTT-Preemption feature as defined in subclause
5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall check if pre-emption control
based on the pre-emption control information provided by the AF as defined in
subclause 4.4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] applies.
NOTE 2: The PCRF determines that pre-emption control applies based on the
presence of the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP received over Rx reference point
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] and operator policies.
If pre-emption control applies, the PCRF shall check the corresponding derived
QoS Rules (before applying priority sharing procedures). If the Pre-emption
Capability of the derived QoS Rule is disabled the PCRF shall notify that
resource allocation has failed for this QoS rule to the AF as defined in
subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]. Otherwise, if the Pre-emption
Capability of the derived QoS Rule is enabled, the PCRF shall perform the pre-
emption control as follows:
For all the active QoS rule(s) that applied priority sharing mechanism, the
PCRF shall identify the QoS Rules that have the Pre-emption Vulnerability
enabled. For those selected QoS Rule(s), the PCRF shall check the Priority
Level value.
\- If there is only one QoS Rule with the Priority Level value higher (i.e.
lower priority) than the derived Priority Level value of new or modified QoS
Rule, the PCRF shall remove this QoS rule. The PCRF shall retry the QoS rule
provisioning or modification procedure for the QoS rule that failed.
\- Otherwise, if there are more than one QoS Rule with the Priority Level
value higher (i.e. lower priority) than the derived Priority Level value of
new or modified QoS Rule, the PCRF shall remove the QoS Rule with the highest
Priority Level from the PCEF. The PCRF shall retry the QoS rule provisioning
or modification procedure for the QoS rule that failed; If more than one QoS
Rule have the same highest Priority Level, the PCRF shall check the Pre-
emption-Control-Info AVP received over Rx interface as defined in 3GPP TS
29.214 [10] and remove the QoS Rule that matches the condition.
\- Otherwise, if there is at least one QoS Rule with the same Priority Level
value than the derived Priority Level value of new or modified QOS Rule, the
PCRF shall check the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP received over Rx interface
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] for these QoS Rules and remove the QoS Rule
that matches the condition.
\- Otherwise, the PCRF shall notify that resource allocation has failed for
this QoS rule to the AF as defined in subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS
29.214 [10].
If there is no active QoS Rule with the Pre-emption Vulnerability enabled, the
PCRF shall notify that resource allocation has failed for this QoS rule to the
AF as defined in subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].
NOTE 2: If the PCRF receives a report that a QoS rule provisioning or
modification failed due to the resource reservation failure as defined in
subclause 4a.5.5 and the PCRF does not support the MCPTT-Preemption feature as
defined in subclause 5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF can apply pre-
emption and remove active QoS rules from the BBERF and then retry the QoS rule
provisioning or modification procedure. Otherwise, the PCRF will notify it to
the AF as defined in subclause 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]. How the
PCRF applies the pre-emption depends on the implementation.
### 4a.5.18 Support for QoS rule versioning
The support of QoS rule versioning is optional. When the RuleVersioning
feature is supported, the BBERF and PCRF shall comply with the procedures
specified in this subclause.
If required by operator policies, the PCRF shall assign a content version for
each generated QoS rule and include the version within the Content-Version AVP
included within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP. Upon each QoS rule modification,
if the content version was assigned to a QoS rule, the PCRF shall assign a new
content version. In this case, all the content related to that QoS rule shall
be included. The content version is unique for the lifetime of the QoS rule.
NOTE 1: The PCRF will include all the content of the QoS rule in each
modification of the QoS rule in order to ensure that the rule is installed
with the proper information regardless of the outcome of the bearer procedure
related to previous rule provisioning versions that are not reported yet.
NOTE 2: The operation policies can take into account whether the AF provides
the related content version information over Rx reference point (see subclause
4.4.9 in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]).
Whenever the BBERF provides a QoS rule report for rules that were provisioned
with a content version, the BBERF shall include the Content-Version AVP(s) as
part of the QoS-Rule-Report AVP for those corresponding QoS rules. The BBERF
may include more than one Content-Version AVP for the same QoS rule within the
QoS-Rule-Report AVP (e.g. The BBERF has combined multiple QoS rule versions
enforcement into one bearer operation). In this case, the PCC-Rule-Status AVP
shall indicate the final status of the QoS rule.
NOTE 3: The PCRF will use the content version to identify the QoS rule version
that failed or succeed when multiple provisions of the same QoS rule in a
short period of time. If required by the AF, the PCRF will inform the AF
according to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], subclause 4.4.9 about the failure or success
for the media component version associated to the PCC rule version.
### 4a.5.19 Extended bandwidth support for EPC supporting Dual Connectivity
(E-UTRAN and 5G NR)
When the Extended-BW-NR feature is supported, extended bandwidth support as
described in subclause 4.5.x applies.
When the Gateway Control Session is being established and if the BBERF
supports the Extended-BW-NR feature, the same behaviour as described for the
PCEF in subclause 4.5.30 applies for the BBERF.
# 4b Sd reference point
## 4b.1 Overview
The Sd reference point is located between the Policy and Charging Rules
Function (PCRF) and the Traffic Detection Function (TDF). For the solicited
application reporting, the Sd reference point is used for establishment and
termination of TDF session between PCRF and TDF, provisioning of Application
Detection and Control rules from the PCRF for the purpose of traffic detection
and enforcement at the TDF, usage monitoring control of TDF session and of
detected applications and reporting of the start and the stop of a detected
applications\'s traffic and transfer of service data flow descriptions for
detected applications, ifdeducible, from the TDF to the PCRF. For the
unsolicited reporting, the Sd reference point is used for establishment and
termination of TDF session between PCRF and TDF, reporting of the start and
the stop of a detected application\'s traffic and transfer of service data
flow descriptions for detected applications, if deducible, and transfer of
Application instance identifier, if service data flow descriptions are
deducible, from the TDF to the PCRF.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Sd reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7].
Signalling flows related to the Sd, Rx, Gxx and Gx interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the Sd interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the Sd interface.
Refer to Annex K of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter load control procedures
over the Sd interface.
The TDF is considered as monolithic entity in the present specification, but
can be decomposed into a User Plane Function and a Control Plane Function
connected via the Sx reference point. The Sx reference point and interactions
between the Sd and Sx reference points are not considered in the present
specification, but are specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [63].
## 4b.2 Sd Reference model
The Sd reference point is defined between the PCRF and the TDF. The
relationships between the different functional entities involved are depicted
in figure 4b.2.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in subclause 3a of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Figure 4b.2.1: Sd reference model
NOTE: The TDF can be decomposed into a User Plane Function and a Control Plane
Function connected via the Sx reference point specified in 3GPP TS 29.244
[63]. If the TDF is decomposed, the Sd reference point terminates in the
Control Plane Function.
Figure 4b.2.2: Void
## 4b.3 Application Detection and Control Rules
### 4b.3.1 Functional entities
The PCRF may provide ADC Rules to the TDF by using Sd interface.
Once the start or stop of the application\'s traffic, matching one of those
ADC Rules, is detected, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the
APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, unless a request to mute
such a notification (Mute-Notification AVP) is part of the corresponding ADC
Rule, the TDF shall report the information regarding the detected
application\'s traffic to the PCRF and apply the enforcement actions, if
defined within the corresponding ADC Rule.
### 4b.3.2 Application Detection and Control Rule Definition
The purpose of the ADC rule is to provide and apply the detection, enforcement
actions and applicable charging parameters for the specified application
traffic.
There are two different types of ADC rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]:
\- Dynamic ADC rules. The PCRF can however provide and modify some parameters
via the Sd reference point, respectively. These ADC rules can be installed,
modified and removed at any time. The dynamic ADC rules are applicable only in
case of solicited application reporting.
\- Predefined ADC rules. Preconfigured in the TDF. In the case of solicited
reporting, the Predefined ADC rules can be activated or deactivated by the
PCRF at any time. Predefined ADC rules within the TDF may be grouped allowing
the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of ADC rules.
An ADC rule consists of:
\- a rule identifier;
\- TDF application identifier;
\- service data flow filter(s);
\- precedence;
\- charging key (i.e. rating group);
\- other charging parameters;
\- monitoring key;
\- sponsor identity;
\- application service provider identity;
\- gate status;
\- UL maximum bit rate;
\- DL maximum bit rate;
\- redirect;
\- DL DSCP value;
\- Traffic steering policy identifier(s).
The rule identifier shall be used to reference an ADC rule in the
communication between the TDF and the PCRF.
NOTE 1: The PCRF has to ensure that there is no dynamically provided ADC rule
that has the same rule identifier value as any of the predefined ADC rules.
The TDF application identifier shall be used to reference the corresponding
application, for which the rule applies during reporting to the PCRF. The same
application identifier value can occur in more than one ADC rule. If so, the
PCRF shall ensure that there is at most one ADC rule active per application
identifier value at any time. Instead of TDF Application identifier, the
service data flow filter(s) list may be provided which comprises one or more
service data flow filters and is used by the TDF to identify the packets
belonging to a detected traffic. The service data flow filter(s) or the TDF
application identifier shall be used to select the traffic for which the rule
applies. Either service data flow filter(s) or TDF application identifier
shall exist in an ADC rule.
NOTE 2: The same application identifier value could be used for a dynamic ADC
rule and a pre-defined ADC rule or for multiple pre-defined ADC rules.
NOTE 3: The configuration of the application detection filter in the TDF can
include the set of information required for encrypted detection as defined in
Annex X of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7].
The _precedence_ defines, if multiple ADC rules overlap in the application
traffic detection, the ADC Rule with the highest precedence will be applied
for the purpose of enforcement, reporting of application starts and stops,
usage monitoring, and charging. When a dynamic ADC rule and a predefined ADC
rule have the same precedence, the dynamic ADC rule takes precedence. For
dynamic ADC rules, the Precedence will be either preconfigured at the TDF or
provided dynamically by the PCRF within the ADC Rules.
NOTE 4: The operator ensures that overlap between the predefined ADC rules can
be resolved based on precedence of each predefined ADC rule in the TDF. For
dynamic ADC rules, if precedence is not preconfigured in the TDF, the PCRF
ensures that overlap between the dynamic ADC rules can be resolved based on
precedence of each dynamic ADC rule.
NOTE 5: Whether precedence for dynamic ADC rules that contain an application
identifier is preconfigured in TDF or provided in the ADC rule from the PCRF
depends on network configuration.
The charging parameters define whether online and offline charging interfaces
are used, what is to be metered in offline charging, on what level the TDF
shall report the usage related to the rule, etc.
The monitoring key for an ADC rule identifies a monitoring control instance
that shall be used for usage monitoring control of a particular application or
a group of applications (as identified by the predefined or dynamic ADC
rule(s)) or all detected traffic belonging to a specific TDF session.
If sponsored data connectivity is supported, the sponsor identity for a ADC
rule identifies the 3^rd^ party organization (the sponsor) willing to pay for
the operator\'s charge for connectivity required to deliver a service to the
end user.
If sponsored data connectivity is supported, the application service provider
identity for a ADC rule identifies the 3^rd^ party organization (the ASP) that
is delivering the service to the end user.
The gate status indicates whether the application, identified by the TDF
application identifier, may pass (gate is open) or shall be blocked (gate is
closed) in uplink and/or in downlink direction.
The UL maximum bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the uplink
component of the detected application traffic.
The DL maximum bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the
downlink component of the detected application traffic.
NOTE 6: In order to support services that generate media with variable bitrate
(e.g. video) , the policing function could need to measure the enforced MBR
with a sliding window that averages over a suitable time period. For example,
for MTSI media, 3GPP TS 26.114 [57] recommends a default period of 2 seconds
and provides further considerations regarding suitable time periods for speech
and video.
The Redirect indicates whether the uplink part of the detected application
traffic should be redirected to another controlled address. The target
redirect address may also be included.
The DL DSCP value indicates the DSCP value for marking of downlink packets of
the detected application traffic.
The traffic steering policy identifier(s) is a reference to a pre-configured
traffic steering policy at the TDF as defined in subclause 4b.4.2.
One or more of the following parameters can be modified for a dynamic ADC
rule:
\- precedence;
\- charging key (i.e. rating group);
\- other charging parameters (with the exemption of charging method);
\- monitoring key;
\- sponsor identity;
\- application service provider identity;
\- gate status;
\- UL maximum bit rate;
\- DL maximum bit rate;
\- redirect;
\- DL DSCP value;
\- Traffic steering policy identifier(s).
### 4b.3.3 Operations on ADC Rules
For dynamic ADC rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: to provision an ADC rules that has not been already
provisioned.
\- Modification: to modify an ADC rule already installed.
\- Removal: to remove an ADC rule already installed.
For predefined ADC rules, the following operations are available:
\- Activation: to allow the ADC rule being active.
\- Deactivation: to disallow the ADC rule.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4b.5.
## 4b.4 Functional elements
### 4b.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element
that encompasses policy control decision. The PCRF provides network control
regarding the application detection, gating, bandwidth limitation, redirection
and application based charging (except credit management) towards the TDF.
The PCRF may provision ADC Rules to the TDF via the Sd reference point.
The PCRF ADC Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- Information obtained from the PCEF via the Gx reference point, e.g. request
type, subscriber/device related information, location information.
\- Information obtained from the SPR via the Sp reference point, e.g.
subscriber related data. The subscription information may include user profile
configuration indicating whether application detection and control should be
enabled.
NOTE: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in
this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
\- Information obtained from the TDF via the Sd reference point, e.g. detected
application, usage monitoring report.
\- Information obtained from the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
\- Information obtained from the AF via the Rx reference point, e.g. an AF
application identifier.
\- Own PCRF pre-configured information.
The PCRF shall inform the TDF through the use of ADC rules, if applicable, on
the treatment of applications, in accordance with the PCRF policy decisions.
It is PCRF\'s responsibility to coordinate the PCC rules and QoS rules, if
applicable, with ADC rules in order to ensure consistent service delivery.
The PCRF may use one or more pieces of information defined in the subclause as
input for the selection of traffic steering policies used to control the
steering of the subscriber\'s traffic to appropriate (S)Gi-LAN service
functions.
### 4b.4.2 TDF
The TDF (Traffic Detection Function) is a functional entity that performs
application\'s traffic detection and reporting of the detected application by
using TDF application identifier and its TDF application instance identifier
and its service data flow descriptions to the PCRF when service data flow
descriptions are deducible. The TDF shall support solicited application
reporting and/or unsolicited application reporting.
NOTE 1: The application detection filter can be pre-configured and/or extended
with the PFDs by the PFDF as described in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and 3GPP TS
29.251 [62].
The TDF shall detect start and stop of the application traffic for the ADC
rules that the PCRF has activated at the TDF (solicited application reporting)
or which are pre-provisioned at the TDF (unsolicited application reporting).
When the APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP event trigger are subscribed,
the TDF shall report, unless the notification is muted for the specific ADC
rule in case of solicited application reporting, to the PCRF:
\- For the APPLICATION_START event trigger: the application identifier and,
when service data flow descriptions are deducible, the application instance
identifier and the service data flow descriptions to use for detecting that
application traffic with a dynamic PCC rule.
\- For the APPLICATION_STOP event trigger: the application identifier and if
the application instance identifier was reported for the start, also the
application instance identifier.
For the solicited application reporting, the TDF shall perform the following
enforcement actions to the detected application traffic, if requested by PCRF:
\- Gating;
\- Redirection;
\- Bandwidth limitation.
For the solicited application reporting, in order to allow service data flow
detection in the PCEF/BBERF in the downlink direction for applications with
non-deducible service data flows detected by the TDF, if requested by the
PCRF, the TDF shall perform marking of downlink packets of the detected
application traffic, as specified in clause 4b.5.14.
For the solicited application reporting, the TDF shall support usage
monitoring as specified in clauses 4b.5.6 and 4b.5.7.
For the solicited application reporting, the TDF shall support application
based charging by having online and offline charging interactions.
For an application that is under charging control the TDF shall allow the
application\'s traffic to pass through it if and only if, for online charging,
the OCS has authorized the applicable credit with that Charging key. The TDF
may let an application pass through it during the course of the credit re-
authorization procedure.
A TDF shall ensure that a detected application\'s traffic, which is discarded
at the TDF as a result of ADC rule enforcement (e.g. gating), is neither
reported for offline charging nor cause credit consumption for online
charging.
For unsolicited application reporting, the TDF shall only perform application
detection and reporting functionality.
NOTE 2: For unsolicited application reporting, the TDF does not perform
enforcement actions, application based charging or usage monitoring.
When the PCRF provides a traffic steering policy identifier(s) in an ADC rule,
the TDF shall enforce the referenced traffic steering policy for the detected
traffic.
To enforce the traffic steering policy, the TDF should perform deployment
specific actions as configured for that traffic steering policy. The TDF may
for example perform packet marking (e.g. mark the Type of service (ToS) field
of the IP packet header) where, for the traffic identified by the application
identifier or service data flow filter(s), the TDF provides information for
traffic steering, as part of the packets, to the (S)Gi-LAN. This information
for traffic steering identifies, explicitly or implicitly, a specific set of
service functions and their order via which the traffic needs to be steered in
the (S)Gi-LAN.
## 4b.5 ADC procedures over Sd reference point for solicited application
reporting
### 4b.5.1 Provisioning of ADC rules
#### 4b.5.1.1 General
If PCRF decides, based on subscriber\'s profile configuration, that the TDF
session should be established with the TDF per corresponding IP-CAN session,
during the IP-CAN session establishment or at any point of time when the PCRF
decides that the session with TDF is to be established (e.g. subscriber
profile changes), the PCRF shall indicate via the Sd reference point, the ADC
rules to be applied at the TDF. The TDF-Information AVP shall be either
received over Gx within initial CC-Request received from PCEF or pre-
provisioned at PCRF. Each ADC rule shall include TDF-Application-Identifier
AVP which references the corresponding application for which the rule applies.
When establishing the session with the TDF, the PCRF shall send a TS-Request
with the PDN information, if available, within the Called-Station-Id AVP, the
UE Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address and/or the UE Ipv6 prefix within
the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP. These parameters shall uniquely identify the
session between the PCRF and the TDF. Additionally, if available (i.e.
received from the PCEF or the BBERF), the PCRF may include the following
information: the user identification within the Subscription-Id AVP, the type
of IP-CAN within the IP-CAN-Type AVP, the type of the radio access technology
within the RAT-Type AVP if applicable and AN-Trusted AVP if applicable, the
device information within User-Equipment-Info AVP, the SGSN address within
either 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP or 3GPP-SGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, the user location
information within 3GPP-User-Location-Info or within 3GPP2-BSID, the Routing
Area Identity within RAI AVP, the Ipv4 and/ or Ipv6 address(es) of the access
node gateway (SGW for 3GPP and AGW for non-3GPP networks) in the AN-GW-Address
AVPs, the MCC and the MNC of the SGSN/S-GW in the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP, the
UE time zone information within 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, the presence reporting
area identifier within the Presence-Reporting-Area-Information AVP, the
charging characteristics within 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics AVP, control
plane P-GW address(es) within 3GPP-GGSN-Address AVP and/or 3GPP-GGSN-
Ipv6-Address AVP, 3GPP-Selection-Mode AVP indicating how the APN was selected,
Dynamic-Address-Flag AVP and Dynamic-Address-Flag-Extension AVP defining
whether IP address(es) where statically or dynamically allocated and PDN-
Connection-Charging-ID AVP containing the charging identifier to identify
different records belonging to the same PDN connection. For xDSL IP-CAN Type,
the Logical-Access-ID AVP and the Physical-Access-ID AVP may be provided.
NOTE: For PDN type Ipv4v6, in case the UE Ipv4 address is not available in the
PCRF , the PCRF initiates the TDF session establishment providing the UE Ipv6
prefix, and will subsequently provide UE Ipv4 address to the TDF using Event-
Report-Indication AVP (as specified in clause 4b.5.8) to the TDF.
The ADC rules may be transferred to the TDF by using one of the following
procedures:
\- PUSH procedure (Unsolicited provisioning): The PCRF may decide to provision
ADC rules at TDF session establishment within TS-Request or at any point of
time within active TDF session by using RA-Request. To provision ADC rules,
the PCRF shall include those ADC rules in either TS-Request or RA-Request
message; or
\- PULL procedure (Provisioning solicited by the TDF): In response to a
request for ADC rules being made by the TDF, as described in the clause
4b.5.2, the PCRF shall provision ADC rules in the CC-Answer.
For each request from the TDF or upon the unsolicited provision, the PCRF
shall provision zero or more ADC rules. The PCRF may perform an operation on a
single ADC rule by one of the following means:
\- To activate or deactivate an ADC rule that is predefined at the TDF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this ADC rule within an ADC-Rule-Name AVP
and indicate the required action by choosing either the ADC-Rule-Install AVP
or the ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned ADC rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding ADC-Rule-Definition AVP within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP.
\- To remove an ADC rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF,
the PCRF shall provision the name of this ADC rule as value of an ADC-Rule-
Name AVP within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
As an alternative to providing a single ADC rule, the PCRF may provide an ADC-
Rule-Base-Name AVP within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP or the ADC-Rule-Remove AVP
as a reference to a group of ADC rules predefined at the TDF. With an ADC-
Rule-Install AVP, a predefined group of ADC rules is activated. With an ADC-
Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of ADC rules is deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above ADC rule operations in a single
command.
To activate a predefined ADC rule at the TDF, the rule name within an ADC-
Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP as a reference
to the predefined rule. To activate a group of predefined ADC rules within the
TDF, an ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Install
AVP as a reference to the group of predefined ADC rules.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined ADC rule, the
ADC-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If an ADC rule with the same rule name,
as supplied in the ADC-Rule-Name AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP,
already exists at the TDF, the new ADC rule shall update the currently
installed rule. If the existing ADC rule already has attributes also included
in the new ADC rule definition, the existing attributes shall be overwritten.
Any attribute in the existing ADC rule not included in the new ADC rule
definition shall remain valid.
For deactivating single predefined or removing PCRF-provided ADC rules, the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP. For
deactivating a group of predefined ADC rules, the ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP shall
be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
The TDF shall apply the ADC rules to the user plane traffic with the IP
address(es) matching the UE Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address and/or
the UE Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP received over Sd
interface and report the detected application information via the
corresponding TDF session.
If the provisioning of ADC rules fails, the TDF informs the PCRF as described
in clause 4b.5.5 ADC Rule Error Handling. Depending on the cause, the PCRF may
decide if re-installation, modification, removal of ADC rules or any other
action applies.
#### 4b.5.1.2 Gate function
The Gate Function represents a user plane function enabling or disabling the
forwarding of application\'s traffic. A gate is applicable to the detected
application\'s traffic. The Flow-Status AVP of the ADC rule shall describe if
the possible uplink and possible downlink gate for the detected application\'s
traffic is opened or closed.
The commands to open or close the gate shall lead to the enabling or disabling
of the passage for corresponding detected application\'s traffic
uplink/downlink. If the corresponding uplink and/or downlink gate is closed,
all packets belonging to the detected application\'s traffic uplink and/or
downlink shall be dropped. If the corresponding uplink and/or downlink gate is
opened, all packets belonging to the detected application\'s traffic uplink
and/or downlink are allowed to be forwarded.
#### 4b.5.1.3 Bandwidth limitation function
The PCRF can provide the maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) for an ADC rule to the
TDF. The Provisioning shall be performed using the ADC rule provisioning
procedure. The allowed QoS shall be encoded using a QoS-Information AVP within
the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP of the ADC rule. If QoS-Information is provided
for an ADC rule, the TDF shall enforce the corresponding policy for the
detected application\'s traffic. Only the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP and
the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP or the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-UL AVP and
the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-DL AVP (see subclause 4b.5.17) shall be used.
#### 4b.5.1.4 Redirect function
The PCRF may provide the redirect instruction (e.g. redirect the detected
application\'s traffic to another controlled address) for a dynamic ADC rule
to the TDF. The Provisioning shall be performed using the ADC rule
provisioning procedure. The redirect instruction shall be encoded using a
Redirect-Information AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP of the dynamic ADC
rule.
For a dynamic ADC rule, the redirect address may be provided as part of the
dynamic ADC rule or may be preconfigured in the TDF. A redirect destination
provided within the Redirect-Server-Address AVP in a dynamic ADC Rule shall
override the redirect destination preconfigured in the TDF for this ADC Rule.
NOTE: The TDF uses the preconfigured redirection address only if it can be
applied to the application traffic being detected, e.g. the redirection
destination address could be preconfigured on a per application identifier
basis.
If Redirect-Information AVP is provided for a dynamic ADC rule, the TDF shall
implement the redirection for the detected application\'s uplink traffic. If
the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is provided within.the Redirect-Information
AVP and the Redirect-Support AVP is not set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED, the TDF
shall redirect the detected application\'s uplink traffic to this address. In
this case, the redirect address type (e.g. Ipv4, Ipv6, URL) shall be defined
by the Redirect-Address-Type AVP. If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not
provided, the redirection address preconfigured in the TDF shall be used
instead. .If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not provided and the
redirection address is not preconfigured in the TDF for the ADC rule, the TDF
shall perform ADC Rule Error Handling as specified in clause 4b.5.5.
When the PCRF wants to disable the redirect function for an already installed
ADC Rule, the PCRF shall update the ADC rule including the Redirect-
Information AVP with Redirect-Support AVP set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED.
#### 4b.5.1.5 Usage Monitoring Control
Usage monitoring may be performed for application (s) associated with one or
more ADC rules.
The provisioning of usage monitoring control per ADC rule shall be performed
using the ADC rule provisioning procedure. For a dynamic ADC rule, the
monitoring key shall be set using the Monitoring-Key AVP within the ADC-Rule-
Definition AVP of the ADC rule. For a predefined ADC rule, the monitoring key
shall be included in the rule definition at the TDF.
#### 4b.5.1.6 Marking of downlink packets
The PCRF may provide the packet marking instruction (i.e. marking of downlink
packets of the detected application traffic) for a dynamic ADC rule to the
TDF. The provisioning shall be performed using the ADC rule provisioning
procedure. The marking instruction shall be encoded using a ToS-Traffic-Class
AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP of the dynamic ADC rule.
If the ToS-Traffic-Class AVP is provided, all downlink packets belonging to
the detected application\'s traffic are marked with this value.
### 4b.5.2 Request for ADC rules
The TDF shall indicate, via the Sd reference point, a request for ADC rules
during the active TDF session established with PCRF, when a provisioned Event
trigger is met. The TDF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set
to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\". Additionally, the TDF shall supply the
specific event which caused the request (within the Event-Trigger AVP) and any
previously provisioned affected ADC rule(s) The ADC rules and their status
shall be supplied to PCRF within the ADC-Rule-Report AVP.
ADC rules can also be requested as a consequence of a failure in the ADC rule
installation/activation or enforcement without requiring an Event-Trigger. For
the additional information see clause 4b.5.5.
### 4b.5.3 Provisioning of Event Triggers
The PCRF may provide one or several event triggers within one or several
Event-Trigger AVP to the TDF using the ADC rule provision procedure. Event
triggers may be used to determine which event causes the TDF to inform PCRF
once occur. Provisioning of event triggers from the PCRF to the TDF shall be
done at TDF session level. The Event-Trigger AVP may be provided in
combination with the initial or subsequent ADC rule provisioning in TSR, RAR
or CCA message.
The PCRF may add new event triggers or remove the already provided ones. In
order to do so, the PCRF shall provide the new complete list of applicable
event triggers including the needed provisioned Event-Trigger AVPs in the CCA
or RAR commands.
The PCRF may remove all previously provided event triggers by providing the
Event-Trigger AVP set to the value NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS. When an Event-Trigger
AVP is provided with this value, no other Event-Trigger AVP shall be provided
in the CCA or RAR command. Upon reception of an Event-Trigger AVP with this
value, the TDF shall not inform PCRF of any event.
If no Event-Trigger AVP is included in a CCA or RAR operation, any previously
provisioned event trigger shall still be applicable.
There are event triggers that are required to be unconditionally reported from
the TDF to the PCRF as specified in clause 5.3.7 even though the PCRF has not
provisioned them to the TDF.
### 4b.5.4 Request of TDF Session Termination
When the corresponding IP-CAN session is terminated or at any point of time
when the PCRF decides that the session with TDF is to be terminated (e.g.
subscriber profile changes), the PCRF shall send a RAR command including the
Session-Release-Cause AVP to the TDF. The TDF shall acknowledge the command by
sending a RAA command to the PCRF and instantly remove/deactivate all the ADC
rules that have been previously installed or activated on that TDF session.
The TDF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" to PCRF to terminate the TDF session.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the TDF.
NOTE 1: According to DCC procedures, the Diameter Credit Control session is
being terminated with this message exchange, as specified in IETF RFC 4006
[9].
Signalling flows for the TDF session termination are presented in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
### 4b.5.5 ADC Rule Error Handling
If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails, the TDF shall
include one or more ADC-Rule-Report AVP(s) in either a TSA, a CCR or an RAA
command as described below for the affected ADC rules. Within each ADC-Rule-
Report AVP, the TDF shall identify the failed ADC rule(s) by including the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP(s) or ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), shall identify the failed
reason code by including a Rule-Failure-Code AVP, and shall include the PCC-
Rule-Status AVP as described below:
\- If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails using a PUSH
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using TSR or RAR command), the
TDF shall communicate the failure to the PCRF in the corresponding TSA/RAA
response.
\- If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails using a PULL
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using a CCA command), the TDF
shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and include the Rule-Failure-Code AVP.
If the installation/activation of one or more new ADC rules (i.e., rules which
were not previously successfully installed) fails, the TDF shall set the PCC-
Rule-Status to INACTIVE for both the PUSH and the PULL modes.
If the modification of a currently active ADC rule using PUSH mode fails, the
TDF shall retain the existing ADC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing ADC rule.
The TDF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the TSA/RAA
command.
If the modification of a currently active ADC rule using PULL mode fails, the
TDF shall retain the existing ADC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing ADC rule.
The TDF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the CCR
command.
Depending on the value of the Rule-Failure-Code for PULL and PUSH mode, the
PCRF may decide whether retaining of the old ADC rule, re-installation,
modification, removal of the ADC rule or any other action applies.
If an ADC rule was successfully installed/activated, but can no longer be
enforced by the TDF, the TDF shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and include
an ADC-Rule-Report AVP. The TDF shall include the Rule-Failure-Code AVP within
the ADC-Rule-Report AVP and shall set the PCC-Rule-Status to INACTIVE.
### 4b.5.6 Requesting Usage Monitoring Control
The PCRF may indicate, via the Sd reference point, the need to apply
monitoring control for the accumulated usage of network resources on a per TDF
session basis. Usage is defined as volume or time of user plane traffic.
Monitoring for volume usage and time usage can be performed in parallel. The
data collection for usage monitoring control shall be performed per monitoring
key, which may apply to one application (i.e. the monitoring key is used by a
single ADC rule), or to several applications (i.e., the monitoring key is used
by many ADC rules), or all detected traffic belonging to a specific TDF
session. If the usage monitoring of a TDF session level is enabled, the PCRF
may request the TDF to exclude one application or several applications from
the usage monitoring of the TDF session level.
If the PCRF requests usage monitoring control and if at this time, the PCRF is
not subscribed to the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger, the PCRF shall include
the Event-Trigger AVP, set to the value \"USAGE_REPORT\", in a TS-Request, CC-
Answer or RA-Request.
At TDF session establishment and modification, the PCRF may provide the
applicable thresholds, volume threshold, time threshold or both volume
threshold and time threshold, for usage monitoring control to the TDF,
together with the respective monitoring keys. To provide the initial threshold
for one or more monitoring key(s), the PCRF may include the threshold in
either TSR, RAR or in the response of a CCR, initiated by the TDF.
During the IP-CAN session establishment, the PCRF may receive information
about total allowed usage per PDN and UE from the SPR, i.e. the overall amount
of allowed traffic volume and/or time of usage that are to be monitored per
PDN and UE and/or total allowed usage for Monitoring key(s) per PDN and UE and
should use it when making a decisions about usage monitoring control.
In order to provide the applicable threshold for usage monitoring control, the
PCRF shall include a Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key. The
threshold level shall be provided in its Granted-Service-Unit AVP. Threshold
levels may be defined for:
\- the total volume only; or
\- the uplink volume only; or
\- the downlink volume only; or
\- the uplink and downlink volume; or
\- the time.
The PCRF shall provide the applicable volume threshold(s) in the CC-Total-
Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs and/or time threshold in the
CC-Time AVP of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP. The monitoring key shall be
provided in the Monitoring-Key AVP. The PCRF may provide multiple usage
monitoring control instances. The PCRF shall indicate if the usage monitoring
instance applies to the TDF session or to one or more ADC rules. For this
purpose, the Usage-Monitoring-Level AVP may be provided with a value
respectively set to SESSION_LEVEL or ADC_RULE_LEVEL. The PCRF may provide one
usage monitoring control instance applicable at TDF session level and one or
more usage monitoring instances applicable at ADC Rule level. If the TDF
session level usage monitoring is enabled and if the application(s) need to be
excluded from TDF session level usage monitoring, the PCRF shall provide an
indication of exclusion from session level monitoring associated with the
respective ADC rule(s) by including the Monitoring-Flags AVP with the bit 0
set in the corresponding ADC-Rule-Install AVP when the PCRF installs or
updates the ADC rule(s). If the exclusion is enabled, the PCRF may disable the
exclusion again by including the Monitoring-Flags AVP with the bit 0 not set
in the corresponding ADC-Rule-Install AVP.
The PCRF may provide a Monitoring-Time AVP to the TDF for the monitoring
keys(s) in order to receive reports for the accumulated usage before and after
the monitoring time occurs within the report triggered by the events defined
in 4b.5.7.2-4b.5.7.6. In such a case, there may be two instances of Granted-
Service-Unit AVP within Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key.
One of them indicates the threshold levels before the monitoring time occurs,
and the other one, which includes Monitoring-Time AVP, indicates the
subsequent threshold levels after the monitoring time occurs.The detailed
functionality in such a case is defined by 4b.5.7.7.
If the PCRF wishes to modify the threshold level for one or more monitoring
keys, the PCRF shall provide the thresholds for all the different levels
applicable to the corresponding monitoring key(s).
If the PCRF wishes to modify the monitoring key for the TDF session level
usage monitoring instance, it shall disable the existing session level
monitoring usage instance following the procedures defined in 4b.5.7.4 and
shall provide a new TDF session level usage monitoring instance following the
procedures defined in this clause. The PCRF may enable the new TDF session
level usage monitoring instance and disable the existing TDF session level
usage monitoring instance in the same command.
When the accumulated usage is reported in a CCR command, the PCRF shall
indicate to the TDF if usage monitoring shall continue for that TDF session,
usage monitoring key, or both as follows:
\- If monitoring shall continue for specific level(s), the PCRF shall provide
the new thresholds for the level(s) in the CC-Answer using the same AVP as
before (CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets, CC-Output-Octets or CC-Time AVPs
within the Granted-Service-Unit AVP);
\- otherwise, if the PCRF wishes to stop monitoring for specific level(s) the
PCRF shall not include an updated threshold in the CCA command for the stopped
level(s) i.e. the corresponding CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets, CC-Output-
Octets or CC-Time AVPs shall not be included within Granted-Service-Units AVP.
If both volume and time thresholds were provided and the threshold for one of
the measurements is reached, the TDF shall report this event to the PCRF and
the accumulated usage since last report shall be reported for both
measurements.
When usage monitoring is enabled, the PCRF may request the TDF to report
accumulated usage for all enabled monitoring or selected monitoring keys
regardless if a usage threshold has been reached by sending to the TDF within
the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP the Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to
the value USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED. The PCRF shall only require TDF to
report accumulated usage for one or more monitoring keys in a CC-Answer when
the TDF has not provided accumulated usage in the CC-Request for the same
monitoring key(s).
To specify the usage monitoring key for which usage is requested, the PCRF
shall include the usage monitoring key within the Monitoring-Key AVP within
the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. To request usage be reported for all
enabled usage monitoring keys, the PCRF shall omit the Monitoring-Key.
The PCRF shall process the usage reports and shall perform the actions as
appropriate for each report.
### 4b.5.7 Reporting Accumulated Usage
#### 4b.5.7.1 General
When usage monitoring is enabled, the TDF shall measure the volume and/or the
time of usage of the TDF session or the volume and/or the time of usage of the
particular application (s). The TDF shall be able to support volume and time
measurements simultaneously for a given application(s). If the ADC rule is
installed or updated with the Monitoring-Flags AVP with the bit 0 set, the TDF
shall not include the corresponding application in the volume and/or time
measurement on TDF session level.
When the time based usage monitoring is supported, the PCRF may optionally
indicate to the TDF, along with other usage monitoring information provided,
the Inactivity Detection Time within the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP. This
value represents the time interval after which the time measurement shall stop
for the Monitoring Key, if no packets are received belonging to the
corresponding Monitoring Key. Time measurement shall resume again on receipt
of a further packet belonging to the Monitoring Key.
Time measurement for a Monitoring key shall also be stopped when time based
usage monitoring is disabled, if this happens before the Inactivity Detection
Time is reached.
If an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity
Detection Time is present within the usage monitoring information provided by
the PCRF, the time measurement shall be performed continuously from the point
at the first packet is received matching the applicable Monitoring Key and
until time based usage monitoring is disabled.
The TDF shall report accumulated usage to the PCRF in the following
conditions:
\- when a usage threshold is reached;
\- when all ADC rules for which usage monitoring is enabled for a particular
usage monitoring key are removed or deactivated;
\- when usage monitoring is explicitly disabled by the PCRF;
\- when a TDF session is terminated;
\- when requested by the PCRF.
To report accumulated usage for a specific monitoring key, the TDF shall send
a CC-Request with the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
accumulated usage since the last report. The Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP
shall include the monitoring key in the Monitoring-Key AVP and the accumulated
volume usage in the Used-Service-Unit AVP. Accumulated volume reporting shall
be done for the total volume, the uplink volume or the downlink volume as
requested by the PCRF, and set in CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-
Output-Octets AVPs of Used-Service-Unit AVP respectively. Accumulated time
reporting shall be set in the CC-Time AVP of Used-Service-Unit AVP. The TDF
shall continue to perform volume measurement after the report until instructed
by the PCRF to stop the monitoring. If both volume and time measurements are
requested by the PCRF and the threshold for one of the measurements is
reached, the TDF shall report this event to the PCRF and the accumulated usage
since last report shall be reported for both measurements.
In case a Monitoring-Time AVP was provided by the PCRF within one instance of
the Granted-Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information
AVP for the usage monitoring control request, the PCEF shall report as defined
in 4b.5.7.7.
For cases, where the PCRF indicates in a CC-Answer command whether the usage
monitoring shall continue as a response to the reporting of accumulated usage
in a CCR command, the TDF shall behave as follows:
\- if the PCRF provisions an updated usage threshold in the CCA command, the
monitoring continues using the updated threshold value provisioned by the
PCRF;
\- otherwise, if the PCRF does not include an updated usage threshold in the
CCA command, the TDF shall not continue usage monitoring for that TDF session,
usage monitoring key, or both as applicable.
NOTE: When the PCRF indicates that usage monitoring shall not continue in the
CCA, the TDF does not report usage which has accumulated between sending the
CCR and receiving the CCA.
Upon receiving the reported usage from the TDF, the PCRF shall deduct the
value of the usage report from the total allowed usage for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as applicable, and the PCRF may also
derive the ADC rules based on the remaining allowed usage or reported usage
and provision them to the TDF.
Additional procedures for each of the scenarios above are described in the
following clauses of 4b.5.7.
#### 4b.5.7.2 Usage Threshold Reached
When usage monitoring is enabled for a particular monitoring key, the TDF
shall measure the volume and/or the time of usage of all traffic for the TDF
session or the corresponding application (s) and notify the PCRF when a usage
threshold for that monitoring key is reached and report the accumulated usage
for that monitoring key and include the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger in a
CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\" by
following the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause
4b.5.7.1.
#### 4b.5.7.3 ADC Rule Removal
When the PCRF removes or deactivates the last ADC rule associated with a usage
monitoring key in an RAR or CCA command in response to a CCR command not
related to reporting usage for the same monitoring key, the TDF shall send a
new CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\"
including the Event-Trigger set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report accumulated
usage for the usage monitoring key within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP
using the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause 4b.5.7.1.
When the TDF reports that the last ADC rule associated with a usage monitoring
key is inactive, the TDF shall report the accumulated usage for that
monitoring key within the same CCR command if the ADC-Rule-Report AVP was
included in a CCR command; otherwise, if the ADC-Rule-Report AVP was included
in an RAA command, the TDF shall send a new CCR command to report accumulated
usage for the usage monitoring key.
#### 4b.5.7.4 Usage Monitoring Disabled
Once enabled, the PCRF may explicitly disable usage monitoring as a result of
receiving a CCR from the TDF which is not related to reporting usage, but
related to other external triggers (e.g. subscriber profile update), or a PCRF
internal trigger. When the PCRF disables usage monitoring, the TDF shall
report the accumulated usage which has occurred while usage monitoring was
enabled since the last report.
To disable usage monitoring for a monitoring key, the PCRF shall send the
Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including only the applicable monitoring key
within the Monitoring-Key AVP and the Usage-Monitoring-Support AVP set to
USAGE_MONITORING_DISABLED.
When the PCRF disables usage monitoring in a RAR or CCA command, the TDF shall
send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report
accumulated usage for the disabled usage monitoring key(s).
#### 4b.5.7.5 TDF Session Termination
At TDF session termination, the TDF shall send the accumulated usage
information for all monitoring keys for which usage monitoring is enabled in
the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" using the procedures to report accumulated usage
defined in clause 4b.5.7.1.
#### 4b.5.7.6 PCRF Requested Usage Report
When the TDF receives the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to the value USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED,
the TDF shall send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report
accumulated usage for the monitoring key received in the Usage-Monitoring-
Information AVP using the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in
clause 4b.5.7, e.g. if the volume threshold and time threshold were provided,
the TDF shall report the volume usage and time of usage. If the Monitoring-Key
AVP was omitted in the received Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP, the TDF
shall send the accumulated usage for all the monitoring keys that were enabled
at the time the Usage-Monitoring-Information was received.
#### 4b.5.7.7 Report in case of Monitoring Time provided
If Monitoring-Time AVP was provided within one instance of the Granted-
Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP by the
PCRF, and if the TDF needs to report the accumulated usage when one of the
events defined in subclauses 4b.5.7.2-4b.5.7.6 occurs before the monitoring
time, the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage as defined subclauses
4b.5.7.2-4b.5.7.6 and the TDF shall not retain the monitoring time; otherwise,
\- If two instances of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP are provided by the PCRF,
then the TDF shall, at the monitoring time, reset the usage threshold to the
value of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP with the Monitoring-Time AVP.
\- If only one instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP is provided by the
PCRF, then the TDF shall, at the monitoring time, reset the usage threshold to
the remaining value of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP previously sent by the
PCRF (i.e. excluding the accumulated volume and/or time usage).
\- For both cases, the usage report from the TDF shall include two instances
of the Used-Service-Unit AVP, one of them to indicate the usage before the
monitoring time and the other one accompanied by the Monitoring-Time AVP under
the same Used-Service-Unit AVP to indicate the usage after the monitoring
time.
When PCRF receives the accumulated usage report in a CCR command, the PCRF
shall indicate to the TDF if usage monitoring shall continue as defined in
clause 4b.5.6. The PCRF may provide the Monitoring-Time AVP again within one
instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP if reports for the accumulated usage
before and after the provided monitoring time are required.
### 4b.5.8 Provisioning of Event Report Indication
The TDF may request from the PCRF to be informed about specific changes
occurred in the location information/access network information in either a
TSA, a CCR or an RAA command. In this case, the PCRF shall subscribe to the
appropriate event triggers in the PCEF according to clause 4.5.3 or in the
BBERF according to clause 4a.5.8.
NOTE 1: In case the IP flow mobility feature is enabled, the TDF doesn\'t have
accurate information about the location and the type of RAT the user is
attached to.
After receiving the reply of the event subscription from the PCEF or the
BBERF, the PCRF shall send the event related information to the TDF by using a
RAR command.
When PCRF is notified that an event is triggered in the PCEF or the BBERF, if
the TDF has previously requested to be informed of the specific event, the
PCRF shall notify the TDF about the event occurred together with additional
related information (i.e. the parameter value). This notification shall be
done by using the Event-Report-Indication AVP. There may be neither ADC Rule
provisioning nor Event Trigger provisioning together with event report
indication in this message.
When PCRF is notified by PCEF that either an UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE or an
UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE event of the IP-CAN session occurs in the PCEF, the PCRF
shall notify the TDF about the event for the corresponding TDF session. The
Framed-IP-Address AVP shall also be provided. This notification shall also be
done by using the Event-Report-Indication AVP within a RAR command. There may
be neither ADC Rules nor Event Triggers in this message. If the PCRF notifies
of the new UE Ipv4 address to the TDF, the TDF shall additionally apply the
ADC rules to the user plane traffic with the IP address matching the new UE
Ipv4 address and report the detected application information via the
corresponding TDF session. If the PCRF notifies to the TDF that the UE Ipv4
address has been released, the TDF shall stop applying the ADC rule to the
user plane traffic with IP address matching the released UE Ipv4 address.
NOTE 2: The TDF does not need to subscribe the notification of the
UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE and UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE.
Whenever the TDF subscribes to an event report indication by using the TSA,
CCR or RAA command, the PCRF shall only send the corresponding currently
applicable values which have been updated (e.g. 3GPP-User-Location-Info,
3GPP2-BSID, etc.) to the TDF in the RAR or CCA if available. In this case, the
Event-Trigger AVPs shall not be included.
NOTE 3: The PCRF can get the currently applicable values during the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure or during the information reporting from the
BBERF when the BBERF gets event subscription from the PCRF as defined in
clause 5.3.7.
### 4b.5.9 Application Detection Information
For the solicited application reporting, the PCRF may instruct the TDF to
detect application (s) by providing the ADC-Rule-Install AVP (s) with the
corresponding parameters as follows: the application to be detected is
identified by the TDF-Application-Identifier AVP, which is either provided
under ADC-Rule-Definition AVP for dynamic ADC Rules or pre-provisioned for the
corresponding predefined ADC Rule, and in such a case only ADC-Rule-Name/ADC-
Rule-Base-Name is provided . If the PCRF requires to be reported about when
the application start/stop is detected, it shall also subscribe to the
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers. The PCRF may also mute
such a notification about a specific detected application by providing Mute-
Notification within the corresponding ADC-Rule-Definition AVP.
When the start or stop of the application\'s traffic, identified by TDF-
Application-Identifier, is detected, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the
APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, unless a request to mute
such a notification (Mute-Notification AVP ) is part of the corresponding ADC-
Rule-Definition AVP, the TDF shall report the information regarding the
detected application\'s traffic in the Application-Detection-Information AVP
in the CCR command even if the application traffic is discarded due to
enforcement actions of the ADC rule.
The corresponding TDF-Application-Identifier AVP shall be included under
Application-Detection-Information AVP. When the Event trigger indicates
APPLICATION_START, the Flow-Information AVP for the detected application may
be included under Application-Detection-Information AVP, if deducible. The
Flow-Information AVP, if present, shall contain the Flow-Description AVP and
Flow-Direction AVP. The TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier, which is
dynamically assigned by the TDF in order to allow correlation of
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers to the specific Flow-
Information AVP, if service data flow descriptions are deducible, shall also
be provided. Also, the corresponding Event-Trigger (APPLICATION_START or
APPLICATION_STOP) shall be provided to PCRF. When the TDF-Application-
Instance-Identifier is provided along with the APPLICATION_START, it shall
also be provided along with the corresponding APPLICATION_STOP. The PCRF then
may make the policy decision based on the information received and send the
updated PCC rules to the PCEF, updated QoS rules to the BBERF, if applicable,
and the updated ADC rules to the TDF.
When a PFD provisioned by the PFDF is removed/modified and the
removed/modified PFD was used to detect application traffic related to an
application identifier in an ADC Rule installed or activated for an TDF
session, if the removed/modified PFD in TDF results in that the stop of an
application or an application instance is not able to be detected, and if the
TDF has reported the application start as described in this subclause to the
PCRF for the application or application instance represented by this PFD, the
TDF shall report the application stop to the PCRF for the corresponding
application or the corresponding application instance.
NOTE: Multiple PFDs can be associated with the application identifier. When
the removed/modified PFD is the last one which is used to detect traffic
identified by TDF-Application-Identifier AVP, the TDF reports application
stop.
### 4b.5.10 Time of the day procedures
TDF shall be able to perform ADC rule request based on time as instructed by
the PCRF in a TSR, CCA or a RAR commands. To do so, the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT (17) if the event
trigger is not previously set, and in addition the Revalidation-Time, when set
by the PCRF. This shall cause the TDF to trigger a PCRF interaction to request
ADC rules from the PCRF for an established TDF session. The TDF shall stop the
timer once the TDF triggers an REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event.
PCRF shall be able to provide a new value for the revalidation timeout by
including Revalidation-Time in CCA or RAR. The PCRF may provide the
Revalidation-Time AVP together with the event trigger REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT or
in a subsequent ADC rule provisioning.
PCRF shall be able to stop the ADC revalidation timer by disabling the
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event trigger.
NOTE 1: By disabling the REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT the revalidation time value
previously provided to the TDF is not applicable anymore.
The PCRF may control at what time the status of an ADC rule changes.
1) If Rule-Activation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the TDF shall set the ADC rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Rule-Activation-Time has passed, then the TDF shall immediately set the ADC
rule active.
2) If Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the TDF shall set the ADC rule active and make it inactive at that time. If
Rule-Deactivation-Time has passed, then the TDF shall immediately set the ADC
rule inactive.
3) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, and also
when the ADC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, the TDF shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then as
defined in 2),
4) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, and also
when the ADC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Activation-Time., the TDF shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as
defined in 1),
5) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, then the TDF shall immediately set the ADC rule inactive.
6) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the
Rule-Activation-Time, then the PCEF shall immediately set the ADC rule active.
ADC Rule Activation or Deactivation shall not generate any CCR commands with
ADC-Rule-Report since PCRF is already aware of the state of the rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified in the ADC-
Rule-Install, then it shall replace the previously set values for the
specified ADC rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time AVP, Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP or both AVPs are
omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is no longer valid.
The 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available, may be used by the PCRF and by the TDF
to derive the Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time.
### 4b.5.11 PCRF Failure and Restoration
If the TDF needs to send a TDF Session update request (e.g. following usage
threshold reached) towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the
TDF Session establishment, the TDF should not send the TDF Session update
request towards a PCRF, and the TDF may clean up the TDF session related
information.
NOTE 1: This mechanism in the TDF removes all application traffic control on
the PDN connection and has no effect on the state of the PDN connection. It is
expected that the PCEF will perform the same detection and clean up of PDN
connections affected by the PCRF failure and restoration
NOTE 2: The method the TDF uses to determine that a PCRF has restarted is not
specified in this release.
### 4b.5.12 Bandwidth limitation function
The PCRF may provide the maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) to the TDF.
The maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) shall be provisioned within a TSR, CCA or
RAR Diameter message as QoS-Information AVP. Only the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-
UL AVP and the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP or the Extended-Max-Requested-
BW-UL AVP and the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-DL AVP (see subclause 4b.5.17)
shall be used. The maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) can refer to a detected
application\'s traffic or to a TDF session.
\- When the maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) applies to a detected
application\'s traffic, see clause 4b.5.1.3.
\- When the maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) applies to a TDF session, the
provisioning is done outside an ADC-Rule-Definition AVP at command level. The
allowed QoS shall be encoded using a QoS-Information AVP. Only the Max-
Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP and the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP or the
Extended-Max-Requested-BW-UL AVP and the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-DL AVP (see
subclause 4b.5.17) shall be used. If QoS-Information is provided at command
level, the TDF shall enforce the corresponding policy for the TDF session.
NOTE: In case the maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) applies to a TDF session, in
order to avoid down-link packets being discarded in PCEF when TDF performs
charging, the PCRF has to set the Maximum downlink bit rate to the DL APN-
AMBR.
### 4b.5.13 Provisioning of charging related information for the TDF session
#### 4b.5.13.1 Provisioning of Charging Addresses
In combination with the initial ADC rule provisioning only, the PCRF may
provide OFCS and/or OCS addresses within a Charging-Information AVP to the TDF
within the TSR command defining the offline and online charging system
addresses respectively. These shall overwrite any predefined addresses at the
TDF. Both primary and secondary addresses for OFCS and/or OCS shall be
provided simultaneously. Provisioning of OFCS and/or OCS addresses without ADC
rules for offline or online charged applications, respectively, shall not be
considered as an error since such ADC rules may be provided in later
provisioning.
If no OCS address is available at the TDF (i.e. no predefined OCS addresses,
and no OCS addresses supplied by the PCRF), the TDF shall use the IMSI (MNC
and MCC values) of the user to construct the OCS Home network domain name as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [25], clause 25.
#### 4b.5.13.2 Provisioning of Default Charging Method
The default charging method indicates what charging method shall be used for
every ADC rule where the charging method is omitted. The TDF may have a pre-
configured Default charging method.
Upon the initial interaction with the TDF, the PCRF may provide default
charging method within the Online AVP or Offline AVP embedded directly within
the TSR command to the TDF. The default charging method provided by the PCRF
shall overwrite any predefined default charging method at the TDF.
#### 4b.5.13.3 Provisioning of Charging Characteristics
Upon the initial interaction with the TDF, if Charging Characteristics are
received from the PCEF and charging is applicable to the TDF, the PCRF shall
provide Charging Characteristics within 3GPPâ€‘Chargingâ€‘Characteristics AVP
within the TSR command to the TDF. In addition, if Charging Characteristics
are received by the PCRF from the PCEF, the PCRF may take them into account to
also provide Chargingâ€‘Information AVP, Online AVP and Offline AVP to the TDF.
In case the TDF receives 3GPPâ€‘Chargingâ€‘Characteristics AVP in addition to
Chargingâ€‘Information AVP, Online AVP and/or Offline AVP, then the
Chargingâ€‘Information AVP, Online AVP or Offline AVP shall supersede the values
determined from the received 3GPP-Charging-Characteristics AVP.
### 4b.5.14 Downlink packet marking by the TDF
For the solicited application reporting, typically for applications with non-
deducible service data flows, the PCRF may instruct the TDF to detect
application(s) and to mark the detected application traffic in the downlink
direction with DSCP value by providing DL DSCP value encoded by ToS-Traffic-
Class AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP.
NOTE 1: Unless a class of applications matches the definition of a DSCP value
standardised by IETF, DSCP values with no standardised meaning in IETF are
used. DSCP values in ranges reserved by IANA for \"experimental or Local Use\"
are suitable.
NOTE 2: Using DSCP values with no standardised meaning in IETF prevents any IP
router between TDF and PCEF to perform differentiated service scheduling for
related IP packets unless it is updated or configured to support those DSCP
values. This implies that sufficient network capacity need to be guaranteed
along the path between the TDF and PCEF so that the disabling of DiffServ
packet forwarding has no detrimental impact on the end-to-end QoS.
NOTE 3: Marking of DSCP bits for this purpose can interfere with appropriate
traffic handling in some operator transport networks. The DSCP marking can
also get remarked by routing entities within the operator networks.
NOTE 4: If the application sets DSCP marking that is used for policy and
charging control in the PCEF, either no ADC Rule is installed in the TDF
matching this application traffic or if an ADC Rule is installed, then DSCP
marking is not enabled. When TDF sets DSCP to values used for policy and
charging control, network configuration needs to prevent an untrusted source
from getting unplanned QoS and charging and also prevent remapping of this
traffic between the application and the TDF.
In order to ensure that the DL DSCP value used for service data flow detection
is not visible to the operator\'s transport network, based on operator
configuration, a tunnelling protocol may be used between the TDF and the PCEF.
In case tunnelling is used, the DL DSCP value encoded with the received ToS-
Traffic-Class AVP shall be carried in the inner IP header. The DSCP value used
in the operator\'s transport network is carried in the outer IP header of the
tunnel.
NOTE 5: The tunnel connections are preconfigured in the IP infrastructure
connecting the TDF and the PCEF. The operator needs to ensure the same tunnel
configuration is used for the TDF and for the PCEF. The tunnel protocol can be
any applicable IP-based tunnel depending on operatorÂ´s choice.
### 4b.5.15 Traffic steering control support
This procedure takes place if the TSC feature as defined in subclause 5 b.4.1
is supported.
The PCRF may instruct the TDF to apply a traffic steering control which
consists of applying a specific (S)Gi-LAN traffic steering policy for the
traffic detected based on application level information or service data flow
level information. The PCRF achieves this by providing the ADC-Rule-Definition
AVP within the ADC-Rule-Install AVP (s) with the corresponding parameters as
follows:
\- either the application to be detected is identified by the TDF-Application-
Identifier AVP or
\- the service data flow to be detected is identified by the Flow-Information
AVP(s)
\- and the traffic steering policy identifier(s) within the Traffic-Steering-
Policy-Identifier-DL AVP and/or Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP.
The PCRF may also provision the traffic steering control information by
activating the pre-defined ADC rule(s) in the TDF.
When a combination of TDF with traffic steering control feature and TSSF is
deployed, the TDF shall behave as specified in subclause 6.1.17 of 3GPP TS
23.203 [7]. In this case, the PCRF shall include the packet marking
information within the Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-DL AVP and/or
Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP included within the ADC-Rule-
Definition AVP. The PCRF shall ensure that the value included in these AVP(s)
is aligned with the traffic detection information provided over the St
reference point. That is, it shall ensure that the value is the same as the
applicable value provided as part of the service data flow information or as
the value(s) configured in the TSSF referred by the application identifier.
See subclause 4c.4.1 in this Technical Specification for the details in the
Diameter based St reference point. See 3GPP TS 29.155 [52] for the details in
the REST based St reference point.
NOTE: The PCRF and the TDF are configured with the packet marking and
forwarding mechanism to be applied in the TDF. This information will be
aligned with the information configured in the TSSF for traffic detection. The
flow information provided over St reference point can be used for traffic
detection at the TSSF when the TDF is configured to do packet marking and
forwarding using e.g. ToS value in the IP header. The Application Identifier
provided over St reference point can be used when the TDF is configured to do
packet marking and forwarding using e.g. GRE or NSH.
### 4b.5.16 Sponsored Data Connectivity
Sponsored data connectivity may be performed for service data flows associated
with one or more ADC rules if the information about the sponsor, the
application service provider and optionally the threshold values are provided
by the AF and if the AF has not indicated to disable/not enable sponsored data
connectivity as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] subclauses 4.4.1 and 4.4.2.
The provisioning of sponsored data connectivity per ADC rule shall be
performed using the ADC rule provisioning procedure. The sponsor identity
shall be set using the Sponsor-Identity AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP
of the ADC rule. The application service provider identity shall be set using
the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition
AVP of the ADC rule. Sponsor-Identity AVP and Application-Service-Provider-
Identity AVP shall be included if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL.
When receiving the usage thresholds from the AF, the PCRF shall use the
sponsor identity to generate a monitoring key and request usage monitoring
control for the monitoring key by following the procedures specified in
subclauses 4b.5.1.5 and 4b.5.6.
When the AF disables sponsoring a service (See 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] subclause
4.4.2), the PCRF
\- may modify the ADC rules in order to set the Reporting-Level AVP to
SERVICE_IDENTIFIER_LEVEL or RATING_GROUP_LEVEL and not include the Sponsor-
Identity AVP and Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP if they were
included previously.
\- may modify the ADC rules to update the charging key.
NOTE 1: A specific charging key can be applied to the sponsored data
connectivity for online charging.
\- shall disable the usage monitoring for the sponsored data connectivity
according to subclause 4b.5.7.4 if it was enabled previously. As a result,
PCRF gets the accumulated usage of the sponsored data connectivity.
NOTE 2: It depends on the implementation whether the solutions defined in
Annex F can be used to disable the usage monitoring.
### 4b.5.17 Extended bandwidth support for EPC supporting Dual Connectivity
(E-UTRAN and 5G NR)
When the Extended-BW-NR feature is supported, extended bandwidth support as
described in subclause 4.5.30 applies.
When the TDF session is being established in solicited mode and if the PCRF
supports the Extended-BW-NR feature the same behaviour as described in
subclause 4.5.30 applies for all the QoS information provided in the TSR
command.
## 4b.5a ADC procedures over Sd reference point for unsolicited application
reporting
### 4b.5a.1 Provisioning of ADC rules
#### 4b.5a.1.1 General
If a TDF is configured for unsolicited reporting, the TDF is pre-configured
with ADC rules which specify which applications to detect and report. These
rules are always active and are not controlled by the PCRF.
### 4b.5a.2 Application Detection Information
When the start or stop of the application\'s traffic, identified by TDF-
Application-Identifier, is detected, the TDF shall report the information
regarding the detected application\'s traffic in the Application-Detection-
Information AVP in the CCR command.
1) When the TDF detects an application for an Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address for
which a TDF session does not exist, the TDF shall send CC-Request with CC-
Request-Type set to value \"INITIAL-REQUEST\". The TDF provides the full UE IP
address using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP and, if
available, the PDN identifier. The corresponding CCA may contain the Ipv6
prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVPs if the established TDF session is
Ipv6 address related.
2) When an application is detected for an Ipv4 address or Ipv6 Prefix for
which a TDF session already exists, the TDF shall send CC-Request with CC-
Request-Type set to value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\".
NOTE: It is considered that a TDF session exists for a detected application
related to an Ipv6 address if the Ipv6 address belongs to the Ipv6 prefix
provided by the PCRF for that TDF session.
The corresponding TDF-Application-Identifier AVP shall be included under
Application-Detection-Information AVP. Also, the corresponding Event-Trigger
(APPLICATION_START or APPLICATION_STOP) shall be provided to PCRF. When the
Event trigger indicates APPLICATION_START, if deducible, the Flow-Information
AVP for the detected application shall be included under Application-
Detection-Information AVP. The Flow-Information AVP, if present, shall contain
the Flow-Description AVP and Flow-Direction AVP. The TDF-Application-Instance-
Identifier, which is dynamically assigned by the TDF in order to allow
correlation of APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers to the
specific Flow-Information AVP, if service data flow descriptions are
deducible, shall also be provided.
### 4b.5a.3 Request of TDF Session Termination
In the unsolicited reporting case the session termination procedure as defined
in clause 4b.5.4 is initiated in the following cases.
\- the corresponding IP-CAN session is terminated;
\- the Ipv4 address of a dual stack IP-CAN session is released and there is an
active Ipv4 address related TDF session for that IP-CAN session;
\- at any point of time when the PCRF decides that the session with TDF is to
be terminated (e.g. subscriber profile changes).
### 4b.5a.4 TDF session to Gx session linking
When the PCRF receives the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the PCRF links the TDF session to a Gx session, if
the UE Ipv4 address orUE Ipv6 address of the TDF session matches the UE Ipv4
address or UE Ipv6 prefix of the Gx session. The PDN information if available
in the Called-Station-Id AVP may also be used for this session linking.
When the PCRF checks if APNs within Called-Station-Id AVPs match each other,
the PCRF shall apply the APN matching procedures in Annex H of 3GPP TS 29.213
[8].
The TDF should handle each UE Ipv4 address and UE Ipv6 prefix, assuming the
max prefix length used in the access network, within a separate TDF session.
The PCRF shall link the separate UE Ipv4 address related TDF session and UE
Ipv6 address related TDF session to the same IP-CAN session and correlate the
TDF sessions.
NOTE 1: In the scenario where the TDF performs initial Application Detection
on multiple simultaneous traffic flows for the same UE Ipv6 prefix (i.e. two
or more traffic flows from UE Ipv6 addresses of the same IP-CAN session) the
TDF could not be aware that those flows belong to the same IP-CAN session
until a response is received from the PCRF, containing the UE Ipv6 prefix.
This leads to using separate TDF sessions for the UE Ipv6 addresses for the
same IP-CAN session. The TDF reports new application detection information
related to that UE Ipv6 prefix via any of the TDF sessions at a later stage.
# 4c St reference point
## 4c.1 Overview
The St reference point resides between the PCRF and TSSF. The St reference
point is used to provision the traffic steering control information from the
PCRF to the TSSF.
The stage 2 level requirements for the St reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7].
Signalling flows related to the St interface is specified in 3GPP TS 29.213
[8].
An alternative HTTP-based protocol for the St reference point is defined in
3GPP TS 29.155 [52].
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the St interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the St interface.
Refer to Annex K of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter load control procedures
over the St interface.
## 4c.2 St Reference model
The St reference point resides between the PCRF and TSSF. The relationship
between the different functional entities involved for non-roaming scenario is
depicted in figure 4c.2.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in
subclause 3a of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Figure 4c.2.1: The PCC architecture with the St for non-roaming scenario
NOTE: Traffic steering control with TSSF in roaming scenarios is in this
release only specified for the home routed access case. In this case, the TSSF
interacts with the H-PCRF.
## 4c.3 Functional elements
### 4c.3.1 PCRF
The PCRF functionality defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] is applicable. The PCRF
shall be able to make a decision of traffic steering policies used to control
the steering of the subscriber's traffic to appropriate (S)Gi-LAN service
functions. The PCRF shall inform the TSSF through the use of ADC rules, if
applicable, on the treatment of service data flows or applications, in
accordance with the PCRF policy decisions.
NOTE: In order to allow the PCRF to select and provision an application based
traffic steering policy, the reporting of detected applications to the PCRF or
any other information can be used.
### 4c.3.2 TSSF
The TSSF is a function that receives traffic steering control information from
the PCRF and ensures that the related traffic steering policy is enforced in
the (S)Gi-LAN.
A traffic steering policy is locally configured in TSSF and can be used for
uplink, downlink or for both directions. To ensure that the traffic steering
policy is enforced, the TSSF performs deployment specific actions as
configured for that traffic steering policy.
## 4c.4 Procedures over St reference point
### 4c.4.1 Traffic Steering Control Information Provisioning
If the PCRF determines at IP-CAN session establishment or at any later point
of time that the traffic steering control is needed for the IP-CAN session,
the PCRF shall indicate via the St reference point the traffic steering
control to be applied at the TSSF.
To indicate the traffic steering control information, the PCRF shall use the
following procedure.
If no active St Diameter session exists for the IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall
establish an St Diameter session by sending an TDF-Session-Request (TSR) to
the TSSF including the Request-Type AVP set to \"0 (initial request)\". Within
the TSR, the PCRF shall provide the UE IPv4 address within the Framed-IP-
Address AVP and/or UE IPv6 prefix within the Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP and ADC-
Rule-Install AVP(s) , and if required by the operator policies, the PDN
information within the Called-Station-Id AVP. The TSSF identifier is pre-
configured on the PCRF, e.g. per PCEF.
NOTE 1: How to cover a scenario where the same IP address is related to
different PDN connections within the same PDN is not addressed in the present
release.
If an active St Diameter session exists for the IP CAN session, the PCRF shall
send an TDF-Session-Request (TSR) to the TSSF including the Request-Type AVP
set to \"1 (update request)\" and ADC-Rule-Install AVP(s) and/or ADC-Rule-
Remove AVP(s).
The PCRF shall use the ADC rule to contain the traffic steering control
information. An ADC rule for traffic steering control, as defined within the
ADC-Rule-Definition AVP shall consist of:
\- a rule identifier within the ADC-Rule-Name AVP;
\- either an TDF-Application-Identifier AVP or service data flow filter(s)
within an Flow-Information AVP;
\- a Precedence AVP; and
\- Traffic steering policy identifier(s) within the Traffic-Steering-Policy-
Identifier-DL AVP and/or the Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP.
The PCRF may perform an operation on a single ADC rule by one of the following
means:
\- To activate or deactivate an ADC rule that is predefined at the TSSF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this ADC rule within an ADC-Rule-Name AVP
and indicate the required action by choosing either the ADC-Rule-Install AVP
or the ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned ADC rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding ADC-Rule-Definition AVP within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP.
\- To remove an ADC rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF,
the PCRF shall provision the name of this ADC rule as value of an ADC-Rule-
Name AVP within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
As an alternative to providing a single ADC rule, the PCRF may provide an ADC-
Rule-Base-Name AVP within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP or the ADC-Rule-Remove AVP
as a reference to a group of ADC rules predefined at the TSSF. With an ADC-
Rule-Install AVP, a predefined group of ADC rules is activated. With an ADC-
Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of ADC rules is deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above ADC rule operations in a single
command.
To activate a predefined ADC rule at the TSSF, the rule name within an ADC-
Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP as a reference
to the predefined rule. To activate a group of predefined ADC rules within the
TSSF, an ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Install
AVP as a reference to the group of predefined ADC rules.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined ADC rule, the
ADC-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If an ADC rule with the same rule name,
as supplied in the ADC-Rule-Name AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP,
already exists at the TSSF, the new ADC rule shall update the currently
installed rule. If the existing ADC rule already has attributes also included
in the new ADC rule definition, the existing attributes shall be overwritten.
Any attribute in the existing ADC rule not included in the new ADC rule
definition shall remain valid.
For deactivating single predefined or removing PCRF-provided ADC rules, the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP. For
deactivating a group of predefined ADC rules, the ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP shall
be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
The TSSF shall apply the ADC rules to the user plane traffic with the IP
address(es) matching the UE Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address and/or
the UE Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP , and the PDN the UE
accesses matching the PDN identifier within the Called-Station-Id AVP if
provided by the PCRF.
If the provisioning of ADC rules fails, the TSSF informs the PCRF as described
in subclause 4c.4.3. Depending on the cause, the PCRF may decide if re-
installation, modification, removal of ADC rules or any other action applies.
When a combination of PCEF/TDF with traffic steering control feature and TSSF
is deployed, the TSSF shall behave as specified in subclause 6.1.17 of 3GPP TS
23.203 [7]. In this case, the PCRF shall provide the traffic detection
information as part of the service data flow information included within the
Flow-Information AVP or within the TDF-Application-Identifier AVP. If traffic
detection is performed using the ToS-Traffic-Class AVP within the Flow-
Information AVP, the PCRF shall ensure that the ToS-Traffic-Class AVP included
within the Flow-Information AVP used for traffic detection is the same as the
value provided in the Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL and/or Traffic-
Steering-Policy-Identifier-DL AVP over Gx or Sd reference point. If traffic
detection is performed using the TDF-Application-Identifier AVP, the PCRF
shall ensure that the identifier included within the TDF-Application-
Identifier AVP refers to the configured value(s) in the TSSF that corresponds
to the value provided in the Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL and/or
Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-DL over Gx or Sd reference point. See
subclauses 4.5.2.8 and 4b.5.15 for the details in the Gx and Sd reference
points respectively.
NOTE 2: The PCRF and TSSF are configured with the traffic detection mechanism
to be applied when the TDF-Application-Identifier AVP is used for traffic
detection.
NOTE 3: The TDF-Application-Identifier AVP can refer to the configured traffic
detection information for uplink and/or downlink traffic.
### 4c.4.2 St Session Termination
When the corresponding IP-CAN session is terminated or at any point of time
when the PCRF decides that the session with TSSF is to be terminated (e.g.
subscriber profile changes), the PCRF shall send a STR command to the TSSF.
The TSSF shall acknowledge the command by sending a STA command to the PCRF
and instantly remove/deactivate all the ADC rules that have been previously
installed or activated on that St session.
### 4c.4.3 ADC Rule Error Handling
If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails, the TSSF shall
include one or more ADC-Rule-Report AVP(s) in the corresponding TSA command
for the affected ADC rules. Within each ADC-Rule-Report AVP, the TSSF shall
identify the failed ADC rule(s) by including the ADC-Rule-Name AVP(s) or ADC-
Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), shall identify the failed reason code by including a
Rule-Failure-Code AVP, and shall include the PCC-Rule-Status AVP as described
below:
If the installation/activation of one or more new ADC rules (i.e., rules which
were not previously successfully installed) fails, the TSSF shall set the PCC-
Rule-Status to INACTIVE.
If the modification of a currently active ADC rule fails, the TSSF shall
retain the existing ADC rule as active without any modification unless the
reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing ADC rule.
Depending on the value of the Rule-Failure-Code, the PCRF may decide whether
retaining of the old ADC rule, re-installation, modification, removal of the
ADC rule or any other action applies.
If an ADC rule was successfully installed/activated, but can no longer be
enforced by the TSSF, the TSSF shall send the PCRF a new TNR command and
include an ADC-Rule-Report AVP. The TSSF shall include the Rule-Failure-Code
AVP within the ADC-Rule-Report AVP and shall set the PCC-Rule-Status to
INACTIVE.
### 4c.4.4 UE IPv4 Address Provisioning
When PCRF is notified by PCEF that either an UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE or an
UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE event of the IP-CAN session occurs in the PCEF, the PCRF
shall notify the TSSF about the event for the corresponding St session by
including the UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE or the UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE event
trigger within the Event-Reporting-Indication AVP which is included in a TSR
command with the Request-Type AVP set to \"1 (update request)\". The Framed-
IP-Address AVP shall also be provided within the Event-Report-Indication AVP
when the UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE event trigger is included. If the PCRF
notifies of the new UE Ipv4 address to the TSSF, the TSSF shall additionally
apply the ADC rules to the user plane traffic with the IP address matching the
new UE Ipv4 address. If the PCRF notifies to the TSSF that the UE Ipv4 address
has been released, the TSSF shall stop applying the ADC rule to the user plane
traffic with IP address matching the released UE Ipv4 address.
NOTE 1: It is possible not to include ADC Rules in the TSR command.
NOTE 2: The TSSF does not need to subscribe the notification of the
UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE and UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE.
# 5 Gx protocol
## 5.1 Protocol support
The Gx protocol in the present release is based on Gx protocol defined for
Release 6 as specified in 3GPP TS 29.210 [2]. However, due to a new paradigm
(DCC session for an IP-CAN session) between Release 6 and the present release,
the Gx application in the present release has an own vendor specific Diameter
application.
The Gx application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application, where
the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Gx Application in the
present release is 16777238. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) need to be configured appropriately to
identify the 3GPP Gx application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order
to create suitable routeing tables.
The Gx application identification shall be included in the Auth-Application-Id
AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Gx interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element that
handles PCC Rule requests for a particular realm. The PCEF acts as the
Diameter client, in the sense that is the network element requesting PCC rules
in the transport plane network resources.
## 5.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and
PCEF pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance
of connections between Diameter nodes is described in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the PCEF shall
advertise the support of the Gx specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733
[61]).
The termination of the Diameter session on Gx can be initiated either by the
PCEF or PCRF, as specified in clauses 4.5.7 and 4.5.9, respectively.
## 5.3 Gx specific AVPs
### 5.3.0 General
Table 5.3.0.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Gx reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted, what access types (e.g. 3GPP-GPRS, etc.) the AVP is applicable
to, the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy control or both,
and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The Vendor-Id header of
all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to 3GPP (10415).

### 5.3.2 Charging-Rule-Install AVP (All access types)
The Charging-Rule-Install AVP (AVP code 1001) is of type Grouped, and it is
used to activate, install or modify PCC rules as instructed from the PCRF to
the PCEF.
For installing a new PCC rule or modifying a PCC rule already installed,
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used.
For activating a specific PCC rule predefined at the PCEF, Charging-Rule-Name
AVP shall be used as a reference for that PCC rule. The Charging-Rule-Base-
Name AVP is a reference that may be used for activating a group of PCC rules
predefined at the PCEF.
For GPRS scenarios where the bearer binding is performed by the PCRF, the
Bearer Identifier AVP shall be included as part of Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
If present within Charging-Rule-Install AVP, the Bearer-Identifier AVP
indicates that the PCC rules within this Charging-Rule-Install AVP shall be
installed or activated within the IP CAN bearer identified by the Bearer-
Identifier AVP.
If no Bearer-Identifier AVP is included within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP,
the PCEF shall select an IP CAN bearer for each of the PCC rules within this
Charging-Rule-Install AVP, where the PCC rule is installed or activated.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified then it applies
to all the PCC rules within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
If Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP is included then it applies to all the
rules within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP. If a Charging-Rule-Install AVP
does not include the Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP, the resource
allocation shall not be notified by the PCEF even if this AVP was present in
previous installations of the same rule.
If the Charging-Correlation-Indicator AVP is included within the Charging-
Rule-Install AVP, it indicates that the PCEF shall provide the assigned access
network charging identifier for the dynamic PCC Rules that are provided in the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP(s) within the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-
Gx AVP.
If the Monitoring-Flags AVP is included within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP,
it is used to indicate the monitoring action related to the corresponding
service data flow. It applies to all the PCC rules within the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP. If the Monitoring-Flags AVP is provided, the value will be valid
for the PCC rules until the new value is provided for the PCC rules.
IP-CAN-Type AVP identifies the access to be used for transporting the service
data flows in NBIFOM scenario. If the IP-CAN-Type AVP is omitted and NBIFOM
applies to the corresponding IP-CAN session, the traffic identified by the PCC
rule is to be transferred on the NBIFOM default access even if this AVP was
present in previous installations of the same rule. Only the 3GPP-EPS and
Non-3GPP-EPS IP-CAN type values are applicable in this release.
NOTE: The IP-CAN-Type AVP is always included in the Charging-Rule-Install AVP
when a PCC rule is installed or modified if the PCC rule is intended to be
bound to the non-default access.

The Charging-Rule-Definition AVP (AVP code 1003) is of type Grouped, and it
defines the PCC rule sent by the PCRF to the PCEF. The Charging-Rule-Name AVP
uniquely identifies the PCC rule and it is used to reference to a PCC rule in
communication between the PCEF and the PCRF within one IP CAN session. The
Flow-Information AVP(s) or the application detection filter referenced by the
TDF-Application-Identifier AVP determines the traffic that belongs to the
service data flow. Either Flow-Information AVP(s) or TDF-Application-
Identifier AVP shall exist in a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP.
If optional AVP(s) within a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP are omitted, but
corresponding information has been provided in previous Gx messages, the

Trigger AVP indicates that the corresponding event has occurred at the
gateway.
NOTE 1: An exception to the above is the Event Trigger AVP set to
NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS that indicates that PCEF shall not notify PCRF of any event
that requires to be provisioned.
NOTE 2: There are events that do not require to be provisioned by the PCRF,
according to the value definition included in this subclause. These events
will always be reported by the PCEF even though the PCRF has not provisioned
them in a RAR or CCA command.
Whenever the PCRF subscribes to one or more event triggers by using the RAR
command, unless otherwise specified in an event trigger\'s value definition,
the PCEF shall send the corresponding currently applicable values (e.g. 3GPP-
SGSN-Address AVP or 3GPP-SGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, RAT-Type, 3GPP-User-Location-
Info, etc.) to the PCRF in the RAA if available, and in this case, the Event-
Trigger AVPs shall not be included.
Whenever one of these events occurs, the PCEF shall send the related AVP that
has changed together with the event trigger indication.
Unless stated for a specific value, the Event-Trigger AVP applies to all

If the Offline AVP is embedded within a Charging-Rule-definition AVP it
defines whether the offline charging interface from the PCEF for the
associated PCC rule shall be enabled. The absence of this AVP within the first
provisioning of the Charging-Rule-definition AVP of a new PCC rule indicates
that the default charging method for offline shall be used.
If the Offline AVP is embedded within the initial CCR on command level, it
indicates the default charging method for offline pre-configured at the PCEF
is applicable as default charging method for offline. The absence of this AVP
within the initial CCR indicates that the charging method for offline pre-
configured at the PCEF is not available.
If the Offline AVP is embedded within the initial CCA on command level, it
indicates the default charging method for offline. The absence of this AVP
within the initial CCA indicates that the charging method for offline pre-
configured at the PCEF is applicable as default charging method for offline.

### 5.3.11 Precedence AVP (All access types)
The Precedence AVP (AVP code 1010) is of type Unsigned32.
Within the Charging Rule Definition AVP, the Precedence AVP determines the
order, in which service data flow templates consisting of service data flow
filters are applied at service data flow detection at the PCEF. For PCC rules
with an application detection filter, the Precedence AVP only determines which
PCC rule is applicable for the detected application for the enforcement of
QoS, for charging control, for reporting of application start and stop and for
usage monitoring. A PCC rule with the Precedence AVP with lower value shall be
applied before a PCC rule with the Precedence AVP with higher value.
NOTE 1: For PCRF-initiated IP-CAN session modification cases where the PCEF
creates new service data flow filters (e.g. mapping into new TFT-UL filters),
the PCEF need to make an appropriate mapping between the value of the
Precedence AVP from the PCC rule and the precedence information of the traffic
mapping information filter. The PCEF have to maintain the order of the
precedence information provided by the PCRF for the PCC rules with the
precedence information of the new traffic mapping information filters. For UE-
initiated IP-CAN session modification cases, according to 3GPP TS 23.060 [17],
the precedence of the traffic mapping information filter provided by the UE is
not modified by the PCEF. Also see access specific annexes for mapping of
Precedence AVP from the PCC rule and the precedence information of the traffic
mapping information filter.
NOTE 2: The precedence value range defined within the PCC rule is operator
configurable and can be set based on the IP-CAN type.
The Precedence AVP is also used within the TFT-Packet-Filter-Information AVP
to indicate the evaluation precedence of the Traffic Mapping Information
filters (for GPRS the TFT packet filters) as received from the UE. The PCEF
shall assign a lower value in the corresponding Precedence AVP to a Traffic
Mapping Information filter with a higher evaluation precedence than to a
Traffic Mapping Information filter with a lower evaluation precedence.
The Precedence AVP is also used within the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP to
indicate the evaluation precedence of the routing filters contained as within
the IP flow mobility routing rules or NBIFOM routing rules. A lower value in
the Precedence AVP indicates higher evaluation precedence. The PCEF shall
assign the lowest evaluation precedence to a Routing filter containg the wild
card filter.
### 5.3.12 Reporting-Level AVP (All access types)
The Reporting-Level AVP (AVP code 1011) is of type Enumerated, and it defines

This value shall be used to indicate that the usage shall be reported on
rating group level, and is applicable when the Rating-Group has been
provisioned within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP.
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL (2)
This value shall be used to indicate that the usage shall be reported on
sponsor identity and rating group combination level, and is applicable when
the Sponsor-IdentityAVP, Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP and Rating-
Group AVP have been provisioned within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP.

information shall be derived from the corresponding TFT packet filter remote
and/or local port parameters. Source and/or destination port(s) shall be
omitted if the corresponding information is not provided in the TFT packet
filter.
\- Destination IP address (possibly masked). The Destination IP address shall
be derived from TFT packet filter parameters \"Local address\" and \"Subnet
Mask\". If no such information is provided in the TFT packet filter, the
Destination IP address shall be set to \"assigned\".
The IPFilterRule type shall be used with the following restrictions:
\- No options shall be used.
\- The invert modifier \"!\" for addresses shall not be used.
The direction \"out\" indicates that the IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters
correspond to the TFT filter \"remote\" parameters in the packet filter and
the IPFilterRule \"destination\" correspond to the TFT filter \"local\" (UE
end) parameters. The TFT-Filter AVP applies in the direction(s) as specified
in the accompanying Flow-Direction AVP.
Destination IP address including the value provided by the UE may be provided
within the TFT-Filter AVP when the ExtendedFilter feature is supported as
described in clause 5.4.1.

### 5.3.18 Charging-Rule-Report AVP (All access types)
The Charging-Rule-Report AVP (AVP code 1018) is of type Grouped, and it is
used to report the status of PCC rules.
Charging-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific PCC rule at the PCEF that
has been successfully installed, modified or removed (for dynamic PCC rules),
or activated or deactivated (for predefined PCC rules) because of trigger from
the MS. Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP is a reference for a group of PCC rules
predefined at the PCEF that has been successfully activated or deactivated
because of trigger from the MS.
The Charging-Rule-Report AVP can also be used to report the status of the PCC
rules which cannot be installed/activated or enforced at the PCEF. In this
condition, the Charging-Rule-Name AVP is used to indicate a specific PCC rule
which cannot be installed/activated or enforced, and the Charging-Rule-Base-
Name AVP is used to indicate a group of PCC rules which cannot be activated.
The Rule-Failure-Code indicates the reason that the PCC rules cannot be
successfully installed/activated or enforced.
The Charging-Rule-Report AVP can also be used to report the status of the PCC
rules for which credit is no longer available or credit has been reallocated
after the former out of credit indication or credit management session failure
has been detected by the OCS. When reporting an out of credit condition, the
Final-Unit-Indication AVP indicates the termination action the PCEF applies to
the PCC rules as instructed by the OCS.
The Charging-Rule-Report AVP can also be used to report the status of the PCC
rules for which corresponding NBIFOM routing rule was rejected by the UE or
which corresponding access is removed. In the case that UE rejects the NBIFOM
routing rule, the Charging-Rule-Name AVP is used to indicate a specific PCC
rule which corresponding NBIFOM routing rule was rejected. The Rule-Failure-
Code AVP indicates the reason for the rejection of the routing rule.
For GPRS scenarios where the bearer binding is performed by the PCRF, the
Bearer-Identifier AVP may be included within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP.
If the RuleVersioning feature is supported, the Content-Version AVP(s) shall
be included if it was included in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP when the
corresponding PCC rule was installed or modified.

### 5.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gx reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request in a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gx reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause
7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the Gx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-7 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Gx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Gx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Gx reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial CCR/CCA command pair:
\- If the PCEF supporting post-Rel-7 Gx functionality is able to interoperate
with a PCRF supporting Rel-7, the CCR shall include the features supported by
the PCEF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the \'M\' bit cleared.
Otherwise, the CCR shall include the supported features within the Supported-
Features AVP(s) with the M-bit set.
NOTE 1: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-7 Gx functionality, the CCA command shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both PCEF and PCRF shall behave as
specified in the Rel-7 version of this document.
\- If the CCR command contains the Supported-Features AVP, the PCRF shall
include the Supported-Features AVP in the CCA command, with the \'M\' bit
cleared, indicating only the features that both the PCRF and PCEF support. In
this case, the PCRF should not use the \'M\' bit setting of the Supported-
Features AVP(s) to determine if the CCR is accepted or rejected.
NOTE 2: The client will always declare all features that are supported
according to table 5.4.1.1 and 5.4.1.2. When more than one feature identifying
a release is supported by both PCEF and PCRF, the PCEF will work according to
the latest common supported release.
Once the PCRF and PCEF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The tables below define the features applicable to the Gx interfaces for the
feature lists with a Feature-List-ID of 1 and 2.

### 5.4.2 Flow-Description AVP
The Flow-Description AVP (AVP code is defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]) is of
type IPFilterRule, and defines a packet filter for an IP flow with the
following information:
\- Action shall be keyword permit\"
\- Direction shall be keyword \"out\".
\- Protocol shall be the decimal protocol number or, to indicate that the
value is not used for matching packets, the keyword \"ip\".
\- Source IP address (possibly masked) or, to indicate that the value is not
used for matching packets, the keyword \"any\".
\- Source port is optional and, if present, shall be the decimal port number
or port range.
\- Destination IP address (possibly masked) or, to indicate that the value is
not used for matching packets, the keyword \"assigned\".
\- Destination port is optional and, if present, shall be the decimal port
number or port range.
The IPFilterRule type shall be used with the following restrictions:
\- The parameter encoding shall comply with IETF RFC 6733 [61].
\- No \"options\" shall be used.
\- The invert modifier \"!\" for addresses shall not be used.
The direction \"out\" indicates that the IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters
correspond to the \"remote\" parameters in the packet filter and the
IPFilterRule \"destination\" parameters correspond to the \"local\" (UE end)
parameters. The Flow-Description AVP applies in the direction(s) as specified
in the accompanying Flow-Direction AVP.
## 5.5 Gx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5.5.1 General
IETF RFC 6733 [61] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID
AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP
Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value
representing the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).
### 5.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 6733 [61] shall
be applied.
### 5.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 6733 [61] are
applicable, as an addition the following Result-Code AVP value defined in IETF
RFC 4006 [9] is applicable:
DIAMETER_USER_UNKNOWN (5030)
This error shall be used by the PCRF to indicate to the PCEF that the end user
specified in the request is unknown to the PCRF and that the Gx session cannot
be created.
Further as an addition the following Experimental-Result AVP values defined in
3GPP TS 29.273 [48] are applicable:
DIAMETER_ERROR_LATE_OVERLAPPING_REQUEST (5453)
This error shall be used by the PCRF to indicate that the incoming request
collides with an existing session which has a more recent time stamp than the
time stamp of the new request.
DIAMETER_ERROR_TIMED_OUT_REQUEST (5454)
This error shall be used by the PCRF to indicate the incoming request is known
to have already timed out at the originating entity.
Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Codes values are defined:
DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140)
This error shall be used when the set of bearer or session or subscriber
information needed by the PCRF for rule selection is incomplete or erroneous
or not available for the decision to be made. (E.g. QoS, SGSN address, RAT
type, TFT, subscriber information)
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRIGGER_EVENT (5141)
This error shall be used when the set of bearer/session information sent in a
CCR originated due to a trigger event been met is incoherent with the previous
set of bearer/session information for the same bearer/session. (E.g. event
trigger met was RAT changed, and the RAT notified is the same as before)
DIAMETER_PCC_RULE_EVENT (5142)
This error shall be used when the PCC rules cannot be installed/activated.
Affected PCC-Rules will be provided in the Charging-Rule-Report AVP including
the reason and status as described in clause 4.5.12. Absence of the Charging-
Rule-Report means that all provided PCC rules for that specific bearer/session
are affected.
DIAMETER_ERROR_BEARER_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5143)
This error shall be used when the PCRF cannot authorize an IP-CAN bearer (e.g.
the authorized QoS would exceed the subscribed QoS) upon the reception of an
IP-CAN bearer authorization request coming from the PCEF. The affected IP-CAN
bearer is the one that triggered the corresponding CCR. The PCEF shall reject
the attempt to initiate or modify the bearer indicated in the related CCR
command.
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144)
This error shall be used when the PCRF does not accept one or more of the
traffic mapping filters (e.g. TFT filters for GPRS) provided by the PCEF in a
CC Request.
DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFLICTING_REQUEST (5147)
This error shall be used when the PCRF cannot accept the UE-initiated resource
request as a network-initiated resource allocation is already in progress that
has packet filters that cover the packet filters in the received UE-initiated
resource request. The PCEF shall reject the attempt for UE-initiated resource
request.
DIAMETER_ADC_RULE_EVENT (5148)
This error shall be used when the ADC rules cannot be installed/activated.
Affected ADC Rules shall be provided in the ADC-Rule-Report AVP including the
reason and status as described in clause 5b.3.6. Absence of the ADC-Rule-
Report means that all provided ADC rules for that IP-CAN session are affected.
DIAMETER_ERROR_NBIFOM_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5149)
This error shall be used when the PCRF cannot authorize NBIFOM applies to the
multi-access PDN connection. (e.g. invalid combination of IP-CAN and RAT Types
or not allowed by the subscription) upon the reception of an addition of an
access request coming from the PCEF.
### 5.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [61] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Code value is
defined for transient failures:
DIAMETER_PCC_BEARER_EVENT (4141)
This error shall be used when for some reason a PCC rule cannot be enforced or
modified successfully in a network initiated procedure. Affected PCC-Rules
will be provided in the Charging-Rule-Report AVP including the reason and
status as described in clause 4.5.12.
DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED (4143)
This error shall be used when the policy decisions (i.e.
installation/modification of PCC rules or provisioning of policy decisions not
related to a PCC rule) received within a RAR initiated by the PCRF cannot be
enforced by the PCEF because the AN-Gateway has failed. If one or more PCC
Rules are affected, these PCC Rules will be provided in the Charging-Rule-
Report AVP including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to AN_GW_FAILED (17), and
PCC-Rule-Status AVP set to INACTIVE as described in clause 4.5.12. Applicable
only to 3GPP-EPS.
DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION (4144)
This error shall be used when a node that supports the PendingTransaction
feature receives an incoming request on a session while it has an ongoing
transaction on the same session and cannot handle the request as described in
clause 8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
DIAMETER_UE_STATUS_SUSPEND (4145)
This error shall be used when the policy decisions received within a RAR
initiated by the PCRF cannot be enforced by the PCEF because the UE's status
is suspended. Applicable only to 3GPP-EPS access type and to functionality
introduced with the UE-Status-Change feature as described in subclause 5.4.1.
## 5.6 Gx Messages
### 5.6.1 Gx Application
Gx Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in clause
5.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol IETF RFC 6733
[61] and the Diameter Credit Control Application IETF**** RFC 4006 [9] are
used with the Gx specific AVPs specified in clause 5.3. The Diameter Credit
Control Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are
re-used are defined in clause 5.4. The Gx application identifier shall be
included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP.
In order to support both PULL and PUSH procedures, a diameter session needs to
be established for each IP-CAN session. For IP-CAN types that support multiple
IP-CAN bearers (as in the case of GPRS), the diameter session is established
when the very first IP-CAN bearer for the IP-CAN session is established.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application IETF RFC 4006 [9] or
Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 6733 [61].
### 5.6.2 CC-Request (CCR) Command
The CCR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by the PCEF to the PCRF in order
to request PCC rules for a bearer and provision IP flow mobility routing
rules. The CCR command is also sent by the PCEF to the PCRF in order to
indicate bearer, PCC rule or IP flow mobility routing rule related events or
the termination of the IP CAN bearer and/or session.

# 5a Gxx protocols
## 5a.1 Protocol support
The Gxx application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application,
where the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Gxx Application in the
present release is 16777266. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) need to be configured appropriately to
identify the 3GPP Gxx application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order
to create suitable routeing tables.
The Gxx application identification shall be included in the Auth-Application-
Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Gxx interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element that
handles QoS Rule requests for a particular realm. The BBERF acts as the
Diameter client, in the sense that it is the network element requesting QoS
rules in the transport plane network resources.
## 5a.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between the BBERF and
PCRF (visited or home) are defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment
and maintenance of connections between Diameter nodes are described in IETF
RFC 6733 [61].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the BBERF shall
advertise the support of the Gxx specific Application by including the value
of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of
the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id
AVP contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733
[61]).
The termination of the Diameter session on Gxx can be initiated either by the
BBERF or PCRF, as specified in clauses 4a.5.3 and 4a.5.4, respectively.
## 5a.3 Gxx specific AVPs
### 5a.3.0 General
Table 5a.3.0.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Gxx reference
point, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the
AVP may be encrypted and what access types (e.g. 3GPP-EPS, etc.) the AVP is
applicable to. The Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present
document shall be set to 3GPP (10415).
Table 5a.3.0.1: Gxx specific Diameter AVPs
|  |  |  | AVP Flag rules (NOTE 1) |  |  |  |  |  |

NOTE 1: The AVP header bit denoted as 'M', indicates whether support of the AVP is required. The AVP header bit denoted as 'V', indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. For further details, see IETF RFC 6733 [61]. NOTE 2: The value types are defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. NOTE 3: The Gxx specific AVPs do not apply to 3GPP-GPRS Access Type. NOTE 4: This AVP only applies to case 2b as defined in TS 29.213 [8] NOTE 5: AVPs marked with "Rel9" are applicable as described in clause 5a.4.1. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5a.3.1 QoS-Rule-Install AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Install AVP (AVP code 1051) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
activate, install or modify QoS rules as instructed from the PCRF to the
BBERF.
For installing a new QoS rule or modifying a QoS rule already installed, QoS-
Rule-Definition AVP shall be used.
For activating a specific QoS rule predefined at the BBERF, QoS-Rule-Name AVP
shall be used as a reference for that QoS rule. The QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is
a reference that may be used for activating a group of QoS rules predefined at
the BBERF.
When Tunnel-Information AVP is provided it applies to all the QoS rules
included within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP. When QoS rules are being modified,
the newly provided Tunnel-Information AVP replaces previously provided Tunnel-
Information AVP for the modified QoS rules. If Resource-Allocation-
Notification AVP is included then it applies to all the rules within the QoS-
Rule-Install AVP. If a QoS-Rule-Install AVP does not include the Resource-
Allocation-Notification AVP, the resource allocation shall not be notified by
the BBERF even if this AVP was present in previous installations of the same
rule.
In case 2a, the QoS-Rule-Install AVP may also contain a charging identifier
within the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP. The charging
identifier information is used by the BBERF for charging correlation. When the
Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP is included, the identifier
applies to all the QoS rules included within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP. The
charging identifier value for a QoS rule shall be the same as that for the
corresponding PCC rule. When a QoS rule is being modified and no new charging
identifier is provided, then the previously provided charging identifier shall
apply for the modified QoS rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified then it applies
to all the QoS rules within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP.
The 3GPP-GGSN-Address AVP, 3GPP-GGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, AN-GW-Address AVP and
UDP-Source-Port AVP are only applicable for S9a interface when provided. UDP-
Source-Port AVP provided within QoS-Rule-Install AVP is only applicable for
the trusted S2c case and shall take precedence over the one provided at the
S9a command level.

### 5a.3.2 QoS-Rule-Remove AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Remove AVP (AVP code 1052) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
deactivate or remove QoS rules from an Gateway Control session.
QoS-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific QoS rule at the BBERF to be
removed or for a specific QoS rule predefined at the BBERF to be deactivated.
The QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is a reference for a group of QoS rules predefined
at the BBERF to be deactivated.
Required-Access-Info AVP may be included if the AF requests the PCRF to report
user access network information and the PCRF is removing QoS rules based on
the AF requests.
AVP Format:
QoS-Rule-Remove ::= \
*[ QoS-Rule-Name ]
*[ QoS-Rule-Base-Name ]
***[ Required-Access-Info ]**
*[ AVP ]
### 5a.3.3 QoS-Rule-Definition AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Definition AVP (AVP code 1053) is of type Grouped, and it defines
the QoS rule for a service data flow sent by the PCRF to the BBERF. The QoS-
Rule-Name AVP uniquely identifies the QoS rule and it is used to reference to
a QoS rule in communication between the BBERF and the PCRF within one Gateway
Control session. The Flow-Information AVP(s) determines the traffic that
belongs to the service data flow.
If optional AVP(s) within a QoS-Rule-Definition AVP are omitted, but
corresponding information has been provided in previous Gxx messages, the
previous information remains valid. If Flow-Information AVP(s) are supplied,
they replace all previous Flow-Information AVP(s).
Required-Access-Info AVP may appear if the AF requests PCRF to report user
access network information.
Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP may appear if the QoS rule is a
candidate for resource sharing.
The Content-Version AVP may be included if the QoS rule is installed or
modified.

### 5a.3.4 QoS-Rule-Name AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Name AVP (AVP code 1054) is of type OctetString, and it defines a
name for QoS rule. For QoS rules provided by the PCRF it uniquely identifies a
QoS rule within one Gateway Control session. For QoS pre-defined at the BBERF
it uniquely identifies a QoS rule within the BBERF.
### 5a.3.5 QoS-Rule-Report AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Report AVP (AVP code 1055) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
report the status of QoS rules.
QoS-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific QoS rule at the BBERF that has
been successfully installed, modified or removed (for dynamic QoS rules), or
activated or deactivated (for predefined QoS rules). QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is
a reference for a group of QoS rules predefined at the BBERF that has been
successfully activated or deactivated.
The QoS-Rule-Report AVP can also be used to report the status of the QoS rules
which cannot be installed/activated or enforced at the BBERF. In this
condition, the QoS-Rule-Name AVP is used to indicate a specific QoS rule which
cannot be installed/activated or enforced and the QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is
used to indicate a group of QoS rules which cannot be activated. The Rule-
Failure-Code AVP indicates the reason that the QoS rules cannot be
successfully installed/activated or enforced.
If the RuleVersioning feature is supported, the Content-Version AVP(s) shall
be included if it was included in the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP when the
corresponding QoS rule was installed or modified.
AVP Format:
QoS-Rule-Report ::= \
*[ QoS-Rule-Name ]
*[ QoS-Rule-Base-Name ]
[ PCC-Rule-Status ]
[ Rule-Failure-Code ]
*[ Content-Version ]
*[ AVP ]
Multiple instances of QoS-Rule-Report AVPs shall be used in the case it is
required to report different PCC-Rule-Status or Rule-Failure-Code values for
different rules within the same Diameter command. If the Content-Version AVP
is included within a QoS-Rule-Report AVP, then only the one corresponding QoS-
Rule-Name AVP shall be included.
### 5a.3.6 Session-Linking-Indicator AVP (All access types)
The Session-Linking-Indicator AVP (AVP code 1064) is of type Enumerated and
indicates whether the session linking between the Gateway Control Session and
the Gx session shall be deferred. The absence of this AVP in case 2b as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] shall indicate the value
SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE.
The following values are defined:
SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE (0)
This value shall be used to indicate that the PCRF shall perform the linking
between the new Gateway Control Session with an existing Gx session
immediately.
SESSION_LINKING_DEFERRED (1)
This value shall be used to indicate that the PCRF shall not attempt linking
the new Gateway Control Session with an existing Gx session immediately.
### 5a.3.7 QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP (AVP code 1074) is of type UTF8String, and it
indicates the name of a preâ€‘defined group of QoS rules residing at the BBERF.
## 5a.4 Gxx re-used AVPs
### 5a.4.0 General
Table 5a.4.0.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the Gxx reference point from
Gx reference point and other existing Diameter Applications, reference to
their respective specifications, short description of their usage within the
Gxx reference point, the applicability of the AVPs to a specific access, and
which supported features the AVP is applicable to. When reused from Gx
reference point, the specific clause in the present specification is referred.
Other AVPs from existing Diameter Applications, except for the AVPs from
Diameter base protocol, do not need to be supported. The AVPs from Diameter
base protocol are not included in table 5a.4, but they are re-used for the Gxx
reference point. Unless otherwise stated, re-used AVPs shall maintain their
\'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag settings. Where RADIUS VSAs are re-used, unless
otherwise stated, they shall be translated to Diameter AVPs as described in
IETF RFC 4005 [12] with the exception that the \'M\' flag shall be set and the
\'P\' flag may be set.

### 5a.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gxx reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gxx reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the Gxx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-8 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Gxx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Gxx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Gxx reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial CCR/CCA command pair:
\- If the BBERF supports post-Rel-8 Gxx functionality, the CCR shall include
the features supported by the BBERF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the
\'M\' bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-8 Gxx functionality, the PCRF shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP in the CCA command. In this case, both BBERF and PCRF
shall behave as specified in the Rel-8 version of this document.
NOTE: The client will always declare all features that are supported according
to table 5a.4.1.1. When more than one feature identifying a release is
supported by both BBERF and PCRF, the BBERF will work according to the latest
common supported release.
Once the PCRF and BBERF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Gxx interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

described in clause 4a.5.5.
## 5a.6 Gxx Messages
### 5a.6.1 Gxx Application
Gxx Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in
clause 5a.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol IETF RFC 6733
[61] and the Diameter Credit Control Application IETF RFC 4006 [9] are used
with the Gxx specific AVPs specified in clause 5a.3. The Diameter Credit
Control Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are
re-used are defined in clause 5a.4. The Gxx application identifier shall be
included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP. A diameter session needs to be
established for each Gateway Control session.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application IETF RFC 4006 [9] or
Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 6733 [61].
### 5a.6.2 CC-Request (CCR) Command
The CCR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by the BBERF to the PCRF in order
to request QoS rules. The CCR command is also sent by the BBERF to the PCRF in
order to indicate QoS rule related events or the termination of the Gateway
Control session.

# 5b Sd protocol
## 5b.1 Protocol support
The Sd application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application, where
the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415. The
Application-ID for the Sd Application is 16777303 and this value shall be used
in the Diameter command header as well as any Application-ID AVPs (Auth-
Application-Id/Vendor-Specific-Application-Id) in the command body.
## 5b.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and TDF
pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance of
connections between Diameter nodes is described in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the TDF shall
advertise the support of the Sd specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733
[61]).
The Diameter session on Sd is established either at the request of the PCRF in
case of solicited application reporting or at the request of the TDF in case
of unsolicited application reporting. Session modifications may be initiated
by either TDF or PCRF. Session termination is initiated at the request of the
PCRF as specified in clause 4b.5.4.
## 5b.3 Sd specific AVPs
### 5b.3.0 General
Table 5b.3.0.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Sd reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted, what access types (e.g. 3GPP-GPRS, etc.) the AVP is applicable
to, the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy control or both,
and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The Vendor-Id header of
all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to 3GPP (10415).

NOTE 1: The AVP header bit denoted as 'M', indicates whether support of the AVP is required. The AVP header bit denoted as 'V', indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. For further details, see IETF RFC 6733 [61]. NOTE 2: The value types are defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5b.3.1 ADC-Rule-Install AVP
The ADC-Rule-Install AVP (AVP code 1092) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
activate, install or modify ADC rules as instructed from the PCRF.
For installing a new ADC rule or modifying an ADC rule already installed, ADC-
Rule-Definition AVP shall be used.
For activating a specific predefined ADC rule, ADC-Rule-Name AVP shall be used
as a reference for that ADC rule. The ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP is a reference
that may be used for activating a group of predefined ADC rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified then it applies
to all the ADC rules within the ADC-Rule-Install.
If the Monitoring-Flags AVP is included within the ADC-Rule-Install AVP, it is
used to indicate the monitoring action related to the corresponding
application. It applies to all the ADC rules within the ADC-Rule-Install AVP.
If the Monitoring-Flags AVP is provided, the value will be valid for the ADC
rules until the new value is provided for the ADC rules.
AVP Format:
ADC-Rule-Install ::= \
*[ ADC-Rule-Definition ]
*[ ADC-Rule-Name ]
*[ ADC-Rule-Base-Name ]
[ Monitoring-Flags ]
[ Rule-Activation-Time ]
[ Rule-Deactivation-Time ]
*[ AVP ]
### 5b.3.2 ADC-Rule-Remove AVP
The ADC-Rule-Remove AVP (AVP code 1093) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
deactivate or remove ADC rules as instructed from the PCRF.
ADC-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific dynamic ADC rule to be removed
or for a specific predefined ADC rule to be deactivated. The ADC-Rule-Base-
Name AVP is a reference for a group of predefined ADC rules to be deactivated.
AVP Format:
ADC-Rule-Remove ::= \
*[ ADC-Rule-Name ]
*[ ADC-Rule-Base-Name ]
*[ AVP ]
### 5b.3.3 ADC-Rule-Definition AVP
The ADC-Rule-Definition AVP (AVP code 1094) is of type Grouped, and it defines
the ADC rule sent by the PCRF. The ADC-Rule-Name AVP uniquely identifies the
ADC rule and it is used to reference to an ADC rule in communication between
the PCRF and the TDF within one TDF session. The TDF Application Identifier
AVP(s) or the Flow-Information AVP(s) determines the traffic that belongs to
the application.
If optional AVP(s) within an ADC-Rule-Definition AVP are omitted, but
corresponding information has been provided in previous Sd messages, the
previous information remains valid.
Monitoring-Key AVP contains the monitoring key that may apply to the ADC rule.
Sponsor-Identity AVP and Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP shall be
included if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL for the service data flow.
Mute-Notification status shall not be changed during the lifetime of the ADC
rules.
Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP and/or Traffic-Steering-Policy-
Identifier-DL AVP may appear if the traffic steering control is required for
the service data flow or application. If the traffic steering policies are
identical in both downlink and uplink directions, the values of the Traffic-
Steering-Policy-Identifier-UL AVP and the Traffic-Steering-Policy-Identifier-
DL AVP shall be identical.

### 5b.3.4 ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP
The ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP (AVP code 1095) is of type UTF8String, and it
indicates the name of a predefined group of ADC rules.
### 5b.3.5 ADC-Rule-Name AVP
The ADC-Rule-Name AVP (AVP code 1096) is of type OctetString, and it defines a
name for ADC rule. For ADC rules provided by the PCRF it uniquely identifies
an ADC rule within one TDF session. For predefined ADC rules, it uniquely
identifies an ADC rule within the TDF.
### 5b.3.6 ADC-Rule-Report AVP
The ADC-Rule-Report AVP (AVP code 1097) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
report the status of ADC rules.
The ADC-Rule-Report AVP is used to report the status of the ADC rules which
cannot be installed/activated or enforced at the TDF. In this condition, the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP is used to indicate a specific ADC rule which cannot be
installed/activated or enforced, and the ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP is used to
indicate a group of ADC rules which cannot be activated. The PCC-Rule-Status
AVP is set to INACTIVE. The Rule-Failure-Code indicates the reason that the
ADC rules cannot be successfully installed/activated or enforced.
The ADC-Rule-Report AVP can also be used to report the status of the ADC rules
for which credit is no longer available or credit has been reallocated after
the former out of credit indication. When reporting an out of credit
condition, the Final-Unit-Indication AVP indicates the termination action the
TDF applies to the ADC rules as instructed by the OCS.
AVP Format:
ADC-Rule-Report ::= \
*[ ADC-Rule-Name ]
*[ ADC-Rule-Base-Name ]
[ PCC-Rule-Status ]
[ Rule-Failure-Code ]
[ Final-Unit-Indication ]
*[ AVP ]
Multiple instances of ADC-Rule-Report AVPs shall be used in the case it is
required to report different PCC-Rule-Status or Rule-Failure-Code values for
different groups of rules within the same Diameter command.
### 5b.3.7 Void
## 5b.4 Sd re-used AVPs
### 5b.4.0 General
Table 5b.4.0.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the Sd reference point from
existing Diameter Applications, reference to their respective specifications,
short description of their usage within the Sd reference point and which
supported features the AVP is applicable to. Other AVPs from existing Diameter
Applications, except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol, do not need to
be supported. The AVPs from Diameter base protocol are not included in table
5b.4.0.1, but they are re-used for the Sd reference point. Unless otherwise
stated, re-used AVPs shall maintain their \'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag
settings. Where 3GPP Radius VSAs are re-used, unless otherwise stated, they
shall be translated to Diameter AVPs as described in IETF RFC 4005 [12] with
the exception that the \'M\' flag shall be set and the \'P\' flag may be set.

### 5b.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Sd reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The Diameter node sending a Diameter request that establishes a
Diameter session (i.e. the PCRF for solicited application reporting and the
TDF for unsolicited application reporting) shall, in this request indicate the
set of features it supports. The Diameter node answering this request (i.e.
the TDF for solicited application reporting and the PCRF for unsolicited
application reporting) shall indicate the set of features that it has in
common with the features in the request and that it shall support within the
same Diameter session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant
with the list of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs
during session establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported
shall not be used to construct the command messages for that Diameter session.
Unless otherwise stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Sd
reference point shall be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery
of supported features and associated error handling on the Sd reference point
as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the Sd reference point is the 3GPP Rel-11 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Sd commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Sd reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Sd reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial TSR/TSA command pair:
\- If the TDF supports post-Rel-11 Sd functionality, the TSA shall include the
features supported by the TDF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the \'M\'
bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the TSR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s), the TSA
command shall not include the Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both TDF
and PCRF shall behave as specified in the Rel-11 version of this document
without UMCH feature.
Once the PCRF and TDF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Sd interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

## 5b.5 Sd specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5b.5.1 General
IETF RFC 6733 [61] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID
AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP
Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value
representing the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).
### 5b.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 6733 [61] shall
be applied.
### 5b.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 6733 [61] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Codes value is
reused for TDF session: DIAMETER_ADC_RULE_EVENT (see 5.5.3):
### 5b.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [61] are
applicable.
## 5b.6 Sd Messages
### 5b.6.1 Sd Application
Sd Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in clause
5b.1.
In addition to the TDF-Session-Request/Answer commands used to establish the
TDF session, existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol
IETF RFC 6733 [61] and the Diameter Credit Control Application IETF RFC 4006
[9] are used with the Sd specific AVPs specified in clause 5b.3. The Diameter
Credit Control Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that
are re-used are defined in clause 5b.4. The Sd application identifier shall be
included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP for the reused commands. The Sd
application identifier shall be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP within
the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped AVP contained in the TDF-Session-
Request/Answer commands.
NOTE 1: As TDF-Session-Request/Answer commands have been defined based on the
former specification of the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 3588 [5]), the
Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is still assumed as a required AVP (an AVP
indicated as {AVP}) in the command code format to avoid backward compatibility
issues, even if the use of this AVP has been deprecated in the new
specification of the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [61]).
In order to support both PULL and PUSH procedures, a Diameter session needs to
be established for each TDF session, if there is a decision made by PCRF to
establish TDF session.
NOTE 2: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application IETF RFC 4006 [9] or
Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 6733 [61].
### 5b.6.2 TDF-Session-Request (TSR) Command
The TSR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 8388637 and the

# 5c St Diameter protocol
## 5c.1 St Application
The St application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application, where
the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415. The
Application-ID for the St Application is 16777349 and this value shall be used
in the Diameter command header as well as any Application-ID AVPs (Auth-
Application-Id/Vendor-Specific-Application-Id) in the command body.
## 5c.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and
TSSF pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance
of connections between Diameter nodes is described in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the TSSF shall
advertise the support of the St Application by including the value of the
application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733
[61]).
The Diameter session on the St reference point shall be established at the
request of the PCRF by an TDF-Session-Request including the Request-Type AVP
set to \"0 (initial request)\". Session modifications shall be initiated by
PCRF with an TDF-Session-Request including the Request-Type AVP set to \"1
(update request)\". The session termination shall be initiated by the PCRF
with an Session-Termination-Request.
## 5c.3 St specific AVPs
### 5c.3.1 General
Table 5c.3.1.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the St reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, and whether or not the AVP
may be encrypted. The Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present
document shall be set to 3GPP (10415).
Table 5c.3.1.1: St specific Diameter AVPs
|  |  |  | AVP Flag rules (NOTE 1) |  | Applicability (NOTE 3) |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Request-Type | 2838 | 5c.3.2 | Unsigned32 | M,V | P |  |  | Y |   
NOTE 1: The AVP header bit denoted as 'M', indicates whether support of the AVP is required. The AVP header bit denoted as 'V', indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. For further details, see IETF RFC 6733 [61]. NOTE 2: The value types are defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. NOTE 3: AVPs marked with a supported feature are applicable as described in subclause 5c.4.2. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5c.3.2 Request-Type AVP
The Request-Type AVP (AVP code 2838) is of type Unsigned32, and contains the
reason for sending a Request message.
The following values are defined:
0 (initial request)
An initial request is used to initiate a Diameter session and contains
information that is relevant to initiation.
1 (update request)
An update request is used to update an existing Diameter session.
## 5c.4 St re-used AVPs
### 5c.4.1 General
Table 5c.4.1.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the St reference point from
existing Diameter Applications, reference to their respective specifications,
short description of their usage within the St reference point and which
supported features the AVP is applicable to. Other AVPs from existing Diameter
Applications, except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol, do not need to
be supported. The AVPs from Diameter base protocol are not included in table
5c.4.1.1, but they are re-used for the St reference point. Unless otherwise
stated, re-used AVPs shall maintain their \'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag
settings.

### 5c.4.2 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the St reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The PCRF shall, in the first request in a Diameter session, indicate
the set of supported features. The TSSF shall, in the first answer within the
Diameter session, indicate the set of features that it has in common with the
PCRF; the TSSF shall then support those features within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the St reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in
subclause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the St reference point is the 3GPP Rel-13 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the St commands. As defined in subclause 7.1.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a
feature, the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be
defined mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the St reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the St reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in subclause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial TSR/TSA command pair:
\- If the TSSF supports any supported features defined for the St application,
the TSA shall include the features supported by the TSSF within Supported-
Features AVP(s) with the 'M' bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the TSR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s), the TSA
command shall not include the Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both TSSF
and PCRF shall behave as specified in the Rel-13 version of this document.
Once the PCRF and TSSF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the St interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.
Table 5b.4.1.1: Features of Feature-List-ID 1 used in St Protocol
+-------------------------------------+---------+-----+-------------+ | Feature bit | Feature | M/O | Description | +-------------------------------------+---------+-----+-------------+ | Feature bit: The order number of | | | | | the bit within the Feature-List AVP | | | | | where the least significant bit is | | | | | assigned number \"0\". | | | | | | | | | | Feature: A short name that can be | | | | | used to refer to the bit and to the | | | | | feature, e.g. \"EPS\". | | | | | | | | | | M/O: Defines if the implementation | | | | | of the feature is mandatory (\"M\") | | | | | or optional (\"O\") in this 3GPP | | | | | Release. | | | | | | | | | | Description: A clear textual | | | | | description of the feature. | | | | +-------------------------------------+---------+-----+-------------+
In this release there are no supported features.
## 5c.5 St specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5c.5.1 General
IETF RFC 6733 [61] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID
AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP
Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value
representing the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).
### 5c.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 6733 [61] shall
be applied.
### 5c.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 6733 [61] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Codes value is
reused for St session: DIAMETER_ADC_RULE_EVENT (see subclause 5.5.3).
### 5c.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [61] are
applicable.
## 5c.6 St Messages
### 5c.6.1 General
St Messages shall use the Diameter Application described in subclause 5c.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol IETF RFC 6733
[61] and from the Diameter Sd protocol are used. In additions, the TNR and TNA
commands are defined.
The St application identifier shall be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP
for the reused commands. The St application identifier shall be included in
the Auth-Application-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped
AVP contained in the TDF-Session-Request/Answer commands.
NOTE 1: As TDF-Session-Request/Answer commands have been defined based on the
former specification of the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 3588 [5]), the
Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is still assumed as a required AVP (an AVP
indicated as {AVP}) in the command code format to avoid backward compatibility
issues, even if the use of this AVP has been deprecated in the new
specification of the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [61]).
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax in IETF RFC 2234 [55],
and according to the rules in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
NOTE 2: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 6733
[61], or to the standard set of AVPs required in most Diameter commands.
The following Command Codes are defined for the St Diameter application, as
allocated by IANA from the vendor-specific namespace defined in IETF RFC 5719

###### ## Annex A (normative): Access specific aspects (GPRS)
# A.1 Scope
This annex defines access specific aspects procedures for use of Gx/Gxx
between PCRF and a GPRS IP-CAN.
# A.2 Reference model
In GPRS IP-CAN, the BBERF does not apply. The Gxx reference point is not
applicable.
# A.2 Functional elements
## A.2.1 PCRF
For GPRS it shall be possible to support policy control, i.e. access control
and QoS control, on a per-PDP context basis for the UE initiated bearer
control case.
# A.3 PCC procedures
## A.3.1 Request for PCC rules
At IP-CAN session establishment as described in clause 4.5.1, information
about the user equipment (e.g. IMEISV), QoS negotiated and further QoS related
information as detailed in clause A.3.3.1, user location information (e.g.
RAI, CGI/SAI) SGSN Address, SGSN country and network codes, APN and indication
if the bearer is used as IMS signalling PDP context shall be provided. The
PCEF shall provide the Bearer-Identifier AVP at the IP-CAN session
establishment. In this case, the PCEF shall also include the Bearer-Operation
AVP set to the value \"Establishment\". If information about the support of
network-initiated bearer procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support
AVP shall be provided.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 29.060 [18] defines the RAT type as optional over Gn/Gp
interface up to 3GPP Relâ€‘9. In fact the optionality was introduced solely for
maintaining backwards compatibility at the protocol level between different
versions of the protocol. For 3GPP Rel-9 and and earlier releases, the
conditions about when the RAT-Type is present over Gn/Gp interface are defined
in 3GPP TS 23.060 [17] clause 15.1.1a. From 3GPP Rel-10 onwards, it is
mandatory for the RAT Type IE to be sent by the SGSN to the GGSN at Create PDP
Context, or at Update PDP Context when the RAT has changed.
IP-CAN session modification with PCEF-requested rules, as described in clause
4.5.1, can occur in the following cases:
\- When a new PDP Context is being established by the UE in an already
existing IP-CAN Session.
\- When a PDP context is being modified and an Event trigger is met.
\- When a PDP context is being terminated.
The request for PCC rules is formed in the same way, regardless the bearer
control mode. The IP-CAN session may have no resources initiated by the
network, e.g. for an IP-CAN session that operates in BCM UE_ONLY, and in that
case there are no NW-initiated resources to take into account.
The following replaces, for packet filter information and QoS handling, what
is specified in clause 4.5.1:
\- If a new IP-CAN bearer is being established, the PCEF shall assign a new
bearer identifier to this IP-CAN bearer, include this identifier within the
Bearer-Identifier AVP, and include the Bearer-Operation AVP set to the value
\"ESTABLISHMENT\", the UE-provided TFT filters and the requested QoS of the
new IP-CAN bearer.
\- If an existing IP-CAN bearer is being modified:
\- If the PCEF has not yet notified the PCRF about this IP CAN bearer and the
UE adds one or more packet filters to the Traffic Flow template, the PCEF
shall assign a new bearer identifier to this IP-CAN bearer, include the
Bearer-Identifier AVP, the Bearer-Operation AVP set to the value
\"ESTABLISHMENT\", the UE-provided TFT filters and the requested QoS as
detailed in clause A.3.3.3a.
\- If the PCEF has already notified the PCRF about this IP CAN bearer, the
PCEF shall include the Bearer-Identifier AVP, the Bearer-Operation AVP set to
the value \"MODIFICATION\" all the TFT filter definitions for this bearer,
including the requested changes but excluding the TFT filters created with NW-
initiated procedures, and QoS related information as detailed in clause
A.3.3.3a.
\- If an existing IP-CAN bearer is being terminated, the PCEF shall include
the Bearer-Identifier AVP, the Bearer-Operation AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION\" and the Charging-Rule-Report AVP indicating the removal of any
PCC rules created with NW-initiated procedures having the bearer binding with
the same bearer.
\- If the Event trigger that caused the IP-CAN bearer modification applies at
session level (i.e. it is common to all the bearers belonging to that IP-CAN
session), PCEF shall send a single CC-Request for all the affected bearers. In
this case, the Bearer-Identifier AVP shall not be included to indicate that it
applies to all the IP-CAN bearers in the IP-CAN session. If the Event trigger
that caused the IP CAN bearer modification applies at bearer level, the
Charging-Rule-Report AVP shall include all the affected PCC rules.
If the PCRF does not accept one or more of the TFT filters provided by the
PCEF in a CC Request (e.g. because the PCRF does not allow the UE to request
enhanced QoS for services not known to the PCRF), the PCRF shall reject the
request using a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144). If the PCEF receives a CC Answer with
this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session establishment or
modification that initiated the CC Request by applying a proper cause code and
other parameters as per 3GPP TS 29.060 [18].
## A.3.2 Provisioning of PCC rules
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding and installs or activates a new PCC
rule, the PCRF shall indicate the IP CAN bearer where the new rule shall be
installed or activated using a Bearer-Identifier AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP. If the PCRF modifies an already installed PCC rule, the PCRF does
not need to indicate the bearer. If the PCEF obtains an updated definition of
a PCC rule within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP without a Bearer-Identifier AVP,
the PCEF shall continue to apply the PCC rule to the IP CAN bearer that has
previously been indicated.
If the PCRF does not perform the bearer binding and installs or activates a
new PCC rule, the PCRF does not indicate the bearer within the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP. The PCEF shall then perform the bearer binding and select the IP
CAN bearer where the provisioned new PCC rule is applied.
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF may move previously
installed or activated PCC rule(s) from one IP CAN bearer to another IP CAN
bearer. To move such PCC rule(s), the PCRF shall indicate the new bearer using
the Bearer-Identifier AVP within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP and shall
indicate the charging rules(s) to be moved using Charging-Rule name AVP(s),
and/or a Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), and/or Charging-Rule-Definition
AVP(s) (for PCC rule(s) that are modified at the same time). The PCEF shall
then apply these PCC rules at the new indicated IP CAN bearer and shall remove
them from the IP CAN bearer where the rules previously had been applied.
The PCRF may request the establishment of a bearer dedicated to IMS signalling
by providing the applicable PCC rules to the PCEF.
When the PCEF includes the Bearer-Usage AVP required for the bearer within the
CCR command during the IP-CAN session establishment procedure, the PCRF shall
provide the Bearer-Usage AVP back in the response with the authorized usage.
If the PCEF includes IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP and the PCRF
accepts that default bearer is dedicated to IMS signalling, the PCRF shall
include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP. In this case, the PCRF
shall restrict the bearer to only be used for IMS signalling as specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 [31] by applying the applicable QCI for IMS signalling.
If the PCEF include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP in the CCR
command, but the PCRF does not include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-
Usage AVP in the CCA command, the PCC Rules provided by the PCRF shall have a
QCI value different from the QCI value for the IMS signalling.
When the PCRF performs the bearer binding and the UE initiates a Secondary PDP
Context Activation, if the PCEF includes the Bearer-Usage AVP indicating
IMS_SIGNALLING and the PCRF accepts that a bearer dedicated to IMS signalling
shall be used, the PCRF shall return the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-
Usage AVP. The provided PCC rules shall have the QCI applicable for IMS
signalling.
### A.3.2.1 PCC rule request for services not known to PCRF
When the PCRF receives a request for PCC rules while no suitable authorized
PCC rules are configured in the PCRF, and if the user is not allowed to access
AF session based services but is allowed to request resources for services not
known to the PCRF, refer to clause 4.5.2.0, the PCRF may downgrade the bitrate
parameters and the QCI according to PCC internal policies when authorizing the
request.
### A.3.2.2 Selecting a PCC rule and IP CAN Bearer for Downlink IP packets
TFT filters shall not be applied to assign downlink IP packets to PDP contexts
if PCC is enabled for an APN.
## A.3.3 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
For 3GPP-GPRS, default EPS bearer QoS provisioning and enforcement is not
applicable.
### A.3.3.0 Overview
The PCRF may provide the authorized QoS that applies to a bearer to the PCEF.
When the authorized QoS applies to an IP CAN bearer, it shall be provisioned
outside a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and it shall also include the Bearer-
Identifier AVP to indicate what bearer it applies to.
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
presents the QoS for this IP CAN bearer. Authorized QoS per QCI is not
applicable. If the PCEF performs the bearer binding, the authorized QoS per IP
CAN bearer is not applicable.
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer may be performed separate
or in combination with the PCC rule provisioning procedure in clause 4.5.2.0.
In case the PCRF provides PCC rules dynamically, authorised QoS information
for the IP-CAN bearer (combined QoS) may be provided. For a predefined PCC
rule within the PCEF the authorized QoS information shall take affect when the
PCC rule is activated.
The PCEF shall make sure that the total QoS information of the PCC rules for
one IP-CAN bearer does not exceed the authorized QoS information, i.e. the
information received from the PCRF.
### A.3.3.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is used if the bearer binding is
performed by the PCRF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]).
The PCEF will request the authorization of an IP CAN bearer establishment or
modification by the PCRF using the \"Request for PCC rules\" procedure if the
related conditions outlined in clause 4.5.1 apply. While executing this
procedure, the PCEF shall apply the following QoS related procedures:
\- When the UE request the establishment of a new IP-CAN bearer, the PCEF
shall derive the requested QoS information. The PCEF shall use Table A.4.1.1
to map the requested QoS within the IP CAN bearer establishment request to the
QoS-Information AVP. If the PCEF receives the \"upgrade QoS Supported\" flag
set to \"1\" in the Common Flag Information element within the corresponding
Create PDP context request (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), the PCEF shall supply the
QoS-Upgrade AVP with value QoS_UPGRADE_SUPPORTED. The PCEF shall request a new
PCC decisions using a CCR command including the requested QoS information
within the QoS-Information AVP, in the CCR command to be sent to the PCRF.
The PCEF shall then wait for the corresponding CCA before replying to the IP-
CAN bearer establishment request.
\- If at any point of time the PCEF receives a request for a modification of
an already existing IP-CAN bearer that matches event triggers supplied by the
PCRF for the IP CAN session, the PCEF shall also request a new PCC decisions
using a CCR command including the corresponding event triggers in the Event-
Trigger AVP. If a QoS change for the existing IP-CAN bearer is requested the
PCEF shall include the requested QoS information within the QoS-Information
AVP in the CCR. If the PCEF receives within the corresponding Update PDP
context request the \"upgrade QoS Supported\" flag in the Common Flag
Information element (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]) set to a different value than
previously communicated to the PCRF, the PCEF shall supply the QoS-Upgrade AVP
indicating the new value. If the PCEF receives within the Update PDP context
request the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag set to \"1\" in the Common Flag
Information element (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), the PCEF shall supply the QoS-
Negotiation AVP with the value NO_QoS_NEGOTIATION.\ \ The PCEF shall wait for
the corresponding CCA before replying to the IP-CAN bearer modification
request.
When receiving a CCR with a QoS-Information AVP, the PCRF shall decide upon
the requested QoS information within the CCR command.
\- The PCRF may compare the authorized QoS derived according to clause 6.3 of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8] with the requested QoS. If the requested QoS is less than
the authorised QoS, the PCRF may either request to upgrade the IP CAN QoS by
supplying that authorised QoS in the QoS-Information AVP to the PCEF (e.g. if
the PCRF has exact knowledge of the required QoS for the corresponding
service), or the PCRF may only authorise the requested QoS by supplying the
requested QoS in the QoS-Information AVP to the PCEF (e.g. if the PCRF only
derives upper limits for the authorized QoS for the corresponding service). If
the requested bitrates are higher than the authorised bitrates, the PCRF shall
downgrade the IP CAN QoS by supplying the authorised QoS in the QoS-
Information AVP to the PCEF.
The following restrictions apply to the PCRF QoS authorization process:
\- If the QoS-Negotiation AVP is received by the PCRF indicating that QoS
negotiation is not allowed, the PCRF shall provision the requested QoS as
authorized QoS.
\- If the QoS-Upgrade AVP has been received by the PCRF indicating that QoS
upgrade is not supported, the PCRF shall not provision an authorized bitrates
(e.g. GBR, MBR) that are higher than the requested bitrates.
If for any reason the PCRF cannot authorize the requested QoS (e.g. authorized
QoS would exceed the subscribed QoS), the PCRF shall indicate to the PCEF that
the request is rejected by answering with a CCA command including the
Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
DIAMETER_ERROR_BEARER_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5143) together with the bearer-
identifier AVP. Otherwise, the PCRF shall provide a response for the CCR to
the PCEF by issuing a CCA command without this experimental result code. The
PCRF may use this CCA at the same time for the solicited PCC rule provisioning
procedure in clause 4.5.2. The CCA command shall include a QoS-Information AVP
at command level including the Bearer-Identifier AVP used in the corresponding
CCR and the authorized QCI and bitrates. If PCRF decides to move rules between
bearers, the CCA command shall also include the QoS-Information AVP(s) for the
impacted bearers.
The PCRF may also decide to modify the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer if it
receives a CCR with other event triggers, for instance if the PCRF moves PCC
rules from one IP-CAN bearer to another (e.g. in GPRS due to a TFT change).
The PCRF shall then provision the updated authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer in
the CCA within a QoS-Information AVP at command level including the
corresponding Bearer-Identifier AVP.
The PCRF may decide to modify the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer at any
time. To modify the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer, The PCRF shall send an
unsolicited authorization to the PCEF. The unsolicited authorization shall be
performed by sending a RAR command to the PCEF and including the QoS-
Information AVP(s) with the new authorized values per IP CAN bearer. The PCRF
may use this RAR at the same time for the unsolicited PCC rule provisioning
procedure in clause 4.5.2.0. If the trigger to modify the authorized QoS comes
from the AF, before starting an unsolicited provisioning, the PCRF may start a
timer to wait for a UE requested corresponding PDP context modification. At
the expiry of the timer, if no PCC rule request has previously been received
by the PCRF, the PCRF should go on with the unsolicited authorization as
explained above.
In addition to a provisioning of the \"Authorized QoS\" per IP CAN Bearer, the
PCRF may also provide an authorized QoS per PCC rule.
### A.3.3.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The PCEF is responsible for enforcing the policy based authorization, i.e., to
ensure that the requested QoS is in-line with the \"Authorized QoS\" per IP-
CAN bearer, as described in clause 4.5.5.1.
Upon reception of an authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer within a CCA or RAR
command, the PCEF shall perform the mapping from that \"Authorised QoS\"
information for the IP-CAN bearer into authorised UM3GPP TS QoS information
according to Table A.4.1.1. The authorised UM3GPP TS QoS information is
further processed by the UM3GPP TS BS Manager within the GGSN.
If the PCEF receives a solicited authorization decision from the PCRF (i.e. a
decision within a CCA) and the requested QoS received within the IP-CAN bearer
establishment or modification request that triggered the corresponding request
for the authorization decision does not match the authorised QoS, the PCEF
shall adjust the requested QoS information to the authorised QoS information
within the IP-CAN bearer establishment or modification response.
The PCEF may store the authorized QoS of an active IP-CAN bearer in order to
be able to make local decisions, when the UE requests for an IP-CAN bearer
modification.
When the PCEF receives an unsolicited authorisation decision from the PCRF
(i.e. a decision within a RAR) with updated QoS information for an IP-CAN
bearer, the PCEF shall update the stored authorised QoS. If the existing QoS
of the IP-CAN bearer does not match the updated authorised QoS the PCEF shall
perform a network initiated IP-CAN bearer modification to adjust the QoS to
the authorised level.
If the PCEF provide authorized QoS for both, the IP-CAN bearer and PCC
rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules shall
take place first.
### A.3.3.2a Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding for a service data flow, the PCRF may
optionally provision an authorized QoS for that service data flow.
For the authorization of a PCC rule with a GBR QCI the PCRF shall assign a GBR
value within the limit supported by the serving network (i.e. GERAN/UTRAN).
The PCRF shall subscribe the RAT_CHANGE event to get the RAT type information
for PCC rule authorization.
NOTE: For the authorization of PCC Rules with the same QCI the PCRF may also
check that aggregated GBR is within the limits supported by the serving
network to minimize the risk of rejection of the bearer by the serving
network.
### A.3.3.3 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per service data flow
If the PCRF provides authorized QoS for both, the IP-CAN bearer and PCC
rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules shall
take place first.
The mapping from the authorized QoS parameters to the UM3GPP TS QoS parameters
shall be performed according to Table A.4.1.1.
### A.3.3.3a Coordination of authorized QoS scopes in mixed mode
The PCEF will request the authorization of an IP CAN bearer establishment or
modification by the PCRF using the \"Request for PCC rules\" procedure if the
related conditions outlined in clause 4.5.1 and A.3.1 apply. The PCEF shall
exclude any guaranteed bitrate for the NW-created PCC rule(s) it has bound to
that IP CAN bearer from the requested QoS of that IP CAN bearer and request
the authorization of the QoS for the affected PCC rules and, if any, new
filters from the PCRF within the within the QoS-Information AVP.
The PCRF shall authorize the bandwidth for an IP CAN bearer which is required
for the PCC rules it has bound to this IP CAN bearer. The PCEF shall add to
the PCRF-provisioned authorized bandwidth of an IP CAN bearer the required
bandwidth of all PCC rules it has bound to that IP CAN bearer unless the
derived MBR value exceeds a possibly provisioned authorized QoS per QCI for
the bearererÂ´s QCI (see clause 4.5.5.6).
### A.3.3.3b Provisioning of authorized QoS per QCI
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding the PCRF shall not provision an
authorized QoS per QCI.
Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per QCI may apply when the IP-CAN type
is 3GPP-GPRS. It shall be performed according to clause 4.5.5.5.
### A.3.3.4 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per QCI
Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per QCI may apply when the IP-CAN type
is 3GPP-GPRS. It shall be performed according to clause 4.5.5.6.
The mapping from the authorized QoS parameters to the UM3GPP TS QoS parameters
shall be performed according to Table A.4.1.1.
### A.3.3.5 Void
### A.3.3.6 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
If the PCRF receives the requested QoS per APN as part of the IP-CAN session
establishment procedure, the PCRF shall provision the authorized unconditional
APN policy information and may provision the authorized conditional APN policy
information in the response. The PCRF may also provide QoS per APN with time
conditions.
## A.3.4 Indication of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications
When a PDP context is terminated, , the PCEF shall apply the \"Indication of
IP CAN Bearer Termination Implications\" procedure to inform the PCRF about
implications of this bearer termination if any of the following conditions
apply while the IP-CAN Session remains active:
\- A PDP Context is terminated, which has been initiated by the UE.
\- A PDP Context is terminated, which has been initiated by the network (e.g.
SGSN).
The following exceptions to clause 4.5.6 shall apply in 3GPP-GPRS.
When the PCRF performs bearer binding, the PCEF shall also supply the Bearer-
Identifier and Bearer-Operation AVPs to indicate \"Termination\" of a specific
bearer in a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\".
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request indicating the implications of a bearer
termination, it shall acknowledge the message by sending a CC-Answer to the
PCEF. The PCRF has the option to make a new PCC decision for the affected PCC
Rules. Within the CC-answer, the PCRF may provision PCC rules as detailed in
clause 4.5.2.0. When the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF may
provision PCC rules e.g. to move PCC rules previously applied to the
terminated IP CAN bearer to any of the remaining IP CAN bearer(s). The Bearer-
Identifier of the selected bearer(s) will be provided. The PCEF shall remove
all PCC rules previously applied to the terminated IP CAN bearer, which have
not been moved.
The PCEF shall remove all PCC rules previously applied to the terminated IP
CAN bearer, which have not been moved.
If the last PDP context within an IP CAN session is being terminated, the PCEF
shall apply the procedures in clause A.3.5 to indicate the IP CAN session
termination.
## A.3.5 Indication of IP-CAN Session Termination
For GPRS, an IP-CAN session is terminated when the last PDP Context within the
IP-CAN session is being terminated. The procedure described in clause 4.5.7
applies here.
## A.3.6 Request of IP-CAN Bearer Termination
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN bearer, the PCEF shall send a
PDP context deactivation request.
If the termination of the last IP CAN bearer within an IP CAN session is
requested, the PCRF and PCEF shall apply the procedures in clause A.3.7.
If the selected Bearer Control Mode is UE-only, the PCRF may request the
termination of an existing IP CAN bearer within an IP CAN session by using the
PCC rule provisioning procedures in clause 4.5.2.0 to remove all PCRF-
provisioned PCC rules and deactivate all PCC rules predefined within the PCEF,
which have been applied to this IP CAN bearer. The PCRF may either completely
remove these PCC rules from the IP CAN session or move them to another IP CAN
bearer within the IP CAN session.
If the PCEF performs the IP CAN bearer binding, the PCRF is not aware that it
requests the termination of an IP CAN bearer by removing certain PCC rules. If
upon removal of the PCC rules, there are no more PCC rules active in the PCEF
for an IP-CAN bearer, the PCEF shall initiate the bearer termination
procedure. Further details of the binding mechanism can be found in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-only, and the PCRF receives a
trigger for the removal of all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN bearer from the
AF, the following steps apply. In order to avoid race conditions, the PCRF
should start a timer to wait for the UE-initiated termination message. If a
UE-initiated termination of an IP CAN bearer is performed before timer expiry,
the PCRF will receive an Indication of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications
according to clause 4.5.6 and shall then not perform the network-initiated
termination of that IP CAN bearer. Otherwise, if the timer expires, the PCRF
shall remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been previously
installed/activated for that IP-CAN bearer.
If the IP-CAN bearer termination is caused by the PS to CS handover, the PCEF
shall report related PCC rules for this IP-CAN bearer by including the Rule-
Failure-Code AVP set to the value PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER.
If the PCRF decides to remove all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN bearer due to
an internal trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall instantly
remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been previously
installed/activated on that IP-CAN bearer.
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN bearer, the PCEF shall terminate
the IP CAN bearer.
## A.3.7 Request of IP-CAN Session Termination
The procedure described in clause 4.5.9 applies with the following changes:
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN session, the PCEF shall send a
PDP context deactivation request with the teardown indicator set to indicate
that the termination of the entire IP-CAN session is requested.
If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-only, and the PCRF receives a
trigger for the removal of all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN session from the
AF, the following steps apply. In order to avoid race conditions, the PCRF
should start a timer to wait for the UE-initiated bearer termination message.
If a UE-initiated bearer termination of an IP CAN session is performed before
timer expiry, the PCRF will receive an Indication of IP-CAN Session
Termination according to clause A.3.5 and shall then not perform the network-
initiated termination of that IP CAN session. Otherwise, if the timer expires,
the PCRF shall remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been previously
installed or activated for that IP-CAN session.
## A.3.8 Bearer Control Mode Selection
The GGSN shall only include the Network-Request-Support AVP if it supports
this procedure and both the UE and the SGSN have previously indicated to the
GGSN (refer to 3GPP TS 23.060 [17] and 3GPP TS 29.060 [18]) that they also
support it. The Network-Request-Support AVP shall be included if the GGSN
received it from the SGSN.
The PCRF derives the Selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy.
At IP-CAN session establishment, if the GGSN provided the Network-Request-
Support AVP, the PCRF shall provide the Selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP to
the GGSN using the PCC Rules provision procedure at IP-CAN session
establishment. At IP-CAN session modification, if the GGSN provided the
Network-Request-Support AVP, the PCRF shall also provide the Bearer-Control-
Mode AVP with the new value if the selected bearer control mode has changed.
The GGSN should forward it to the UE. The selected value is applicable to all
PDP Contexts within the activated PDP Address/APN pair.
The BCM selection procedure can also be triggered as a consequence of a change
of SGSN.
The values defined in 5.3.23 for the Bearer-Control-Mode AVP apply with the
following meaning:
UE_ONLY (0)
This value is used to indicate that the UE shall request any additional PDP
Context establishment.
RESERVED (1)
This value is not used in this Release.
UE_NW (2)
This value is used to indicate that both the UE and PCEF may request any
additional PDP Context establishment and add own traffic mapping information
to a PDP Context.
## A.3.9 Bearer Binding Mechanism
Refer to annex D.2 of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## A.3.10 Void
## A.3.11 PCC Rule Error Handling
In addition to the procedures described in clause 4.5.12 the following
procedures apply:
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, for predefined PCC rules that contain
only uplink service data flow filters which are known to the PCRF, the PCEF
may include the Bearer-Identifier AVP within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP to
indicate the affected IP-CAN bearer from a failed PCC rule activation. If no
Bearer-Identifier is provided then the PCRF shall assume that PCC rule failed
to activate to all assigned IP-CAN bearers.
NOTE: In such a case the same PCC rule can be activated to multiple IP-CAN
bearers of the same IP-CAN session.
## A.3.12 IMS Emergency Session Support
### A.3.12.1 Request of PCC Rules for an Emergency services
The PCEF shall execute the procedures described in clause A.3.1 to Request PCC
Rules for Emergency.
A PCEF that requests PCC Rules at IP-CAN Session Establishment shall send a
CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the
Called-Station-Id AVP including the Emergency APN. The PCEF may include the
IMSI within the Subscription-Id AVP and if the IMSI is not available the PCEF
shall include the IMEI within the User-Equipment-Info AVP. The PCEF may
include the rest of the attributes described in clause A.3.1.
If the PCRF detects that the initial or subsequent CCR command shall be
rejected, it shall execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental
result code described in clause A.3.1.
Any PCEF-initiated requests for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service that
include the \"TFT_CHANGE\" Event-Trigger AVP shall be rejected by the PCRF
with the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
### A.3.12.2 Provisioning of PCC Rules for an Emergency services
The PCRF shall execute the procedures described in clause A.3.2 to provision
PCC Rules.
The PCRF shall detect that a Gx session is restricted to IMS Emergency
services when a CCR command is received with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the Called-Station-Id AVP includes a PDN
identifier that matches one of the Emergency APNs from the configurable list.
The PCRF:
\- shall provision PCC Rules restricting the access to Emergency Services
(e.g. P-CSCF(s), DHCP(s) and DNS (s) and SUPL(s) addresses) required by local
operator policies in a CCA command according to the procedures described in
clause A.3.2.
\- may provision the authorized QoS within the QoS-Information AVP in a CCA
command according to the procedures described in clause A.3.3.1 except for
obtaining the authorized QoS upon interaction with the SPR.
\- shall assign NW mode to the PCC Rules that are bound to an IP-CAN session
restricted to Emergency services.
NOTE 1: The PCRF does not provision the authorized QoS per QCI for Gx sessions
established for the Emergency purposes.
When the PCRF receives IMS service information for an Emergency service and
derives authorized PCC Rules from the service information, the Priority-Level
AVP, the Pre-emption-Capability AVP and the Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP in
the QoS information within the PCC Rule shall be assigned values as required
by local operator policies.
If the Bearer Control Mode is assigned to \"UE_NW\" the PCRF shall assign NW
mode to the PCC Rules that are bound to an IP-CAN session restricted to
Emergency services and immediately initiate a PUSH procedure as described in
clause A.3.2 to provision PCC Rules and the procedures described in clause
A.3.3.2a to provision the authorized QoS per service data flow, except for the
QoS Information within the PCC Rules that shall be assigned a priority within
the Priority-Level AVP as required by local operator policies.
Any PCEF-initiated request for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service
triggered by Event-Trigger AVP assigned to \"TFT-change\" shall be rejected by
the PCRF with the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
## A.3.13 Removal of PCC Rules for Emergency Services
The reception of a request to terminate an AF session for an IMS Emergency
service by the PCRF follows the same procedure defined in clause 4.5.15.2.3.
## A.3.14 Removal of PCC Rules at Gx session termination
The reception of a request to terminate the IP-CAN session restricted to IMS
Emergency session shall follow the same procedure defined in clause
4.5.15.2.4.
## A.3.15 IMS Restoration Support
The procedure described in clause 4.5.18 applies and the monitoring procedure
is defined in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] Section 13a.2.2.1.
## A.3.16 Provisioning of CSG information reporting indication
The PCRF may provide one or more CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs during IP-
CAN/TDF session establishment and/or throughout the lifetime of the IP-CAN/TDF
session, to request the PCEF/TDF to report the user CSG information change
applicable for an IP-CAN/TDF session to the OFCS.
NOTE: The SPR can provide the Subscriber\'s User CSG Information reporting
rules to the PCRF, the SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
## A.3.17 Packet-Filter-Usage AVP
NOTE: The maximum number of packet filters sent to UE is limited as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## A.3.18 Precedence handling
PCRF provides only one precedence value per PCC rule. For network initiated
IP-CAN session modification, since one PCC rule may result in more than one
TFT filters, the PCEF shall ensure that each TFT filter is assigned unique
precedence value across all TFT filters of the corresponding PDN connection
(as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). When two PCC rules result in two sets
of TFT filters, the PCEF shall also ensure that the relative precedence of the
each set of TFT filters is same as the relative precedence of the
corresponding PCC rule. E.g. if PCC rule R1 has higher precedence than PCC
rule R2, all the TFT filters corresponding to R1 shall have higher precedence
than all the TFT filters corresponding to R2.
NOTE: The maximum value of precedence of the TFT filter is limited as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
Provisioning of CSG information reporting indication to the TDF applies when
ABC feature is supported.
## A.3.19 Reporting Access Network Information
The procedure described in clause 4.5.22 applies.
The GGSN provides the CGI/SAI within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP.
## A.3.20 User CSG Information Reporting
If the PCEF receives the credit re-authorization triggers from the OCS and CSG
information reporting indications within the CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs
from the PCRF which request different levels of reporting of user CSG
information change for a single IP-CAN session, the PCEF should derive the
highest level of detail required and request the user CSG information change
from the SGSN as defined in 3GPP TS 29.060 [18].
When ABC feature is supported, the PCEF may send user CSG information to the
TDF via the PCRF. During the IP-CAN Session Establishment, the PCEF may send
the user CSG information to the PCRF in a CC-Request command within a User-
CSG-Information AVP, and the PCRF sends User-CSG-Information AVP in a TSR
command to the TDF.
The TDF shall, for the purpose of reporting to the OCS, select and subscribe
to the applicable event triggers USER_CSG_INFORMATION_CHANGE,
USER_CSG_HYBRID_SUBSCRIBED_INFORMATION_CHANGE and/or USER_CSG_
HYBRID_UNSUBSCRIBED_INFORMATION_CHANGE within an Event-Report-Indication AVP
for reporting from the PCEF via the PCRF if the corresponding credit re-
authorization triggers are requested by the OCS. The PCRF shall subscribe to
the event triggers for the highest level of detail required for the reporting
within the user CSG information reporting rules and Event-Report-Indication
AVP to the PCEF. Then the PCEF request the user CSG information change from
the SGSN as defined in 3GPP TS 29.060 [18].
The PCEF reports that user CSG information has changed with the applicable
values provided in the related Event-Trigger AVPs and, when applicable, the
new user CSG information within the User-CSG-Information AVP.
The PCRF shall send the Event-Trigger AVPs and when applicable, the User-CSG-
Information AVP within an Event-Report-Indication AVP to the TDF in a RA-
Request command.
NOTE: The PCEF/TDF reports the user CSG information to the OFCS on the level
of detail as requested by the PCRF within the CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs
and reports the user CSG information to the OCS on the level of detail as
requested by the OCS re-authorization triggers.

NOTE: This table defines the mapping for GPRS QCI to/from UM3GPP TS QoS
parameters for pre-release 8 GPRS. The characteristics of GPRS QCIs are
independent from the standardized QCI characteristics for EPS.
The PCEF determines R97/98 attributes from R99 attributes according to 3GPP TS
23.107 [41].
## A.4.2 GPRS ARP to UMTS ARP parameter mapping
The mapping of the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP to the UM3GPP TS ARP
parameter(s) is specified in clause B.3.3.3.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Access specific aspects, 3GPP
(GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN) EPS
# B.1 Scope
This annex defines access specific aspects procedures for use of Gx/Gxx
between PCRF and a 3GPP EPC IP-CAN.
# B.2 Functional Elements
## B.2.1 PCRF
There are no access specific procedures defined.
## B.2.2 PCEF
There are no access specific procedures defined.
## B.2.3 BBERF
There are no access specific procedures defined.
# B.3 PCC procedures
## B.3.1 Request for PCC and/or QoS rules
This procedure is defined in clauses 4.5.1 and 4a.5.1 the following specifics.
Information about the support of network-initiated bearer procedures for the
IP-CAN session shall be provided via the Gx reference point.
The PCEF shall always include the RAT-Type as part of the IP-CAN Session
Establishment procedure.
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses:
\- When the UE requests to modify the bearer QoS without specifying any TFT
filter the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\",
and shall include within the CC-Request:
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP, set to the value for each of the packet filter(s) created by the UE. If
BCM is MS-only, the PCEF shall include all the packet filter identifier(s)
previously assigned on Gx for this EPS bearer within the Packet-Filter-
Identifier AVP. If BCM is MS/NW, the PCEF shall also include the SDF filter
identifier(s) that correspond to the packet filter identifier(s) in the
parameter list of the TFT within the Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the affected
packet filters; and
\- if there is no packet filter set by the network on the same bearer, the
QoS-Information AVP may indicate an updated QCI.
\- When the UE requests to add filters to an existing TFT, the PCEF shall set
the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include within
the CC-Request the request:
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each for each packet filter requested
for addition without any Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP; and
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each of the existing filter(s),
created by the UE, with the Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP and without any
filter attributes used for matching; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the affected PCC
rules.
For GERAN and UTRAN access, the relationship between the TFT operation
requested by MS and the Gx operation provided by PCEF to PCRF is as follows:
\- If the TFT operation is \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", the
PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", the
PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", the PCEF
shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Create new TFT\", the PCEF shall set the Packet-
Filter-Operation AVP to \"ADDITION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Delete existing TFT\", the PCEF shall set the
Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"No TFT operation\" or the TFT is missing (allowed
in BCM MS-only only, the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to
\"MODIFICATION\".
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, the PCRF shall provide packet filters in the PCC
rule as received in the Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter
requested by the UE.
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, if the PCRF receives a request for addition of
service data flow(s) with a reference to existing packet filter identifiers
(and by that to existing PCC rule(s)), the PCRF shall update the existing PCC
rule for the new service data flow(s) without changing the QCI and ARP.
NOTE: The reference to an existing packet filter identifiers informs the PCRF
that the request is confined to an existing bearer, having bearer bindings
with PCC rules that have the same QCI/ARP combination. Assigning a different
QCI or ARP to the new service data flows would cause the procedure to fail,
since the PCEF cannot map the new service data flows to another bearer.
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, when BCM is MS-only and the UE requests to
create a TFT for a PDP context without a TFT created by the PDP Context
Activation Procedure, the PCRF shall authorize a PCC rule which contains the
packet filters as requested by the UE when receiving the CCR request from the
PCEF. The PCEF shall install the PCC rule provisioned by the PCRF, shall
deactivate/remove the activated PCC rules that were previously
activated/installed by the PCRF and were bound to the same bearer, and shall
send a CCR command to the PCRF with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\", including the Charging-Rule-Report AVP specifying the
deactivated/removed PCC rules with the PCC-Rule-Status set to inactive and
including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP assigned to the value NO_BEARER_BOUND
(15).
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, when BCM is MS-only and the UE requests to
delete the existing TFT, the PCRF should provide at least one new PCC rule to
be installed at the same time when the PCC rule corresponding to the TFT is
removed.
For E-UTRAN accesses with UE initiated resource modification procedure, the
PCRF shall either authorize the same QoS as requested QoS within the QoS-
Information AVP or reject the request if the requested QoS can not be
authorized. The PCRF may reject the request using a CC-Answer with the Gx
experimental result code DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140). If the PCEF
receives a CC-Answer with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session
modification that initiated the CC-Request.
## B.3.2 Provisioning of PCC and/or QoS rules
For GTP-based 3GPP accesses, the PCRF may request the establishment of a
bearer dedicated to IMS signalling by providing the applicable PCC rules to
the PCEF.
For PMIP-based 3GPP accesses, the PCRF may request the establishment of a
bearer dedicated to IMS signalling by providing the applicable QoS rules to
the BBERF.
When the PCEF includes the Bearer-Usage AVP required for the default bearer
within the CCR command during the IP-CAN session establishment procedure, the
PCRF shall provide the Bearer-Usage AVP back in the response with the
authorized usage.
If during IP-CAN session establishment procedure, the PCEF includes
IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP and the PCRF accepts that default
bearer is dedicated to IMS signalling, the PCRF shall include the
IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP. In this case, the PCRF shall
restrict the bearer to only be used for IMS signalling as specified in 3GPP TS
23.228 [31] by applying the applicable QCI for IMS signalling.
If the PCEF include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP in the CCR
command, but the PCRF does not include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-
Usage AVP in the CCA command, the PCC Rules provided by the PCRF shall have a
QCI value different from the QCI value for the IMS signalling.
When UE initiates a resource modification request, if the PCEF includes the
Bearer-Usage AVP indicating IMS_SIGNALLING and the PCRF accepts that a bearer
dedicated to IMS signalling shall be used, the PCRF shall return the
IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP. The provided PCC rules shall have
the QCI applicable for IMS signalling.
During the IP-CAN session establishment, the PCEF shall not provide packet
filters to UE on the default bearer in the IP-CAN session establishment
response, referring to 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
## B.3.3 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
### B.3.3.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF shall provision the authorized unconditional APN policy information
and may provision the authorized conditional APN policy information as part of
the IP-CAN session establishment procedure. The PCRF may also provide QoS per
APN with time conditions.
### B.3.3.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per APN
There are no access specific procedures defined.
### B.3.3.3 QoS handling for interoperation with Gn/Gp SGSN
When the PCEF receives the establishment or modification of an IP-CAN bearer
from a Gn/Gp SGSN, the PCEF shall derive the requested QoS information in the
CC-Request command following the mapping rules included in 3GPP TS 23.401 [32]
Annex E as follows:
\- Guaranteed-Bitrate-UL AVP and Guaranteed-Bitrate-DL AVP shall be obtained
from the bearer parameter GBR received within the PDP-Context.
\- If APN-AMBR is not received within the initial PDP-Context for the IP-CAN
session, the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP and APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL
AVP shall be mapped from the bearer parameter MBR received within the PDP-
Context. If APN-AMBR is received as a part of the initial PDP Context for the
IP-CAN session, it shall be included within the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL
AVP and APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate DL AVP. When the PCEF receives a request for
modification of the MBR for the initial PDP context or any non-GBR PDP
context, the PCEF shall take the common flags \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" and
\"No QoS negotiation\" described down below in to consideration and act
accordingly.
\- Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP shall be derived based on the QoS bearer
parameters included in the initial PDP-Context received for the IP-CAN
session. When the PCEF receives a request for modification of the initial PDP
context that modifies either the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP or Allocation-
Retention-Priority AVP, the modified values shall be provided as part of the
Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP.
\- Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP shall be mapped one-to-one from the
Evolved ARP if this parameter is included within the PDP Context. Otherwise,
it will be derived as follows:
\- The Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall be
set based on operator policies.
\- The Priority-Level AVP is derived as described in table B.3.3.3.1:
Table B.3.3.3.1: Mapping of ARP to Priority-Level AVP
* * *
ARP Value Priority-Level AVP 1 1 2 H+1 3 M+1
* * *
NOTE 1: The values of H (high priority) and M (medium priority) can be set
according to operator requirements to ensure proper treatment of users with
higher priority level information. The minimum value of H is 1\. The minimum
value of M is H+1.
\- QoS-Class-Identifier AVP may be derived based on table B.3.3.3.2:
Table B.3.3.3.2: Mapping between standardized QCIs and R99 UMTS QoS parameter
values

The PCEF determines R97/98 attributes from R99 attributes according to 3GPP TS
23.107 [41].
The PCRF shall provide the authorized QoS information according to clause
4.5.5.2 (when the authorized QoS applies to the service data flow), clause
4.5.5.8 (when the authorized QoS applies at APN level) or 4.5.5.9 (when the
authorized QoS applies to the default bearer).
When the PCEF receives the authorized QoS information applicable for the
service data flow, the PCEF shall act according to clause 4.5.5.3. The PCEF
shall then derive the QoS information of the PDP context from the calculated
authorized QoS as follows:
\- For non-GBR bearers, if APN-AMBR parameter was not received in the initial
PDP context for the IP-CAN session, the bearer parameter MBR shall be set to
the value of the authorized APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL and APN-Aggregate-
Max-Bitrate-DL AVPs. For GBR-bearers the MBR and GBR of the PDP-Context shall
be mapped one-to-one from the MBR and GBR values calculated for that bearer
according to clause 4.5.5.3.
\- The Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP received as part of the PCC Rule
shall be used to bind the PCC rules to the corresponding bearer. If the SGSN
supports the Evolved ARP parameter (i.e. it was received as part of the PDP
contexts) the Evolved ARP for the PDP context shall be mapped one-to-one from
the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP assigned to the corresponding bearer. If
the SGSN does not support Evolved ARP parameter, the P-GW shall ignore the
Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP when deriving the
ARP of the PDP Context.
The ARP parameter is derived as described in table B.3.3.3.3:
Table B.3.3.3.3: Mapping of Priority-Level AVP to ARP
* * *
Priority-Level AVP ARP value 1 to H 1 H+1 to M 2 M+1 to 15 3
* * *
NOTE 2: The values of H (high priority) and M (medium priority) can be set
according to operator requirements to ensure proper treatment of users with
higher priority level information. The minimum value of H is 1\. The minimum
value of M is H+1.
\- The P-GW shall bind only PCC rules with the same ARP setting (Priority-
Level AVP, Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP) to
the same PDP context to enable modification of the bearer ARP without
impacting the assignment of services to bearers after a handover to E-UTRAN.
NOTE 3: When Evolved ARP parameter is not received as part of the PDP-Context,
any change of the bearer ARP parameter may get overwritten by the SGSN due to
subscription enforcement.
\- The PCEF may derive the Traffic Class, Traffic Handling Priority,
Signalling Indication and Source Statistics Descriptor from the QoS-Class-
Identifier AVP based on the table B.3.3.3.2. The standardized QCI
characteristics may be derived from the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP according to
table 6.1.7 in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. The derivation of other values received as
part of the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP shall be performed as defined in 3GPP TS
23.401 [32], Annex E.
Common flags \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" and \"No QoS negotiation\" shall be
handled as follows.
\- When the PCEF receives a Create PDP context request, the PCEF shall derive
the QoS information according to the mapping procedures described in this
clause and it shall check whether the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flags are
present. The following procedures shall apply.
\- If the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flag is set to \"1\" in the Common Flag
Information Element within the Common Flag IE (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), normal
procedures apply.
\- If the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flag is set to \"0\" or if it is absent,
the PCEF shall contact the PCRF including the requested QoS information
derived following the mapping rules described in this clause. When the PCEF
derives the authorized UM3GPP TS QoS information received from the PCRF
according to the mapping procedures described in this clause, it shall check
\- Whether the authorized GBR, MBR or APN-AMBR is equal to or higher than the
GBR, MBR or APN-AMBR requested from the GnGp SGSN. If it is so, the PCEF shall
accept the requested values. Otherwise the PCEF shall accept the authorized
values.
\- Whether the authorized ARP priority level is equal to or higher than the
ARP priority level requested from the GnGp SGSN. If it is so, the PCEF shall
accept the requested priority value. Otherwise the PCEF shall accept the
authorized values.
NOTE 4: The ARP priority level attribute represents the actual priority for
the service/user with the value 1 as the highest.
NOTE 5: Whether the QCI is permitted to be changed or not is subject to
operator policies and normal restrictions on changing from a Non-GBR QCI value
to GBR QCI value on a default bearer.
NOTE 6: Whether the Pre-emption capability and Pre-emption vulnerability are
permitted to be changed or not is subject to operator policies.
\- When the PCEF receives an Update PDP context request, the PCEF shall derive
the QoS information according to the mapping procedures described in this
clause and it shall check whether the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag and the
\"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flags are present. The following procedures shall
apply.
\- If the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flag set to \"1\" and the \"No QoS
negotiation\" flag set to \"0\" or is absent, normal procedures apply with the
following exceptions when only MBR is changed:\ If the derived MBR is equal to
or less than the authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall
accept the requested QoS values without interacting with the PCRF. If the
derived MBR is higher than the last authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN
session, the PCEF shall send a MBR equal to the authorized APN-AMBR in the
Update PDP context response without interacting with the PCRF, i.e. the PCEF
does not report the QOS_CHANGE event trigger to the PCRF.
\- If the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag is set to \"1\" in the Common Flag
Information Element (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), and the derived QCI and/or ARP is
different from the QCI and/or ARP authorized for that bearer, the PCEF shall
reject the procedure. Otherwise, the next procedure shall apply.
\- If the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag is set to \"1\", if the derived MBR or
APN-AMBR is equal to or less than the authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN
session, the PCEF shall accept the requested QoS values without interacting
with the PCRF. If the derived MBR or APN-AMBR is higher than the authorized
APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall reject the requested QoS
change. If the GBR is different from the authorized GBR, the PCEF shall reject
the requested QoS change.
\- If the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flag set to \"0\" in the Common Flag
Information Element or if the corresponding bit within the Common Flag IE is
absent (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), and the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag is set to
\"0\" or is absent, the PCEF shall behave in the same way as when the
\"Upgrade QoS supported\" flag set to \"0\" is received in the Create PDP
Context request procedure with the following exceptions when only MBR is
changed:\ If the derived MBR is equal to or less than the last authorized APN-
AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall accept the requested QoS values
without interacting with the PCRF. If the derived MBR is higher than the
authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall send a MBR equal to
the authorized APN-AMBR in the Update PDP context response without interacting
with the PCRF, i.e. the PCEF does not report the QOS_CHANGE event trigger to
the PCRF.
When the PCEF receives the authorized QoS information applicable for the
default bearer as part of the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP, the PCEF shall then
derive the QoS information corresponding to the initial PDP Context from the
QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP, following the
same derivation rules as when the QoS information is received as part of the
PCC Rule.
When the PCEF receives the authorized QoS information applicable for the APN,
the PCEF shall act according to clause 4.5.5.8. The PCEF shall modify the MBR
for the PDP contexts with Traffic Class \'Interactive\' and \'Background\'.
When the PCEF receives the Secondary PDP Context Activation command, the PCEF
shall derive the QoS information and packet filter information, and interact
with PCRF by applying the UE initiated resource modification procedure as
specified in clause 4.5.1.
### B.3.3.4 Void
### B.3.3.5 Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
For the authorization of a PCC rule with a GBR QCI the PCRF shall assign a GBR
value within the limit supported by the serving network (i.e. GERAN/UTRAN).
The PCRF shall subscribe the RAT_CHANGE event to get the RAT type information
for PCC rule authorization.
NOTE: For the authorization of PCC Rules with the same QCI the PCRF may also
check that aggregated GBR is within the limits supported by the serving
network to minimize the risk of rejection of the bearer by the serving
network.
### B.3.3.6 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS of the Default EPS Bearer
The procedures defined in clause 4.5.5.10 apply.
Whenever the PCRF modifies the Authorized QoS of the default bearer, the PCRF
shall simultaneously modify the QCI and/or ARP of all PCC/QoS Rules that,
according to the operator policy, shall have the same QoS as the default
bearer. The PCEF/BBERF shall re-evaluate the bearer binding procedure defined
in clause 5.4 in the 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] taking into account the default bearer
QoS change and any PCC/QoS Rule operation requested by the PCRF.
NOTE2: The network configuration can ensure that at least one PCC/QoS Rule is
bound to the default bearer by applying either operator policies in the PCRF
ensuring that a PCC/QoS Rule with matching QoS will be active or in the
PCEF/BBERF ensuring that a predefined PCC/QoS Rule not known to the PCRF is
bound to the default bearer.
## B.3.4 Packet-Filter-Information AVP
In addition to the definition of the Packet-Filter-Information AVP in clause
5.3.55, for E-UTRAN the Packet-Filter-Information AVPs shall be derived from
the information defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## B.3.5 Bearer Control Mode Selection
Bearer Control Mode Selection shall take place via the Gx reference point
according to clause 4.5.10.
## B.3.6 Trace activation/deactivation at P-GW
In case of a PMIP-based 3GPP access the S-GW sends the trace activation and
deactivation to the P-GW via the PCRF. To activate the trace, the S-GW sends
the Trace Information to the PCRF in a CCR message within a Trace-Data AVP and
with an Event-Trigger AVP containing the value PGW_TRACE_CONTROL. The PCRF
sends the Trace-Data and Event-Trigger AVPs within an Event-Report-Indication
AVP further to the P-GW in a CCA message (upon IP-CAN session establishment)
or RAR message. To deactivate the trace, the S-GW sends the Trace Reference to
the PCRF in a CCR message within a Trace-Reference AVP and with an Event-
Trigger AVP containing the value PGW_TRACE_CONTROL. The PCRF sends the Trace-
Reference and Event-Trigger AVPs within an Event-Report-Indication AVP further
to the P-GW in a RAR message.
## B.3.7 IMS Restoration Support
The procedure described in clause 4.5.18 applies and the monitoring procedure
is defined in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] Section 13a.2.2.1.
## B.3.8 Provisioning of CSG information reporting indication
The PCRF may provide one or more CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs during IP-
CAN/TDF session establishment and/or throughout the lifetime of the IP-CAN/TDF
session, to request the PCEF/TDF to report the user CSG information change
applicable for an IP-CAN/TDF session to the OFCS.
NOTE: The SPR can provide the Subscriber\'s User CSG Information reporting
rules to the PCRF, the SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
Provisioning of CSG information reporting indication to the TDF applies when
ABC feature is supported.
## B.3.9 Packet-Filter-Usage AVP
NOTE: The maximum number of packet filters sent to UE is limited as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## B.3.10 User CSG Information Reporting
### B.3.10.1 GTP-based S5/S8
The procedure defined in clause A.3.20 is applied except that the PCEF should
request the user CSG information change from the S-GW as defined in 3GPP TS
29.274 [22].
### B.3.10.2 PMIP-based S5/S8
The S-GW may send user CSG information to the P-GW via the PCRF.
During the IP-CAN Session Establishment, the S-GW may send the user CSG
information to the PCRF in a CC-Request command within a User-CSG-Information
AVP and the PCRF sends User-CSG-Information AVP in a CC-Answer command to the
P-GW or in a TSR command to the TDF if the ABC feature is supported.
The P-GW or TDF if ABC feature is supported shall select and subscribe to the
applicable event triggers USER_CSG_INFORMATION_CHANGE,
USER_CSG_HYBRID_SUBSCRIBED_INFORMATION_CHANGE and/or USER_CSG_
HYBRID_UNSUBSCRIBED_INFORMATION_CHANGE within an Event-Report-Indication AVP
for reporting from the BBERF via the PCRF if the corresponding credit re-
authorization triggers are requested by the OCS. The PCRF shall subscribe to
the event triggers for the highest level of detail required for the reporting
within the user CSG information reporting rules and Event-Report-Indication
AVP to the S-GW.
The S-GW reports that user CSG information has changed with the applicable
values provided in the related Event-Trigger AVPs and, when applicable, the
new user CSG information within the User-CSG-Information AVP.
The PCRF shall send the Event-Trigger AVPs and when applicable, the User-CSG-
Information AVP within an Event-Report-Indication AVP to the P-GW/TDF in a RA-
Request command.
NOTE: The PCEF/TDF reports the user CSG information to the OFCS on the level
of detail as requested by the PCRF within the CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs
and reports the user CSG information to the OCS on the level of detail as
requested by the OCS re-authorization triggers.
## B.3.11 Request of IP-CAN Bearer Termination
For PMIP-based 3GPP accesses, if the IP-CAN bearer termination is caused by
the PS to CS handover, the BBERF reports related QoS rules for this IP-CAN
bearer by including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to the value
PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER as part of the Gateway Control Session Modification
procedure.
For GTP-based 3GPP accesses, if the IP-CAN bearer termination is caused by the
PS to CS handover, the PCEF reports related PCC rules for this IP-CAN bearer
by including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to the value PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER as
part of the IP-CAN session modification procedure.
## B.3.12 CS to PS handover
In order to support CS to PS handover according to 3GPP TS 23.216 [40], the
PCRF shall ensure that voice media may use the default bearer until the
appropriate bearer has been established.
If the operator policy requires a policy decision to be made in order to allow
voice media on the default bearer, the PCRF shall subscribe to the
CS_TO_PS_HANDOVER event trigger. Upon detection of CS to PS handover, the PCEF
shall generate a CS_TO_PS_HANDOVER event. In response to the event the PCRF
shall make policy decisions, for example provisioning or modifying the
appropriate PCC rules, to allow voice media on the default bearer.
NOTE 1: If the PCRF provides dynamic PCC rules to be installed in the default
bearer, the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP in
the PCC rule(s) shall be respectively set to the same value as the ones of the
default EPS bearer QoS information of the IP-CAN session.
If the PCRF received the first voice media authorized over Rx interface that
corresponds to the voice session being transferred, the PCRF shall provide the
corresponding PCC Rules and shall also subscribe to
SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION event trigger.
If the PCRF receives the SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION event trigger for the
first voice media authorized over Rx that corresponds to the voice session
being transferred and the PCRF made policy decisions upon request of the
CS_TO_PS_HANDOVER event, the PCRF should revoke that decision. In the case
there were PCC Rules related to the voice media being transferred installed in
the default bearer should be removed by the PCRF.
NOTE 2: There exists a very small possibility that another Rx session is
established before or in parallel to the IMS voice session in transfer, i.e.
due to a terminating voice session request. It is considered that this can be
avoided by implementation and is therefore out of scope of standard.
## B.3.13 Precedence handling
PCRF provides only one precedence value per PCC rule. For network initiated
IP-CAN session modification, since one PCC rule may result in more than one
TFT filters, the PCEF/BBERF has to ensure that each TFT filter is assigned
unique precedence value across all TFT filters of the corresponding PDN
connection (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [42]). When
two PCC rules result in two sets of TFT filters, the PCEF/BBERF shall also
ensure that the relative precedence of the each set of TFT filters is same as
the relative precedence of the corresponding PCC rule. E.g. if PCC rule R1 has
higher precedence than PCC rule R2, all the TFT filters corresponding to R1
shall have higher precedence than all the TFT filters corresponding to R2.
NOTE: The maximum value of precedence of the TFT filter is limited as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## B.3.14 S-GW Restoration Support
During IP-CAN session establishment, if both the PCEF and PCRF advertise the
support for S-GW restoration, the PCRF shall subscribe to the AN_GW_CHANGE
event trigger.
When the PCRF sends a RAR or CCA command with new policy decisions for a PDN
connection maintained during a S-GW failure, the PCEF shall act as follows:
\- For MME/S4-SGSN triggered S-GW Restoration scenarios:
if the policy decisions were received in a RAR command, the PCEF shall send an
RAA command with the Experimental-Result-Code set to DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED
(4143) indicating the failure to enforce all those policy decisions.
If the installation/modification of one or more PCC rules fails the PCEF shall
reject the procedure as described in clause 4.5.12. The Rule-Failure-Code AVP,
for both PULL and PUSH modes shall be set to AN_GW_FAILED (17).
If the PCRF sends a CCA that includes policy decision not related to a PCC
Rule (e.g. change of APN-AMBR), the PCEF shall send a CCR that includes the
event trigger related with the failure to enforce the corresponding policy
decision (as per the existing procedures) and the AN-GW-Status AVP set to
AN_GW_FAILED (0).
\- For P-GW triggered S-GW Restoration scenarios, the PCEF shall accept the
procedure as per normal procedures. In the case, the PDN connection is not
restored during an operator configured time period, the PCEF shall send a new
CCR command when the related timer expires. If the RAR/CCA related to a PCC
Rule procedure, the CCR shall include the Charging-Rule-Report AVP with the
Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_FAILURE and with the PCC-
Rule-Status set to INACTIVE. If the RAR/CCA included policy decision not
related to the PCC Rules (e.g. change of APN-AMBR), the CCR shall include the
event trigger related with the failure to enforce the corresponding policy
decision according to the current procedures.
For MME/S4-SGSN triggered S-GW Restoration scenarios, while the S-GW
restoration is in progress, if the PCEF sends a CCR command towards the PCRF
that is triggered by a different event (e.g. internal event at PCEF or Gy
interface related event), the PCEF shall include the AN-GW-Status AVP set to
AN_GW_FAILED (0).
Upon reception of the Rule-Failure-Code set to AN_GW_FAILED (17) , AN-GW-
Status set to AN_GW_FAILED (0) or a Experimental-Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED (4143) the PCRF shall not initiate any IP-CAN Session
Modification procedure, except if the IP-CAN Session Modification procedure is
initiated for the PCC rule removal only, for the given IP-CAN session over Gx
until the S-GW has recovered.
If the PCEF indicated AN_GW_FAILED previously according to the procedures
described above, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF when the S-GW has recovered
using the Event-Trigger AVP set to AN_GW_CHANGE and including the AN-GW-
Address AVP related to the restored or new S-GW. The PCRF may after this
update the PCEF with PCC Rules if necessary.
NOTE 1: The PCRF could reject requests from the AF and SPR when the Rule-
Failure-Code set to AN_GW_FAILED (17) , the AN-GW-Status AVP set to
AN_GW_FAILED (0) or the Experimental-Result-Code set to DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED
(4143) is received until the Event-Trigger AVP set to AN_GW_CHANGE is
received.
The PCEF shall maintain the PDN connections affected by the S-GW failure and
eligible for restoration for an operator configurable time period (see 3GPP TS
23.007 [43]). Upon expiry of that time period, the PCEF shall release the PDN
connection and inform the PCRF about the IP-CAN Session Termination as
specified in clause 4.5.7.
NOTE 2: The PCRF is not aware of which PDN connections are eligible for
restoration. When the PCEF detects a S-GW failure, the PCEF requests the PCRF
to terminate IP-CAN sessions associated to PDN connections affected by the
S-GW failure and not eligible for restoration.
The PCEF should maintain the GBR bearers of the PDN connections eligible for
restoration for an operator configurable time period (see 3GPP TS 23.007
[43]). Upon expiry of that time period, the PCEF shall release GBR bearers
that have not yet been restored and inform the PCRF about the PCC rule removal
as specified in clause 4.5.6.
The PCEF shall discard downlink packets received for a PDN connection
maintained during a S-GW failure that has not yet been restored.
The PCEF shall delete the PDN connection locally when it receives an IP-CAN
session termination from the PCRF as described in clause 4.5.9.
For the PMIP-based 3GPP access, when the PCRF detects a BBERF failure or
restart, the PCRF shall maintain the IP-CAN sessions and delete locally the
Gateway Control sessions affected by the BBERF failure. In this case, if the
PCRF receives a request from the AF or SPR that requires to modify the IP-CAN
session and no error indication was received from the PCEF before, the PCRF
may initiate the IP-CAN session modification towards the PCEF.
NOTE 3: The method the PCRF uses to determine that a BBERF has failed or
restarted is not specified in this release.
NOTE 4: The PCRF can refrain from sending policy information within the RAR
command since it is aware that the BBERF has failed or restarted via Gxx
reference point. The PCRF will know that the BBERF has recovered when a new
Gateway Control Session Establishment is received that is linked with the
affected IP-CAN session.
## B.3.15 Reporting Access Network Information
The procedure described in clause 4.5.22 or clause 4a.5.16 applies.
In case of a GTP-based 3GPP access the P-GW provides the CGI/SAI/ECGI within
the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP.
In case of a PMIP-based 3GPP access the S-GW provides the CGI/SAI/ECGI within
the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP.
If the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, upon installation,
modification and removal of any PCC/QoS rule(s) containing the Required-
Access-Info AVP the PCEF/BBERF shall send an appropriate \"Bearer Setup
Request\", \"Update Bearer Request\" or \"Delete Bearer Request\". The
response message will include the access network information to the PDN GW.
NOTE: No specific request for location information reporting is required
within those request messages.
## B.3.16 Presence Reporting Area Information reporting
The PCRF determines at IP-CAN session establishment, whether reports for
change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area are desired for the IP-CAN
session based on the subscriber\'s profile configuration and the Supported-
Features AVP indicating the value \"CNO-ULI\". If the reporting is desired for
the IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall provide the Presence-Reporting-Area-
Information AVP which contains the Presence Reporting Area Identifier within
the Presence-Reporting-Area-Identifier AVP, and, for a UE-dedicated Presence
Reporting Area, the list of elements composing the presence reporting area
within the Presence-Reporting-Area-Elements-List AVP to the PCEF. The PCRF may
activate the reporting changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by
subscribing to the CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT
event trigger at the PCEF at any time during the lifetime of the IP-CAN
session.
NOTE 1: If Presence Reporting Area reporting is not supported, the PCRF can
instead activate location change reporting that reports actual location. Due
to the potential increase in signalling load, careful consideration of the
network load is necessary for such reporting, e.g. limiting the number of
subscribers subject to such reporting.
The PCRF may also provide Presence-Reporting-Area-Identifier AVP within
Presence-Reporting-Area-Information AVP via TSR command during the TDF session
establishment. The TDF may request the notification of
\"CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT (48)\" by including
it in Event-Trigger AVP within Event-Report-Indication AVP via TSA or CCR
command to indicate the PCRF to report the presence reporting area status
change.
When the UE enters or leaves the presence reporting area, the PCEF shall
report the CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT event;
additionally, the PCEF shall also report the presence reporting area status
within the Presence-Reporting-Area-Status AVP and presence reporting area
identifier within Presence-Reporting-Area-Identifier AVP included in Presence-
Reporting-Area-Information AVP. If the TDF has requested the notification of
the change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, the PCRF shall provide
Presence-Reporting-Area-Information AVP within the Event-Report-Indication AVP
via RAR command to the TDF.
NOTE 2: The PCRF may acquire the necessary data for presence reporting from
the SPR. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified
in this Release.
NOTE 3: For a given PDN connection, reporting for only one presence reporting
area is specified in this Release.
NOTE 4: Homogeneous support of Presence Area reporting in a network is
assumed.
NOTE 5: Presence Reporting Area reporting is not supported for case 2b in this
release.
The PCRF may be notified during the lifetime of an IP-CAN session that the UE
is located in an access network where local configuration indicates that the
reporting change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area is not supported.
The PCRF may unsubscribe to the change of UE presence in Presence Reporting
Area by providing the Event-Trigger AVP with removing the value
CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT (48), if previously
activated.
The PCEF shall de-activate the relevant IP-CAN specific procedure for
reporting Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, when the PCRF and
OCS unsubscribe to change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area.
## B.3.17 Multiple Presence Reporting Area Information reporting
When Multiple-PRA feature is supported, the PCRF may determine at any time
during the lifetime of the IP-CAN session whether reports for change of UE
presence in Presence Reporting Area(s) are desired for the IP-CAN session
based on the subscriber\'s profile configuration. If the reporting is desired
for the IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall provide the PRA-Install AVP including
the Presence-Reporting-Area-Information AVP(s) which each contains the
Presence Reporting Area Identifier within the Presence-Reporting-Area-
Identifier AVP, and, for a UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area and the list
of elements composing the presence reporting area within the Presence-
Reporting-Area-Elements-List AVP. If PCRF is configured with a Presence
Reporting Area identifier referring to the list of Presence Reporting Area
Identifier(s) within a Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [32], the PCRF shall include the identifier of
the Presence Reporting Area set within the Presence-Reporting-Area-Identifier
AVP.The PCRF shall activate the reporting changes of UE presence in Presence
Reporting Area(s) by subscribing to the
CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT event trigger at the
PCEF.
NOTE 1: If this feature is not supported, the PCRF can instead activate
location change reporting that reports actual location. Due to the potential
increase in signalling load, careful consideration of the network load is
necessary for such reporting, e.g. limiting the number of subscribers subject
to such reporting.
NOTE 2: The Presence Reporting Area Identifier can correspond to a list of
Presence Reporting Area Identifier(s) within a set of Core Network predefined
Presence Reporting Areas (PRA set identifier) as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401
[32] if the PCRF is configured
The PCRF may modify the list of PRA Identifier(s) by providing the new
Presence Reporting Areas within the PRA-Install AVP as described above and/or
by removing existing Presence Reporting Area(s) within the PRA-Remove AVP. In
this case, the Presence-Reporting-Area-Identifier AVP of the removed Presence
Reporting Area shall be included within the Presence-Reporting-Area-
Information AVP(s).
The PCRF may modify the list(s) of Presence Reporting Area elements. In that
case, the PCRF shall provide the PRA-Install AVP including the Presence-
Reporting-Area-Information AVP(s) which contains the Presence-Reporting-Area-
Identifier AVP(s) for the affected Presence Reporting Area(s) and the Presence
Reporting Area elements within the Presence-Reporting-Area- Elements-List AVP.
All the contents related to the Presence Reporting Area shall be included in
this case.
The PCRF may unsubscribe to the change of UE presence in Presence Reporting
Area by providing the Event-Trigger AVP with removing the value
CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT (48), if previously
activated.
If the CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT event trigger
is set, when the PCRF provides a list of presence reporting areas as described
above, the PCRF shall ensure that the maximum number of provisioned Presence
Reporting Area Identifiers is not exceeded. The maximum number of PRAs may be
configured in the PCRF. The PCRF may have independent configuration of the
maximum number for Core Network pre-configured PRAs and UE-dedicated PRAs.
NOTE 3: For all the Presence Reporting Area(s) provided by the PCRF, the PCEF
can store the Presence Reporting Area Identifier(s) together with an
indication that states that it relates to PCRF requested PRA status changes.
NOTE 4: This information is needed so that if both PCRF and OCS subscribe to
reports of PRA status changes, the PCEF is able to differentiate whether the
reported PRA changes are relevant to PCRF or OCS.
The PCEF shall initiate the appropriate IP-CAN specific procedure according to
3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
When the PCEF receives the presence reporting area information from the
serving node as defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22] indicating that the UE is
inside or outside of one or more presence reporting areas or any of the
presence reporting areas is set to inactive, the PCEF shall check if the
reported presence reported area identifier corresponds to a presence reporting
area that is relevant for the PCRF. In that case, the PCEF shall report the
CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT event in the Event-
Trigger AVP; additionally, the PCEF shall also report the presence reporting
area status within the Presence-Reporting-Area-Status AVP and presence
reporting area identifier within Presence-Reporting-Area-Identifier AVP
included in Presence-Reporting-Area-Information AVP(s) for each of the
presence reporting areas reported by the serving node.
If the PCEF receives additional presence reporting area information together
with the PRA Identifier as described in 3GPP TS 29.274 [22], the PCEF shall
only provide the PCRF with the presence reporting area information
corresponding to the additional PRA information.
NOTE 5: The PCEF will receive additional presence reporting area information
when the UE enters or leaves one or more presence reporting areas related to a
PRA set. In that case, the additional presence reporting area information
corresponds to the actual individual presence reporting area. The received
presence reporting area identifier corresponds to the PRA set id and is used
to identify the requester (PCRF or OCS) of the notification information.
NOTE 6: The PCRF can acquire the necessary data for presence reporting from
the SPR. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified
in this Release.
NOTE 7: Homogeneous support of Presence Area reporting in a network is
assumed.
NOTE 8: Presence Reporting Area reporting is not supported for case 2b in this
release.
NOTE 9: The serving node can activate the reporting for the PRAs which are
inactive as described in the 3GPP TS 23.401 [32].
The PCRF may be notified during the lifetime of an IP-CAN session that the UE
is located in an access network where local configuration indicates that the
reporting change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area is not supported.
The PCRF may unsubscribe to the change of UE presence in Presence Reporting
Area by providing the Event-Trigger AVP with the value
CHANGE_OF_UE_PRESENCE_IN_PRESENCE_REPORTING_AREA_REPORT (48) omitted, if
previously activated.
The PCEF shall de-activate the relevant IP-CAN specific procedure for
reporting Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, when the PCRF and
OCS unsubscribe to change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area.
## B.3.18 RAN Information Support
If RAN-Support-Info feature is enabled, the PCRF may provide, for PCC rules
with QCI of 1, the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP including the downlink maximum
packet loss rate within the Max-PLR-DL AVP and/or the uplink maximum packet
loss rate within the Max-PLR-UL AVP.
Upon receipt of the Max-PLR-DL AVP and/or Max-PLR-UL AVP from the PCRF, the
PCEF shall set the downlink and/or uplink maximum packet loss rate value(s) to
the lowest one for each direction among all of the values sharing the QCI=1
bearer.
###### ## Annex C (Informative): Mapping table for type of access networks

###### ## Annex D (normative): Access specific aspects (EPC-based Non-3GPP)
# D.1 Scope
This annex defines access specific procedures for use of Gxx between PCRF and
a Non-3GPP access connected to EPC. Gx interface applies between the PCRF and
the PCEF and shall follow the procedures within the main body of this
specification.
If an EPC-based non-3GPP access (3GPP TS 23.402 [23]) requires Gxx for dynamic
QoS control then it shall include the BBERF. The allocation of a BBERF to a
node within the non-3GPP IPâ€‘CAN is out of 3GPP scope, unless otherwise
specified in this Annex.
# D.2 EPC-based eHRPD Access
## D.2.1 General
In case of EPC-based eHRPD access the BBERF is located in the HRPD Serving
Gateway (HSGW) as defined in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [24].
The HSGW of an EPC-based eHRPD access that supports a Gxa interface shall
support all the Gxa procedures defined in this specification.
During the pre-registration phase in case of optimised EUTRAN-to-HRPD
handovers, the Serving GW and the HSGW are associated with the IPâ€‘CAN
session(s) of the UE in the PCRF. The HSGW is the non-primary BBERF.
## D.2.2 Gxa procedures
### D.2.2.1 Request for QoS rules
The procedures specified in clause 4a.5.1 apply with the following additions.
If the BBERF in HSGW is being requested via IP-CAN specific signaling not to
establish the Gateway Control session, the BBERF shall not establish the
Gateway Control session.
NOTE 1: When the Gateway Control Session is not used, certain functions such
as location information report, APN-AMBR update and dedicated bearer
establishment are impacted.
NOTE 2: The decision to not establish the Gateway Control session applies for
the life time of the IP-CAN session.
NOTE 3: The indicator to not establish the Gateway Control session is
configured in the HSS. It is delivered to the BBERF within the Charging
Characteristics. The indicator is operator specific, therefore it can only be
used in non-roaming cases.
At gateway control session establishment as described in clause 4a.5.1, the
information about the radio access technology shall be provided. The BBERF
includes also the BSID if available. If information about the support of
network-initiated QoS procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support AVP
shall be provided.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the IP-CAN-Type AVP set to the value \"Non-3GPP-EPS\",
the RAT-Type AVP set to the value \"EHRPD\" from a new BBERF and at least one
Gateway Control Session for the same user identity and PDN ID exists, and if
the UE has acquired an IPv6 prefix via the 3GPP access, the PCRF shall provide
the IPv6 prefix of the UE to the BBERF by including the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP
in the CCA command.
NOTE 4 In order to allow the PCRF to link the new Gateway Control session to a
Gx session based on the information received in the CCR command, it is assumed
that there is only a single IP-CAN session per PDN ID and user identity.
When UE requests the establishment or modification of resources, the BBERF
shall map the requested QoS information to the QoS-Information AVP following
the guideline described in clause D.2.4.
### D.2.2.2 Provisioning of QoS rules
#### D.2.2.2.1 QoS rule request for services not known to PCRF
When the PCRF receives a request for QoS rules while no suitable authorized
PCC/QoS rules are configured in the PCRF, and if the user is not allowed to
access AF session based services but is allowed to request resources for
services not known to the PCRF, to the procedures specified in clause 4.5.2.0
apply. In addition, the PCRF may downgrade the bitrate parameters and the QCI
according to operator policies when authorizing the request.
### D.2.2.3 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
#### D.2.2.3.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS
When receiving a CCR with a QoS-Information AVP, the PCRF shall decide upon
the requested QoS information within the CCR command.
\- The PCRF may compare the authorized QoS derived according to clause 6.3 of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8] with the requested QoS for the service data flow. If the
requested QoS is less than the authorised QoS, the PCRF may either request to
upgrade the IP CAN QoS by supplying that authorised QoS in the QoS-Information
AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP to the BBERF (e.g. if the PCRF has
exact knowledge of the required QoS for the corresponding service), or the
PCRF may only authorise the requested QoS by supplying the requested QoS in
the QoS-Information AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP to the BBERF (e.g.
if the PCRF only derives upper limits for the authorized QoS for the
corresponding service data flow). If the requested QoS is higher than the
authorised QoS, the PCRF shall downgrade the IP CAN QoS by supplying the
authorised QoS in the QoS-Information AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP
to the BBERF.
The PCRF may decide to modify the authorized QoS at any time. The PCRF shall
send an unsolicited authorization to the BBERF as described in 4a.5.2. If the
trigger to modify the authorized QoS comes from the AF, before starting an
unsolicited provisioning, the PCRF may start a timer to wait for a UE
requested corresponding QoS modification. At the expiry of the timer, if no
QoS rule request has previously been received by the PCRF, the PCRF should go
on with the unsolicited authorization as explained above.
#### D.2.2.3.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS
The procedures as described in 4a.5.10 apply with the following additions.
Upon reception of an authorized QoS within a CCA or RAR command, the BBERF
shall perform the mapping from that \"Authorised QoS\" information into
authorised access specific QoS information according to guidelines described
in clause D.2.4.
When the BBERF receives an unsolicited authorisation decision from the PCRF
(i.e. a decision within a RAR) with updated QoS information, the BBERF shall
update the stored authorised QoS. If the existing QoS of the IP-CAN bearer
does not match the updated authorised QoS the BBERF shall perform a network
initiated QoS modification to adjust the QoS to the authorised level.
## D.2.3 Bearer Control Mode selection
Bearer Control Mode selection shall take place via Gxa reference point to the
HSGW.
The HSGW shall only include the Network-Request-Support AVP if it supports
this the network-initiated bearer setup procedure and the UE has previously
indicated to the HSGW that the UE also support it.
The PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. The PCRF selects the same Bearer Control Mode
for all PDN connections from a UE to the same APN. The selected Bearer-
Control-Mode AVP shall be provided to the HSGW using the QoS rule provision
procedures at Gateway control session establishment.
The BCM selection procedure may also be triggered as a consequence of a change
of HSGW.
The values defined in 5.3.23 for the Bearer-Control-Mode AVP apply with the
following meaning:
UE_ONLY (0)
This value is used to indicate that the UE shall request any additional
resource establishment.
RESERVED (1)
This value is not used in this Release.
UE_NW (2)
This value is used to indicate that both the UE and the BBERF may request any
additional bearer establishment and add additional traffic mapping information
to an existing bearer.
## D.2.4 QoS Mapping
### D.2.4.1 QCI to eHRPD QoS parameter mapping
The mapping of QCI to eHRPD QoS parameters follows the guidelines described
3GPP2 X.S0057 [24].
# D.3 EPC-based Trusted WLAN Access with S2a
For EPC-based trusted WLAN Access with S2a, the PCEF is located in the P-GW
and the BBERF does not apply.
NOTE: Gxa interface is not used for S2a-PMIP in Trusted WLAN within this
release of the specification.
The PCEF provides the PCRF with the access network information as described in
clause 4.5.1, with the exception of the user location information that, if
available, is included in the TWAN-Identifier AVP. RAT-Type AVP set to
\"WLAN\" and AN-Trusted AVP set to \"Trusted\" shall be provided. If the
NetLoc-Trusted-WLAN is supported, the procedure described in clause 4.5.22
shall apply with the exception of the user location information that, if
available, is included in the TWAN-Identifier AVP.
PLMN_CHANGE, IP-CAN_CHANGE and RAT_CHANGE event triggers as defined in clause
5.3.7 apply in this access. When reporting IP-CAN_CHANGE and RAT_CHANGE event
triggers, the PCEF shall, in addition to the IP-CAN-Type AVP and/or RAT-Type
AVP, provide the AN-Trusted AVP set to \"Trusted\".
# D.4 EPC-based Untrusted WLAN Access
For EPC-based untrusted WLAN Access the BBERF does not apply.
For an IP-CAN session set-up over an untrusted WLAN access over S2b the
following applies:
At IP-CAN Session Establishment the PCEF provides the PCRF with the IP-CAN-
Type AVP indicating Non-3GPP-EPS, the RAT-Type AVP indicating the access
technology type as provided by the access network, the ePDG address used as
IPSec tunnel endpoint with the UE within the AN-GW-Address AVP, the serving
network identifier in 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP and the AN-Trusted AVP set to
\"Untrusted\". If the following information is available as appropriate, the
PCEF also provides the PCRF with location information within the TWAN-
Identifier AVP, a location timestamp in the User-Location-Info-Time AVP and
the UE local IP address within the UE-Local-IP-Address AVP and the UDP source
port number within the UDP-Source-Port AVP or the TCP source port number
within the TCP-Source-Port AVP as received from the access network.
If the NetLoc-Untrusted-WLAN feature is supported, reporting access network
information procedure described in subclause 4.5.22 shall apply with the
exception that the PCEF provides the PCRF with location information within the
TWAN-Identifier AVP, a location timestamp in the User-Location-Info-Time AVP
and the UE local IP address within the UE-Local-IP-Address AVP and the UDP
source port number within the UDP-Source-Port AVP or the TCP source port
number within the TCP-Source-Port AVP as received from the access network.
PLMN_CHANGE, IP-CAN_CHANGE and RAT_CHANGE event triggers as defined in clause
5.3.7 apply in this access. When reporting IP-CAN_CHANGE and RAT_CHANGE event
triggers, the PCEF shall, in addition to the IP-CAN-Type AVP and/or RAT-Type
AVP, provide the AN-Trusted AVP set to \"Untrusted\". As described for the
case of an IPâ€‘CAN Session Establishment, the PCEF provides also the PCRF with
location information it may have received from the ePDG and the ePDG IP
address used as IPSec tunnel endpoint with the UE.
NOTE: The PCEF reports IP-CAN_CHANGE and RAT_CHANGE event triggers to the PCRF
when a Create Session Request is received including information that the UE
moved to an untrusted WLAN access.

# E.3 Reference points and Reference model
## E.3.0 General
For Fixed Broadband Access network interworking, the applied scenarios of case
1, case 2a and case 2b are defined in clause E.4.1 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## E.3.1 Gx Reference Point
In addition to the specification of the Gx reference point defined in clause
4, this reference point is also used to transport, for case 1:
\- The UE local IP address, the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel if the
NA(P)T is detected and ePDG IP address when GTP-based S2b is used in the WLAN
scenario.
\- The UE local IP address, the UDP source port number of DSMIPv6 binding
update signalling (user plane traffic is not encapsulated by Ipsec), UDP
source port number of IPSec tunnel (user plane traffic is encapsulated by
Ipsec) if the NA(P)T is detected and P-GW IP address when trusted S2c is used
in the WLAN scenario.
\- The H(e)NB local IP address and the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel
if the NA(P)T is detected for GTP-based S5/S8 is used in the H(e)NB scenario.
## E.3.2 Gxx Reference Point
This reference point is defined between the PCRF and the BBERF which is
located at the ePDG or S-GW for PMIP-based S5/S8. It is used to transport:
\- The UE local IP address, the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel if the
NA(P)T is detected, and ePDG IP address when PMIP based S2b (case 2b) or
untrusted S2c (case 2a) is used in the WLAN scenario (BBERF located at the
ePDG).
\- The H(e)NB local IP address and the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel
if the NA(P)T is detected for PMIP based S5/S8 (case 2b) in the H(e)NB
scenario (BBERF located at the S-GW).
When the BBERF is located at the ePDG, no QoS Rules should be sent over the
Gxx reference point.
## E.3.3 S15 Reference Point
The S15 reference point is located between the HNB GW and the PCRF and between
the HNB GW and the V-PCRF. It enables provisioning and removal of dynamic QoS
rules from the (V-) PCRF to the BPCF for the purpose of allocation and release
of QoS resources in the Fixed Broadband Access Network for HNB CS calls.
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the S15 interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the S15 interface.
Refer to Annex K of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] for Diameter load control procedures
over the S15 interface.
## E.3.3a Sd Reference Point
This reference point is an intra-operator interface between the TDF and the
(V-)PCRF for the NSWO traffic. Scenarios where NSWO traffic is routed via the
TDF are therefore limited to the case where the Fixed Broadband Access Network
and the PLMN are owned by the same operator.

The HNB GW shall initiate RAB modification or RAB release procedure to release
the corresponding resource allocated in the 3GPP network as defined in 3GPP TS
23.060 [17].
### E.5.3.3 S15 Session Termination
The HNB GW initiates the S15 session termination with the PCRF if the HNB GW
initiates deregistration for the HNB or receives the deregistration request
from the HNB.
The HNB GW shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\".
If the HNB GW needs to send an S15 Session termination request towards a PCRF
which is known to have restarted since the S15 Session establishment, the HNB
GW should not send CC-Request to inform the PCRF.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the HNB GW.
## E.5.4 ADC procedures over Sd reference point for solicited application
reporting
### E.5.4.1 TDF session establishment
If PCRF decides, based on subscriber\'s profile configuration, that the TDF
session should be established with the TDF per corresponding IP-CAN session,
during the IP-CAN session establishment or at any point of time when the PCRF
decides that the session with TDF is to be established (e.g. subscriber
profile changes), the PCRF shall indicate via the Sd reference point, the ADC
rules to be applied at the TDF. The TDF-Information AVP shall be either
received over S9a within initial CC-Request received from BPCF or pre-
provisioned at PCRF.
NOTE: In case the TDF-Information is pre-provisioned in the PCRF and also the
value is received in CC-Request from the BPCF, the value received in CC-
Request takes precedence over the pre-provisioned value.
When establishing the session with the TDF, the PCRF shall send a TS-Request
with the PDN information (NSWO-APN), if available, within the Called-Station-
Id AVP, the UE Local IP address within the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or the
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP.
## E.5.5 ADC procedures over Sd reference point for unsolicited application
reporting
### E.5.5.1 General
For provisioning of ADC Rules and Application Detection Information reporting
the procedures described in clauses 4b.5a.1 and 4b.5a.2 apply respectively.
For the request of TDF Session Termination, the procedure described in clause
4b.5a.3 applies, with the exemption that the release of Ipv4 address in a dual
stack scenario is notified with the S9a* Session Termination for that Ipv4
address.
### E.5.5.2 TDF session to S9a* session linking
When the PCRF receives the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" over Sd reference point, the PCRF links the TDF
session to an S9a* session, if the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address of the TDF
session matches the UE local IP address of the S9a* session. The PDN
information (i.e NSWO-APN) if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP may also
be used for this session linking.
When the PCRF checks if APNs within Called-Station-Id AVPs match each other,
the PCRF shall apply the APN matching procedures in Annex H of 3GPP TS 29.213
[8].
The TDF should handle each Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix, assuming the max
prefix length used in the access network, within a separate TDF session.
NOTE 1: In a dual-stack scenario where a 3GPP UE in the Broadband Fixed Access
Network is allocated an Ipv6 address/prefix and an Ipv4 address, this would
result in two S9a* sessions. The PCRF would link the Ipv4 address related TDF
session and Ipv6 address related TDF session for the same UE to the different
S9a* sessions.
NOTE 2: In the scenario where the TDF performs initial Application Detection
on multiple simultaneous traffic flows for the same Ipv6 prefix (i.e. two or
more traffic flows from Ipv6 addresses of the same IP-CAN session) the TDF
could not be aware that those flows belong to the same IP-CAN session until a
response is received from the PCRF, containing the Ipv6 prefix. This leads to
using separate TDF sessions for the Ipv6 addresses for the same IP-CAN
session. The TDF reports new application detection information related to that
Ipv6 prefix via any of the TDF sessions at a later stage.
# E.6 S15 Protocol
## E.6.1 Protocol support
The S15 application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application,
where the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the S15 Application in the
present release is 16777318. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) need to be configured appropriately to
identify the 3GPP S15 application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order
to create suitable routeing tables.
The S15 application identification shall be included in the Auth-Application-
Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the S15 interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, the HNB GW acts as the Diameter client.
## E.6.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and HNB
GW pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance
of connections between Diameter nodes is described in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the HNB GW shall
advertise the support of the S15 specific Application by including the value
of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of
the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id
AVP contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter base protocol (IETF RFC 6733
[61]).
The termination of the Diameter user session on S15 can be initiated by the
HNB GW, as specified in clause E.5.3.3.
## E.6.3 S15 specific AVPs
### E.6.3.1 General
Table E.6.3.1.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the S15 reference
point, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the
AVP may be encrypted, what access types (e.g. 3GPP-EPS, etc.) the AVP is
applicable to, the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy
control or both, and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The
Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to
3GPP (10415).

## E.6.4 S15 re- used AVPs
### E.6.4.1 General
Table E.6.4.1.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the S15 reference point
from Gx reference point and other existing Diameter Applications, reference to
their respective specifications, short description of their usage within the
S15 reference point and the applicability of the AVPs to a specific access.
When reused from Gx reference point, the specific clause in the present
specification is referred. Other AVPs from existing Diameter Applications,
except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol, do not need to be supported.
The AVPs from Diameter base protocol are not included in table E.6.4.1.1, but
they are re-used for the S15 reference point. Unless otherwise stated, re-used
AVPs shall maintain their \'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag settings. Where RADIUS
VSAs are re-used, unless otherwise stated, they shall be translated to
Diameter AVPs as described in IETF RFC 4005 [12] with the exception that the
\'M\' flag shall be set and the \'P\' flag may be set.

### E.6.4.2 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the S15 reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the S15 reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the S15 reference point is the 3GPP Rel-11 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the S15 commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the S15 reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the S15 reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial CCR/CCA command pair:
\- If the HNB GW supports post-Rel-11 S15 functionality, the CCR shall include
the features supported by the HNB GW within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the
\'M\' bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-11 S15 functionality, the CCA command shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both HNB GW and PCRF shall behave as
specified in the Rel-11 version of this document.
Once the HNB GW and PCRF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
## E.6.5 S15 specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### E.6.5.1 General
IETF RFC 6733 [61] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID
AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP
Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value
representing the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).
### E.6.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 6733
[61], shall be applied.
### E.6.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 6733
[61], are applicable.
### E.6.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 6733
[61], are applicable.
## E.6.6 S15 Messages
### E.6.6.1 S15 Application
S15 Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in
clause E.6.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 6733
[61], and the Diameter Credit Control Application, IETF RFC 4006 [9], are used
with the S15 specific AVPs specified in clause E.6.3. The Diameter Credit
Control Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are
re-used are defined in clause E.6.4. The S15 application identifier shall be
included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP. A diameter session needs to be
established for each S15 session.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application, IETF RFC 4006 [9],
or Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 6733 [61].
### E.6.6.2 CC-Request (CCR) Command
The CCR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by the HNB GW to the PCRF in order
to initiate an S15 session establishment or request resource for the CS
service. The CCR command is also sent by the HNB GW to the PCRF in order to
indicate the termination of the S15 session.

###### ## Annex F (informative): Disabling/re-enabling Usage Monitoring for a
PCC/ADC rule
If usage monitoring for a PCC/ADC rule (belonging to a usage monitoring group)
needs to be disabled, one of the two ways below can be chosen to realize this
feature:
\- The PCRF generates a new PCC/ADC rule with the same information (apart from
the PCC/ADC Rule identifier within the Charging-Rule-Name AVP/ADC-Rule-Name
AVP) as the existing PCC/ADC rule used to control the same traffic but without
the monitoring key. The PCRF provides the new PCC/ADC rule with the Charging-
Rule-Install AVP/ADC-Rule-Install AVP to the PCEF/TDF and removes the existing
PCC/ADC rule with the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP/ ADC-Rule-Remove AVP in one CCA
or RAR command.
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the activation of the new PCC/ADC rule takes place
at the same time as the removal of the existing PCC/ADC rule and that no other
actions are triggered (e.g. with respect to charging and bearer management)
beside the ones related to the disabling of usage monitoring.
\- The operator selects a specific monitoring key value to be used for all
PCC/ADC rules for which usage monitoring is disabled. The PCRF modifies the
monitoring key in the corresponding PCC/ADC rules to this specific value with
the Charging-Rule-Install AVP/ADC-Rule-Install AVP. Following the PCRF
instruction, the PCEF or TDF updates the monitoring key in the modified
PCC/ADC rule and collects the usage information for the specific monitoring
key value. The PCEF/TDF usage reports would still be received by the PCRF but
could be ignored.
NOTE 2: The operator should configure the usage threshold to a sufficiently
high value so that frequent usage reports are avoided.
If usage monitoring needs to be re-enabled for a PCC/ADC rule (i.e. usage
monitoring has been disabled for this PCC/ADC rule before), one of the two
ways below can be chosen to realize this feature:
\- The PCRF generates a new PCC/ADC rule with the same information (apart from
the PCC/ADC Rule identifier within the Charging-Rule-Name AVP/ADC-Rule-Name
AVP) as the existing PCC/ADC rule used to control the same traffic and adds
the required monitoring key. The PCRF provides the new PCC/ADC rule with the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP/ADC-Rule-Install AVP to the PCEF/TDF and removes the
existing PCC/ADC rule without monitoring key with the Charging-Rule-Remove
AVP/ ADC-Rule-Remove AVP in one CCA or RAR command. The PCEF/TDF executes the
operations in the same way it is described above in Note 1.
\- The PCRF modifies the monitoring key of the corresponding PCC/ADC rule to
the value of the required usage monitoring group (e.g. back to its original
value) with the Charging-Rule-Install AVP/ADC-Rule-Install AVP.
###### ## Annex G (normative): Access specific aspects, Fixed Broadband Access
network convergence
# G.1 Scope
This annex defines the enhancement to Gx/Sd reference point for supporting
policy and charging control in the fixed broadband access network in the
convergent scenario where a single operator is deploying both the fixed
broadband access network and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC).
The scope of this Annex is to define the convergent scenario where the PCRF
controls directly the network element(s) in the fixed broadband access without
the mediation of a different policy server, such as the Broadband Policy
Control Function (BPCF).
Policy and charging control is provided for both Non-seamless WLAN offload
traffic from a 3GPP UE and the traffic from fixed devices.
# G.2 Definitions and abbreviations
## G.2.1 Definitions
The definitions in the following are relevant for this annex only.
**UE local IP address** is defined as either the public IP address assigned to
the UE by the Broadband Forum domain in the no-NAT case, or the public IP
address assigned by the Broadband Forum domain to the NATed RG.
**IP-CAN session** as defined in clause 3.1 applies with the following
clarifications for fixed broadband access. The term UE corresponds to the
device that accesses the services provided by the network (i.e. either RG, or
3GPP UE or fixed end-device), the PDN identifies the IP network where the
device gets IP connectivity and the UE identity information may be the IMSI,
the user-name or the access line identifier (if available). In a Fixed
Broadband Access an IP-CAN session corresponds to a Subscriber IP Session
defined in Broadband Forum TR-146 [46].
NOTE: The PDN connection concept and APN are not applicable to Subscriber IP
session for fixed device.
## G.2.2 Abbreviations
The following abbreviations are relevant for this annex only:
BBF Broadband Forum
BSSID Basic Service Set Identifier
NAT Network Address Translation
NSWO Non-Seamless WLAN offload
NSWO-APN Non-Seamless WLAN offload APN
RG Residential Gateway
SSID Service Set Identifier
# G.3 Reference points and Reference model
## G.3.1 Reference architecture
### G.3.1.1 General
For Fixed Broadband Access network convergence, the reference architecture in
Figure G.3.1.2.1 and Figure G.3.1.3.1 applies with the following conditions:
\- PCEF resides in the IP Edge in the Fixed Broadband Access network.
NOTE 1: Either SPR or UDR is used in this architecture.
NOTE 2: Gxx reference point is not used.
### G.3.1.2 Reference architecture
Figure G.3.1.2.1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access
network convergence when SPR is used
Figure G.3.1.2.2: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access
network convergence when UDR is used
## G.3.2 Gx Reference Point
This reference point corresponds to the Gx which resides between the PCEF in
the IP Edge and the PCRF. The Gx reference point provides the same
functionality as the Gx described in clause 4 with the following exceptions:
\- No provisioning of IP flow mobility routing information from the PCEF in
the IP Edge to the PCRF is performed.
\- Negotiation of Bearer Control Mode (UE-only or UE/NW) does not apply.
In addition, for the purpose of convergence between 3GPP access and Fixed
Broadband Access Network, the Gx reference point enables the transfer of PCC
rules for an IP-CAN session that exists in the PCEF for a fixed device or for
a 3GPP UE.
## G.3.3 Sd Reference Point
The Sd reference point as described in clause 4b applies with the exception
that the TDF does not request any notifications of specific events from the
PCRF.
# G.4 Functional Elements
## G.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF functionality defined in clause 4.4.1 and clause 4b.4.1 shall apply,
with the following exceptions:
\- No negotiation of IP-CAN bearer control mode applies.
\- Subscriptions to changes of IP-CAN type, RAT type or Access Network
Information do not apply.
\- Usage Monitoring Control as defined in clause 4.5.2.5, 4.5.16, 4.5.17 for
Gx reference point and 4b.5.1.5, 4b.5.6, 4b.5.7 for Sd reference point applies
with the following exceptions:
\- In the routed RG with NAT mode, the IP-CAN session is per RG in the PCEF/IP
Edge, the PCRF retrieves the usage monitoring related information from the SPR
using the subscriber identifier within Subscription-ID AVP provided over Gx.
The PCRF decides how to allocate a usage threshold to each existing IP-CAN
session and/or monitoring key.
\- In the bridge RG mode and in routed RG mode without NAT there may be a
separate fixed subscriber session (i.e. IP-CAN session) for the each device
behind the RG. The PCRF retrieves usage monitoring related information from
the SPR using the subscriber identifier within Subscription-ID AVP and the
NSWO APN information within the Called-Station-Id AVP if available provided
over Gx. The PCRF decides how to allocate a usage threshold to each existing
IP-CAN session and/or monitoring key.
## G.4.2 PCEF(IP Edge)
The PCEF is located in the IP Edge as defined in TR-300 [47]. The PCEF
performs those functions specified in clause 4.4.2 with the following Fixed
Broadband specific functions:
The PCEF converts QoS parameters sent from the PCRF to Fixed Broadband Access
to specific QoS attributes and determines the QoS parameters sent to the PCRF
from a set of Fixed Broadband Access specific QoS attributes.
The support of Application Detection functionality is considered as a network
operator\'s choice in Fixed Broadband Access. In addition, the UE and/or
Network initiated bearer procedures and enforcement of authorized QoS for an
IP-CAN bearer does not apply for Fixed Broadband Access.
## G.4.3 TDF
The TDF functionality defined in clause 4b.4.2 shall apply. For supporting
Fixed Broadband Access network convergence, the TDF does not request any
notifications of specific events from the PCRF as described in clause 4b.5.8.
# G.5 PCC procedures
## G.5.1 Concept Adaptations for Fixed Broadband Access Network Convergence
### G.5.1.1 General
The PCC procedures specified in clause 4.5 for Gx and in clause 4b.5 for Sd
apply with the following concept adaptation for Fixed Broadband Access network
convergence.
### G.5.1.2 IP-CAN session
Fixed Broadband Access IP-CAN is a fixed access broadband network that
provides IP connectivity to a 3GPP UE or fixed devices. The Fixed Broadband
Access IP-CAN reuses the definition of an IP-CAN session in clause 3.1 with
the following addition.
For routed mode RG with NAT, one IP-CAN session shall be established for each
corresponding Subscriber IP session on the IP Edge for the Ipv4 address and/or
Ipv6 address or Ipv6 prefix assigned to the RG.
In case of routed mode RG when the PPP pass-through feature is enabled (see
requirement R-10 in Broadband Forum TRâ€‘124 Issue 3 [45]) an IP-CAN session
shall be established for the each single fixed device starting the PPP
session. In this case the 3GPP UE does not have Subscriber IP session in IP
Edge.
For bridged mode RG, one IP-CAN session shall be established for each
corresponding Subscriber IP session on the IP Edge for each Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 address or Ipv6 prefix assigned to the fixed device or 3GPP UE
which established a Subscriber IP session in Fixed Broadband Access network.
For routed mode RG with Ipv6 when stateless Ipv6 address autoconfiguration is
used by the end-device behind the RG, one IP-CAN session shall be established
for each corresponding Subscriber IP session on the IP Edge for the Ipv6
prefix assigned to the RG. When stateful Ipv6 address configuration is used by
the end-devices, one IP-CAN session may be established for each end-device.
For routed mode RG, the successful completion of 3GPP-based access
authentication and assignment of IP address to the 3GPP UE shall not result in
any IP-CAN session establishment if the IP address assignment does not result
in a new Subscriber IP Session in the IP Edge. In this case the pre-existent
IP-CAN session for the RG is used.
A device connected to the RG (e.g. VoIP phones) may also initiate a Subscriber
IP session when the RG is configured in bridge mode or when the PPP pass-
through feature is enabled on the Routing RG (see requirement R-10 in
Broadband Forum TRâ€‘124 Issue 3 [45]).
### G.5.1.3 IP-CAN bearer
The Fixed Broadband Access network does not support the concept of a bearer
and multiple bearers as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [32]. However, DSCP marking
provides QoS support on transport network layer so that QoS and charging
policies can be applied per SDF.
### G.5.1.4 PCC rule
The definition of PCC rules and PCC rule operations in clause 4.3 are
applicable except:
\- PS to CS session continuity
\- User Location Report
NOTE: The procedure for provisioning predefined PCC rules at the IP Edge is
out of 3GPP scope.
### G.5.1.5 ADC rule
For convergent application detection and control and TDF based charging, the
definition of ADC rules in clause 4b.3 are applicable.
### G.5.1.6 Subscriber Identifier
In the convergence scenario the Subscriber Identifier represents the
identifier of the user.
For the 3GPP UE the Subscriber Identifier is received in the Subscription-Id
AVP and includes the IMSI.
The Subscriber Identifier used by fixed device or the RG at establishment of
Subscriber IP session in fixed broadband access network can be the Access Line
Identifier (Physical-Access-ID AVP and Logical-Access-ID AVP) or the username
received in Subscription-Id AVP, for example when the Subscriber IP session is
a PPP Session.
NOTE: For the RG and fixed device based on Broadband Forum specification, the
Subscriber Identifier is defined in Broadband Forum TRâ€‘134 [44].
### G.5.1.7 Default QoS control
The BBF AAA may provide a default Access Profile QoS for the IP-CAN session
that may contain QoS information.
The PCRF may provide the default QoS for the IP-CAN session to the PCEF over
Gx. The IP Edge/PCEF shall enforce the default QoS provisioned over Gx.
NOTE: The IP Edge/PCEF does not enforce the default Access Profile QoS
provided by the Broadband Fixed Access Network if PCRF is deployed.
The default QoS is included in the Default-QoS-Information AVP provided at
command level as defined in clause 5.3.103.
The IP Edge/PCEF shall be able to convert default QoS into Fixed Broadband
Access QoS attribute values. In the IP Edge, the QCI and optionally the
Priority-Level AVP within the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP is used to
determine the DSCP code value or other transport specific information element
and the MBR is used for bandwidth limitation for the DSCP code value. The
PCEF/IP Edge shall enforce first the QoS for the packets that matches a
service data flow template in an installed PCC Rule for which specific QoS
enforcement actions are provided then the IP Edge/PCEF shall enforce the
default QoS for all downlink and uplink traffic for the IP-CAN session.
The IP Edge/PCEF shall be able to convert the Fixed Broadband Access QoS
attributes values into the default QoS included in the Default-QoS-Information
AVP.
## G.5.2 IP-CAN Session Establishment
The IP-CAN session establishment procedure defined in clause 4.5.1 applies.
NOTE 1: In routed mode configuration with NATed RG, the PCEF located in the IP
Edge initiates the IP-CAN session establishment after the RG has been
connected to the network and has been assigned an IPv4 address and/or IPv6
Prefix. In bridge mode, the PCEF located in the IP Edge initiates the IP-CAN
session establishment after it becomes aware of an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6
address/IPv6 prefix has been assigned to the fixed device and/or 3GPP UE by
the fixed broadband access.
NOTE 2: In case of routed mode RG when the PPP pass-through feature is
enabled, an IP-CAN session is established for the each single fixed device
starting the PPP session. In this case the 3GPP UE does not have Subscriber IP
session in IP Edge.
NOTE 3: For routed mode RG, the successful completion of 3GPP-based access
authentication and assignment of IP address to the 3GPP UE would not result in
any IP-CAN session establishment if the IP address assignment does not result
in a new Subscriber IP Session in the IP Edge. In this case the pre-existent
IP-CAN session for the RG is used.
NOTE 4: How to assign the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address/IPv6 Prefix to a RG
or fixed device is out of the scope of 3GPP.
The PCEF located in the IP Edge shall send a CC-Request command to the PCRF
with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the CC-
Request command shall include the type of IP-CAN within the IP-CAN-Type AVP
set to the value \"FBA\", the NSWO-APN information within the Called-Station-
Id if available, the PLMN id within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP if available,
the location information within the Fixed-User-Location-Info AVP if available
and the Default QoS within the Default-QoS-Information AVP if available.
NOTE 5: How the location information becomes available to the PCEF/IP Edge is
out of the scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 6: Operator policies in the PCEF indicate if dynamic policy control is
provided. In addition, the NSWO-APN is also configured for subscribers on a
PLMN basis.
In route mode configuration with NATed RG, the CC-Request command shall
include the Access Line Identifier of the RG within the Physical-Access-ID AVP
and the Logical-Access-ID AVP and the RG Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-
Address AVP and/or the RG Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP.
In bridge mode, the CCR command may include the Subscription-Id AVP with the
identity of the device (e.g. IMSI for the 3GPP UE, username for a fixed
device) and the Access Line Identifier within the Physical-Access-ID AVP and
the Logical-Access-ID AVP and the Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address
AVP and/or the Ipv6 address/prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall respond to this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the PCEF located in the IP Edge. The CC-Answer command
shall include the Default QoS within the Defaultâ€‘QoSâ€‘Information AVP, the
applicable PCC Rules within the Chargingâ€‘Ruleâ€‘Install AVP and the applicable
event triggers within the Event-Trigger AVP. The PCEF located in the IP Edge
maps the Default QoS received in the QoS-Information AVP into the Default
Access Profile required in the Fixed Broadband Access network.
NOTE 7: The Default-Access-Profile is defined by Broandband Forum and out of
the 3GPP scope.
NOTE 8: How the mapping between the Default-Access-Profile to Default-QoS is
performed is out of 3GPP scope.
NOTE 9: Whether the Default QoS within the Default-QoS-Information AVP
provided by the PCRF corresponds to a dynamic QoS or a default QoS name is
subject to operator policies.
## G.5.3 IP-CAN Session Termination
IP-CAN session termination can be initiated by the PCEF(IP Edge) and PCRF.
PCEF (IP Edge) initiated IP-CAN session termination is in accordance with the
clause 4.5.7 with the following exceptions:
The IP-CAN session termination is triggered by PCEF when Subscriber IP session
is terminated. The trigger to terminate the Subscriber IP session is Broadband
Forum specific (e.g. RG switch off, loss of transmission, IP address lease
expiration PPPoE session termination, etc) and out of the scope of 3GPP.
In routed mode configuration with NAT this procedure is applicable only when
IP session from RG is terminated, e.g. when RG switches off or when public IP
address assigned to the RG is released, etc. (The termination of connection
from a device in LAN, e.g. when device releases the local IP address or it
disconnects from WLAN does not trigger the IP-CAN session termination for IP
session from RG.)
PCRF initiated IP-CAN session termination is in accordance with the clause
4.5.9. The term UE in the value of Session-Release-Cause AVP corresponds to
the device that accesses the services provided by the network (i.e. either RG,
or 3GPP UE or fixed end-device).
## G.5.4 IP-CAN Session Modification
### G.5.4.1 PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
This clause is related to IP-CAN session modification initiated by PCEF(IP
Edge) for IP session. This procedure is in accordance with clause F.4.4.1 of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
The PCEF(IP Edge) may initiate an IP-CAN Session Modification by sending a CCR
command when an event is met according to clause 4.5.1. The PCRF may provide
in the CCA command PCC Rules according to clause 4.5.2.0 and Event Triggers
according to clause 4.5.3. The PCRF may also provide the Default QoS within
the Defaultâ€‘QoSâ€‘Information AVP. For solicited application reporting with a
TDF, the PCRF may provide ADC Rules to the TDF as described in clause 4b.5.1
and Event Triggers according to clause 4b.5.3.
NOTE 1: Whether the Default QoS within the Default-QoS-Information AVP
provided by the PCRF corresponds to a dynamic QoS or a default QoS name is
subject to operator policies
The PCEF(IP Edge) may initiate an IP-CAN Session Modification by sending a CCR
command in order to indicate a PCC Rule failure (e.g. release of resources) to
the PCRF.
The CCR shall include the Charging-Rule-Report AVP indicating the PCC rules
that were not accepted and the Rule-Failure-Code AVP indicating the failure
cause at command level.
The PCRF shall include the result of the procedure in the CCA command.
### G.5.4.2 PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
This procedure is in accordance with clause F.4.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
The PCRF may include in the RAR command the applicable PCC Rules according to
clause 4.5.2.0 and Event-Triggers according to clause 4.5.3. The PCRF may also
provide the Default QoS within the Default-QoS-Information AVP. For solicited
application reporting with a TDF, the PCRF may provide ADC Rules to the TDF
according to clause 4b.5.1 and Event Triggers according to clause 4b.5.3.
NOTE 1: Whether the Default QoS within the Default-QoS-Information AVP
provided by the PCRF corresponds to a dynamic QoS or a default QoS name is
subject to operator policies.
The PCEF(IP Edge) shall include the result of the procedure in the RAA
command.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Policy Control for Remote UEs behind a ProSe
UE-to-network relay UE
With the Proximity-based services, as described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [56] a UE
acting as a remote UE can connect to a PDN via a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE,
using an IP-CAN session that the ProSe UE-to-network relay UE has established.
In this Release of the specification, the following functionalities are
required to enable support for policy control for remote UEs:
\- The PDN GW and PCRF are configured with a dedicated APN for ProSe UE-to-
network relay connectivity.
\- The remote UE is assigned a 64-bit IPv6 Prefix from a shorter IPv6 prefix
by the ProSe UE-to-network relay UE.
\- ExtendedFilter feature as described in subclause 5.4.1 is supported for the
IP-CAN session so that services can be authorized separately for each remote
UE.
NOTE: The non support of any of these conditions will mean that policy control
for the remote UE in the established PDN connection will not be supported.
