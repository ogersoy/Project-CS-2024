# 4 Background Data Transfer Policy Control Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The BDT Policy Control Service, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS
23.503 [4], is provided by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
This service enables the NF service consumer to negotiate policy for a future
background data transfer and offers the following functionalities:
\- get background data transfer policies based on the request from the NEF;
and
\- update background data transfer policies based on the selection provided by
the NEF.
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Policy and
Charging related 5G architecture is also described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [5].
The BDT Policy Control Service (Npcf_BDTPolicyControl) is part of the Npcf
service-based interface exhibited by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
The only known NF service consumer of the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl service is the
Network Exposure Function (NEF).
The NEF accesses the BDT Policy Control Service at the PCF via the N30
Reference point. In the roaming scenario, the N30 reference point is located
between the PCF and the NEF in the home network only.

* * *
### 4.2.2 Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create service operation
#### 4.2.2.1 General
The Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create service operation is used by an NF service
consumer to retrieve BDT policies from the PCF.
The following procedure using the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create service
operation is supported:
\- retrieval of BDT policies.
#### 4.2.2.2 Retrieval of BDT policies
This procedure is used by the NEF to request BDT policies from the PCF, as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [4].
Figure 4.2.2.2-1 illustrates a retrieval of BDT policies.
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Retrieval of BDT policies
Upon reception of a Background Data Transfer request from the AF indicating a
transfer policy request, the NEF shall invoke the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create
service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the URI representing a
\"BDT policies\" collection resource of the PCF (as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1,
step 1). The NEF shall include a \"BdtReqData\" data type in a payload body of
the HTTP POST request. The \"BdtReqData\" data type shall contain:
\- an ASP identifier in the \"aspId\" attribute;
\- a volume of data per UE in the \"volPerUe\" attribute;
\- an expected number of UEs in the \"numOfUes\" attribute; and
\- a desired time window in the \"desTimeInt\" attribute,
and may include a network area information (e.g. list of TAIs and/or NG-RAN
nodes and/or cells identifiers) in the \"nwAreaInfo\" attribute.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the PCF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
Otherwise, upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the NEF indicating
a BDT policies request, the PCF:
\- may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation, as described in
3GPP TS 29.504 [11] and 3GPP TS 29.519 [12], to request from the UDR all
stored transfer policies;
NOTE 1: In case only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can
be locally stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not required.
\- shall determine one or more acceptable transfer policies based on:
a) information provided by the NEF; and
b) other available information (e.g. the existing transfer policies, network
policy, load status estimation for the desired time window); and
\- shall create a BDT Reference ID.
The PCF shall send to the NEF a \"201 Created\" response to the HTTP POST
request, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall include in the
\"201 Created\" response:
\- a Location header field; and
\- a \"BdtPolicy\" data type in the payload body containing the BDT Reference
ID in the \"bdtRefId\" attribute and acceptable transfer policy/ies in the
\"transfPolicies\" attribute.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created individual BDT
policy resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
bdtpolicycontrol/v1/bdtpolicies/{bdtPolicyId}\".
For each included transfer policy, the PCF shall provide:
\- a transfer policy ID in the \"transPolicyId\" attribute;
\- a recommended time window in the \"recTimeInt\" attribute; and
\- a reference to charging rate for the recommended time window in the
\"ratingGroup\" attribute,
and may provide a maximum aggregated bitrate for the uplink direction in the
\"maxBitRateUl\" attribute and/or a maximum aggregated bitrate for the
downlink direction in the \"maxBitRateDl\" attribute.
If the PCF included in the \"BdtPolicy\" data type:
\- more than one transfer policy, the PCF shall wait for the transfer policy
selected by the NEF as described in subclause 4.2.3; or
\- only one transfer policy, the PCF may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Update
service operation, as described in 3GPP TS 29.504 [11] and 3GPP TS 29.519
[12], to update the UDR with the selected transfer policy, the corresponding
BDT Reference ID, the volume of data per UE, the expected number of UEs and if
available a network area information for the provided ASP identifier.
NOTE 2: In case only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can
be locally stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not required.
### 4.2.3 Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service operation is used by an NF service
consumer to update a BDT policy to the PCF.
The following procedure using the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service
operation is supported:
\- indication about selected transfer policy.
#### 4.2.3.2 Indication about selected transfer policy
When the feature \"PatchCorrection\" is supported, this procedure is used by
the NEF to inform the PCF about selected transfer policy, as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [4].
Figure 4.2.3.2-1 illustrates an indication about selected transfer policy.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Indication about selected transfer policy
Upon reception of a Background Data Transfer request from the AF indicating
transfer policy selection, the NEF shall invoke the
Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service operation by sending an HTTP PATCH
request to the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 1. The NEF shall set
the request URI to \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
bdtpolicycontrol/v1/bdtpolicies/{bdtPolicyId}\".
The NEF shall include a \"PatchBdtPolicy\" data type in a payload body of the
HTTP PATCH request. The \"PatchBdtPolicy\" data type shall contain a
\"bdtPolData\" attribute which shall encode a transfer policy ID of the
selected transfer policy in the \"selTransPolicyId\" attribute.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PATCH request due to
the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP PATCH request, the PCF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
Otherwise, upon the reception of the HTTP PATCH request from the NEF
indicating a selected transfer policy, the PCF:
\- may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation, as described
in 3GPP TS 29.504 [11] and 3GPP TS 29.519 [12], to update the UDR with the
selected transfer policy, the corresponding BDT Reference ID, the volume of
data per UE, the expected number of UEs and if available a network area
information for the provided ASP identifier;
NOTE: In case only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can
be locally stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not required.
\- shall send:
a) a \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 2a); or
b) a \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 2b) with a
\"BdtPolicy\" data type in the payload body,
to the HTTP PATCH request to the NEF.

#### 5.6.3.1 Introduction
This subclause defines simple data types and enumerations that can be
referenced from data structures defined in the previous subclauses.

## 5.7 Error handling
### 5.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [6].
For the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and
application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] shall be
supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are
specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall
apply.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API are listed in
table 5.7.3-1. The PCF shall include in the HTTP status code a
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute indicating the
application error as listed in table 5.7.3-1.
Table 5.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description BDT_POLICY_NOT_FOUND 404 Not
Found The HTTP request is rejected because the specified Individual BDT policy
resource does not exist. (NOTE) NOTE: This application error is included in
the responses to the GET and PATCH requests.
* * *
## 5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.8-1 are defined for the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
subclause 6.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
When requesting the PCF to create an Individual BDT policy resource the NF
service consumer shall indicate the optional features the NF service consumer
supports for the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl service by including the \"suppFeat\"
attribute in the \"BdtReqData\" data type of the HTTP POST request.
The PCF shall determine the supported features for the created Individual BDT
policy resource as specified in subclause 6.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6]. The PCF
shall indicate the supported features in the HTTP response confirming the
creation of the Individual BDT policy resource by including the \"suppFeat\"
attribute in the \"BdtPolicyData\" data type.
Table 5.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | Description | +----------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+ | 3 | PatchCorrection | Indicates support of the | | | | correction to the PATCH method. | | | | | | | | When this feature is not | | | | supported, the interoperability | | | | between a NF service consumer | | | | and the PCF can only be ensured | | | | when it is not required the | | | | update of the Individual BDT | | | | policy resource. | +----------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+
## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [18] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API, based on local configuration, may be authorized by
means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [19]), using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [20])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API, shall obtain a \"token\"
from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service,
as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [20], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl service.
The Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API defines a single scope \"npcf-bdtpolicycontrol\"
for OAuth2 authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [18]) for the entire
API, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation
level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [10] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on the public 3GPP file server in the
following locations (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900 [21] for further
information):
\- https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/OpenAPI/\/; and
\- https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/\/\/OpenAPI/.
NOTE 2: To fetch the OpenAPI specification file after CT#83 plenary meeting
for Release 15 in the above links \ must be replaced with the date
the CT Plenary occurs, in the form of year-month (yyyy-mm), e.g. for CT#83
meeting \ must be replaced with value \"2019-03\" and \ must
be replaced with value \"Rel-15\".
