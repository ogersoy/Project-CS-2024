### 5.1.7 Error handling
#### 5.1.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [6].
For the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API, HTTP error responses shall be supported
as specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and
application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] shall be
supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are
specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall
apply.
#### 5.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API.
#### 5.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API are
listed in table 5.1.7.3-1. The NWDAF shall include in the HTTP status code a
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute indicating the
application error as listed in table 5.1.7.3-1.
Table 5.1.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
**Application Error** **HTTP status code** **Description**
SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found Indicates the Individual NWDAF Event
Subscription resource does not exist. (NOTE) NOTE: This application error is
included in the responses to the PUT request (see subclause 4.2.2.2.3) and the
DELETE request (see subclause 4.2.2.3.2).
* * *
### 5.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.1.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API. They shall be negotiated using the
extensibility mechanism defined in subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.1.8-1: Supported Features

**Feature number** **Feature Name** **Description**
* * *
### 5.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[12]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription service.
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-
eventssubscription\" for the entire service, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 5.2 Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo Service API
### 5.2.1 Introduction
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo Service shall use the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API.
The request URI used in each HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards
the NWDAF shall have the structure defined in subclause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS
29.501 [7], i.e.:
> **{apiRoot}/{apiName}/{apiVersion}/{apiSpecificResourceUriPart}**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [7].
\- The {apiName} shall be \"nnwdaf-analyticsinfo\".
\- The {apiVersion} shall be \"v1\".
\- The {apiSpecificResourceUriPart} shall be set as described in subclause
5.2.3.
### 5.2.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 5.2.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [9], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in subclause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[6].
The OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo is contained in Annex A.
#### 5.2.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
See subclause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] for the usage of HTTP standard
headers.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [10], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in subclause 5.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [6]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [15].
#### 5.2.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo Service API shall support HTTP custom header fields
specified in subclause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
In this release of the specification, no specific custom headers are defined
for the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo Service API.

### 5.2.7 Error handling
#### 5.2.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [6].
For the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and
application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] shall be
supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are
specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall
apply.
#### 5.2.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API.
#### 5.2.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API are listed in
table 5.2.7.3-1. The NWDAF shall include in the HTTP status code a
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute indicating the
application error as listed in table 5.2.7.3-1.

### 5.2.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.2.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.2.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
**Feature number** **Feature Name** **Description**
* * *
### 5.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service.
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-analyticsinfo\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription and the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on the public 3GPP file server in the
following locations (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900 [16] for further
information):
\- [https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/OpenAPI/\/]{.underline},
and
