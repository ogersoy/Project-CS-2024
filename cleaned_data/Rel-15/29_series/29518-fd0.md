This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

#### 5.2.2.2 UE Context Operations
##### 5.2.2.2.1 UEContextTransfer
##### 5.2.2.2.1.1 General {#general .H6}
The UEContextTransfer service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- General Registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.2.2.2)
The UEContextTransfer service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a target AMF, towards the AMF (acting as source AMF), when the target AMF
receives a Registration Request with the UE\'s 5G-GUTI included and the
serving AMF has changed since last registration, to retrieve the UE Context,
e.g. the UE\'s SUPI and MM Context, in the source AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the target AMF) shall retrieve the UE Context by
invoking the \"transfer\" custom method on the URI of an \"Individual
ueContext\" resource identified by UE\'s 5G-GUTI, see clause 6.1.3.2.4. See
also Figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1 UE Context Transfer
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall send a HTTP POST request
to invoke \"transfer\" custom method on an \"Individual ueContext\" resource
URI. The payload of the request shall be an object of
\"UeContextTranferReqData\" data type.
If UE Context Transfer is triggered by UE initial registration or mobility
registration, the NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall set the reason
attribute to \"INIT_REG\" or \"MOBI_REG\" and include the integrity protected
registration request message which triggers the UE context transfer in the
payload.
2a. On success:
\- if the reason attribute is \"INIT_REG\" and integrity check is successful,
the (source) AMF shall respond with the status code \"200 OK\". The payload of
the response shall be an object of \"UeContextTransferRspData\" data type,
containing:
case a) the representation of the requested UE Context without PDU Session
Contexts; or
case b) the representation of the requested UE Context only containing the
\"supi\" attribute, if the UE is registered in a different access type in the
(source) AMF and the source AMF determines based on the PLMN ID of the
(target) AMF that there is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface to
the (target) AMF.
\- If the reason attribute is \"MOBI_REG\" and integrity check is successful,
the (source) AMF shall respond with the status code \"200 OK\". The payload of
the response shall be an object of \"UeContextTransferRspData\" data type,
containing the representation of the complete UE Context including available
PDU Session Contexts.
The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters, if
signalling based trace has been activated (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [30]).\ \ The NF
Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, starts tracing according to the received
trace control and configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the
UE context indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once the
NF Service Consumer receives subscription data, trace requirements received
from the UDM supersedes the trace requirements received from the AMF.
The UE context shall contain event subscriptions information in the following
cases:
a) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE specific event; and/or
b) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE group specific events to
which the UE belongs. In this case the event subscriptions provided in the UE
context shall contain the event details applicable to this specific UE in the
group (e.g maxReports in options IE).
The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall:
\- in case a) create event subscriptions for the UE specific events;
\- in case b) create event subscriptions for the group Id if there are no
existing event subscriptions for that group Id, subscription change
notification URI(subsChangeNotifyUri) and the subscription change notification
correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId). If there is already an
existing event subscription for the group Id, and for the given subscription
change notification URI(subsChangeNotifyUri) and subscription change
notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId), then an event
subscription shall not be created at the NF Service Consumer. The inidividual
UE specific event details (e.g maxReports in options IE) within that group
shall be taken into account.
\- for both the cases, for each created event subscription, allocate a new
subscription Id, if necessary (see clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]), and if
allocated, send the new subscription Id to the notification endpoint for
informing the subscription Id creation, along with the notification
correlation Id for the subscription Id change.
NOTE: Subscription Id can be reused if the mobility is between AMFs of same
AMF Set.
If the UE context being transferred from the source AMF is the last UE context
that belongs to a UE group Id related subscription, then the source AMF shall
not delete the UE group Id related subscription until the expiry of that event
subscription (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.4.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.4.2-2.
##### 5.2.2.2.1.2 Retrieve UE Context after successful UE authentication
{#retrieve-ue-context-after-successful-ue-authentication .H6}
When a successful UE authentication has been performed after a previous
integrity check failure, the NF service consumer (e.g. the target AMF) shall
retrieve the UE context by invoking \"transfer\" service operation on the URI
of the \"Individual ueContext\" resource identified by UE\'s SUPI. The same
requirements in clause 5.2.2.2.1.1 shall be applied with following
modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1, with following differences:
\- The {ueContextId} in the URI shall be composed using UE\'s SUPI, and
\- The \"reason\" attribute in request body shall be set to
\"MOBI_REG_UE_VALIDATED\", and
\- The request body shall not include registration request message from UE.
2\. Same as step 2a of figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1, with following differences:
\- The (source) AMF shall skip integrity check and shall respond with the
status code \"200 OK \"with the complete UE Context including available PDU
Session Contexts
##### 5.2.2.2.2 RegistrationStatusUpdate
##### 5.2.2.2.2.1 General {#general-1 .H6}
The RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- General Registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.2.2.2)
\- Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3],
clause 4.2.2.2.3)
The RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer, e.g. the target AMF, towards the NF Service Producer, i.e. the
source AMF, to update the status of UE registration at the target AMF, thereby
indicating the result of previous UE Context transfer for a given UE (see
clause 5.2.2.2.1.1).
The target AMF shall update the NF Service Producer (i.e. source AMF) the
status of the UE registration at the target AMF due to a previous UE Context
transfer. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. target AMF) shall use the HTTP method
POST to invoke the \"transfer-update\" custom operation on the URI of an
\"Individual ueContext\" resource, see clause 6.1.3.2.4. See also Figure
5.2.2.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.2.1-1 Registration Status Update
> 1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. target AMF), shall send a POST request to
> invoke the \"transfer-update\" custom operation on the URI of an
> \"Individual ueContext\" resource, to update the source AMF of the status of

>
> NOTE: AMF selects the same PCF instance for AM policy and for UE policy, as
> described in clause 6.3.7.1, 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].Once the update is received,
> the source AMF shall:
\- remove the individual ueContext resource and release any PDU session(s) in
the toReleaseSessionList attribute, if the transferStatus attribute included
in the POST request body is set to \"TRANSFERRED\". The source AMF may choose
to start a timer to supervise the release of the UE context resource and may
keep the individual ueContext resource until the timer expires. If the
pcfReselectedInd is set to true, the source AMF shall terminate the AM Policy
Association and/or the UE Policy Association that the source AMF has to the
old PCF.
\- shall keep the UE Context as if the context transfer procedure had not
happened if the transferStatus attribute included in the POST request body is
set to \"NOT_TRANSFERRED\".
2a. On Success: The source AMF shall respond with the status code \"200 OK\"
if the request is accepted.
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.5.2-2
shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.5.2-2, where applicable.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 CreateUEContext
##### 5.2.2.2.3.1 General {#general-2 .H6}
The CreateUEContext service operation is used during the following procedure:
\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
4.9.1.3)
The CreateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a source AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF), when the source AMF
_can\'t serve the UE and selects the target AMF during the handover procedure_
, to create the UE Context in the target AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall create the UE Context by
using the HTTP PUT method with the URI of the \"Individual UeContext\"
resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.3.1). See also Figure 5.2.2.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.3.1-1 Create UE Context
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. source AMF, shall send a PUT request, to
create the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the PUT request
shall contain a UeContextCreateData structure, including a N2 Information
Notification callback URI.
The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters, if
signalling based trace has been activated (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [30]).
2a. On success, the target AMF shall respond with the status code \"201
Created\" if the request is accepted, together with a HTTP Location header to
provide the location of a newly created resource. The payload body of the PUT
response shall contain the representation of the created UE Context. If the
target AMF selects a new PCF for AM Policy other than the one which was
included in the UeContext by the old AMF, the target AMF shall set
pcfReselectionInd to true. If the pcfReselectionInd is set to true, the source
AMF shall terminate the AM Policy Association to the old PCF.
The target AMF starts tracing according to the received trace control and
configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the UE context
indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once the AMF
receives subscription data, trace requirements received from the UDM
supersedes the trace requirements received from the NF Service Consumer.
The UE context shall contain event subscriptions information in the following
cases:
a) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE specific event; and/or
b) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE group specific events to
which the UE belongs. In this case the event subscriptions provided in the UE
context shall contain the event details applicable to this specific UE in the
group (e.g maxReports in options IE).
The target AMF, shall:
\- in case a) create event subscriptions for the UE specific events;
\- in case b) create event subscriptions for the group Id if there are no
existing event subscriptions for that group Id, subscription change
notification URI(subsChangeNotifyUri) and the subscription change notification
correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId). If there is already an
existing event subscription for the group Id and for the given subscription
change notification URI(subsChangeNotifyUri) and subscription Id change
notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId), then an event
subscription shall not be created at the target AMF. The inidividual UE
specific event details (e.g maxReports in options IE) within that group shall
be taken into account.
\- for both the cases, for each created event subscription, allocate a new
subscription Id, if necessary (see clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]), and if
allocated send the new subscription Id to the notification endpoint for
informing the subscription Id creation, along with the notification
correlation Id for the subscription Id change.
NOTE: Subscription Id can be reused if the mobility is between AMFs of same
AMF Set.
If the UE context being transferred from the NF service consumer (e.g. source
AMF) is the last UE context that belongs to a UE group Id related
subscription, then the NF service consumer (e.g. source AMF) shall not delete
the UE group Id related subscription until the expiry of that event
subscription (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).
> 2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table

##### 5.2.2.2.4 ReleaseUEContext
##### 5.2.2.2.4.1 General {#general-3 .H6}
The ReleaseUEContext service operation is used during the following procedure:
\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, Cancel procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502
[3], clause 4.9.1.4)
The ReleaseUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a source AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF), when the source AMF
_receives the Handover Cancel from the 5G-AN during the handover procedure_ ,
to release the UE Context in the target AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall release the UE Context by
using the HTTP \"release\" custom operation with the URI of the \"Individual
UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.2). See also Figure 5.2.2.2.4.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.4.1-1 Release UE Context
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. source AMF, shall send a POST request, to
release the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain any data that needs to be passed to the target AMF.
2a. On success, the target AMF shall return \"204 No Content\" with an empty
payload body in the POST response.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2.
#### 5.2.2.3 UE Specific N1N2 Message Operations
##### 5.2.2.3.1 N1N2MessageTransfer
##### 5.2.2.3.1.1 General {#general-4 .H6}
The N1N2MessageTransfer service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer to
transfer N1 and/or N2 information to the UE and/or 5G-AN through the AMF in
the following procedures:
\- Network triggered Service Request (see clause 4.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to transfer N1 and N2
information. The NF Service Consumer may include a N1N2MessageTransfer
Notification URI to AMF in the request message.
2a. On success, i.e. if the request is accepted and the AMF is able to
transfer the N1/N2 message to the UE and/or the AN, the AMF shall respond with
a \"200 OK\" status code. The AMF shall set the cause IE in the
N1N2MessageTransferRspData as \"N1_N2_TRANSFER_INITIATED\" in this case.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.5.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a N1N2MessageTransferError structure, including:
\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in Table 6.1.3.5.3.1-3;
##### 5.2.2.3.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the AMF {#detailed-behaviour-of-the-
amf .H6}
When an NF service consumer is requesting to send N1 and/or N2 information and
the UE is in CM-IDLE state for the access type for which the N1 and/or N2
information is related (called \"associated access type\" hereafter in this
clause), the requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
NOTE: N1 and/or N2 Session Management information is related to the access
type of the targeted PDU session; LCS related N1 (LPP) and/or N2 (NRPPa)
information is related to 3GPP access in Rel-15.
4xx and 5xx response cases shall also apply to UEs in CM-CONNECTED state, when
applicable.
**2xx Response Cases:**
**Case A: When UE is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access and the associated access type is
3GPP access:**
a) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF should respond with the
status code \"200 OK\", if \"skipInd\" attribute is set to \"true\" in the
request body, with a response body that carries the cause
\"N1_MSG_NOT_TRANSFERRED\".
b) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"202 Accepted\", if the asynchronous type communication is
invoked and hence the UE is not paged, update the UE context and store N1
and/or N2 information and initiate communication with the UE and/or 5G-AN when
the UE becomes reachable. In this case the AMF shall provide the URI of the
resource in the AMF in the \"Location\" header of the response, which contains
information regarding the stored N1/N2 message. The AMF shall also provide a
response body containing the cause, \"WAITING_FOR_ASYNCHRONOUS_TRANSFER\" that
represents the current status of the N1/N2 message transfer;
c) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"202 Accepted\", if paging is issued when the UE is in CM-IDLE
and reachable for 3GPP access, with a response body that carries a cause
\"ATTEMPTING_TO_REACH_UE\" as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 and 5.2.2.2.7 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
**Case B: When UE is CM-IDLE in Non-3GPP access but CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP
access and the associated access type is Non-3GPP access:**
a) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"200 OK\" with cause \"N1_N2_TRANSFER_INITIATED\" and initiate N1
NAS SM message transfer via 3GPP access, if the NF service consumer (i.e. SMF)
requests to send only N1 NAS SM message without any associated N2 SM
information, and the current access type related to the PDU session is
Non-3GPP access and the UE is CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access.
b) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"202 Accepted\", if NAS Notification procedure is issued when the
UE is in CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access, with a response body that carries a
cause \"ATTEMPTING_TO_REACH_UE\" as specified in step 4c of clause 4.2.3.3 and
5.2.2.2.7 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
**Case C: When UE is CM-IDLE in both Non-3GPP access and 3GPP access and the
associated access ype is Non-3GPP access:**
All the bullets specified in Case A are applicable.
The NF Service Consumer shall not send any further signalling for the UE if it
receives a POST response body with a cause \"ATTEMPTING_TO_REACH_UE\" unless
it has higher priority signalling. In such a case the response shall include
the \"Location\" header containing the URI of the resource created in the AMF,
which holds the status of the N1/N2 message transfer, e.g.
\".../n1-n2-messages/{n1N2MessageId}\". The AMF shall:
\- store the N1 and/or N2 information related to 3GPP access and, when the UE
responds with a Service Request, shall initiate communication with the UE
and/or 5G-AN using the stored N1 and/or N2 information;
\- store the N1 NAS SM information related to Non-3GPP access if no N2
information was received and the AMF initiated paging towards the UE. Later
when the UE responds with a Service Request,the AMF shall initiate
communication with the UE using the stored N1 information via 3GPP access;
\- inform the SMF which invoked the service operation, that the access type of
the PDU Session can be changed from Non-3GPP access to 3GPP access as
specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.502 [16], when the UE responds
with a \"List Of Allowed PDU Sessions\" and the indicated non-3GPP PDU session
of the N2 (and N1 if received) information is included in the list; or
\- notify the NF which invoked the service operation, as specified in clause
5.2.2.3.2, if the Notification URI is provided, when the AMF determines that
the paging or NAS Notification has failed or when the UE responds with a
\"List Of Allowed PDU Sessions\" and the indicated Non-3GPP PDU session of the
N2 (and N1 if received) information is not included in the list.
**4xx Response Cases:**
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with status
code \"409 Conflict\" in the following cases:
\- if the UE is in 3GPP access and there is already an ongoing paging
procedure with higher or same priority, the AMF shall set the application
error as \"HIGHER_PRIORITY_REQUEST_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
ProblemDetails structure of the POST response body. The AMF may provide a
retry timer value to the NF Service Consumer in order for the NF Service
Consumer to retry the request after the expiry of the timer. When the retry
timer is provided, the NF Service Consumer shall not initiate the downlink
messaging until the timer expires. The AMF may also provide the ARP value of
the QoS flow that has triggered the currently ongoing highest priority paging,
so that the NF Service Consumer (e.g. SMF) knows that if any subsequent
trigger initiating downlink messaging for a QoS flow with the same or lower
priority happens.
\- if there is an ongoing registration procedure (see clause 4.2.3.3 of 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3]) the AMF shall set the application error as
\"TEMPORARY_REJECT_REGISTRATION_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
ProblemDetails structure in the POST response body;
\- if this is a request to transfer a N2 PDU Session Resource Release Command
to a 5G-AN and if the UE is in CM-IDLE state at the AMF for the Access Network
Type associated to the PDU session (see clause 5.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.527
[33]), the AMF shall set the application error \"UE_IN_CM_IDLE_STATE\" in the
\"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails structure in the POST response body.
\- if there is an ongoing Xn or N2 handover procedure (see clause 4.9.1.2.1
and 4.9.1.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) the AMF shall set the application error
as \"TEMPORARY_REJECT_HANDOVER_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
ProblemDetails structure in the POST response body, if the AMF rejects the
request due to the on-going handover.
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"403 Forbidden\", if the UE is in a Non-Allowed Area and the
service request is not for regulatory prioritized service. The AMF shall set
the application error as \"UE_IN_NON_ALLOWED_AREA\" in POST response body.
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"403 Forbidden \", if the NF service consumer (e.g. an LMF) is
requesting to send N1 LPP message to the UE and the UE has indicated that it
does not support LPP in N1 mode during registration procedure (see clause
5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [11]). The AMF shall set the
application error to \"UE_WITHOUT_N1_LPP_SUPPORT\" in POST response body.
**5xx Response Cases:**
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"504 Gateway Timeout\", if the UE is currently unreachable (e.g.,
due to the UE in MICO mode or the UE is only registered over Non-3GPP access
and its state is CM-IDLE). The AMF shall set the application error as
\"UE_NOT_REACHABLE\" in POST response body.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 N1N2Transfer Failure Notification
The AMF uses this notification to inform the NF service consumer that
initiated an earlier Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, that the AMF
failed to deliver the N1 message to the UE as the UE failed to respond to
paging. The HTTP POST method shall be used on the notification callback URI
provided by the NF service consumer as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1.2.
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1 N1N2Transfer Failure Notification for UE related signalling
1\. When the AMF determines that the paging or NAS Notification has failed or
the indicated non-3GPP PDU session is not allowed to move to 3GPP access, and
if the NF service consumer had provided a notification URI (see clause
5.2.2.3.1.2), the AMF shall send a POST request to the NF Service Consumer on
that Notification URI. The AMF shall include the N1N2MessageTransfer request
resource URI returned earlier (see clause 5.2.2.3.1.2) in the POST request
body. The AMF shall also include a N1/N2 message transfer cause information in
the POST request body and set the value as specified in clause 6.1.5.6.3.1.
The NF Service Consumer shall delete any stored representation of the
N1N2MessageTransfer request resource URI upon receiving this notification.
2\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a response with \"204 No Content\"
status code.
##### 5.2.2.3.3 N1N2MessageSubscribe
##### 5.2.2.3.3.1 General {#general-5 .H6}
The N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer
(e.g. LMF or PCF) to subscribe to the AMF for notifying N1 messages of a
specific type (e.g. LPP) or N2 information of a specific type (e.g. NRPPa).
For the N1 message class UPDP, a PCF shall subscribe for the N1 message
notification with the AMF to receive the N1 messages from UE that are related
to UE Policy.
NOTE: Step 0 of clause 4.2.4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] specifies that the PCF
can split the UPDP transfer towards UE into multiple units. one UE specific
callback URI is registered with the AMF by the PCF for the AMF to notify all
UPDP message responses from the UE to the same callback URI. As a result, an
explicit subscription per UE policy association is defined in stage 3 for this
purpose.
An NF Service Consumer (e.g. LMF or PCF) may subscribe to notifications of
specific N1 message type (e.g. LPP or UPDP) or N2 information type (e.g.
NRPPa). In this case the NF Service Consumer shall subscribe by using the HTTP
POST method with the URI of the \"N1N2 Subscriptions Collection for Individual
UE Contexts\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.6.3.1). See also Figure
5.2.2.3.3.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.3.1-1 N1N2 Message Subscribe
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription
resource in the AMF for a UE specific N1/N2 message notification. The payload
body of the POST request shall contain:
\- N1 and/or N2 Message Type, identifying the type of N1 and/or N2 message to
be notified
\- A callback URI for the notification
2\. If the request is accepted, the AMF shall include a HTTP Location header
to provide the location of a newly created resource (subscription) together
with the status code 201 indicating the requested resource is created in the
response message.
##### 5.2.2.3.4 N1N2MessageUnSubscribe
##### 5.2.2.3.4.1 General {#general-6 .H6}
The N1N2MessageUnSubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer
(e.g. LMF or PCF) to unsubscribe to the AMF to stop notifying N1 messages of a
specific type (e.g. LPP or UPDP).
The NF Service Consumer shall use the HTTP method DELETE with the URI of the
\"N1N2 Individual Subscription\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.7.3.1), to request
the deletion of the subscription for the N1 / N2 message towards the AMF. See
also Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1-1 N1N2 Message UnSubscribe
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing
subscription resource in the AMF.
2\. If the request is accepted, the AMF shall reply with the status code 204
indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully deleted,
in the response message.
##### 5.2.2.3.5 N1MessageNotify
##### 5.2.2.3.5.1 General {#general-7 .H6}
The N1MessageNotify service operation is used by an AMF notifying the N1
message received from the UE to a destination CN NF, and it is used in the
following procedures:
\- Registration with AMF re-allocation (see clause 4.2.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502
[3])
\- UE assisted and UE based positioning procedure (see clause 4.13.5.4 of 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3])
\- UE configuration update procedure for transparent UE policy delivery (See
clause 4.2.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3])
NOTE: Though in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] the procedure is called \"UE configuration
update procedure for transparent UE policy delivery\", as per 3GPP TS 24.501
[11] clause 5.4.5.2.1, the UE initiated NAS transport procedure is used.
The AMF shall use HTTP POST method to the N1 Notification URI provided by the
NF Service Consumer via N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation (See clause
5.2.2.3.3). See also figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1 N1 Message Notify
1\. The AMF shall send a HTTP POST request to the N1 Notification URI, and the
payload body of the POST request shall contain an N1MessageNotificatoin data
structure with the subscribed N1 message.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the payload body of
the POST response shall be empty.
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.5.6.4.1-2
shall be returned. The message body shall contain a ProblemDetails object with
\"cause\" set to one of the corresponding application errors listed in Table

##### 5.2.2.3.5.2 Using N1MessageNotify in the Registration with AMF Re-
allocation Procedure {#using-n1messagenotify-in-the-registration-with-amf-re-
allocation-procedure .H6}
In the Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure, the N1MessageNotify
service operation is invoked by a NF Service Producer, i.e. an Initial AMF,
towards a NF Service Consumer, e.g. the target AMF, which is selected to serve
the UE, by the initial AMF.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. The initial AMF discovers the N1 Notification URI of the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. the target AMF) from the NRF (See clause 6.1.6.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.510 [29]).
NOTE: The alternate AMF is expected to have registered a callback URI with the
NRF.
2\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1, the request payload shall include
the following information in the HTTP POST Request message body:
\- RAN NGAP ID and initial AMF name (the information enabling (R)AN to
identify the N2 terminating point);
\- RAN identity, e.g. RAN Node Id, RAN N2 IPv4/v6 address;
\- Information from RAN, e.g. User Location, RRC Establishment Cause and UE
Context Request;

Positioning Procedure {#using-n1messagenotify-in-the-ue-assisted-and-ue-based-
positioning-procedure .H6}
In the UE assisted and UE based positioning procedure, the N1MessageNotify
service operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the LMF, to notify the N1 UE
positioning messages received from the UE.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. If the corresponding N1 notification URI is not available, the AMF shall
retrieve the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer (e.g. the LMF) from the NRF
using the NF Instance Identifier received during corresponding
N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (see clause 5.2.2.3.1), and further
identify the corresponding service instance if Service Instance Identifier was
also received, and fetch N1 Notification URI from the default subscription
registered with \"N1_MESSAGE\" notification type and \"LPP\" message class
(See clause 6.1.6.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [29]).
2\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1, the request payload shall include
the following information:
\- the N1 Uplink Positioning Message;
\- LCS correlation identifier.
##### 5.2.2.3.5.4 Using N1MessageNotify in the UE Configuration Update for
transparent UE Policy delivery {#using-n1messagenotify-in-the-ue-
configuration-update-for-transparent-ue-policy-delivery .H6}
In the UE Configuration Update for transparent UE Policy delivery procedure,
the N1MessageNotify service operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the PCF
which subscribed to be notified with UPDP messages received from the UE.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1. The request payload shall include
the following information:
\- the UPDP message.
##### 5.2.2.3.6 N2InfoNotify
##### 5.2.2.3.6.1 General {#general-8 .H6}
The N2InfoNotify service operation is used during the following procedure:
\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3],
clause 4.9.1.3.3)
\- Network assisted positioning procedure (See clause 4.13.5.5 in 3GPP TS
23.502 [3])
The N2InfoNotify service operation is invoked by AMF, to notify a NF Service
Consumer that subscribed N2 information has been received from access network.
The AMF shall use HTTP POST method to the N2Info Notification URI provided by
the NF Service Consumer via N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation (See clause
5.2.2.3.3). See also figure 5.2.2.3.6.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.6.1-1 N2 Information Notify
1\. The AMF shall send a HTTP POST request to the n2InfoNotifyUrl, and the
payload body of the POST request shall contain a N2InformationNotification
data structure, containing the N2 information that was subscribed by the NF
Service Consumer.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the payload body of
the POST response shall be empty.
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.5.5.3.1-2
shall be returned. The message body shall contain a ProblemDetails object with
\"cause\" set to one of the corresponding application errors listed in Table

##### 5.2.2.3.6.2 Using N2InfoNotify during Inter NG-RAN node N2 based
handover procedure {#using-n2infonotify-during-inter-ng-ran-node-n2-based-
handover-procedure .H6}
The N2InfoNotify service operation is invoked by a NF Service Producer, e.g.
the target AMF, towards the NF Service Consumer, i.e. the source AMF, to
notify that the handover procedure has been successful in the target side, for
a given UE.
Figure 5.2.2.3.6.2-1 N2 Information Notify during N2 Handover execution
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.6.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
0\. During an inter AMF handover procedure, the source AMF, acting as a NF
Service Consumer, when invoking the CreateUEContext service operation (see
clause 5.2.2.2.3), shall include a N2Info Notification URI to the target AMF
in the HTTP request message.
1\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.6.1-1, the request payload shall contain
the following information:
\- notification payload (see clause 6.1.5.5) without the \"n2InfoContainer\"
attribute;
\- the \"notifyReason\" attribute set to \"HANDOVER_COMPLETED\".
If any network slice(s) become no longer available and there are PDU
Session(s) associated with them, the target AMF shall include these PDU
session(s) in the toReleaseSessionList attribute in the payload. The
n2NotifySubscriptionId included in the notification payload shall be the UE
context Id.
2\. Same as Step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.6.1-1, with the following
additions/modifications:
\- the source AMF shall release the PDU Session(s) listed in the
toReleaseSessionList attribute in the payload and remove the individual
ueContext resource. The source AMF may choose to start a timer to supervise
the release of the UE context resource and may keep the individual ueContext
resource until the timer expires;
\- if Secondary RAT usage data have been received from the source NG-RAN and
buffered at the source AMF for one or more PDU sessions as specified in step
2a0 of clause 4.9.1.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], the source AMF shall send a 200
OK response with the Secondary RAT usage data included in the response payload
for the corresponding PDU sessions.
NOTE: This notification is due to an implicit subscription and hence no
explicit subscription Id is created. UE context Id is included as the
notification subscription Id for the NF Service Consumer (e.g. Source AMF) to
co-relate the notification to an earlier initiated UE context creation during
a handover procedure.
##### 5.2.2.3.6.3 Using N2InfoNotify during Location Services procedures
{#using-n2infonotify-during-location-services-procedures .H6}
The N2InfoNotify service operation is invoked by a NF Service Producer, i.e.
the AMF, towards the NF Service Consumer, e.g. the LMF, to notify the
positioning parameters received from the 5G-AN in the NRPPa message.

\- UE requested PDU Session Establishment including Request Types \"Initial
Request\" and \"Existing PDU Session\" (Non-roaming and Roaming with Local
Breakout (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.3.2.2.1).
\- UE requested PDU Session Establishment including Request Types \"Initial
Request\" and \"Existing PDU Session\" (Home-routed Roaming (see 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], clause 4.3.2.2.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and roaming
with local breakout) (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.3.3.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (home-routed roaming) (see

\- UE Triggered Service Request (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.3.2) to
move PDU Session(s) from untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.
\- Network requested PDU Session Modification, when the SMF needs to release
the assigned EBI from a QoS flow (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.11.1.4.3).
The EBIAssignment service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g.
a SMF, towards the NF Service Producer, i.e. the AMF, to request the AMF to
allocate EPS bearer ID(s) towards EPS bearer(s) mapped from QoS flow(s) for an
existing PDU Session for a given UE. EBI allocation shall apply only to PDU
Session(s) via 3GPP access supporting EPS interworking with N26. EBI
allocation shall not apply to PDU Session(s) via 3GPP access supporting EPS
interworking without N26 or PDU Session(s) via non-3GPP access supporting EPS
interworking.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the SMF) shall perform EBIAssignment service
operation by invoking \"assign-ebi\" custom operation on the \"individual
ueContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.3). See also Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1 EBI Assignment
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. the SMF, shall invoke \"assign-ebi\" custom
method on individual ueContext resource, which is identified by the UE\'s SUPI
or PEI in the AMF. The NF Service consumer shall provide PDU Session ID, ARP
list and S-NSSAI as input for the service operation.
2a. On success, the AMF shall assign EBI for each ARP in received ARP list, if
enough EBI(s) are available. If there is not enough EBI(s) available, the AMF
may revoke already assigned EBI(s) based on the ARP(s) and the S-NSSAI of the
PDU session for which the request was received, EBIs information in the UE
context and local policies. The AMF may only assign a subset of the requested
EPS Bearer ID(s), e.g. when other PDU Sessions with higher ARP have occupied
other available EPS Bearer IDs. If AMF has successfully assigned all or part
of the requested EBI(s), the AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK,
together with the assigned EBI to ARP mapping(s), the list of ARPs for which
the AMF failed to allocate an EBI (if any) and the list of EBI(s) released for
this PDU session due to revocation based on ARP(s) and the S-NSSAI (if any).
If the request contains \"releasedEbiList\", the AMF shall release the
requested EBI(s). The AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK and shall
include the EBI(s) released in the \"releasedEbiList\" IE of the POST response
body. The \"releasedEbiList\" in the request shall be handled before the EBI
assignment in AMF.
If the same EBI(s) are both in the \"releasedEbiList\"and \"assignedEbiList\",
the NF sevice consumer considers that EBI(s) have been released and
reassigned.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.3.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a N1N2MessageTransferError structure, including:
\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.3.2-2;
\- a failureDetails which describes the detailed cause phrase why the request
has failed.

### 5.3.2 Service Operations
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
For the Namf_EventExposure service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Subscribe;
\- Unsubscribe;
\- Notify.
#### 5.3.2.2 Subscribe
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
The Service Operation is used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. NEF) to subscribe
to an event(s) for one UE, group of UE(s) or any UE.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Creation of a subscription
The Subscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. NEF,
towards the AMF, when it needs to create a subscription to monitor at least
one event relevant to the AMF. The NF Service Consumer may subscribe to
multiple events in a subscription. A subscription may be associated with one
UE, a group of UEs or any UE.
The NF Service Consumer shall request to create a new subscription by using
HTTP method POST with URI of the subscriptions collection, see clause 6.2.3.2.
The NF Service Consumer shall include the following information in the HTTP
message body:
\- NF ID, indicates the identity of the network function instance initiating
the subscription;
\- Subscription Target, indicates the target(s) to be monitored, as one of the
following types:
\- A specific UE, identified with a SUPI, a PEI or a GPSI;
\- A group of UEs, identified with a group identity;
\- Any UE, identified by the \"anyUE\" flag.
\- Notification URI, indicates the address to deliver the event notifications
generated by the subscription;
\- Notification Correlation ID, indicates the correlation identity to be
carried in the event notifications generated by the subscription;
\- List of events to be subscribed;
\- Event Types per event, as specified in clause 5.3.1.
\- Reference Id per event, indicates the value of the Reference Id associated
with the event to be monitored. If provided, the Reference Id shall be
included in the reports triggered by the event.
The NF Service Consumer may include the following information in the HTTP
message body:
\- Immediate Report Flag per event, indicates an immediate report to be
generated with current event status;
\- Event Trigger, indicates how the events shall be reported (One-time
Reporting or Continuously Reporting).
\- Maximum Number of Reports, defines the maximum number of reports after
which the event subscription ceases to exist;
\- Expiry, defines maximum duration after which the event subscription ceases
to exist;
\- Event Filter per applicable event, defines further options on how the event
shall be reported.
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1 Subscribe for Creation
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription
resource in the AMF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
representation of the individual subscription resource to be created. The
request may contain an expiry time, suggested by the NF Service Consumer as a
hint, representing the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept
active and the time after which the subscribed event(s) shall stop generating
report.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall include a HTTP Location
header to provide the location of a newly created resource (subscription)
together with the status code 201 indicating the requested resource is created
in the response message. If the NF Service Consumer has included the
immediateFlag with value as \"true\" in the event subscription, the AMF shall
include the current status of the events subscribed, if available (e.g. last
known location information is included if the subscribed event is
LOCATION_REPORT). If the NF Service Consumer has set the event reporting
option as ONE_TIME and if the AMF has included the current status of the
events subscribed in the response, then the AMF shall not do any subsequent
event notification for the events given in the AmfCreateEventSubscription
parameter.
The response, based on operator policy and taking into account the expiry time
included in the request, may contain the expiry time, as determined by the
AMF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription
expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it
shall create a new subscription in the AMF. The AMF shall not provide the same
expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and
recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not
included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the
subscription to be valid without an expiry time.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.2.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-3.
##### 5.3.2.2.3 Modification of a subscription
The Subscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. NEF,
towards the AMF, when it needs to modify an existing subscription previously
created by itself at the AMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall modify the subscription by using HTTP method
PATCH with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause
6.2.3.3) to be modified.
See also Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 below.
Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 Modification of a Subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a PATCH request to modify a
subscription resource in the AMF. The modification may be for the events
subscribed or for updating the event options.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall return the
representation of the modified subscription resource or its sub-resource
together with the status code 200 OK. When the PATCH request is for modifying
the expiry attribute of the options IE of the subscription, then the AMF based
on operator policies and taking into account the expiry time included in the
request, shall include an expiry time, after which the subscription becomes
invalid. Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to
keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the AMF,
as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2. The AMF shall not provide the same expiry
time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and
recreating the subscription at the same time.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.1-3.
#### 5.3.2.3 Unsubscribe
##### 5.3.2.3.1 General
The Unsubscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g.
NEF, towards the AMF, to remove an existing subscription previously created by
itself at the AMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall unsubscribe to the subscription by using HTTP
method DELETE with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause
6.2.3.3) to be deleted.
Figure 5.3.2.3.1-1 Unsubscribe a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing
subscription resource in the AMF.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall reply with the status
code 204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully
deleted in the response message.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.2-3.
#### 5.3.2.4 Notify
##### 5.3.2.4.1 General
The Notify service operation is invoked by the AMF, to send a notification,
towards the notification URI, when certain event included in the subscription
has taken place.
The AMF shall use the HTTP method POST, using the notification URI received in
the subscription creation as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2, including e.g. the
subscription ID, Event ID(s) for which event has happened, notification
correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer at the time of event
subscription, to send a notification. See Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1.
Additionally, the Notify service operation shall also be invoked by the AMF,
when there is a change of AMF during UE mobility procedures and if the
subscription Id changes (i.e. Registration procedures and Handover
procedures).
Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1 Notify
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to send a notification.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403 Forbidden\")
indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error
information should be returned.

## 5.5 Namf_Location Service
### 5.5.1 Service Description
The Namf_Location service is used by NF service consumers to request the AMF
for initiating positioning requests and provide the location information. It
is also used to subsequently notify the location change events towards the NF
service consumers. The following are the key functionalities of this NF
service:
\- Allow NFs to request the current geodetic and optionally civic location of
a target UE.
\- Allow NFs to be notified of event information related to emergency
sessions.
\- Allow NFs to request Network Provided Location Information (NPLI) and/or
local time zone corresponding to the location of a target UE.
### 5.5.2 Service Operations
#### 5.5.2.1 Introduction
For the Namf_Location Service the following service operations are defined:
\- ProvidePositioningInfo;
\- EventNotify; and
\- ProvideLocationInfo.
#### 5.5.2.2 ProvidePositioningInfo
##### 5.5.2.2.1 General
The ProvidePositioningInfo service operation is used in the following
procedure:
\- 5GC-MT-LR Procedure without UDM Query (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
4.13.5.2)
\- 5GC-MT-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.5.3)
\- Location Continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN (see
3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.5.7)
The ProvidePositioningInfo service operation shall be invoked by the NF
Service Consumer (e.g. GMLC) to request the current geodetic and optionally
civic location of the UE. The service operation triggers the AMF to invoke the
service towards the LMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending POST to
the URI of the \"provide-pos-info\" custom operation on the \"Individual UE
Context\" resource (See clause 6.4.3.2.4.2). See also figure 5.5.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.2.1-1: NF Service Consumer requests the positioning information
of the UE
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource URI of
\"provide-pos-info\" custom operation of the \"_Individual UE context\"_
resource of the AMF. The payload body of the POST request may contain an
indication of a positioning request from an emergency services client, the
required QoS and Supported GAD shapes. If the NF service consumer wants the
location change information to be notified (e.g. during a handover procedure),
it also provides a callback URI on which the EventNotify service operation is
executed (see clause 5.5.2.3).
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned, the payload body containing the
LCS correlation identifier, the location estimate, its age and accuracy and
the information about the positioning method. If the request is invoked during
a handover the response body shall also include the target AMF node identifier
as specified in clause 4.13.5.7 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2
shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in Table 6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2.
#### 5.5.2.3 EventNotify
##### 5.5.2.3.1 General
The EventNotify service operation is used in the following procedure:
\- 5GC-NI-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.5.1)
\- Location Continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN (see
3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.5.7)
The EventNotify service operation notifies the NF Service Consumer (i.e. GMLC)
about a UE location related event information related to emergency sessions,
i.e. the initiation, handover or termination of an emergency session. The
notification is delivered to:
\- the callback URI received from the GMLC during an earlier
ProvidePositioningInfo service operation, if any;
Otherwise (if not available),
\- the callback URI registered in the NRF, if the GMLC registered to the NRF
with notification endpoints for location notifications (see clauses 6.1.6.2.4
and 6.1.6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [29]);
Otherwise (if not available),
\- GMLC URI locally provisioned in the AMF.
NOTE: During a handover procedure, both the source AMF and the target AMF can
invoke the EventNotify service operation, based on the local configuration.
The operation is invoked by issuing a POST request to the callback URI of the
NF Service Consumer (See clause 6.4.5.2.2). See also figure 5.5.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.3.1-1: UE Location Notification
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to the callback URI provided by the NF
service consumer determined as described above. The request body shall include
the type of location related event and UE Identification (SUPI or PEI), and
may include the GPSI, Geodetic Location, Civic Location and the Position
methods used.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403 Forbidden\")
indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error
information should be returned.
#### 5.5.2.4 ProvideLocationInfo
##### 5.5.2.4.1 General
The ProvideLocationInfo service operation allows an NF Service Consumer (e.g.
UDM) to request the Network Provided Location Information (NPLI) of a target
UE.
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending POST
request to the URI of the \"provide-loc-info\" custom operation on the
\"Individual UE Context\" resource (see clause 6.4.3.2.4.3), as shown in
figure 5.5.2.4.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.4.1-1: NF Service Consumer requests the Location Information of
the UE
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource URI of
\"provide-loc-info\" custom operation of the \"_Individual UE context\"_
resource on the AMF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
\"requestLocInfo\" data structure indicating the desired type of location
information.
If the NF Service Consumer desires the current location information of the
target UE, it shall set \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute to \"true\".
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" response shall be returned. The payload body of the
response shall contain a \"ProvideLocInfo\" data structure including the
Network Provide Location Information (NPLI) of the target UE.
If \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute is set to \"true\" and the UE is in CM-IDLE
state, the AMF shall initiate a paging procedure to the UE. If the paging
procedure is successful, the AMF shall return the current location information
and set \"currentLoc\" attribute to \"true\" in the response; if the UE does
not respond to the paging, the AMF shall provide the last known location and
set \"currentLoc\" attribute to \"false\" in the response.
If \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute is set to \"true\" and the UE is in CM-
CONNECTED state, the AMF shall follow NG-RAN Location reporting procedure, as
specified in clause 4.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], to trigger a single standalone
report by setting \"direct\" event type in **Location Reporting Control
message. If NG-RAN reports current location of the UE, the AMF shall** set
\"currentLoc\" attribute to \"true\" in the response; if NG-RAN reports last
known location of the UE with timestamp, the AMF shall set \"currentLoc\"
attribute to \"false\" in the response.
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.4.3.2.4.3.2-2
shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in table 6.4.3.2.4.3.2-2.

[9]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [9]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body part
shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [10]), and the JSON body

### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_Communication API
may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_Communication API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_Communication service.
The Namf_Communication API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the
name of the service (i.e., \"namf-comm\"), and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.2 Namf_EventExposure Service API

##### 6.2.6.3.3 Enumeration: AmfEventType
Table 6.2.6.3.3-1: Enumeration AmfEventType
Enumeration value Description
* * *
\"LOCATION_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the Last Known
Location of a UE or a group of UEs, and Updated Location of the UE or any UE
in the group when AMF becomes aware of a location change of the UE.
\"PRESENCE_IN_AOI_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the
current present state of a UE in a specific Area of Interest (AOI), and
notification when a specified UE enters or leaves the specified area. The area
could be identified by a TA list, an area ID or specific interest area name
like \"LADN\". \"TIMEZONE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive
the current time zone of a UE or a group of UEs, and updated time zone of the
UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a time zone change of the
UE. \"ACCESS_TYPE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the
current access type(s) of a UE or a group of UEs, and updated access type(s)
of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of the access type
change of the UE. \"REGISTRATION_STATE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event
to receive the current registration state of a UE or a group of UEs, and
report for updated registration state of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF
becomes aware of a registration state change of the UE.
\"CONNECTIVITY_STATE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the
current connectivity state of a UE or a group of UEs, and report for updated
connectivity state of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a
connectivity state change of the UE. \"REACHABILITY_REPORT\" A NF subscribes
to this event to receive the current reachability of a UE or a group of UEs,
and report for updated reachability of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF
becomes aware of a reachability change of the UE.
\"COMMUNICATION_FAILURE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the
Communication failure report of a UE or group of UEs or any UE.
\"UES_IN_AREA_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the number of
UEs in a specific area. \"SUBSCRIPTION_ID_CHANGE\" This event type is used by
the AMF to inform the NF service consumer that the subscription Id for the
event subscription is changed (e.g. Subscription Id creation at the target AMF
for individual UE level event subscriptions, during mobility registration or
handover procedures involving an AMF change). This event needs no explicit
subscription form an NF service consumer. \"SUBSCRIPTION_ID_ADDITION\" This
event type is used by the AMF to inform the NF service consumer that a new
subscription Id is added (e.g creation of an event subscription for a UE group
level event subscription at the target AMF, during mobility registration or
handover procedures involving AMF change for a UE belonging to a group Id and
when such a UE is the first UE of the group registering at the target AMF).
This event needs no explicit subscription form the NF service consumer.
\"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\" An NF subscribes to this event to receive the event
report of a UE or group of UEs when AMF detects that a target UE is no longer
reachable for either signalling or user plane communication. Such condition is
identified when Mobile Reachable timer expires in the AMF (see 3GPP TS 23.501
[2]), when the UE detaches and when AMF deregisters from UDM for an active UE.
If the UE is already not reachable for either signalling or user plane
communication when the event is subscribed, the AMF reports the event
directly.

### 6.2.8 Feature Negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
AMF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Namf_EventExposure service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Namf_EventExposure service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures
attribute in payload of the HTTP Request Message for subscription resource
creation.
The AMF shall determine the supported features for the service operations as
specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and shall indicate the supported
features by including the supportedFeatures attribute in payload of the HTTP
response for subscription resource creation.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [6].
The following features are defined for the Namf_EventExposure service:

+-------------------------------------+---------+-----+-------------+ | Feature Number | Feature | M/O | Description | +=====================================+=========+=====+=============+ | | | | | +-------------------------------------+---------+-----+-------------+ | Feature number: The order number of | | | | | the feature within the | | | | | s**upportedFeatures attribute | | | | | (starting with 1).** | | | | | | | | | | **Feature: A short name that can be | | | | | used to refer to the bit and to the | | | | | feature.** | | | | | | | | | | **M/O: Defines if the | | | | | implementation of the feature is | | | | | mandatory (** \"**M** \"**) or | | | | | optional (** \"**O** \"**).** | | | | | | | | | | Description: A clear textual | | | | | description of the feature. | | | | +-------------------------------------+---------+-----+-------------+
### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_EventExposure API
may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_EventExposure API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_EventExposure service.
The Namf_EventExposure API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the
name of the service (i.e., \"namf-evts\"), and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.3 Namf_MT Service API
### 6.3.1 API URI
The Namf_MT shall use the Namf_MT API.
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-mt\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.3.3.
### 6.3.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.3.2.1 General

5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf_MT service shall comply with the OpenAPI
[23] specification contained in Annex A.
#### 6.3.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.3.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.3.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [8], shall be used as content type of the
HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause 5.4
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [36]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
#### 6.3.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.3.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf_MT service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom headers used across
all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

### 6.3.8 Feature Negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
AMF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Namf_MT service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Namf_MT service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures attribute in
payload of the HTTP Request Message for following service operations:
\- EnableUEReachability, as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\- ProvideDomainSelectionInfo, as specified in clause 5.4.2.3;The AMF shall
determine the supported features for the service operations as specified in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and shall indicate the supported features by
including the supportedFeatures attribute in payload of the HTTP response for
the service operation.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [6].

### 6.3.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_MT API may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]), using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_MT API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_MT service.
The Namf_MT API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name of the
service (i.e., \"namf-mt\"), and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
## 6.4 Namf_Location Service API
### 6.4.1 API URI
The Namf_Location shall use the Namf_ Location API.
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-loc\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.1.3.
### 6.4.2 Usage of HTTP

HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf_Location service shall comply with the
OpenAPI [23] specification contained in Annex A.
#### 6.4.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.4.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.4.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [8], shall be used as content type of the
HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause 5.4
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [36]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
#### 6.4.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.4.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf_Location service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom headers used
across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

### 6.4.8 Feature Negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
AMF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Namf_Location service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Namf_Location service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures
attribute in payload of the HTTP Request Message for following service
operations:
\- ProvidePositioningInfo, as specified in clause 5.5.2.2;
\- ProvideLocationInfo, as specified in clause 5.5.2.x;
The AMF shall determine the supported features for the service operations as
specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and shall indicate the supported
features by including the supportedFeatures attribute in payload of the HTTP
response for the service operation.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [6].
The following features are defined for the Namf_Location service.
Table 6.1.8-1: Features of supportedFeatures attribute used by Namf_Location

### 6.4.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_Location API may
be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]), using
the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS
29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_Location API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_Location service.
The Namf_Location API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name of the
service (i.e., \"namf-loc\"), and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
# Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
## A.1 General
This Annex specifies the API definition of the service provided by AMF in this
document. The APIs are defined by OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML format,
following guidelines in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
The APIs for specified for following services:
\- Namf_Communication Service
\- Namf_EventExposure Service
\- Namf_MT Service
\- Namf_Location Service
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on the public 3GPP file server in the
following locations (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900 [37] for further
information):
