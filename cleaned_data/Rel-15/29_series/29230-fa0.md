# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

specified in the RFC 3588 [9]. There are two kind of applications: IETF
standards track applications and vendor specific applications. All application
identifiers are assigned by IANA [12]. This chapter lists the application
identifiers assigned by IANA to all 3GPP Diameter applications.
The application identifiers are transferred in Diameter command\'s header in
the Application-ID field.
## 4.1 3GPP specific application identifiers

# 6 Vendor identifier
The vendor identifier (also known as Enterprise number) indicates the vendor
specific attributes, result codes and application identifiers in Diameter
commands. The vendor identifier is used in the Vendor-ID field of the AVP
header and in the Vendor-Id AVP. The Vendor-Id AVP is used to identify the
vendor in the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id and Experimental-Result-Code
grouped AVPs.
## 6.1 3GPP\'s vendor identifier
The IANA has allocated a vendor identifier value 10415 for 3GPP [11].
# 7 Attribute-Value-Pair codes
The AVP codes are used together with the vendor identifier to identify each
attribute uniquely. There are multiple AVP namespaces. The IETF IANA
namespace, that is, the AVPs with vendor identifier zero or without vendor
identifier, is controlled by IANA. Each vendor controls the AVP codes within
their AVP namespaces.
## 7.1 3GPP specific AVP codes
The 3GPP specific AVPs have the Vendor-Specific bit (\'V\' bit) set in the AVP
header and they carry the 3GPP\'s vendor identifier in the Vendor-ID field of
the AVP header. The 3GPP specific AVP codes are presented in the following
table.

# 8 Experimental result codes
The Diameter answer messages must carry either Result-Code AVP or
Experimental-Result AVP. The values of Result-Code AVP are controlled by IANA.
The Experimental-Result AVP is a grouped AVP containing the Vendor-Id AVP and
Experimental-Result-Code AVP, thus the experimental result codes are
controlled in a vendor-specific manner.
## 8.1 3GPP specific result codes
The 3GPP specific result codes are always transferred in the Experimental-
Result AVP, which has the Vendor-Id with value of 3GPP\'s vendor identifier.
The 3GPP specific result codes shall follow the same classification as defined
for the values of Result-Code AVP in IETF RFC 3588 [9]. That means, the result
codes are grouped to following ranges:
> \- 1xxx (Informational)
>
> \- 2xxx (Success)
>
> \- 4xxx (Transient Failures)
>
> \- 5xxx (Permanent Failures)
### 8.1.1 Informational
The Informational result codes shall use the values from 1001 to 1999 in the
Experimental-Result-Code AVP.
Editor\'s note: No informational result codes have been yet defined in 3GPP.
### 8.1.2 Success
The Success result codes shall use the values from 2001 to 2999 in the
Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The reserved 3GPP specific Success result codes
are presented in the following table.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Assignment of the Diameter codes and
identifiers in 3GPP
This annex defines the recommended assignment procedure of Diameter codes and
identifiers within the 3GPP.
# A.1 Application identifiers
If a working group detects it will require a new application identifier, it
should contact the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 via a Liaison Statement. The LS shall
contain the name of the Diameter application and a reference to the
corresponding 3GPP TS. The 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 will then request the application
identifier from IANA. When the application identifier is received, the
corresponding working group will be informed by 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 and the table
4.1 in this specification will be updated.
According to RFC 3588 the creation of a new application should be avoided if
at all possible and therefore it is recommended to use the existing
application identifiers whenever possible.
# A.2 Command codes
If a working group detects there is a need for a new command code(s) from the
3GPP\'s range, it should contact the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 via an LS. The LS shall
contain the reference to the 3GPP TS, which specifies the command(s). The 3GPP
TSG-CN WG 4 will inform the assigned command code(s) to the corresponding
working group and the table 5.1 in this specification will be updated.
It should be noted that the standard command codes allocated for 3GPP are
scarce resource and getting new ones would require IETF specification work to
be done. Therefore it is recommended to use the existing command codes
whenever possible.
# A.3 AVP codes
If a working group detects a Diameter application needs new 3GPP specific AVP
codes, it should contact the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 via an LS. The LS shall contain
the name of the Diameter application and a reference to the corresponding 3GPP
TS. The 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 will allocate a range of 100 AVP codes for the
application. The range will be informed to the corresponding working group and
the table 7.1 will be updated in this specification to show the reserved
range. The working group can use the allocated range as a working assumption
when defining the actual AVPs.
When the corresponding working group has specified the AVPs, and the
specification has been approved and is under CR control, it should inform the
AVPs to the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 via an LS. The LS should list the used AVP codes
in the form of the table 7.1.
If there will be defined new AVPs for a Diameter application through the CR
procedure, the assigned AVP range can be used, but the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 should
be also informed about the new AVP codes via an LS.
Re-using of the existing AVPs is recommended, but special attention should be
paid on the use of enumerated AVPs. Defining new values for an enumerated AVP
should be agreed case by case with the working group responsible of the
particular enumerated AVP. 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 shall be informed via an LS about
the new values assigned to the enumerated AVP.
# A.4 Result codes
If a working group detects a Diameter application needs new 3GPP specific
result codes, it should contact the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 via an LS. The LS shall
contain the name of the Diameter application and a reference to the
corresponding 3GPP TS. The 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 will allocate a range of 20 result
codes from each required result code group for the application. The ranges
will be informed to the corresponding working group and the tables in the
chapter 8 of this specification will be updated to show the reserved ranges.
The working group can use the allocated ranges as a working assumption when
defining the actual result codes.
When the corresponding working group has specified the result codes, and the
specification has been approved and is under CR control, it should convey the
codes to the 3GPP TSG-CN WG 4 via an LS. The LS should list the used result
codes in the form of the tables in chapter 8.
If there will be defined new result codes for a Diameter application through
the CR procedure, the assigned result code ranges can be used, but the 3GPP
TSG-CN WG 4 should be also informed about the new result codes via an LS.
Re-using of the existing result codes is recommended.
