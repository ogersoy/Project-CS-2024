# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 3 of the control plane of the GPRS
Tunnelling Protocol, Version 2 (GTPv2-C).
GTPv2-C shall be used over:
\- the S2a, S2b, S3, S4, S5, S8, S10, S11, S16, Sm and Sn signalling
interfaces in EPC, specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [45].
\- the N26 signalling interface between EPC and 5GC, specified in 3GPP TS
23.501 [82] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [83].
GTPv2-C based protocols shall also be used over the Sv (see 3GPP TS 29.280
[15]) and S101/S121 (see 3GPP TS 29.276 [14]) interfaces.
In this document, unless otherwise specified, the S2a, S2b, S5 and S8
interfaces refer to the GTP-based S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 interfaces respectively.
The present document specifies functions, procedures and information which
apply to GERAN Iu mode. However, functionality related to GERAN Iu mode is
neither maintained nor enhanced.

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**GTP-PDU:** GTP Protocol Data Unit is either a GTP-C Message or a GTP-U
Message. GTP-U Message may be either a signalling message across the user
plane tunnel, or a G-PDU (see clause 6).
**\- Signalling Message** : any GTP-PDU (GTP-C or GTP-U) except the G-PDU.
**\- G-PDU:** GTP user plane message, which carries the original packet
(payload). G-PDU consists of GTP-U header and a T-PDU.
**\- T-PDU:** original packet, for example an IP datagram, from an UE or a
network node in an external packet data network. A T-PDU is the payload that
is tunnelled in the GTP-U tunnel.
**\- GTP-C Message:** GTP control plane message type of a GTP-PDU. GTP-C
message consists of GTP-C header, which is followed by zero or more
information elements.
**\- GTP-U Message:** GTP user plane message. The user plane messages are used
to carry user data packets, and also signalling messages e.g. for path
management and error indication. Therefore, GTP-U message consists of GTP-U
header, which is followed by either a T-PDU, or zero or more information
elements.
**GTP Tunnel:** A GTP tunnel is a communication tunnel between two GTP nodes
(see clause 4.1 \"GTP Tunnel\").

## 4.1 GTP Tunnel
GTP tunnels are used between two nodes communicating over a GTP based
interface, to separate traffic into different communication flows.
A GTP tunnel is identified in each node with a TEID, an IP address and a UDP
port number. The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the TEID
value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID value shall be assigned in a
non-predictable manner for PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b interfaces (see 3GPP TS 33.250
[85]). The TEID values are exchanged between tunnel endpoints using GTP-C or
S1-MME or Iu-PS messages. The GTPv2 entity communicates to the peer GTPv2
entity the TEID value at which it expects to receive all subsequent control
plane messages related to that GTP tunnel via the:
\- \"Sender F-TEID for Control Plane\" IE,
\- \"PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based
Control Plane interface\" IE,
\- \"MSC Server Sv TEID for Control Plane\" IE,
\- \"S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane\" IE, or
\- \"MME/SGSN Sv TEID for Control Plane\" IE.
The criteria defining when the same or different GTP tunnels shall be used
between the two nodes differs between the control and the user plane, and also
between interfaces.
For the control plane, for each end-point of a GTP-C tunnel:
\- The TEID-C shall be unique per PDN-Connection on GTP based S2a, S2b, S5 and
S8 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages
related to all bearers associated to the PDN-Connection. A TEID-C on the
S2a/S2b/S5/S8 interface shall be released after all its associated EPS bearers
are deleted.
\- There shall be only one pair of TEID-Cs per UE on each of the S3, S10, S16
and N26 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages
related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S3/S10/S16/N26 interface
shall be released after its associated UE context is removed or the UE is
detached. For the S3 interface, when ISR is active for the UE, during I-RAT
handover between the ISR associated nodes, the existing S3 TEID-C may be re-
used or new S3 TEID-C may be allocated. During this scenario, if the node
decides to allocate new S3 TEID-C, it shall release its own old S3 TEID-C.
\- There shall be only one pair of TEID-C per UE over the S11 and the S4
interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related
to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S11/S4 interface shall be released
after all its associated EPS bearers are deleted.
\- There shall be only one pair of TEID-C per MBMS Bearer Service (i.e. per
TMGI and MBMS Flow Identifier, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is provided; or per
TMGI, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is not provided) over the Sm and Sn
interfaces respectively. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control
messages related to the same MBMS Bearer Service. A TEID-C on the Sm/Sn
interface shall be released after the MBMS Bearer Session is stopped.
For GTP-U, a TEID-U is used according to 3GPP TS 29.281 [13].
NOTE: GTP-U is based on GTP version 1 (GTPv1).
## 4.2 Protocol stack
### 4.2.0 General
The protocol stack for GTPv2 shall be as depicted in Figure 4.2.0-1.
{width="6.267361111111111in" height="3.267361111111111in"}
Figure 4.2.0-1: GTPv2 stack
The GTPv2 headers are specified in the respective clauses of this
specification.
The source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports used for each GTP-C
message depend on the role that the message plays in a message exchange. A
message can be an Initial message, or a Triggered message, or a Triggered
Reply message to Triggered message. An Initial message is sent to a peer GTP
entity with a sequence number chosen by the sending entity (see clause 7.6). A
Triggered message is sent in response to an Initial message. Triggered Reply
message may be sent in response to a Triggered message. See clause 7.6 for the
sequence number usage.
Typically, a Request message is an Initial message, but a Request message may
be a Triggered messages in certain procedures where they are triggered by an
Initial Command message. See clause 4.2.5 for classification of the Initial
messages and their possible Triggered messages, as well as cases where there
are Triggered Reply messages to the Triggered messages.
Piggybacking is an optional feature, which is described in Annex F of 3GPP TS
23.401 [3]. If the feature is supported, then the piggybacking of the initial
messages on triggered response messages for EUTRAN Initial Attach, a Handover
from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN (see sub-clauses 8.6
and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) and UE-requested PDN Connectivity procedures
shall be implemented as per requirements in clauses 4.2.0 and 5.5.1 of this
specification .When piggybacking is used, a common IP header and a common UDP
header shall be used for the triggered response message and the piggybacked
initial message as depicted in Figure 4.2.0-2. Immediately following the
triggered response message is the piggybacked initial message, following which
no additional information shall be present. The clause 5.5 specifies the usage
of piggybacking-specific fields in the GTP-C header.
* * *
IP header UDP header Triggered response message (P=1) Piggybacked initial
message (P=0)
* * *
Figure 4.2.0-2: Packet Format for the Piggybacking of messages
### 4.2.1 UDP header and port numbers
#### 4.2.1.0 General
A User Datagram Protocol (UDP) compliant with IETF RFC 768 [7] shall be used.
#### 4.2.1.1 Initial Messages
The UDP Destination Port number for GTPv2 Initial messages shall be 2123\. It
is the registered port number for GTP-C.
The UDP Source Port for a GTPv2 Initial message is a locally allocated port
number at the sending GTP entity.
If GTPv2 and GTP\' v2 modules are using the same IP address for sending
messages, the implementation shall ensure that while some source port number
is used by GTPv2 messages, the same source port number shall not be used by
GTP\' v2 messages. Otherwise, the IP interface may have difficulty to
delivering a response message to the right protocol entity.
#### 4.2.1.2 Triggered Messages
The UDP Destination Port value of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a
Triggered Reply message shall be the value of the UDP Source Port of the
corresponding message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the
case of the SGSN pool scenario.
The UDP Source Port of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered Reply
message shall be the value from the UDP Destination Port of the corresponding
message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of the SGSN
pool scenario.
In the SGSN pool scenario, if the Identification Request, the Context Request
or the Suspend Notification messages have been forwarded by another SGSN in
the pool, the UDP Destination Port for the Identification Response, the
Context Response or the Suspend Acknowledge message shall be determined in the
following way. The value from the information element \"UDP Source Port
Number\", which was sent in the corresponding forwarded request, shall be
copied into the UDP Destination Port field. The UDP Source Port for the
Identification Response, the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowledge
message may be a locally allocated port number at the sending GTP entity.
In the handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed, if the Forward
Relocation Request message has been forwarded by the target MME, the UDP
Destination Port for the Forward Relocation Response shall be set to the value
of Source UDP Port Number IE included in the Forward Relocation Request
message; the UDP Source Port for the Forward Relocation Response message may
be a locally allocated port number at the sending GTP entity.
#### 4.2.1.3 Piggybacked Messages
A piggybacked initial message is carried as a concatenation after a triggered
response message and they share a common UDP header (see Figure 4.2.0-2).
The UDP Destination port for the IP packet containing both the triggered
response message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as the
port number used for the triggered response message.\ \ The UDP Source port
for the IP packet containing both the triggered response message and the
piggybacked initial message shall be the same as the port number used for the
triggered response message.
### 4.2.2 IP header and IP addresses
#### 4.2.2.1 Initial Messages
The IP Destination Address of a GTPv2 Initial message shall be an IP address
of the destination GTPv2 entity.
During the establishment of the GTP tunnel, the GTPv2 entity selects and
communicates to the peer GTPv2 entity the IP Destination Address at which it
expects to receive subsequent control plane Initial messages related to that
GTP tunnel via the:
\- \"Sender F-TEID for Control Plane\" IE,
\- \"PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based
Control Plane interface\" IE,
\- \"MSC Server Sv Address for Control Plane\" IE,
\- \"S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane\" IE, or
\- \"MME/SGSN Sv Address for Control Plane\" IE.
A Create Session Request shall only include in the Sender F-TEID the same IP
address type as the destination address used in the IP header. An IPv4/IPv6
capable SGW and PGW may advertize an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6 address in
the F-TEID of the above IEs.
Upon a change of MME, SGSN or SGW, the new MME, SGSN or SGW may switch to a
different IP address type (e.g. IPv6 address) in the IP header if a different
IP address type was advertized by the SGW or PGW earlier. A Modify Bearer
Request shall only include in the Sender F-TEID the same IP address type as
the destination address used in the IP header.
NOTE 1: Advertizing a single IP address type in a Create Session Request or a
Modify Bearer Request ensures that both GTP-C peers know without ambiguity the
IP address type to be used in subsequent control plane Initial messages in the
reverse direction related to that GTP-C tunnel, and it avoids intempestive IP
address switching during the establishment of the GTP-C tunnel or during an
established communication between two GTP-C peers.
NOTE 2: IP switching between IPv4 and IPv6 can occur upon a change of MME/SGSN
or SGW in deployments with MME/SGSNs or SGWs with different IPv6 capabilities.
EXAMPLE 1: If an MME gets IPv4 addresses from the DNS for the SGW, the MME
only includes an IPv4 address in the Sender F-TEID IE of the Create Session
Request. In the response, the SGW advertises an IPv4 address and optionally an
IPv6 address, and the SGW uses IPv4 addressing in subsequent control plane
Initial messages it sends to the MME related to that GTP-C tunnel.
EXAMPLE 2: As a continuation of EXAMPLE 1, upon a subsequent change of MMEs,
assuming the source MME only supports IPv4 and the target MME supports IPv4
and IPv6, the target MME can switch to IPv6 addressing by sending a Modify
Bearer Request to the SGW using the SGW S11 IPv6 address in the IP header and
including a Sender F-TEID with an MME S11 IPv6 address only.
During the network triggered service restoration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.007
[17]), if an MME/S4-SGSN sends a Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication
message to the SGW, then the destination address for this message shall be the
SGW IP address signalled via the Sender F-TEID for Control Plane IE in the
Downlink Data Notification message (if present in the message), otherwise the
source IP address of the Downlink Data Notification message received earlier.
The IP Source Address of a GTPv2 Initial message shall be an IP address of the
source GTPv2 entity from which the Initial message is originating.
#### 4.2.2.2 Triggered Messages
The IP Destination Address of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered
Reply message shall be copied from the IP Source Address of the message to
which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of the SGSN pool
scenario.
The IP Source Address of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered Reply
message shall be copied from the IP destination address of the message to
which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of SGSN pool scenario
and handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed.
In the SGSN pool scenario, if the Identification Request, the Context Request
or the Suspend Notification messages have been forwarded by another SGSN in
the pool, the IP Source address for the Identification Response, the Context
Response or the Suspend Acknowledge messages shall be locally allocated by the
sending GTP entity. The IP Destination Address for the Identification
Response, the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowlegde messages shall be
determined in the following way. The value from the information element
\"Address for Control Plane\", which was sent in the corresponding
Identification Request or the Suspend Notification message; or the value from
the information element \"S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane\",
which was sent in the corresponding Context Request message, shall be copied
into the IP Destination Address field.
In the handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed, if the Forward
Relocation Request message has been forwarded by the target MME, the IP Source
address of the Forward Relocation Response shall be locally allocated by the
sending GTP entity. The IP Destination Address field of the Forward Relocation
Response shall be set to the value of the \"Sender\'s F-TEID for Control
Plane\" IE received in the Forward Relocation Request message.
#### 4.2.2.3 Piggybacked Messages
A piggybacked initial message is carried as a concatenation after a triggered
response message and they share a common IP header (see Figure 4.2.0-2).
The IP Source Address for the IP packet containing both the triggered response
message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as the IP
Address used for the triggered response message.
The IP Destination Address for the IP packet containing both the triggered
response message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as the
IP Address used for the triggered response message.
### 4.2.3 Layer 2
Typically Ethernet should be used as a Layer 2 protocol, but operators may use
any other technology.
### 4.2.4 Layer 1
Operators may use any appropriate Layer 1 technology.
### 4.2.5 Messages with GTPv2 defined replies: Classification of Initial and
Triggered Messages
An Initial message is a GTPv2 message that is not triggered as a response to
another GTPv2 message across the given interface.
The expected reply to a Request message is a Triggered message and the reply
has the same message name as the Request but with \"Response\" replacing
\"Request\".
NOTE 1: If the SGW receives a \"Create Session Request\" on S11/S4, this can
trigger either of the following GTPv2 messages across S5/S8: \"Create Session
Request\" or \"Modify Bearer Request\". However, neither of these messages
across S5/S8 is considered to be a Triggered message.
If a Request message is a reply to a Command message, then the Request message
is a Triggered message; otherwise the Request message is an Initial message.
Responses do not have replies except when a \"Context Acknowledge\" is
required as a reply to \"Context Response\" message as specified in relevant
Stage 2 procedures. Context Acknowledge is always triggered message and does
not have a reply.
NOTE 2: The \"Context Acknowledge\" message is sent only if the \"Context
Response\" message is received with the acceptance cause.
A message whose name ends in \"Command\" is always an initial message. If a
\"Command\" message fails, the name of the reply message is constructed by
replacing \"Command\" with \"Failure Indication\". Apart from \"Downlink Data
Notification Failure Indication\" message, a \"Failure Indication\" is a
Triggered message. The \"Failure Indication\" message does not have a reply.
If a \"Command\" message is successful, its reply will be a Request as
specified in relevant Stage 2 procedures.
A message whose name ends in \"Notification\" is always an Initial message,
The expected Triggered message in reply has the same message name but with
\"Acknowledge\" replacing \"Notification\", except for the case of the message
\"Downlink Data Notification\" which has the reply \"Downlink Data
Notification Acknowledge\" and \"PGW Resart Notification\" which has the reply
\"PGW Restart Notification Acknowledge\". An \"Acknowledge\" message does not
have a reply.
CS Paging Indication, Stop Paging Indication, RAN Information Relay,
Configuration Transfer Tunnel, Trace Session Activation, Trace Session
Deactivation, ISR Status Indication and Downlink Data Notification Failure
Indication messages are Initial messages that do not have a reply.
A Version Not Supported Indication message is a Triggered message.
## 4.3 Transmission Order and Bit Definitions
The messages in this document shall be transmitted in network octet order
starting with octet 1 with the Most Significant Bit sent first.
The most significant bit of an octet in a GTP message is bit 8. If a value in
a GTP message spans several octets and nothing else is stated, the most
significant bit is bit 8 of the octet with the lowest number.
# 5 GTP Header for Control Plane
## 5.1 General format
Control Plane GTP uses a variable length header. Control Plane GTP header
length shall be a multiple of 4 octets. Figure 5.1-1 illustrates the format of
the GTPv2-C Header.

The usage of GTPv2-C header across the EPC specific interfaces is defined in
the clause 5.5 \"Usage of the GTPv2-C Header\". Octet 1 bits shall be coded as
follows:
\- Bits 6-8 represent the Version field.
\- Bit 5 represents the Piggybacking flag (P).
\- Bit 4 represents the TEID flag (T).
\- Bits 3-1 are spare, the sender shall set them to \"0\" and the receiving
entity shall ignore them.
## 5.2 Control Plane GTP Extension Header
The legacy Extension Header mechanism is not used for the GTP version 2
control plane (GTPv2-C). Future extensions will be implemented by adding
Information Elements in the message body if new parameters are needed.
## 5.3 GTP-C header for Echo and Version Not Supported Indication messages
The GTPv2-C message header for the Echo Request, Echo Response and Version Not
Supported Indication messages shall not contain the TEID field, but shall
contain the Sequence Number fields, followed by one spare octet as depicted in
figure 5.3-1. The spare bits shall be set to zero by the sender and ignored by
the receiver. _For the Version Not Supported Indication message header, the
Sequence Number may be set to any number and shall be ignored by the
receiver._

## 5.5 Usage of the GTPv2-C Header
### 5.5.1 General
The format of the GTPv2-C header is specified in clause 5.1 \"General
format\". The usage of the GTP-C header across e.g. S101/S121 (3GPP TS 29.276
[14]) and Sv (3GPP TS 29.280 [15]) interfaces are defined in their respective
specifications.
The usage of the GTPv2-C header for EPC specific interfaces shall be as
defined below.
The first octet of the header shall be used is the following way:
\- Bits 8 to 6, which represent the GTP-C version, shall be set to decimal 2
(\"010\").
\- Bit 5 represents a \"P\" flag. If the \"P\" flag is set to \"0\", no
piggybacked message shall be present. If the \"P\" flag is set to \"1\", then
another GTPv2-C message with its own header and body shall be present at the
end of the current message.
When present, a piggybacked message shall have its \"P\" flag set to \"0\" in
its own header. If a Create Session Response message (as part of EUTRAN
initial attach, a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to
E-UTRAN (see sub-clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) or UE-requested
PDN connectivity procedure) has the \"P\" flag set to \"1\", then a single
Create Bearer Request message shall be present as the piggybacked message. As
a response to the Create Bearer Request message, if the Create Bearer Response
has the \"P\" flag set to \"1\", then a single Modify Bearer Request (as part
of EUTRAN initial attach, a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP
Access to E-UTRAN (see sub-clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) or
UE-requested PDN connectivity procedure) shall be present as the piggybacked
message. A Create Bearer Response with \"P\" flag set to \"1\" shall not be
sent unless a Create Session Response with \"P\" flag set to \"1\" has been
received for the same procedure. Apart from Create Session Response and Create
Bearer Response messages, all the EPC specific messages shall have the \"P\"
flag set to \"0\".
\- Bit 4 represents a \"T\" flag, which indicates if TEID field is present in
the GTP-C header or not. If the \"T\" flag is set to 0, then the TEID field
shall not be present in the GTP-C header. If the \"T\" flag is set to 1, then
the TEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in octets 5 to 8.
Apart from the Echo Request, Echo Response and Version Not Supported
Indication messages, in all EPC specific messages the value of the \"T\" flag
shall be set to \"1\".
\- Bit 3 represents a \"MP\" flag. If the \"MP\" flag is set to \"1\", then
bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall indicate the message priority.
\- Bit 2 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
\- Bit 1 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
The usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified
below.
\- Octet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the unique
value for each type of control plane message. Message type values are
specified in Table 6.1-1 \"Message types for GTPv2\".
\- Octets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall indicate
the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the GTP-C
header (the first 4 octets). The TEID (if present) and the Sequence Number
shall be included in the length count. The format of the Length field of
information elements is specified in clause 8.2 \"Information Element
Format\".
\- A piggybacked initial message and the preceding triggered response message
present in the common IP/UDP packet shall have their own length and sequence
number in their respective GTP-C headers. The overall length of the IP/UDP
packet shall indicate the total length of the two GTP-C messages.
\- For EPC specific interfaces, T=1, and therefore octets 5 to 8 represent the
Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) field. This field shall unambiguously
identify a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP-C entity. The Tunnel Endpoint
Identifier is set by the sending entity in the GTP header of all control plane
messages to the TEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity (see
clause 4.1). If a peer\'s TEID is not available the TEID field shall be
present in a GTPv2-C header, but its value shall be set to \"0\", as specified
in clause 5.5.2 \"Conditions for sending TEID=0 in GTPv2-C header\".
NOTE: The TEID in the GTP header of a Triggered (or Triggered Reply) message
is set to the TEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity
regardless of whether the source IP address of the Initial (or Triggered)
message and the IP Destination Address provided by the receiving entity for
subsequent control plane Initial messages (see clause 4.2.2.1) are the same or
not.
\- Octets 9 to 11 represent GTP Sequence Number field.
\- Bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall indicate the relative priority of the GTP-C
message, if the \"MP\" flag is set to 1 in Octet 1. It shall be encoded as the
binary value of the Message Priority and it may take any value between 0 and
15, where 0 corresponds to the highest priority and 15 the lowest priority.\ \
If the \"MP\" flag is set to \"0\" in Octet 1, bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall
be set to \"0\" by the sending entity and ignored by the receiving entity.
\- Bits 4 to 1 of octet 12 are spare bits. The sending entity shall set them
to \"0\" and the receiving entity shall ignore them.
### 5.5.2 Conditions for sending TEID=0 in GTPv2-C header
If a peer\'s TEID is not available, the TEID field still shall be present in
the header and its value shall be set to \"0\" in the following messages:
\- Create Session Request message on S2a/S2b/S5/S8
\- Create Session Request message on S4/S11, if for a given UE, the SGSN/MME
has not yet obtained the Control TEID of the SGW.
\- Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message on S4/S11, if the
SGW selected by the MME/S4-SGSN for indirect data forwarding is different from
the SGW used as anchor.
\- Identification Request/Response messages.
\- Forward Relocation Request message over the S10, S16 and N26 interfaces,
and over the S3 interface during I-RAT handover when ISR is not active.
\- Forward Relocation Request message over the S3 interface during I-RAT
handover between ISR associated nodes, when ISR is active for the UE, and if
the node decides to allocate new S3 TEID-C.
\- Context Request message over the S10, S16, S3 and N26 interfaces.
\- Relocation Cancel Request message over the S10, S16, S3 and N26 interfaces,
except for the case where the old SGSN/MME or AMF has already been assigned
the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane of the new SGSN/MME or AMF.
\- Relocation Cancel Response message over the S10, S16, S3 and N26 interfaces
if the new SGSN/MME or AMF does not have the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier
Control Plane of the old SGSN/MME or AMF.
\- Delete PDN Connection Set Request/Response messages.
\- Configuration Transfer Tunnel message.
\- RAN Information Relay message.
\- If a node receives a message and the TEID-C in the GTPv2 header of the
received message is not known, it shall respond with \"Context not found\"
Cause in the corresponding response message to the sender, the TEID used in
the GTPv2-C header in the response message shall be then set to zero.
\- If a node receives a request message containing protocol error, e.g.
Mandatory IE missing, which requires the receiver to reject the message as
specified in clause 7.7, it shall reject the request message. For the response
message, the node should look up the remote peer\'s TEID and accordingly set
the GTPv2-C header TEID and the message cause code. As an implementation
option, the node may not look up the remote peer\'s TEID and set the GTPv2-C
header TEID to zero in the response message. However in this case, the cause
code shall not be set to \"Context not found\".
\- MBMS Session Start Request message.
\- PGW Restart Notification / PGW Restart Notification Acknowledge messages.
\- Downlink Data Notification message sent on S11/S4 as part of the Network
Triggered Service Restoration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]), and
corresponding Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge and Downlink Data
Notification Failure Indication if the SGW did not include the Sender F-TEID
for Control Plane IE in the Downlink Data Notification message.
\- Stop Paging Indication message is sent to the the restarted CN node (or
another node in the same pool) as part of the Network Triggered Service
Restoration procedure with ISR (see 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]).
\- Suspend Notification and Suspend Acknowledge messages: over S16 interface;
over S3 interface when ISR is not active.
\- PGW Downlink Triggering Notification message on S5 and S11/S4, PGW Downlink
Triggering Acknowledge message on S11/S4, and PGW Downlink Triggering
Acknowledge message on S5 if the PGW did not include the Sender F-TEID for
Control Plane IE in the PGW Downlink Triggering Notification message.
\- UE Registration Query Request and UE Registration Query Response messages
over S3 interface.
NOTE: Legacy implementation conforming to earlier versions of this
specification can send the Change Notification Request/Response messages on
the TEID zero in spite of the peer\'s node TEID being available.

# 6 GTP-C Message Types and Message Formats
# 6.0 General
A GTP-C message is sent across a GTP control plane tunnel. In a message, the
GTP-C header is followed by zero or more information elements. The GTP-C
messages are used for the control plane path management, for the control plane
tunnel management and for mobility management.
A T-PDU is an original packet, for example an IP datagram, from an UE, or from
a network node in an external packet data network.
## 6.1 Message Format and Type values
### 6.1.0 Message Type
GTP defines a set of messages between two associated EPC network elements. The

### 6.1.1 Presence requirements of Information Elements
There are four different presence requirements (Mandatory, Conditional,
Optional, or Conditional-Optional) for an IE within a given GTP-PDU:
\- Mandatory means that the IE shall be included by the sending side, and that
the receiver diagnoses a \"Mandatory IE missing\" error, when detecting that
the IE is not present. A response including a \"Mandatory IE missing\" cause,
shall include the type of the missing IE.
\- Conditional means:
\- that the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions specified
in the relevant protocol specification are met;
\- the receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the corresponding
message type description, based on the parameter combination in the message
and/or on the state of the receiving node, to infer if a conditional IE shall
be expected. Only if a receiver has sufficient information the following
applies. A conditional IE, which is absolutely necessary for the receiving
entity to complete the procedure, is missing, then the receiver shall abort
the procedure.
\- Conditional-Optional means:
\- that the IE shall be included by the up-to-date sending entity, if the
conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are met. An
entity, which is at an earlier version of the protocol and therefore is not
up-to-date, obviously cannot send such new IE.
\- the receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message. If the
receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE, then the IE\'s
absence shall not trigger any of the error handling procedures. The handling
of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be treated as Optional IEs as
specified in clause 7.7 \"Error Handling\".
\- Optional means:
\- that the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE may be
included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an
erroneous optional IE is specified in clause 7.7 \"Error Handling\".
For conditional IEs, the clause describing the GTP-PDU explicitly defines the
conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or optional
for that particular GTP-PDU. These conditions shall be defined so that the
presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is critical for the
receiving entity. The definition might reference other protocol specifications
for final terms used as part of the condition.
For grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the
rules:
\- The grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence
requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the Mandatory
grouped IE for the given message.
\- The grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE in
the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as
Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is
Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the
receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE
is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver.
\- The grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the
embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is
viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the
grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE
by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this
embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver.
\- The grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in the
grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.
In all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in clause
7.7 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.
Only the Cause information element at message level shall be included in the
response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not
accepted regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional
information elements defined for a given response message.
The following are exceptions:
\- Optionally, the Protocol Configuration Options, Recovery, User Location
Information (ULI), Load Control Information, Overload Control Information,
Bearer Context and Local Distinguished Name (LDN) information elements may be
included.
\- For the rejection response of a Forward Relocation Request, the Forward
Relocation Response message may also include an F-Cause IE as specified in
clause 7.3.2.
\- For the rejection response of a SRVCC PS to CS Request, the SRVCC PS to CS
Response message may also include an SRVCC Cause IE as specified in clause
5.2.3 in 3GPP TS 29.280 [15].
\- A Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge (with or) without an indication of
success may also include a DL low priority traffic Throttling IE and the IMSI
IE.
\- The PGW Back-Off Time IE may also be returned when rejecting a Create
Session Request with the cause \"APN Congestion\".
\- Change Notification Response message may also include the IMSI and MEI
information elements.
\- Failure Indication type messages do not have \"Accept\" types of Cause
values, i.e. all used values indicate the rejection, therefore for Failure
Indication type of triggered messages, other information elements, other than
the Cause IE, shall also be included according to the conditions of presence
specified in the respective message, if they are available.
\- The Context Response message (sent by an SGSN or MME) should also include
the IMSI IE if the Cause IE contains the value \"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\",
except if the UE is emergency attached and the UE is UICCless.
\- The Create Bearer Response message, the Update Bearer Response message and
the Delete Bearer Response message shall include the RAN/NAS Cause IE
according to the conditions specified in clauses 7.2.4, 7.2.16 and 7.2.10.2.
\- The UE Registration Query Response message shall include IMSI to allow the
SGSN to correlate the response message with the corresponding request.
If the Cause information element at Grouped IE level contains a value that
indicates that the Grouped IE is not handled correctly, e.g. \"Context Not
Found\" at Bearer Context IE level, the other information elements in this
Grouped IE, other than the Cause IE, may not be included.
### 6.1.2 Grouped Information Elements
Information elements can contain other IEs. This type of IE is called
\"Grouped IEs\".
Grouped IEs have a length value in the TLIV encoding, which includes the added
length of all the embedded IEs. Overall coding of a grouped information
element with 4 octets long IE header is defined in clause 8.2 \"Information
Element Format\". Each information element within a grouped IE also shall also
contain 4 octets long IE header.
Grouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE
type values. The clause describing an IE in this specification shall
explicitly state if it is grouped.
NOTE 1: Each entry into each Grouped IE creates a new scope level. Exit from
the grouped IE closes the scope level. The GTPv2 message level is the top most
scope. This is analogous to the local scope of a subroutine/function.
If more than one grouped information elements of the same type, but for a
different purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have different
Instance values.
If more than one grouped information elements of the same type and for the
same purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have exactly the same
Instance value to represent a list.
NOTE 2: For instance, all \"Bearer Contexts Modified\" IEs of the type
\"Bearer Context\" in a \"Modify Bearer Response\" message shall have the
Instance value of 0, while all \"Bearer Contexts Marked for Removal\" IEs of
the type \"Bearer Context\" in the same message shall have the Instance value
of 1.
### 6.1.3 Information Element instance
Every GTPv2 message and grouped IE within a message in this specification has
a column documenting the instance value of each IE.
When a GTPv2 message is encoded for use the instance value of each included IE
is encoded in the Instance field of the IE for the message scope. See clause 7
and clause 8.2 for details of that encoding.
An Information Element in an encoded GTPv2 message or encoded grouped IE is
identified by the pair of IE Type and Instance values and described by a
specific row in the corresponding tables in clauses of 7 in the present
document.
If several Information Elements with the same Type and Instance values are
included in an encoded GTPv2 message, they represent a list for the
corresponding IE name and row identified in the message grammar in clauses of
clause 7.
If several Information Elements with the same Type and Instance values are
included in an encoded grouped IE, they represent a list for the corresponding
IE name and row identified in the grouped IE grammar in clauses of clause 7.
In tables in this document the instance value for \"Private Extension\" is
marked as VS (Vendor Specific). While an instance value must be encoded by the
sender the value can be Vendor and even Private Extension specific.
The same IE name might be used in different messages (on the top level or
within grouped IEs) in this specification. The instance value and name of an
IE is only meaningful within the scope of the message definition . The
combination of Type value and Instance value uniquely identifies a specific
row in a message description table.
## 6.2 Message Granularity
The GTPv2-C messages shall be sent per UE on the S3, S10, S16 and N26
interfaces.
The GTPv2-C messages shall be sent per PDN-Connection on the S2a, S2b, S4,

# 7 GTP-C messages
## 7.1 Path Management Messages
### 7.1.0 General
Three path management messages are specified for GTP-C: Echo Request, Echo
Response and Version Not Supported Indication.
The usage of Echo Request / Response procedure is specified in 3GPP TS 23.007
[17].
### 7.1.1 Echo Request
Table 7.1.1-1 specifies the information elements included in the Echo Request
message.
The Recovery information element contains the local Restart Counter, which is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17])
The optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific
information.
Table 7.1.1-1: Information Elements in Echo Request
Information elements P Condition / Comment IE Type Ins.
* * *
Recovery M Recovery 0 Sending Node Features CO This IE shall be sent towards a
peer node on any GTPv2 interface if the sending node supports at least one
feature on this interface or if the sending node supports at least one feature
and does not know the interface type towards the peer node. This IE may be
present otherwise. Node Features 0 Private Extension O Private Extension VS
### 7.1.2 Echo Response
Table 7.1.2-1 specifies the information elements included in the Echo Response
message.
The Recovery information element contains the local Restart Counter, which is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17])
The optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific
information.
Table 7.1.2-1: Information Elements in Echo Response
Information elements P Condition / Comment IE Type Ins.
* * *
Recovery M Recovery 0 Sending Node Features CO This IE shall be sent towards a
peer node on any GTPv2 interface if the sending node supports at least one
feature on this interface or if the sending node supports at least one feature
and does not know the interface type towards the peer node. This IE may be
present otherwise. Node Features 0 Private Extension O Private Extension VS
NOTE: Having no Cause IE in the Echo Response message is an exceptional case
for a triggered message. Hence, a GTP entity that detects a GTP protocol
error, e.g Mandatory IE missing, in the Echo Request message, ignores the
IE(s) that are in error and sends Echo Response. In addition it can log the
error.
### 7.1.3 Version Not Supported Indication
This message contains only the GTPv2 header and indicates the latest GTP
version that the sending entity supports.
## 7.2 Tunnel Management Messages
### 7.2.0 General
A node shall include the Recovery information element if it is in contact with
the node\'s peer for the first time, or if the node or the node\'s peer has
restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been
indicated to the peer. The peer receiving the Recovery information element
shall handle it as when an Echo Response message is received but shall
consider the rest of the message in accordance with the message semantics and
parameters.
### 7.2.1 Create Session Request
The direction of this message shall be from MME/S4-SGSN to SGW and from SGW to
PGW, and from ePDG/TWAN to the PGW (see Table 6.1-1).

on S5/S8 interface (see sub-clauses 8.2 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45])
and on the S4 interface by the SGSN to the SGW as part of the procedures:
\- Routing Area Update with MME interaction and with SGW change

and on the S2b interface by the ePDG to the PGW as part of the procedures:
\- Initial Attach with GTP on S2b
\- UE initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with GTP on S2b
\- Handover to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with GTP on S2b (See sub-clause

[45])
\- Addition of an access using S2a of NBIFOM procedure as specified by 3GPP TS
23.161 [71].
If the new Create Session Request received by the SGW collides with an
existing active PDN connection context (the existing PDN connection context is
identified with the tuple [IMSI, EPS Bearer ID], where IMSI shall be replaced
by TAC and SNR part of ME Identity for emergency attached UE without UICC or
authenticated IMSI), this Create Session Request shall be treated as a request
for a new session. Before creating the new session, the SGW should delete:
\- the existing PDN connection context locally, if the Create Session Request
is received with the TEID set to zero in the header, or if it is received with
a TEID not set to zero in the header and it collides with the default bearer
of an existing PDN connection context;
\- the existing dedicated bearer context locally, if the Create Session
Request collides with an existing dedicated bearer context and the message is
received with a TEID not set to zero in the header.
In the former case, if the PGW S5/S8 IP address for control plane received in
the new Create Session Request is different from the PGW S5/S8 IP address for
control plane of the existing PDN connection, the SGW should also delete the
existing PDN connection in the corresponding PGW by sending a Delete Session
Request message.
NOTE 1: The SGW can send the Create Session Request and Delete Session Request
over S5/S8 asynchronously, e.g. the SGW can send the Delete Session Request
and then the Create Session Request without having to wait for the Delete
Session Response. It does not matter if the PGW happens to receive the Delete
Session Request after the Create Session Request since the PGW assigns a
different S5/S8 F-TEID for control plane to the new PDN connection.
If the new Create Session Request received by the PGW collides with an
existing PDN connection context (the existing PDN connection context is
identified with the triplet [IMSI, EPS Bearer ID, Interface type], where
applicable Interface type here is S2a TWAN GTP-C interface or S2b ePDG GTP-C
interface or S5/S8 SGW GTP-C interface, and where IMSI shall be replaced by
TAC and SNR part of ME Identity for emergency attached UE without UICC or
authenticated IMSI), this Create Session Request shall be treated as a request
for a new session. Before creating the new session, the PGW should delete:
\- the existing PDN connection context, if the Create Session Request collides
with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;
\- the existing dedicated bearer context, if the Create Session Request
collides with a dedicated bearer of an existing PDN connection context.
The PGW shall allocate a new PGW S5/S8 F-TEID for control plane to the new PDN
connection, i.e. not the same F-TEID value as the one which was assigned to
the existing PDN connection.
NOTE 2: With GTP based S2a and S2b, the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for specific
UE over S2a between the TWAN and PGW and over S2b between an ePDG and PGW are
independent of the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for the same UE over S5/S8 and may
overlap in value (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [45] clause 4.6.2).
NOTE 3: Only the TAC and SNR part of the ME Identity is used to identify an

### 7.2.5 Bearer Resource Command
A Bearer Resource Command message shall be sent from a MME to a SGW and
forwarded to PGW as a part of the **UE requested bearer resource allocation
procedure or UE requested bearer resource modification** procedure (which is
used also for a dedicated bearer deactivation or dedicated bearer activation),
as specified by 3GPP TS 24.301 [23].
The message shall also be sent on the S4 interface by a SGSN to a SGW and on
the S5/S8 interface by a SGW to a PGW as part of the MS initiated PDP Context
modification procedure, or secondary PDP context activation procedure.
The message shall also be sent on the S11/S4 interface by an MME/S4-SGSN to a
SGW and on the S5/S8 or S2a/S2b interface by a SGW or a TWAN/ePDG to a PGW as
part of the UE-initiated IP flow mobility procedure and the UE requested IP
flow mapping procedure, as specified by 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].
Table 7.2.5-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.

### 7.2.6 Bearer Resource Failure Indication
A Bearer Resource Failure Indication shall be sent by the PGW to an SGW and
forwarded to the MME to indicate failure of the **UE requested bearer resource
allocation procedure or UE requested bearer resource modification** procedure,
as specified by 3GPP TS 24.301 [23].
The message shall also be sent by a PGW to an SGW and forwarded to an SGSN as
part of the failure of an MS initiated PDP Context modification procedure or
secondary PDP context activation procedure.
The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 or S2a/S2b interface by a PGW to a
SGW or to a TWAN/ePDG and the S11/S4 interface by a SGW to an MME/S4-SGSN as
part of the UE-initiated IP flow mobility procedure and the UE requested IP
flow mapping procedure, as specified by 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].
Table 7.2.6-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.
Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:
  * \"Semantic error in the TAD operation\".
  * \"Syntactic error in the TAD operation\".
  * \"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\".
  * \"Syntactic errors in packet filter(s)\".
```{=html}
``` \- \"Collision with network initiated request\".
  * \"Service denied\".
\- \"Bearer handling not supported\".
\- \"UE context without TFT already activated\".

\- PGW Pause of Charging procedure
and on the S2b interface by the ePDG to the PGW as part of the procedures:
\- UE initiated IPsec tunnel update procedure
If the optional network triggered service restoration feature is supported by
the MME, SGSN and SGW, then the Modify Bearer Request message shall also be
sent as part of the network triggered service restoration procedure with ISR
during an intra MME TAU and an intra S4-SGSN RAU procedure for UEs that had
ISR active before either the MME or the S4-SGSN has restarted, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.007 [17]:
\- on the S11 interface by the MME to the SGW, if the MME detected that the
ISR associated S4-SGSN has restarted and UE performs a TAU procedure;
\- on the S4 interface by the S4-SGSN to the SGW, if the S4-SGSN detected that
the ISR associated MME has restarted and UE performs a RAU procedure.
This message can be used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers in the
SGW and in the PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [43] sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.3.2.1, 3GPP
TS 23.272 [21] sections 6.3, 6.5 and 7.4). A Modify Bearer Request used as an
implicit resume can contain zero or more IE(s), depending on the conditions of
presence of the IEs specified in table 7.2.7-1. The PGW should not consider a
Modify Bearer Request with zero IE as an error.
The Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases from
the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User CSG
Information or/and UE Time Zone which occured during a previous RAU procedure
without SGSN change but which has not been reported yet to the SGW/PGW, or to
indicate to the PGW that the UE is available for signalling if the PDN
connection is delay tolerant and if there is pending network initiated PDN
connection signalling:
\- during a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for the
corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U tunnel;
\- when the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC
frame serving as a paging response from a UE in GERAN with an existing S4-U
tunnel.
The Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases from
the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of User Location Information
which occured during a previous RAU procedure without SGSN change but which
has not been reported yet to the SGW/PGW, if the S4-SGSN is configured to
defer the reporting of ULI change until a RAB/user plane is established:
\- during a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for the
corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U tunnel;
\- when the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC
frame serving as a paging response for a UE in GERAN with an existing S4-U
tunnel.
NOTE 1: the S4-SGSN can alternatively send a Change Notification Request
message in the above cases, if no other information which requires the sending
of a Modify Bearer Request, needs to be reported to the PGW.
The Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent by the MME to the SGW/PGW
to report a change of Serving Network, User Location Information, User CSG
Information, UE Time Zone or/and RAT Type, when user data is transported in
NAS signalling, for a UE with an existing S11-U tunnel.
When requesting the PGW to pause or unpause charging for a PDN connection, the
SGW shall wait for the PGW acknowledgement (i.e. Modify Bearer Response)
before sending a new pause or unpause request.
NOTE 2: this ensures that the PGW always act per the most recent SGW request
in particular in scenarios where the SGW would need to request the PGW to
pause and unpause charging in a row (or vice-versa) and the Modify Bearer
Request messages would arrive out of order at the PGW.
Upon receipt of a request from the PGW/PCRF/OCS in a message other than Create
Bearer Request and Update Bearer Request to report changes of UE presence in
new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s), the MME/S4-SGSN shall immediately
send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change Notification Request message
to report to the PGW whether the UE is inside or outside the new or modified
Presence Reporting Area(s) or whether the Presence Reporting Area(s) is
inactive.
The MME/S4-SGSN shall also send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change
Notification Request message to report any subsequent change of UE presence in
the Presence Reporting Area, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS
23.060 [35].
If the Modify Bearer Request message is sent from the old MME/SGSN as part of
Tracking/Routeing Area Update procedure with SGW change and data forwarding as
specified in clause 5.3.3.1A of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], the old MME/SGSN shall
only include the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE.
NOTE 3: Since the UE has left the old MME/SGSN, some information related to
the UE, e.g. ULI, UE Time Zone, CSG, RAT Type in the old MME/SGSN are not
valid any more.
Upon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Presence
Reporting Area Information from the MME/S4-SGSN, the SGW shall send a Modify
Bearer Request message on the S5/S8 interface if any of the following
condition is met:
\- ISR is not active;
\- ISR is active, and the RAT Type has changed since last reported or the
CPRAI flag has been set to 1.
The MME shall increment the \"MO Exception data counter\" by one each time the
MME has received the RRC cause \"MO Exception data\". The MME may defer
sending a Modify Bearer Request message to report a non-zero value for the MO
Exception Data Counter based on local configuration.
Upon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Secondary
RAT Usage Data Report from the MME, the SGW shall send a Modify Bearer Request
message on the S5/S8 interface if the IRPGW flag is set to 1 in the Secondary
RAT Usage Data Report IE.

### 7.2.8 Modify Bearer Response
The Modify Bearer Response message shall be sent on the S11/S4 interfaces by
the SGW to the MME/S4-SGSN, on the S5/S8 interfaces by the PGW to the SGW and
on the S2b interface by the PGW to the ePDG as part of the procedures listed
for the Modify Bearer Request (see clause 7.2.7).
If the MME has sent the counter for the RRC Cause \"MO Exception data\" in the
Modify Bearer Resquest, the MME shall reset the counter value when receiving
the Modify Bearer Response message.
If handling of default bearer fails, then Cause at the message level shall be
a failure cause.
Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:
\- \"Request accepted\".
\- \"Request accepted partially\".
\- \"Context not found\".
\- \"Service not supported\".

The message shall also be sent on the S2b interface by the ePDG to the PGW as
part of procedures:
\- UE/ePDG Initiated Detach with GTP on S2b
\- UE Requested PDN Disconnection with GTP on S2b
\- HSS/AAA Initiated Detach with GTP on S2b
The message shall also be sent on the S2a interface by the TWAN to the PGW as
part of procedures:
\- UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/TWAN Requested PDN Disconnection in WLAN on
GTP S2a
\- HSS/AAA Initiated Detach in WLAN on GTP S2a
This message may also be sent on S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW:
\- If Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge message with Context not found
cause value is received.
During the detach procedure, if ISR is active and SGW receives a Delete
Session Request, the SGW shall deactivate the ISR.
NOTE: The SGW can determine if it is a detach procedure based on e.g. it
receives a Delete Session Request message for the last PDN Connection.
When ISR is active, during the Detach procedure the SGW shall forward the
Delete Session Request message to the PGW on the S5/S8 interface after
receiving both of the messages sent from the MME and the SGSN for the same PDN
Connection.
If there are any procedure collisions, the Delete Session Request shall have
precedence over any other Tunnel Management message.
During the handover procedure the Delete Session Request message shall not
release the indirect data forwarding tunnels.
Possible Cause values are:
\- \"ISR deactivation \".
\- \"Network Failure\".
\- \"QoS parameter mismatch\".

#### 7.2.9.2 Delete Bearer Request
The direction of this message shall be from PGW to SGW, from SGW to
MME/S4-SGSN and from PGW to TWAN/ePDG (see Table 6.1-1).
A Delete Bearer Request message shall be sent on the S5/S8 and S4/S11
interfaces as part of the following procedures:
\- PGW or MME initiated bearer deactivation procedures,
\- UE requested Bearer Resource Modification,
\- MS and SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure using S4 or
\- PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure using S4.
In the above cases, this Request is sent by the PGW to the SGW and shall be
forwarded to the MME or S4-SGSN.
The message shall also be sent on the S4/S11 interface by the SGW to the
SGSN/MME to delete the bearer resources on the other ISR associated CN node if
the ISRAI flag is not set in the Modify Bearer Request/Modify Access Bearers
Request message.
The message shall also be sent on the S4/S11 interface by the SGW to the
SGSN/MME to delete the bearer resources on the other ISR associated CN node in
the TAU/RAU/Handover procedures if the ISR related Cause IE is included in the
Delete Session Request message.
The message shall also be sent on the S2b interface by the PGW to the ePDG as
part of PGW Initiated Bearer Resource Allocation Deactivation procedure with
GTP on S2b.
The message shall also be sent on the S2a interface by the PGW to the TWAN as
part of the PGW Initiated Bearer Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN on
GTP on S2a procedure.
The message may also be sent on the S11/S4 interface by the SGW to the MME/S4
SGSN when the SGW receives the Error Indication from PGW for the default
bearer or the ICMP message from a PGW that indicates the UE specific error
indication as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].
The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 or S2a/S2b interface by the PGW to
the SGW or to the TWAN/ePDG and on the S11/S4 interface by the SGW to the
MME/S4-SGSN as part of the Network-initiated IP flow mobility procedure, as
specified by 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].
The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 interface by the PGW to the SGW,
as part of EPS to 5GS mobility without N26 interface, ePDG/EPC to 5GS
handover, EPS to 5GC/N3IWF handover, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [83].
If the UE uses NB-IoT, WB-EUTRAN or GERAN Extended Coverage with increased NAS
transmission delay (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [23] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]), the
MME/SGSN should proceed as specified for a UE in ECM-IDLE state with extended
idle mode DRX enabled in clause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].
Possible Cause values are:
\- \"RAT changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP\",
\- \"ISR deactivation\",
\- \"Access changed from Non-3GPP to 3GPP\",
\- \"Reactivation requested\",
\- \"PDN reconnection to this APN disallowed\",
\- \"PDN connection inactivity timer expires\",
\- \"Local release\",
\- \"Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed\",
\- \"EPS to 5GS Mobility\".

#### 7.2.11.3 Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication
A Downlink Data Notification Failure indication shall be sent from an MME/SGSN
to a SGW indicating that the UE did not respond to paging. It shall also be
sent in the case that the UE responded to the page with a Service Request but
that the MME has rejected the request by sending a Service Reject to the UE.
It may happen, for example, because the requested service is not supported or
there is a bearer context mismatch.
This message should not be used after an MME/SGSN successfully receives the
Service Request message from the UE in the Network Triggered Service Request
procedure as defined in the 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].
NOTE: Either the Modify Bearer Request message or the Delete Bearer Command
message is used by the MME/SGSN to indicate a possible failure case after an
MME/SGSN successfully receives the Service Request message from the UE.
Possible Cause values are:
  * \"UE not responding\".
  * \"Service denied\".
  * \"UE already re-attached\".
Table 7.2.11.3-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.

### 7.2.14 Modify Bearer Command and Failure Indication
#### 7.2.14.1 Modify Bearer Command
The Modify Bearer Command shall be sent on the S11 interface by the MME to the
SGW and on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW as part of the HSS
Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification procedure, or when the SQCI flag or the
PSCI flag is set to 1 in the Context Response message.
It shall also be sent on the S4 interface by the SGSN to the SGW and on the
S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW as part of the HSS Initiated subscribed
QoS modification procedure, or when the SQCI flag or the PSCI flag is set to 1
in the Context Response message.
When deferred reporting of subscription change procedure is homogenously
supported by MMEs and SGSNs in the serving network, the MME shall defer
sending Modify Bearer Command if the related UE is not reachable by the MME,
e.g. when the UE is suspended, when the UE has entered into power saving mode
or when the PPF is cleared in the MME, until the UE becomes reachable again as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].
NOTE: SGSNs do not defer the reporting of subscription change but need to
support reporting the subscription change when receiving the PSCI flag in the
Context Response message.
It shall also be sent on the S2a/S2b interface by the TWAN/ePDG to the PGW as
part of the HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification procedure.

### 7.2.16 Update Bearer Response
An Update Bearer Response shall be sent from a MME/SGSN to a SGW and forwarded
to the PGW, and from TWAN/ePDG to the PGW as a response to an Update Bearer
Request message.
Table 7.2.16-1 specifies the presence requirements and the conditions of the
IEs in the message.
Cause IE indicates if an EPS bearer has been modified in the
MME/SGSN/TWAN/ePDG or not. The EPS Bearer has not been modified in the
MME/SGSN/TWAN/ePDG if the Cause IE value differs from \"Request accepted\" or
\"Request accepted partially\". Possible Cause values are specified in Table
8.4-1. Message specific cause values are:
  * \"Request accepted\".
  * \"Request accepted partially\"
  * \"Context not found\"
  * \"Semantic error in the TFT operation\".
  * \"Syntactic error in the TFT operation\".
  * \"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\".
  * \"Syntactic errors in packet filter(s)\".

#### 7.2.17.2 Delete Bearer Failure Indication
A Delete Bearer Failure Indication shall be sent on the S5/S8 interface by the
PGW to the SGW and on the S11 interface by the SGW to the MME as part of
failure of eNodeB requested bearer release or **MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer
Deactivation** procedure.
The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 interface by the PGW to the SGW
and on the S4 interface by the SGW to the SGSN as part of failure of MS and
SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure using S4.
This message shall be sent back if none of the bearers (not even a single one)
included in the Delete Bearer Command message could be deleted.
The Cause IE indicates that the EPS bearer has not been deleted in the PGW.
When the SGW receives a Delete Bearer Failure Indication message from the PGW
with the TEID set to zero in the GTPv2 header and the Cause IE is set to
\"Context Not Found\", which implies that the PDN connection does not exist in
the PGW, the SGW may send a Delete Bearer Request message to delete the PDN
connection towards the MME/SGSN after sending the Delete Bearer Failure
Indication message.
Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:
  * \"Context not found\"

### 7.2.25 Modify Access Bearers Response
If an SGW supports the MABR feature (see clause 8.83), the SGW shall send a
Modify Access Bearers Response message on the S11 interface to an MME as a
response to a Modify Access Bearers Request message.
If handling of all default bearers to be modified fails, then Cause at the
message level shall be a failure cause.
Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:
\- \"Request accepted\".
\- \"Request accepted partially\".
\- \"Context not found\".
\- \"Service not supported\".
\- \"Modifications not limited to S1-U bearers\"
The SGW shall send the cause value \"Modifications not limited to S1-U
bearers\" if
  * it can not serve the MME Request without corresponding S5/S8 signalling other than to unpause charging in the PGW, or without corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over the S5/S8 interface, or
  * if there are suspended non-GBR bearers for that UE in the SGW (NOTE 3).
Upon receipt of that cause value, the MME shall repeat its request using
Modify Bearer Request message per PDN connection.
NOTE 1: This cause value is introduced for forward compatibility between an
MME implementing this version of the specification and an SGW implementing a
more recent version requiring the SGW to send S5/S8 signalling.
NOTE 2: During an Inter-MME Intra-SGW handover/TAU, if the SGW, PGW and the
old MME support the partial failure handling feature but the new MME doesn\'t,
the SGW needs to inform the PGW about the change of FQ-CSID (see clause 16.2.5
of 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]). If the SGW receives a Modify Access Bearers Request
from the new MME, it can force the MME to send individual Modify Bearer
Request message per PDN connection by returning the cause value
\"Modifications not limited to S1-U bearers\".
NOTE 3: There may be some suspended non-GBR bearers in the SGW during an
Inter-MME Intra-SGW Tracking Area Update without SGW Change when the UE is
coming back to E-UTRAN via a different MME than the MME serving the UE before
the CSFB or SRVCC call.

## 7.3 Mobility Management Messages
### 7.3.1 Forward Relocation Request
A Forward Relocation Request message shall be sent from:
\- the source MME to the target MME over the S10 interface as part of an
S1-based handover relocation procedure;
\- the source MME to the target SGSN, or from the source SGSN to the target
MME over the S3 interface as part of an Inter RAT handover and combined hard
handover and SRNS relocation procedures;
\- the source SGSN to the target SGSN over the S16 interface as part of an
SRNS Relocation and PS handover procedures;
\- the source MME to the target SGSN over the S3 interface as part of an SRVCC
from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support procedures and from the
source SGSN to the target SGSN over the S16 interface as part of SRVCC from
UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support;
\- the source MME to the target AMF, or from the source AMF to the target MME
over the N26 interface as part of the EPS to 5GS handover and 5GS to EPS
handover procedures.
A source MME/SGSN which supports CIoT knows whether the target MME/SGSN pool
or target AMF (5GS) supports some CIoT optimisations either by using DNS
procedures enhanced for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in clause
5.9 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32]. A source AMF knows whether the target MME pool
supports SGi Non-IP PDN connections either by using DNS procedures enhanced
for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in clause 5.9 of 3GPP TS
29.303 [32]. The target MME/SGSN may forward the Forward Relocation Request to
another MME/SGSN in the target MME/SGSN pool which is more suitable to serve
the UE, based on the information received in the Forward Relocation Request
message, e.g. required CIoT EPS optimisation(s) applicable to the given UE\'s
attachment.
NOTE 1: The source MME/SGSN/AMF does not need to know each individual CIoT
feature the target MME/SGSN pool or target AMF (5GS) supports. The source
MME/SGSN/AMF can behave as if the target MME/SGSN/AMF pool supports all CIoT
features when the target MME/SGSN pool is known to support CIoT; the source
MME/SGSN/AMF determines then which bearer contexts were successfully
transferred as specified in sunclause 7.3.2.
NOTE 2: Among the CIoT optimization features, only the support of SCEF Non-IP
PDN connection and the support of SGi Non-IP PDN connection are applicable to
a SGSN.
NOTE 3: 5GS supports Attach without PDU session. 5GS can also support
Unstructured and Ethernet PDU session types, which are assimilated to \"SGi
Non-IP PDN connections\" over N26.
Forward Relocation procedure across S10 interface (when K~ASME~ is taken into
use) shall be performed according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of
Security Procedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].
When the source MME/SGSN supports one or more of the CIoT optimization
features as specified in clause 8.125, the source MME/SGSN shall transfer EPS
bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN connections or for PDN connections to a
SCEF only if the target serving node is known to support SGi Non-IP PDN
connections or SCEF Non-IP PDN connections respectively, as specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.1 and 5.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]. Likewise, a source AMF shall
transfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN connections only if the
target MME is known to support SGi Non-IP PDN connections. The source
MME/SGSN/AMF shall not proceed with the Forward Relocation Request procedure
if the UE does not have any EPS bearer context(s) for SGi IP or Non-IP PDN
connections that can be transferred to the target serving node, i.e. under the
following conditions:
\- If the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN with only the PDN
connection(s) of PDN type \"non-IP\" through the SGW and the PGW, with or
without SCEF PDN connections, and the target serving node is known to not
support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection (as specified in clause 4.3.17.8.3.3 of 3GPP
TS 23.401 [3] and in clause 5.3.13.8 of 3GPP TS 23 060 [35]); or
\- If the UE is attached to the source AMF (5GS) with only PDU session(s) of
type \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\", and the target MME is known to not
support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection.
Table 7.3.1-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs in
the message.

### 7.3.2 Forward Relocation Response
A Forward Relocation Response message shall be sent as a response to Forward
Relocation Request during S1-based handover procedure, Inter RAT handover
procedures, SRNS Relocation procedure and PS handover procedures, EPS to 5GS
handover and 5GS to EPS handover procedures.
Based on the List of Set-up Bearers IE in the Forward Relocation Response, the
source MME/AMF shall determine whether the bearer contexts for SGi (IP or Non-
IP) PDN connections were successfully transferred to the target MME/AMF.
Based on the List of Set-up Bearers for SCEF PDN Connections IE in the Forward
Relocation Response, the source MME shall determine whether the bearer
contexts for SCEF PDN connections were successfully transferred to the target
MME, and initiate procedures to release the SCEF PDN connections which were
not successfully handed over.
Table 7.3.2-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs in
the message.
Cause IE indicates if the relocation has been accepted, or not. The relocation
has not been accepted by the target MME/SGSN/AMF if the Cause IE value differs
from \"Request accepted\". Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1.
Message specific cause values are:
\- \"Relocation failure\".

### 7.3.5 Context Request
The new MME/SGSN shall send the Context Request message to the old MME/SGSN on
S3/S16/S10 interface as a part of TAU/RAU procedure and UTRAN/GERAN to
E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC procedure to get the MM and EPS bearer Contexts for
the UE.
NOTE 1: During UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC procedure as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [43], the GUTI, RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and P-TMSI
Signature IE, are not received directly from the UE but from the MSC Server
over Sv interface.
The new MME shall send the Context Request message to the old AMF on N26
interface as a part of an 5GS to EPS Idle mode Mobility using N26 interface
procedure, to get the MM and EPS bearer Contexts for the UE.
The new AMF shall send the Context Request message to the old MME on N26
interface as a part of an EPS to 5GS Idle mode registration using N26
interface procedure, to get the MM and EPS bearer Contexts for the UE.
If the sending/new node is a MME, it shall include in the Context Request
message:
\- the GUTI IE and Complete TAU Request Message IE, if the GUTI or the
indication of mapped or native GUTI received from UE indicates the old node is
a MME, as specified in clause 2.8.2.2.2 and 2.10.2.1.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
\- the RAI IE and the P-TMSI IE, which are derived from the GUTI received from
UE, and the P-TMSI Signature that was received intact from the UE, if the GUTI
or the indication of mapped or native GUTI indicates the old node is an SGSN
as specified in clause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
If the sending/new node is an SGSN, it shall include RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and
P-TMSI Signature IE in the Context Request message. If the receiving/old node
is an MME, it shall construct GUTI according to the RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and
P-TMSI Signature IE (see the mapping relationship between RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
signature and GUTI defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]), and find UE context via
this GUTI.
If the sending/new node is an AMF, it shall include the GUTI IE, which is
derived from the 5G-GUTI received from UE, and the Complete TAU Request
Message IE in the Context Request message, if the AMF receives a mapped GUTI
from the UE, that is indication that the old node is an MME, as specified in
clause 2.10.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
If the receiving/old node is an AMF, it shall construct 5G-GUTI from the GUTI
IE (see the mapping relationship between GUTI and 5G-GUTI defined in 3GPP TS
23.003 [2]), and find UE context via this 5G-GUTI.
The new MME differentiates the type of the old node as specified in clause
2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]. If the old node is an SGSN, the GUTI shall be
mapped to RAI and P-TMSI by the new MME; if the old node is a MME, the new MME
include GUTI IE and Complete TAU Request Message IE in the Context Request
message. The Mapping between temporary and area identities is defined in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [2].
The Target PLMN ID IE shall be used in old SGSN/MME in order to decide whether
un-used authentication vectors to be distributed to new SGSN/MME/AMF or not.
Distribution and use of authentication vectors between different serving
network domains are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. The AMF shall not
transmit un-used authentication vectors to an MME and shall discard any un-
used authentication vectors received from an MME, regardless of whether the
MME and AMF pertain to the same or different serving network domains.

### 7.3.6 Context Response
A Context Response message shall be sent as a response to a previous Context
Request message, in the scenarios identified in clause 7.3.5.
Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:
\- \"IMSI/IMEI not known\"
\- \"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\"
> \- \"User authentication failed\"
>
> \- \"Target access restricted for the subscriber\"
Based on the subscription profile, when the access to the target RAT is
prohibited for the subscriber, the old MME/SGSN/AMF may reject the Context
Request message with the cause \"Target access restricted for the
subscriber\".
When the source MME/SGSN/AMF supports one or more of the CIoT optimization
features as indicated through the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE
specified in clause 8.125, and if the target node is a MME and the target MME
has not set the AWOPDN bit of the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE set
to 1 in the Context Request message as specified in clause 8.125, the source
MME/SGSN/AMF shall reject the Context Request with a cause value of \"Request
Rejected\" under the following conditions (conditions are mutually exclusive):
\- If the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN without any PDN connection

### 7.3.8 Identification Request
If the UE identifies itself with temporary identity and it has changed
SGSN/MME since detach in Attach procedure, the new MME/SGSN shall send an
Identification Request message to the old SGSN/MME/AMF over S3, S16, S10 or
N26 interface to request IMSI.
NOTE: The Identification Request procedure can be initiated over the N26
interface by an MME towards an AMF, but not from an AMF to an MME.
Table 7.3.8-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs in
the message.
If the sending/new node is a MME, it shall include in the Identification
Request message:
\- the GUTI IE and Complete Attach Request Message IE, if the GUTI or the
indication of mapped or native GUTI received from UE indicates the old node is
a MME, as specified in clause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
\- the RAI P-TMSI, which was derived from the GUTI received from UE, and the
P-TMSI Signature that was received intact from the UE, if the GUTI or the
indication of mapped or native GUTI indicates the old node is an SGSN as
specified in clause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
If the sending/new node is an SGSN, it shall include RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and
P-TMSI Signature IE in the Identification Request message. If the
receiving/old node is an MME, it shall construct GUTI according to the RAI IE,
P-TMSI IE and P-TMSI Signature IE (see the mapping relationship between RAI,
P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and GUTI defined in 3GPP TS23.003[2]), and find UE
context via this GUTI.
The new MME differentiates the type of the old node as specified in clause
2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]. If the old node is an SGSN, the GUTI shall be
mapped to RAI and P-TMSI by the new MME; if the old node is a MME, the new MME
include GUTI IE and Complete Attach Request Message IE in the Identification
Request message. The Mapping between temporary and area identities is defined
in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
The GUTI IE shall not coexist with any of the RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and P-TMSI
Signature IE in an Identification Request message. If this occurs, the
receiving node shall return a corresponding cause value in the response
message.
The Target PLMN ID IE shall be used in old SGSN/MME in order to decide whether
un-used authentication vectors to be distributed to new SGSN/MME or not.
Distribution and use of authentication vectors between different serving
network domains are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].
If the receiving/old node is an AMF, it shall construct the 5G-GUTI from the
GUTI IE (see the mapping relationship between GUTI and 5G-GUTI defined in
clause 2.10 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]), and find UE context via this 5G-GUTI.

message, the SGSN shall include the old IP address of the received message in
this optional parameter if this IE is not present and relay the message to the
old SGSN. IP Address 0 UDP Source Port Number C If an SGSN within the same
SGSN pool as the old SGSN receives this message, the SGSN shall include the
UDP Source Port number of the received message in this parameter if this IE is
not present and relay the message to the old SGSN. The old SGSN shall use this
UDP port as the UDP destination port of the Identification Response message.
Port Number 0 Hop Counter O If an SGSN within the same SGSN pool with the old
SGSN receives this message, the SGSN shall decrement the Hop Counter if this
IE is present in the received message; otherwise, the SGSN may include a Hop
Counter with a value of max-1, and may relay the message to the old SGSN. Hop

present in the Routeing Area Identity (RAI) IE.
### 7.3.9 Identification Response
The old SGSN/MME/AMF shall send an Identification Response message to the new
MME/SGSN as a response to a previous Identification Request message over
S3/S10/S16/N26 interface.
Table 7.3.9-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs in
the message.
For Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes, if an old SGSN
within an SGSN pool receives an Identification Request message that contains
the optional parameter Address for Control Plane, the old SGSN shall use this
address as destination IP address of the Identification Response message.
Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:
  * \"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\"
  * \"User authentication failed\"
Only the Cause information element shall be included in the response if the
Cause contains another value than \"Request accepted\".

### 7.3.10 Forward Access Context Notification
A Forward Access Context Notification message shall be sent from the Old SGSN
to the New SGSN over the S16 interface to forward the RNC contexts to the
target system, or sent from the Old MME to the New MME over the S10 interface
to forward the RNC/eNodeB contexts to the target system.
When the old SGSN receives the RANAP message Forward SRNS Context, the old
SGSN shall send a Forward Access Context Notification message to the new SGSN.
The new SGSN shall forward the message to the target RNC using the
corresponding RANAP message.
When the old SGSN receives a BSSGP message PS handover Required and the
acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for the Bearer Context or when
\"delivery order\" is set in the Bearer Context QoS profile, the old SGSN

### 7.3.12 Detach Notification
A Detach Notification message shall be sent from an MME to the associated
SGSN, or from an SGSN to the associated MME as a part of Detach procedure if
the ISR is activated between the MME and SGSN for the UE.
Possible Cause values are:
  * \"Local Detach\".
  * \"Complete Detach\".
A Detach Notification message shall also be sent from an SGSN to the
associated MME as a part of Detach procedure if the ISR is activated between
the MME and SGSN for the UE.
Possible Cause values are:
  * \"IMSI Detach only\".
\"Local Detach\" indicates that this detach is local to the MME/SGSN and so
the associated SGSN/MME registration where the ISR is activated shall not be
detached. The MME/SGSN that receives this message including this Cause value
of \"Local Detach\" only deactivates the ISR. This Cause value shall be
included in the procedures:
  * MME/SGSN-initiated Detach Procedure in case of implicit detach.
\"Complete Detach\" indicates both the MME registration and the SGSN
registration that the ISR is activated for, shall be detached. This \"Complete
Detach\" Cause value shall be included in the procedures:
  * UE-initiated Detach Procedure.
  * MME/SGSN-initiated Detach Procedure in case of explicit detach.
For the purpose of SGs handling, the SGSN shall include Detach Type in the
Detach Notification message for \"Complete Detach\" when the UE is combined
IMSI/EPS attached and the ISR is activated.
Possible Detach Type values are:
  * \"PS Detach\".
  * \"Combined PS/CS Detach\".
\"PS Detach\" indicates that the MME shall perform explicit IMSI detach from
EPS service as specified in section 5.4, 3GPP TS 29.118 [22]. \"Combined PS/CS
detach\" indicates that the MME shall perform explicit IMSI detach from non-
EPS service as specified in section 5.5, 3GPP TS 29.118 [22].
\"IMSI Detach only\" indicates that combined IMSI/EPS attached UE initiates
IMSI only GPRS detach from non-GPRS service as specified in section 4.7.4.1,
3GPP TS 24.008 [5], and both the SGSN/MME registration shall be remained. The
MME shall perform explicit IMSI detach from non-EPS service for the SGs
handling purpose, which is specified in section 5.5, 3GPP TS 29.118 [22]. This
\"IMSI Detach only\" Cause value shall be included in the procedures:
  * UE-initiated Detach Procedure for GERAN/UTRAN for \"IMSI Detach only\".

### 7.3.14 Change Notification Request
3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] specify that if PGW has requested
ECGI/eNodeB ID/TAI/CGI/SAI/RAI Change Reporting or reporting of change of UE
presence in Presence Reporting Area(s) or User CSG information Change
Reporting and if MME/S4-SGSN supports the feature, then MME/S4-SGSN shall send
the Change Notification Request message on the S11/S4 interface to the SGW. If
SGW supports the feature, the SGW forwards the message on the GTP based S5/S8
interface to the PGW as part of location dependent charging related
procedures.
In this version of the specification, the sender shall set the header TEID
value to that of the peer node\'s Control Plane TEID on S11/S4 interface or to
the peer node\'s Control Plane TEID on S5/S8 interface. However a receiver
shall be prepared to receive messages in which the header TEID value is set to
zero from implementation conforming to earlier versions of this specification.
When that is the case, the receiver identifies the subscriber context based on
the included LBI, IMSI, and/or MEI IEs.
The MME shall increment the \"MO Exception Data Counter\" by one each time the
MME has received the RRC cause \"MO Exception data\". The MME may defer
sending a Change Notification Request message to report a non-zero value for
the \"MO Exception Data Counter\" based on local configuration.
If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting and if PDN GW
Secondary RAT reporting is active, the MME shall send the Change Notification
Request message and include \"Secondary RAT Usage Data Report\" on the S11
interface to the SGW when it has received Secondary RAT usage data from the
eNodeB in the following procedures, regardless of whether ULI shall be
reported or not:
  * Connection Suspend
  * eNodeB initiated S1 release
  * E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT handover
  * E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT handover
  * MME triggered Serving GW relocation
  * MME to 3G SGSN combined hard handover and SRNS relocation
  * The MME may also send the send the Change Notification Request message and include \"Secondary RAT Usage Data Report\" on the S11 interface to the SGW when it has received periodic reporting of Secondary RAT usage data from eNodeB or as part of an MME initiated S1 release from the eNodeB, as described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] clause 5.7A. The SGW shall forward the \"Secondary RAT Usage Data Report\" to the PGW if the IRPGW flag is set to \"1\".

### 7.3.15 Change Notification Response
The Change Notification Response message may be sent on the S11/S4 interface
by the SGW to the MME/SGSN and is sent on the S5/S8 interface by the PGW to
the SGW as part of location dependent charging related procedures to
acknowledge the receipt of a Change Notification Request.
If SGW does not support the feature (see clause 7.3.14 \"Change Notification
Request\"), SGW may silently discard Change Notification Request message from
MME/SGSN. If the MME/ SGSN does not receive Change Notification Response, the
MME/SGSN may either send Change Notification Request to the same SGW next time
UE location changes, or not (marking SGW as not supporting the feature).
The Cause value indicates whether or not the Change Notification Request was
received correctly. Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1.
Message specific cause values are:
  * \"Request accepted\".
  * \"Request accepted partially\".
  * \"IMSI/IMEI not known\".
In this version of the specification, the sender shall set the header TEID
value to that of the peer node\'s Control Plane TEID on S11/S4 interface or to
the peer node\'s Control Plane TEID on S5/S8 interface. However a receiver
shall be prepared to receive messages in which the header TEID value is set to
zero from implementation conforming to earlier versions of this specification.
When that is the case, the receiver identifies the subscriber context based on
the included LBI, IMSI, and/or MEI IEs.
If the IMSI is unknown, or the IMEI is unknown when the UE is emergency
attached and UICCless or the UE is emergency attached but the IMSI is not
authenticated for the receiving GTP-C entity, then the message shall be
silently discarded and no further processing of the IEs shall continue.
If the MME/SGSN receives Change Notification Response containing a Cause value
of \"IMSI/IMEI not known\" and CS bit set to 1, this indicates that the
associated PDN connection does not exist within the PGW. The Change Reporting
mechanism shall be stopped in the receiving SGSN/MME for all Bearers of the
associated PDN connection. The SGSN/MME shall then initiate PDN disconnection
for all of these PDN Connections.
If the PDN Connection associated of the Change Notification Request message
received by the SGW does not exist within the SGW, the SGW shall return Change
Notification Response with the CS bit set to 0 to the MME/SGSN. The Change
Reporting mechanism shall be stopped in the receiving SGSN/MME for all Bearers
of the associated PDN connection, and the MME/SGSN shall then locally delete
the PDN connection and release all associated resources.
If the location Change Reporting mechanism is to be stopped or modified for
this subscriber in the SGSN/MME, then the PGW shall include the Change
Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action field
appropriately.
If the MME has sent the \"MO Exception Data Counter\" for the RRC Cause \"MO
Exception data\" in the Change Notification Resquest, the MME shall reset the
counter value when receiving the Change Notification Response message.

### 7.4.3 Resume Notification
The Resume Notification message should be sent on the S11 interface by the MME
to the SGW and forwarded on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW as part
of the resume procedure returning back to E-UTRAN in the case of CS fallback
or SRVCC.
The Resume Notification message should also be sent on the S4 interface by the
SGSN to the SGW and forwarded on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW as
part of the resume procedure returning from SRVCC to HSPA if there is no
Modify Bearer Request message sent to the SGW and PGW as specified in 3GPP TS
23.216 [43].
The SGW may also send a Resume Notification message to the PGW on the S5/S8
interface upon receipt from the MME/S4-SGSN of a (non-empty) Modify Bearer
Request used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers in the SGW and in
the PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [43] sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.3.2.1, 3GPP TS 23.272
[21] sections 6.3, 6.5 and 7.4) if the conditions of presence of the IEs in
the Modify Bearer Request specified in table 7.2.7-1 do not require any IE to
be sent over S5/S8 to the PGW.
NOTE: This is an alternative to sending over S5/S8 a Modify Bearer Request
used as an implicit resume with zero IE(s), see clause 7.2.7.
After receiving a Resume Notification message or a Modify Bearer Request used
as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers, the SGW/PGW clears suspended
status for all the non-GBR bearers. The PGW shall forward packets it receives
for the UE. If the suspended bearers are of the type S4-U GTP-U, the SGW shall
forward over the S4-U interface, packets it receives for the UE, upon receipt
of Resume Notification.
Table 7.4.3-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs in

IEs in the message.
The Cause value indicates if Data Forwarding Resources has been created in the
Serving GW or not. Data Forwarding Resources have not been created in the

## 7.6 Reliable Delivery of Signalling Messages
Retransmission requirements in the current clause do not apply to the Initial
messages that do not have Triggered messages.
Reliable delivery in GTPv2 messages is accomplished by retransmission of these
messages. A message shall be retransmitted if and only if a reply is expected
for that message and the reply has not yet been received. There may be limits
placed on the total number of retransmissions to avoid network overload.
Initial messages and their Triggered messages, as well as Triggered messages
and their Triggered Reply messages are matched based on the Sequence Number
and the IP address and port rules in clause 4.2 \"Protocol stack\". Therefore,
an Initial message and its Triggered message, as well as a Triggered message
and its Triggered Reply message shall have exactly the same Sequence Number
value. A retransmitted GTPv2 message (an Initial or a Triggered) has the exact
same GTPv2 message content, including the GTP header, UDP ports, source and
destination IP addresses as the originally transmitted GTPv2 message.
For each triplet of local IP address, local UDP port and remote peer\'s IP
address a GTP entity maintains a sending queue with signalling messages to be
sent to that peer. The message at the front of the queue shall be sent with a
Sequence Number, and if the message has an expected reply, it shall be held in
a list until a reply is received or until the GTP entity has ceased
retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique for each
outstanding Initial message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint. A node
running GTP may have several outstanding messages waiting for replies. Not
counting retransmissions, a single GTP message with an expected reply shall be
answered with a single GTP reply, regardless whether it is per UE, per APN, or
per bearer
A piggybacked initial message (such as a Create Bearer Request message or
Modify Bearer Request message) shall contain a Sequence Number that is
assigned by sending GTP entity and the message shall be held in a list until a
response is received. The response message to a piggybacked initial message
may arrive without piggybacking (e.g., Create Bearer Response at PGW).
The Sequence Number in the GTP header of the triggered response message shall
be copied from the respective request message.
If a request message (e.g., Create Session Request) triggers piggybacking
(i.e., Create Bearer Request piggybacked on Create Session Response), re-
transmission of the request message shall also trigger piggybacking. A
Sequence Number used for a Command message shall have the most significant bit
set to 1. A Sequence Number in a message, which was triggered by a Command
message, as well as respective Triggered Reply message shall have the same
Sequence Number as the Command message (i.e. shall also have the most
significant bit set to 1). This setting of the most significant bit of the
Sequence Number is done to avoid potential clashes between the Sequence Number
selected for a Command message, and the Sequence Number selected by a GTPv2
peer for a Request message, which was not triggered by a Command message.
A Sequence Number used for a Request message, which was not triggered by a
Command message shall have the most significant bit set to 0.
A timer, denoted T3-RESPONSE, shall be started when a signalling message (for
which a reply is expected) is sent. A signalling message or the triggered
message has probably been lost if a reply has not been received before the
T3-RESPONSE timer expires.
Once the T3-RESPONSE timer expires, the message corresponding to the
T3-RESPONSE timer is then retransmitted if the total number of retry attempts
is less than N3‑REQUESTS times. The expiry of the timer for piggybacked
request messages shall result in re-transmission of the original IP/UDP packet
containing both the triggered response message and the piggybacked initial
message. T3-RESPONSE timer and N3‑REQUESTS counter setting is implementation
dependent. That is, the timers and counters may be configurable per procedure.
Multileg communications (e.g. Create Session Requests and Responses) however
require longer timer values and possibly a higher number of retransmission
attempts compared to single leg communication.
All received GTPv2 messages with an expected reply shall be replied to and all
reply messages associated with a certain message shall always include the same
information. Duplicated reply messages shall be discarded by the receiver
unless the reply needs a reply. A received reply message without a matching
outstanding message that is waiting for a reply should be discarded.
If a GTPv2 node is not successful with the transfer of a non-Echo signalling
message, e.g. a Create Bearer Request message, it shall inform the upper layer
of the unsuccessful transfer so that the controlling upper entity may take the
necessary measures.
NOTE: At failure of sending a GTPv2 message after retransmissions, some
information included in the message may be lost, e.g. Secondary RAT data usage
report.
## 7.7 Error Handling
### 7.7.0 Handling Piggybacked Messages
For piggybacked initial messages, the following general rule shall apply: the
triggered response message carrying the piggybacked message shall be processed
first, according to the following sections. Subsequently, the piggybacked
initial message shall be processed independently. If the processing of
dedicated bearer activation message results in an error, this shall not affect
the default bearer establishment. If the default bearer establishment fails,
the dedicated bearer activation related message shall be discarded.
### 7.7.1 Protocol Errors
A protocol error is defined as a message or an Information Element received
from a peer entity with unknown type, or if it is unexpected, or if it has an
erroneous content.
The term silently discarded is used in the following clauses to mean that the
receiving GTP entity\'s implementation shall discard such a message without
further processing, or that the receiving GTP entity discards such an IE and
continues processing the message. The conditions for the receiving GTP entity
to silently discard an IE are specified in the subsequent clauses.
The handling of unknown, unexpected or erroneous GTP messages and IEs shall
provide for the forward compatibility of GTP. Therefore, the sending GTP
entity shall be able to safely include in a message a new conditional-optional
or an optional IE. Such an IE may also have a new type value. Any legacy
receiving GTP entity shall, however, silently discard such an IE and continue
processing the message.
If a protocol error is detected by the receiving GTP entity, it should log the
event including the erroneous message and may include the error in a
statistical counter.
For Request messages and Response messages without a rejection Cause value,
the following applies:
\- An information element with \"Mandatory\" in the \"Presence requirement\"
column of a message definition shall always be present in that message.
\- An information element with \"Conditional\" in the \"Presence requirement\"
column of a message definition shall be sent when the conditions detailed in
the \"Condition / Comment\" column are met.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see clause 6.1.1.
The Version Not Supported Indication message shall be considered as a
Triggered message as specified in clause 4.2.5 \"Messages with GTPv2 defined
replies: Classification of Initial and Triggered Messages\".
The receiving GTP entity shall apply the error handling specified in the
subsequent clauses in decreasing priority.
If the received erroneous message is a reply to an outstanding GTP message,
the GTP transaction layer shall stop retransmissions and notify the GTP
application layer of the error even if the reply is silently discarded.
### 7.7.2 Different GTP Versions
If a GTPv2 entity receives a message of an unsupported GTP version, higher
than GTPv2, it shall return a Version Not Supported Indication message and
silently discard the received message.
If a GTPv2 entity listens to the GTPv0 port, the entity shall silently discard
any received GTPv0 message.
If a GTPv2 entity does not support GTPv1 and receives a GTPv1 message, it
shall silently discard the received message.
### 7.7.3 GTP Message of Invalid Length
If a GTP entity receives a message, which is too short to contain the
respective GTPv2 header, the GTP-PDU shall be silently discarded.
Apart from a piggybacked GTP message or an Echo Request message, if a GTP
entity receives a Request message within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is
inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of the GTP header,
then the receiving GTP entity should log the error and shall send the Response
message with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid Length\".
Apart from a piggybacked GTP message, if a GTP entity receives a Response
message within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is inconsistent with the
value specified in the Length field of the GTP header, then the receiving GTP
entity should log the error and shall silently discard the message.
If a GTP entity receives two GTP messages (triggered response message and a
piggybacked initial message) within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is
inconsistent with the total length of the two concatenated messages as
indicated by Length fields of the GTP headers, then the receiving GTP entity
should log the error and return an appropriate Response message with Cause IE
value set to \"Invalid overall length of the triggered response message and a
piggybacked initial message\". That is:
\- for a Create Session Response message together with a piggybacked Create
Bearer Request message, a Create Bearer Response message should be returned
with the above Cause value.
\- for a Create Bearer Response message together with a piggybacked Modify
Bearer Request message, a Modify Bearer Response message should be returned
with the above Cause value.
### 7.7.4 Unknown GTP Message
If a GTP entity receives a message with an unknown Message Type value, it
shall silently discard the message.
### 7.7.5 Unexpected GTP Message
If a GTP entity receives an unexpected initial message (see clause 4.2
\"Protocol stack\"), for example a known message that is sent over an
interface for which the message is not defined, or a message that is sent over
an interface for which the message is defined, but the direction is incorrect,
then the GTP entity shall silently discard the message and shall log an error.
If a GTP entity receives an unexpected triggered message which is not a
request message (see clause 4.2 \"Protocol stack\"), for example a message for
which there is no corresponding outstanding request, it shall discard the
message and may log an error.
When a GTP entity receives an unexpected triggered message, which is a request
message, triggered by a command message, i.e. the MSB of the sequence number
is set \"1\", e.g. in Create/Update/Delete Bearer Request messages, the GTP
entity may continue to handle the request, e.g. to accept the Delete Bearer
Request message.
NOTE: Whether to accept or reject such a message is implementation specific.
### 7.7.6 Missing Information Elements
A GTP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Request message. Apart from Echo Request message, if one or more mandatory
information elements are missing in the received Request message, the GTP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to \"Mandatory IE missing\" together with the type and instance of
the missing mandatory IE.
If a GTP entity receives a Response message with Cause IE value set to
\"Mandatory IE missing\", it shall notify its upper layer.
A GTP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Response message without a rejection Cause value. If one or more mandatory
information elements are missing, the GTP entity shall notify the upper layer
and should log the error.
A GTP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Request message, if possible (i.e. if the receiving entity has
sufficient information available to check if the respective conditions were
met). If one or more conditional information elements are missing, a GTP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to \"Conditional IE missing\" together with the type and instance of
the missing conditional IE.
A GTP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Response message without a rejection Cause value, if possible
(i.e. if the receiving entity has sufficient information available to check if
the respective conditions were met). If one or more conditional information
elements are missing, a GTP entity shall notify the upper layer and should log
the error.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see clause 6.1.1.
If the Indication IE is applicable for the message as a conditional IE and if
it is not present, the GTP entity shall not reject the message unless there
are other reasons to reject the message.
If the Indication IE is applicable for the message as conditional IE and if it
is present with the value of all the applicable flags set to \"0\", the GTP
entity shall not reject the message unless there are other reasons to reject
the message.
Absence of an optional information element shall not trigger any of the error
handling processes.
### 7.7.7 Invalid Length Information Element
An information element has invalid length when the actual length of the IE is
different from the value of the Length field in the IE header. Here, the
actual length of the IE means the length of the content field of the received
IE.
If a GTP message contains more than one information elements and one or more
of them have invalid length, the receiving GTP entity can detect which of the
IEs have invalid length only in the following cases:
\- If the Length value in the IE header is greater than the overall length of
the message;
\- If the invalid length IE is the last one in the message.
Apart from Echo Request message, if a receiving GTP entity detects information
element with invalid length in a Request message, it shall send an appropriate
error response with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid length\" together with the
type and instance of the offending IE.
Other Length field handling cases are specified below:
\- If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
fixed length IE are consistent, but the length is greater than that expected
by the fixed number of octets, then the extra octets shall be discarded.
\- If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
fixed length IE are consistent, but the length is less than that expected by
the fixed number of octets, this shall be considered an error, IE shall be
discarded and if the IE was received as a Mandatory IE or a verifiable
Conditional IE in a Request message, an appropriate error response with Cause
IE value set to \"Invalid length\" together with the type and instance of the
offending IE shall be returned to the sender.
\- If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
extendable length IE are consistent, but the length is greater than that
expected by the fixed number of octets preceding the extended field(s), then
the extra unknown octets shall be discarded.
\- If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
extendable length IE are consistent, but the length is less than the number of
fixed octets defined for that IE, preceding the extended field(s), this shall
be considered an error, IE shall be discarded and if the IE was received as a
Mandatory IE or a verifiable Conditional IE in a Request message, an
appropriate error response with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid length\"
together with the type and instance of the offending IE shall be returned to
the sender. Please refer to Table 8.1-1 for determining the number of fixed
octets of an IE.
### 7.7.8 Semantically incorrect Information Element
Apart from Echo Request message, the receiver of a GTP signalling message
Request including a mandatory or a verifiable conditional information element
with a semantically invalid Value shall discard the request, should log the
error, and shall send a response with Cause set to \"Mandatory IE incorrect\"
together with a type and instance of the offending IE.
The receiver of a GTP signalling message Response including a mandatory or a
verifiable conditional information element with a semantically invalid Value
shall notify the upper layer that a message with this sequence number has been
received and should log the error.
If a GTP entity receives an information element with a value which is shown as
reserved, it shall treat that information element as invalid and should log
the error. If the invalid IE is received in a Request, and it is a mandatory
IE or a verifiable conditional IE, the GTP entity shall send a response with
Cause set to \"Mandatory IE incorrect \" together with a type and instance of
the offending IE.
The principle is: the use of reserved values invokes error handling; the use
of spare values can be silently discarded and so in the case of IEs with spare
values used, processing shall be continued ignoring the spare values.
The receiver of a GTP signalling message including an optional information
element with a Value that is not in the range defined for this information
element value shall discard this IE, but shall treat the rest of the message
as if this IE was absent and continue processing. The receiver shall not check
the content of an information element field that is defined as \'spare\".
All semantically incorrect optional information elements in a GTP signalling
message shall be treated as not present in the message.
### 7.7.9 Unknown or unexpected Information Element
The receiver of a GTP message including an unexpected information element with
known Type value, but with the instance value that is not defined for this
message shall discard the IE and log an error. The receiver shall process the
message.
An information element with a Type value which is defined in section 8.1 of
the present specification but whose Instance Value is not expected in the
received GTP signalling message according to the grammar defined in section 7
of the present specification shall be silently discarded (skipped) and the
rest of the message processed as if this information element was not present.
NOTE: An Information Element in an encoded GTPv2 message or grouped IE is
identified by the pair of IE Type and Instance value.
### 7.7.10 Repeated Information Elements
An Information Element is repeated if there is more than one IE with the same
IE Type and Instance in the scope of the GTP message (scope of the grouped
IE). Such an IE is a member in a list.
If an information element is repeated in a GTP signalling message in which
repetition of the information element is not specified, only the contents of

## 7.10 Fallback to GTPv1 mechanism
An EPC entity shall assume that each GTP processing node that it is about to
communicate with is GTPv2 capable. Before the first GTP tunnel is setup for a
given UE/node, the EPC node shall always send a version 2 (GTPv2) message to a
peer node. As an exception, during an inter-SGSN handover, even if the target
SGSN is GTPv2 capable, the source SGSN shall send a GTPv1 message \"Forward
Relocation Request\" to the target SGSN if the PDP Context(s) for this UE were
established to GGSN(s), or if there is no active PDP context and the source or
target SGSN does not support SRNS relocation w/o PDN connection over GTPv2
(see clause 7.3.1).
A GTPv2 entity shall fallback to GTPv1 only if either a \"Version Not
Supported\" message in GTPv1 format as specified in 3GPP TS 29.060 [4] is
received from the peer node (this indicates that the peer GTP entity does not
support GTPv2), or if a GTPv2 message is received with Cause value \"Fallback
to GTPv1\".
If a GTPv1 \"Version Not Supported\" message in received, a GTPv2 entity may
fallback to GTPv1. 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] (see annex D) and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35]
specify GTP version usage during the mobility between a UTRAN/GERAN and an
E-UTRAN.
A GTPv2 entity may receive a GTPv2 message with a Cause value \"Fallback to
GTPv1\" in the following cases:
\- an S4 SGSN receives the Cause code \"Fallback to GTPv1\" in a GTPv2 Context
Response message over S16 interface. When an UE has activated a PDP context
via S4 SGSN to GGSN and inter-SGSN RAU is underway, the old S4 SGSN shall
include the Cause value \"Fallback to GTPv1\" in a GTPv2 Context Response
message over S16 interface. In this case, the new S4 SGSN shall abort the
ongoing GTPv2 procedure and send a GTPv1 \"SGSN Context Request\" message to
the old S4 SGSN. The fallback to GTPv1 is performed only for this UE in the
current procedure.
\- an MME receives the Cause code \"Fallback to GTPv1\" in a GTPv2 Context
Response message over the S3 interface. When an UE has active PDP context(s)
via an S4 SGSN and a TAU is underway, the old S4 SGSN may include the Cause
value \"Fallback to GTPv1\" in a GTPv2 Context Response message over the S3
interface. In this case, the MME shall abort the ongoing GTPv2 procedure and
should send a GTPv1 \"SGSN Context Request\" message to the old S4 SGSN. The
fallback to GTPv1 is performed only for this UE.
Fallback to GTPv1 shall not occur on already established GTP tunnels without
change of the peer nodes of the communication bearer.
## 7.11 Fallback to GTPv0
Fallback from GTPv2 to GTPv0 shall not be supported. Therefore, GTPv2 entity
should not listen to the well-known GTPv0 port 3386.
## 7.12 Trace Management Messages
### 7.12.1 Trace Session Activation
The Trace Session Activation message shall be sent on S11/S4 by the MME/SGSN
to the SGW, on S2a/S2b by the TWAN/ePDG to the PGW, and on S5/S8 by the SGW to
the PGW when session trace is activated for a particular IMSI or IMEI for a UE

# 8 GTP-C Information Elements
## 8.1 Information Element Types
A GTP control plane (signalling) message may contain several information
elements. In order to have forward compatible type definitions for the GTPv2
information elements, all of them shall be TLIV (Type, Length, Instance,
Value) coded. GTPv2 information element type values are specified in the Table
8.1-1. The last column of this table indicates whether the information element
is:
\- Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of
octets.
\- Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable
number of octets.\ For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to \"5
to (n+4)\". In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then
the last field is not present.
\- Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable
number of octets.\ The last fields are typically specified with the statement:
\"These octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified\". The legacy
receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.
In order to improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, it is recommended that
the information elements should be arranged in the signalling messages as well
as in the grouped IEs, according to the order the information elements are
listed in the message definition table or grouped IE definition table in
section 7. However the receiving entity shall be prepared to handle the
messages with information elements in any order.
Within information elements, certain fields may be described as spare. These
bits shall be transmitted with the value set to 0. To allow for future
features, the receiver shall not evaluate these bits. GTPv2-C information
elements that have similar semantics in GTPv1-C shall be converted into
GTPv1-C format, as specified in TS 29.060 [4], before sending them to a pre-R8
GSN.

Figure 8.2-1: Information Element Format
An IE has the following mandatory fields:
\- Type field: This field indicates the type of Information Element. The valid
values of the IE type are defined in clause 8.1.
\- Length: This field contains the length of the information element excluding
the first four octets, which are common for all information elements (Type,
Length and the contents of octet 4) and is denoted \"n\" in Figure 8.2-1. For
all the length fields, bit 8 of the lowest numbered octet is the most
significant bit and bit 1 of the highest numbered octet is the least
significant bit.
\- Instance: This field shall be used to differentiate amongst different
parameters in one specific message which use the same information element type
(see also clause 6.1.3 \"Information Element Instance\").
An IE is said to be TLIV (Type, Length, Instance, Value) encoded.
### 8.2.1A Information Element with an IE Type Extension field
Figure 8.2.1A-1 depicts the format of an information element with an IE Type
Extension field.

Figure 8.2.1A-1: Information Element with an IE Type Extension field
The IE Type in octet 1 of an information element with an IE Type Extension
field shall be set to 254. Such IE shall be further identified by the value
encoded in the IE Type Extension field in octets 5 and 6.
The value of the IE Type Extension shall be encoded in full hexadecimal
representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) from 256 up to 65535. This field
indicates the type of the Information Element and the valid values of the IE
type Extension field are defined in clause 8.1.
The semantics of the Length and Instance field remain the same as specified in
clause 8.2.1.
### 8.2.2 Handling ASN.1/PER encoded parameters
During the TAU/RAU/HO procedures MME/S4-SGSN GTPv2 entities send some of the
RANAP/S1AP/BSSGP parameters to a GTPv2 peer. Copying of the BSSGP parameters
into GTPv2 IEs is straightforward. RANAP and S1AP, however, use ASN.1/PER
encoding, which is different from GTPv2 specific TLV encoding.
Transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP parameters across GTPv2 interfaces:
  * a GTPv2 entity shall transparently copy the respective information into one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE as specified in Annex B and clause 8.48. With this approach, GTPv2 will not be impacted if the contents of such RANAP/S1AP parameter changes over the time.
Non-transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP parameters across GTPv2 interfaces:
\- GTPv2 entity decodes ASN.1/PER parameter and shall encode the value(s) into
one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE according to what is specified in the
present document.
## 8.3 International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is transferred via GTP
tunnels. The sending entity copies the value part of the IMSI into the Value
field of the IMSI IE. IMSI is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

Figure 8.3-1: IMSI
Octets 5 to (n+4) represent the IMSI value in international number format as
described in ITU-T Rec E.212 [64], encoded as TBCD digits, i.e. digits from 0
through 9 are encoded \"0000\" to \"1001\". When there is an odd number of
digits, bits 8 to 5 of the last octet are encoded with the filler \"1111\".
The maximum number of digits is 15.
## 8.4 Cause
Cause IE is coded as depicted in Figure 8.4-1.

| a(n+4) |  | Spare | Instance  
---|---  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Figure 8.4-1: Cause
Cause is a variable length IE, which may have either of the following two
lengths values:
\- If n = 2, a = 0 and the Cause IE shall be 6 octets long. Therefore, octets
\"a(n+1) to a(n+4)\" will not be present.
\- If n = 6, a = 1 and the Cause IE will be 10 octets long.
For PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW/MAG shall do the mapping between GTPv2 Cause IE
and respective PMIPv6 IE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.275 [26].
The following bits within Octet 6 indicate:
\- Bits 8 to 4: Spare, for future use and set to zero
\- Bit 1 -- CS (Cause Source): If this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the
corresponding error cause is originated by the remote node (i.e., the MME/SGSN
to a PGW, or the PGW to an MME/SGSN). This bit is set to 0 to denote that the
corresponding error cause is originated by the node sending the message.
The CS should be set to 1 by the SGW when the SGW relay a response message
with cause value from the MME/SGSN to the PGW or from the PGW to the MME/SGSN.
For PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW shall set the CS bit to 1 when the SGW/MAG relay
a response message with the cause value from the PGW/LMA to the MME/SGSN.
\- Bit 2 -- BCE (Bearer Context IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it
indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in the
Bearer Context IE. This bit shall be discarded if the cause value is one of
Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.
\- Bit 3 -- PCE (PDN Connection IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it
indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in the
PDN Connection IE. This bit shall be discarded if the cause value is one of
Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.
The Cause value shall be included in a response message. In a response
message, the Cause value indicates the acceptance or the rejection of the
corresponding request message. The Cause value indicates the explicit reason
for the rejection.
If the rejection is due to a mandatory IE or a verifiable conditional IE is
faulty or missing, the offending IE shall be included within an additional
field \"a(n+1) to a(n+4)\". Only Type and Instance fields of the offending IE
that caused the rejection have a meaning. The length in the Octet 8-9 and
spare bits in the Octet 10 shall be set to \"0\". In this case, the value of
\"n\" shall be \"6\". Otherwise, the value of \"n\" is equal to \"2\".
The Cause may also be included in the request message. In a request message,
the Cause value indicates the reason for the request.
\"Request accepted\" is returned when the GTPv2 entity has accepted a control
plane request.
\"Context Not Found\" is used in the response message by a GTP entity when it
receives a message for which it does not have context, e.g. TEID-C or EBI is
not known. When \"Context Not Found\" is received at Bearer Context IE level,
it means the bearer context is unknown in the peer. When \"Context Not Found\"
is received at message level together with a known TEID-C in the GTPv2-C
header in the response message, this indicates some bearer contexts are not
known in the peer; the sender of the request message should further determine,
based on the bearer context(s) included in the request message, that:
\- if the default bearer is unknown, this means the PDN connection is not
known in the peer;
\- if one or more dedicated bearers are unknown, this means only those
dedicated bearer contexts are not known in the peer.
\"Context Not Found\" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response
message during the non-3GPP to 3GPP access handover procedures, if the request
corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not exist in the
PGW.
\"Context Not Found\" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response
message during the 3GPP to non-3GPP access handover procedures, if the request
corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not exist in the
PGW.
\"Service not supported\" is used by the GTP entity when it receives a
message, which corresponds to a feature or a service which is not supported by
the node.
\"Service denied\" is used when the requested service cannot be granted.
\"System failure\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate a generic error
condition.
\"No resources available\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate the temporary
unavailability of the resource(s) to process the received request.
\"Semantic error in the TFT operation\", \"Syntactic error in the TFT
operation\", \"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\", \"Syntactic errors in
packet filters(s)\", \"UE context without TFT already activated\", \"Semantic
error in the TAD operation\" and \"Syntactic error in the TAD operation\" are
indications of error cases involving TFT(s)/TAD(s) as specified in clause
7.7.11 in this specification.
\"Missing or unknown APN\" is used by the PGW when it does not support the
Access Point Name, received in Create Session Request message.
\"Relocation failure\" is used by the target MME/S4-SGSN to indicate the
source MME/S4-SGSN that the relocation has failed.
\"Relocation failure due to NAS message redirection\" is used by the new
MME/S4-SGSN to indicate to the old MME/S4-SGSN that the TAU/RAU procedure is
not successful due to NAS message redirection as described in 3GPP TS 23.401
[3].
\"Denied in RAT\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the requested
service is not accepted in the RAT.
\"Preferred PDN type not supported\" is used by the PGW to indicate that the
PDN type received in the Create Session Request message is not supported by
the PGW for the PDN corresponding to the received Access Point Name.
\"Protocol type not supported\" is used by the SGW to indicate that the S5/S8
protocol type requested by the MME/S4-SGSN is not supported by it.
\"UE not responding\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate that the UE is
not responding to the request initiated by the network, e.g. Paging.
\"UE refuses\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the UE, without
specifying further detail, rejected the request from the network.
\"Unable to page UE\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate its inability to
page the UE, temporarily.
\"User authentication failed\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the
request is rejected due to failure in authentication/security procedure.
\"APN access denied -- no subscription\" is used to indicate that the PGW has
denied the user access to an APN because a subscription is required, but the
subscriber does not have the necessary subscription.
\"Remote peer not responding\" is used by the SGW for the messages spanning
through two interfaces. This cause value is returned by the SGW to the
MME/S4-SGSN or PGW in a response message where no response message is received
from the PGW or MME/S4-SGSN.
\"Collision with network initiated request\" is used by the PGW to indicate
that the UE-initiated bearer resource allocation/modification request is
rejected since the PGW has requested a bearer resource allocation/modification
for the same service using a network-initiated procedure.
\"Unable to page UE due to Suspension\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate
that the UE has not been paged because the bearers of the UE are in a
suspended state.
\"APN Restriction type Incompatible with currently active PDN connection\" is
used by the PGW to indicate that the newly requested PDN connection has APN
restriction value that is not compatible with the currently active PDN
connection(s)\'s APN restriction value(s).
\"Invalid peer\" is used by the SGW to indicate that currently the UE is being
managed by the different node (e.g. MME/S4-SGSN) than the node (e.g.
S4-SGSN/MME) which has sent the Delete Session Request message.
\"Invalid Reply from remote peer\" is used by the SGW for the messages
spanning through two interfaces. This cause value is returned by the SGW to
the MME/SGSN or PGW in a reply message where the corresponding reply message
on S5/S8 or S11/S4 from the PGW or MME/SGSN is not decoded as valid.
\"Temporarily rejected due to handover/TAU/RAU procedure in progress\" is used
by the MME/S4-SGSN for the bearer related procedure initiated by the PGW. When
the handover/TAU/RAU with/without SGW change and/or MME/S4-SGSN change is in
progress, the MME/S4-SGSN may receive Create / Update / Delete Bearer request
message for the bearer creation, modification or deletion initiated by the
PGW. If the handover/TAU/RAU procedure results in the SGW and/or MME/S4-SGSN
change, then the bearer related procedure cannot be handled temporarily by the
MME/S4-SGSN till the handover/TAU/RAU procedure is completed. In that case the
MME/S4-SGSN shall reject the bearer related procedure with this rejection
cause. This cause is also used to indicate that the Downlink Data Notification
message is rejected temporarily due to the mobility procedures with MME or
SGSN change in progress as specified in sub-clause 5.3.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.401
[3].
The usage of \"Fallback to GTPv1\" is specified in clause 7.10 \"Fallback to
GTPv1 mechanism\".
In the PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure for the default bearer, the
PGW may include the Cause IE in the Delete Bearer Request with values \"RAT
changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP\", \"Reactivation requested\" or \"Reactivation
disallowed to APN\".
\"APN Congestion\" is used by the PGW and it indicates that the PGW has
detected congestion for the requested APN and performs overload control for
that APN which does not allow the PDN connection to be established.
\"GTP-C Entity Congestion\" is used to indicate that the GTP-C entity has
detected node level congestion and performs overload control at the node
level, which does not allow the request to be processed.
\"UE already re-attached\" is used by MME/S4-SGSN for the network triggered
service restoration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]. The
MME/S4-SGSN may send the Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge or Downlink
Data Notification Failure Indication with this cause as part of the network
triggered service restoration procedure.
\"PDP connection inactivity timer expires\" is used by the PGW in Delete
Bearer Request(s) to indicate that all the bearer(s) for the emergency PDN
connection are deleted upon the inactivity timer expiry as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [48].
\"Network failure\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session Request
to indicate that the message is sent due to a network problem.
\"QoS parameter mismatch\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session
Request to indicate that the PDN connection can not be established due to a
QoS parameter mismatch.
\"MME/SGSN refuses due to VPLMN policy\" is used by the MME/SGSN in the VPLMN
to indicate to the PGW in the Create Bearer Response or Update Bearer Response
that it does not allow the establishment or modification of the bearer due to
VPLMN operator\'s policy.
The listed cause values for rejection response message descriptions in clause
7 are not meant to be exhaustive lists. Therefore a GTPv2 node shall use the
most appropriate matching rejection response cause value that is listed in
Table 8.4-1.
If a Bearer Resource Command message is related to an established PDN
connection for LIPA or for SIPTO at the local network, the LGW shall reject
the Bearer Resource Command with the cause value of \"Bearer handling not
supported\".
\"Multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed\" is used by SGW for
reply message to the MME/S4-SGSN when PMIP-based S5/S8 is used. If either SGW
or PGW does not support the multiple PDN connections to the same APN function,
the SGW shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure with this
rejection cause when receiving Create Session Request for additional PDN
connectivity to the given APN from the same UE.
As specified in sub-clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and sub-clause 9.2.1
in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value \"New PDN type due to network
preference\" indicates that the UE has requested PDN type IPv4v6 and only IPv4
or IPv6 address is allowed for the PDN based on PGW operator policy.
As specified in sub-clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and sub-clause 9.2.1
in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value \"New PDN type due to single address
bearer only\" indicates that the MS has requested PDN type IPv4v6 and both
IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual Address Bearer
Flag of the Indication IE is set to 0 or the Indication IE is absent, or only
single IP version addressing is possible in the PDN.
\"PGW not responding\" is used by the SGW in PGW Restart Notification to
indicate that the peer PGW has failed and not restarted as specified in clause
7.9.5.
\"UE context without TFT already activated\" is used by the PGW in the Bearer
Resource Failure Indication message to indicate that the PGW has received the
Bearer Resource Command message without TAD IE in the secondary PDP Context
Activation procedure.
\"Target access restricted for the subscriber\" is used by the MME/SGSN in the
Context Response message to indicate that the target access is prohibited for
the subscriber, based on the subscription profile.
\"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Identification
Response and Context Response message if the P-TMSI Signature stored in the
old SGSN or MME does not match the value sent by the UE via the new SGSN or
MME.
\"Late Overlapping Request\" is used by the PGW in the Create Session Response
to indicate that the incoming request collides with an existing session which
has a more recent time stamp than the time stamp of the new request, as
specified in clause 13.2.
\"Timed Out Request\" is used by the SGW and PGW in the Create Session
Response to indicate that the incoming request is known to have already timed
out at the originating entity, as specified in clause 13.3.
\"UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving\" is used by the
MME/SGSN in the Create/Update Bearer Response message to reject the
corresponding network initiated procedures for a Delay Tolerant PDN connection
and also request the PGW to hold the network initiated procedure until it
receives the subsequent Modify Bearer Request message with the UASI flag
indicating that the UE is available for end to end signalling.
\"UE not authorised by OCS or external AAA Server\" is used by the PGW in the
Create Session Response to reject the corresponding UE initiated procedures
when the OCS or an external AAA Server on SGi did not authorise it and the
support of the Cause Code was indicated by the SGSN/MME within the Create
Session Request.
If a Create Session Request message requests the addition of an access to a
PDN connection, and NBIFOM is not supported by the MME/SGSN, SGW or TWAN, the
PGW should reject the request with the cause value of \"Multiple accesses to a
PDN connection not allowed\". This cause is also used by the PGW in the Delete
Bearer Request message to initiate the removal of 3GPP access from the PDN
connection due to detection of the MME/SGSN or SGW not supporting NBIFOM at
the inter-PLMN mobility procedure.
\"Request rejected due to UE capability\" is used by the MME in the Create
Bearer Response to reject the request to add an EPS bearer that would exceed
the UE capability (e.g. a NB-IoT UE can only support up to 2 EPS bearers).
This cause value does not prevent the PGW from sending Create Bearer Request
later.
\"S1-U Path Failure\" is used by the SGW in the Create Session Response, or in
the Modify Bearer Response message, or in the Modify Access Bearer Response
message to report an S1-U path failure. The SGW may include this cause code in
a Downlink Data Notification message and/or a Delete Bearer Request message to
report the S1-U path failure. See clause 20.3 in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].
\"EPS to 5GS Mobility\" is used by the PGW, and it indicates that PGW
initiated bearer deactivation procedure is due to EPS to 5GS mobility
procedures.
\"5GC not allowed\" is used by the source MME in the Context Response message
sent to the target AMF during an EPS to 5GS idle mode mobility procedure, to
indicate that the UE is not allowed for 5GC, based on the subscription
profile.

NOTE: The APN field is not encoded as a dotted string as commonly used in
documentation.
## 8.7 Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR)
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR) is transferred via GTP tunnels. The sending
entity copies the value part of the AMBR into the Value field of the AMBR
(APN-AMBR) IE.
AMBR is defined in clause 9.9.4.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23], but it shall be

Figure 8.7-1: Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR)
The APN-AMBR for uplink and the APN-AMBR for downlink may require converting
values in bits per second to kilo bits per second when the APN-AMBR for uplink
and the APN-AMBR for downlink are received from an interface other than GTPv2
interface. If such conversions result in fractions, then the value of APN-AMBR
for uplink and the APN-AMBR for downlink shall be rounded upwards.
NOTE: The encoding in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23] is different from the encoding
within this specification.
## 8.8 EPS Bearer ID (EBI)
EPS Bearer ID (EBI) is coded as depicted in Figure 8.8-1.

pending MT Short Message(s) in the SMS-GMSC, i.e. that the target MME/S4-SGSN
shall provide its E.164 address and Diameter Identity if available to receive
the MT Short message and maintain the signalling connection with the UE for a
longer time to enable the retransmission of the Short Message.
\- Bit 4 -- S11-U Tunnel Flag (S11TF): This flag shall be set to 1 on the S11
interface if user data is transported in NAS signalling.
\- Bit 3 -- PNSI (Pending Network Initiated PDN Connection Signalling
Indication): if this bit is set to 1, it indicates to the target MME/SGSN that
there is pending network initiated PDN connection signalling for the PDN
connection, i.e. the target MME/SGSN shall set UASI flag in the Create Session
Request or Modify Bearer Request message to indicate to the PGW that the UE is
available for end to end signalling.
\- Bit 2 -- UNACCSI (UE Not Authorised Cause Code Support Indication): If this
bit is set to 1, it indicates that the Cause Code for \"UE not authorized by
OCS or external AAA Server\" is supported by the S4-SGSN/MME.
\- Bit 1 - WLCP PDN Connection Modification Support Indication (WPMSI): if
this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the TWAN supports the WLCP PDN
Connection Modification procedure. This indication is used by the P-CSCF
restoration extension procedure for TWAN access (see 3GPP TS 23.380 [61]).
The following bits within Octet 11 shall indicate:
\- Bit 8 -- 5GSNN26 (5GS Interworking without N26 Indication): if this bit is
set to 1 and the 5GS Interworking Indication (5GSIWKI) is set to 1, it
indicates to the PGW-C+SMF that 5GS Interworking is supported without the N26
interface. If this bit is set to 0 and the 5GSIWKI (5GS Interworking
Indication) is set to 1, it indicates to the PGW-C+SMF that 5GS Interworking
is supported with the N26 interface.
\- Bit 7 -- REPREFI (Return Preferred Indication): This flag shall be set to 1
to indicate a preferred return of the UE to the last used EPS or 5GS PLMN at a
later access change to an EPS or 5GS shared network.
\- Bit 6 --5GSIWKI (5GS Interworking Indication): This flag shall be set to 1
for UEs supporting N1 mode and not restricted to interworking with 5GS by user
subscription (see \"5GC\" bit within Core-Network-Restrictions AVP and
Interworking-5GS-Indicator AVP specified in 3GPP TS 29.272 [70] and 3GPP TS
29.273 [68]) and hence access to 5GC is allowed for the PDN connection.
\- Bit 5 --EEVRSI (Extended EBI Value Range Support Indication): if this bit
is set to 1, it indicates that the sending GTPv2 entity supports the 15 EPS
Bearers, i.e. it supports to use EPS Bearer ID with a value between \'1\' and
\'15\'.
\- Bit 4 --LTEMUI (LTE-M UE Indication): if this bit is set to 1, it indicates
that the UE is a LTE-M UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]);
\- Bit 3 -- LTEMPI (LTE-M RAT Type reporting to PGW Indication): if this bit
is set to 1, it indicates to the SGW to forward the LTE-M RAT type to the PGW;
\- Bit 2 -- ENBCRSI (eNB Change Reporting Support Indication): if this bit is
set to 1, it indicates that the MME supports Macro eNodeB Change Reporting
mechanism for the corresponding session.
\- Bit 1 --TSPCMI (Triggering SGSN initiated PDP Context Creation/Modification
Indication): if this bit is set to 1, it indicates to the S4-SGSN that in the
UE_initiated PDP Context Modification procedure, when the NBIFOM container is
included, the S4-SGSN accepts the UE initiated PDP Context Modification
procedure and initiates SGSN initiated PDP Context Creation/modification
procedures respectively towards UE to transfer the NBIFOM container received
from the PGW either in Create Bearer Request or Update Bearer Request message
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].
## 8.13 Protocol Configuration Options (PCO)

Octet 5 represents the Allocation/Retention Priority (ARP) parameter. The
meaning and value range of the parameters within the ARP are defined in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [29]. The bits within the ARP octet are:
\- Bit 1 -- PVI (Pre-emption Vulnerability): See 3GPP TS 29.212[29], clause
5.3.47 Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP.
\- Bit 2 -- spare
\- Bits 3 to 6 -- PL (Priority Level): See 3GPP TS 29.212[29], clause 5.3.45
Priority-Level AVP. PL encodes each priority level defined for the Priority-
Level AVP as the binary value of the priority level.
\- Bit 7 -- PCI (Pre-emption Capability): See 3GPP TS 29.212[29], clause
5.3.46 Pre-emption-Capability AVP.
\- Bit 8 -- spare.
Octet 6 contains the \"QCI\" value, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [48].
The UL/DL MBR and GBR fields are encoded as kilobits per second (1 kbps = 1000
bps) in binary value. The UL/DL MBR and GBR fields may require converting
values in bits per second to kilobits per second when the UL/DL MBR and GBR
values are received from an interface other than GTPv2 interface. If such
conversions result in fractions, then the value of UL/DL MBR and GBR fields
shall be rounded upwards. For non-GBR bearers, both the UL/DL MBR and GBR
should be set to zero. The range of QCI, Maximum bit rate for uplink, Maximum
bit rate for downlink, Guaranteed bit rate for uplink and Guaranteed bit rate
for downlink are specified in 3GPP TS 36.413 [10].
NOTE: The encoding in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] is different
from the encoding within this specification.

NOTE 1: For S4-SGSN, currently it is only possible to detect the difference
between GERAN and UTRAN when GERAN Gb mode is used. If GERAN Iu mode is used,
then an S4-SGSN may not be able to detect the difference between GERAN and
UTRAN. Across the Gb interface, the SGSN may also not be able to detect the
difference between GERAN and GAN. If S4-SGSN cannot detect that the HSPA
Evolution 3GPP TR 25.999 [46] network is behind the Iu interface, the S4-SGSN
will send the \"UTRAN\" RAT Type.
NOTE 2: For the Iu interface case, if the SGSN detects UTRAN or HSPA, it sets
the RAT-Type to \"UTRAN\". If the SGSN detects HSPA+, it sets the RAT-Type to
\"HSPA Evolution\", otherwise the SGSN will send the \"UTRAN\" RAT Type.
NOTE 3: The MME sets the LTE-M RAT-Type for a UE accessing E-UTRAN and
indicating Category M in its UE radio capability, as specified in 3GPP TS
23.401 [3].

If an Administration decides to include only two digits in the MNC, then bits
5 to 8 of octet 6 are coded as \"1111\".
Unless specified otherwise in the specification, this IE contains the serving
core network operator ID provided by the MME, S4-SGSN or ePDG, or the PLMN
identity of the selected PLMN used for 3GPP-based access authentication
provided by the TWAN.
NOTE: The serving core network operator ID is the PLMN ID of the MME, S4-SGSN
or ePDG which is currently serving the UE. An S4-SGSN/MME which supports
multiple PLMN IDs is considered as logically different S4-SGSNs/MMEs.

Other values of \"Interface Type\" are spare and reserved for future use.
\"Interface type\" values with bit \"6\" set to 1 shall only be used between
Rel-10 onwards GTPv2-C nodes.
NOTE 1: \"Interface type\" IE is defined with 5 bits only in the earlier
releases of this specification, thus pre-Rel-10 GTPv2-C nodes can ignore bit
\"6\" which is marked as \"Spare\" in earlier releases, allowing backward
compatibility.
NOTE 2: Interface Type 8 is not used in this Release and in earlier Releases.
Octet 6 to 9 (TEID/GRE field) represent either a TEID or a GRE key. If both
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are present in F-TEID IE, then the TEID value shall be
shared by both addresses.
Octets \"m to (m+3)\" and/or \"p to (p+15)\" (IPv4 address / IPv6 address
fields), if present, contain respective address values.

The following bits within Octet 5 indicate:
\- Bit 1 -- PPC (Prohibit Payload Compression): This flag is used to determine
whether an SGSN should attempt to compress the payload of user data when the
users asks for it to be compressed (PPC = 0), or not (PPC = 1).
\- Bit 2 -- VB (Voice Bearer): This flag is used to indicate a voice bearer
when doing PS-to-CS (v)SRVCC handover.
\- Bit 3 -- Vind (vSRVCC indicator): This flag is used to indicate that this
bearer is an IMS video bearer and is candidate for PS-to-CS vSRVCC handover.
\- Bit 4 - ASI (Activity Status Indicator): When set to 1, this flag indicates
that the bearer context is preserved in the CN without corresponding Radio
Access Bearer established. The target S4-SGSN shall keep the bearer context
associated with this indicator preserved. When the target S4-SGSN sends
Relocation Request message towards the target RNC, the target S4-SGSN may not
request to setup the RABs for those bearer contexts associated with this
indicator.

## 8.38 MM Context
The MM Context information element contains the Mobility Management, UE
security parameters that are necessary to transfer over S3/S16/S10/N26
interface.
All Spare bits are set to zeros by the sender and ignored by the receiver.
Spare bits in MM Context IE shall be set to 1\'s before sending MM Context IE
to Gn/Gp SGSN.
NOTE 1: The encoding of Spare bits in MM Context IE is different between GTPv1
and GTPv2. Spare bits in GTPv1 in MM Context IE there are set to 1s.
Security Mode indicates the type of security keys (GSM/UMTS/EPS) and
Authentication Vectors (quadruplets /quintuplets/triplets) that are passed to
the new MME/SGSN/AMF.
The DRX parameter coding is specified in clause 10.5.5.6 of 3GPP TS 24.008
[5]. If DRXI (DRX Indicator), bit 4 of octet 5, is set to \"1\", then the DRX
parameter field is present, otherwise its octets are not present.
Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR (Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate) is coded as
Unsigned32 integer values in kbps (1000 bps) for all non-GBR bearers according
to the subscription of the user. The uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR
requires converting values in bits per second to kilobits per second when it
is received from the HSS. If such conversions result in fractions, then the
uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR values shall be rounded upwards. If SAMBRI
(Subscribed UE AMBR Indicator), bit 1 of octet 6, is set to \"1\", then the
Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR parameter field is present, otherwise these
parameters are not present. If no Subscribed UE AMBR is received from the HSS,
the SAMBRI shall be set to \"0\".Uplink/downlink Used UE AMBR (Aggregate
Maximum Bit Rate) is coded as Unsigned32 integer values in kbps (1000 bps) for
all non-GBR bearers currently being used by the UE. If UAMBRI (Used UE AMBR
Indicator), bit 2 of octet 6, is set to \"1\", then the Uplink/downlink Used
UE AMBR parameter field is present, otherwise these parameters are not
present.
The encoding of Mobile Equipment Identity (MEI) field shall be same as
specified in clause 8.10 of this specification. If Length of Mobile Equipment
Identity is zero, then the Mobile Equipment Identity parameter shall not be
present. If the UE is emergency attached and the UE is UICCless or the IMSI is
unauthenticated, Mobile Equipment Identity (MEI) shall be used as the UE
identity.
The UE Network Capability coding is specified in clause 9.9.3.34 of 3GPP TS
24.301 [23]. If Length of UE Network Capability is zero, then the UE Network
Capability parameter shall not be present.
The MS Network Capability coding is specified in clause 10.5.5.12 of 3GPP TS
24.008 [5]. If Length of MS Network Caapability is zero, then the MS Network
Capability parameter shall not be present.
The Voice Domain Preference and UE\'s Usage Setting coding is specified in
clause 10.5.5.28 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]. If Length of Voice Domain Preference
and UE\'s Usage Setting is zero, then the Voice Domain Preference and UE\'s
Usage Setting parameter shall not be present.
Used Cipher indicates the GSM ciphering algorithm that is in use.
Used NAS Cipher indicates the EPS ciphering algorithm that is in use.
The Access restriction data is composed of UNA(UTRAN Not Allowed), GENA(GERAN
Not Allowed), GANA(GAN Not Allowed), INA(I-HSPA-Evolution Not Allowed),
ENA(WB-E-UTRAN Not Allowed), NBNA( NB-IoT Not Allowed), ECNA (Enhanced
Coverage Not Allowed) and HNNA(HO-To-Non-3GPP-Access Not Allowed).
If the SGSN support the Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag, the Higher bitrates
than 16 Mbps flag shall be included in the MM Context if:
\- the source S4-SGSN has received \"Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag\" in
the RANAP Initial UE Message or in RANAP Relocation Complete as defined in TS
25.413 [33] from the RNC, or
\- the source S4-SGSN has stored the \"Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag\"
(received from an SGSN via the Identification Response, Context Response or
Forward Relocation Request during earlier procedures).
The S4-SGSN shall set the \"Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag\" to \"1\" if
\"Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag\" is \"allowed\" and to \"0\" if it is
\"not allowed\". The Length of Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag shall be set
to zero if the S4-SGSN has not received the \"Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps
flag\".
As depicted in Figure 8.38-1, the GSM Key, Used Cipher and Authentication
Triplets that are unused in the old SGSN shall be transmitted to the new SGSN
for the GSM subscribers. An array of at most 5 Authentication Triplets may be
included. The field \'Number of Triplet\' shall be set to the value \'0\' if
no Authentication Triplet is included (i.e. octets \'16 to h\' are absent).
The Authentication Triplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-7.

Figure 8.38-1: GSM Key and Triplets
As depicted in Figure 8.38-2, the UMTS Key, Used Cipher and Authentication
Quintuplets that are unused in the old SGSN shall be transmitted to the new
SGSN when the UMTS subscriber is attached to a GSM BSS in the old system, in
case the user has a ME capable of UMTS AKA. An array of at most 5
Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field \'Number of
Quintuplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\' if no Authentication Quintuplet
is included (i.e. octets \'40 to h\' are absent).
If the UGIPAI (Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm Indicator), bit 3 of
octet 6, is set to 1, then bits 4 to 6 of octet 7 shall contain the Used GPRS
integrity protection algorithm field, otherwise these bits shall be set to 0
and ignored by the receiver.
The GUPII (GPRS User Plane Integrity Indicator), bit 4 of octet 6, shall be
set to 1 if the subscriber profile indicated that user plane integrity
protection is required and set to 0 otherwise.
NOTE 2: The encoding of the bits is not identical with GTPv1 as the spare bits
are encoded differently.
The source S4-SGSN shall include the IOV_updates counter if it is supported
and available. The IOV_updates counter is encoded as an integer with a length
of 1 octet. The use of the IOV_updates counter is specified in 3GPP TS 43.020
[78]. If IOVI (IOV_updates Indicator), bit 5 of octet 6, is set to \"1\", then
the IOV_updates counter parameter field shall be present, otherwise it shall
not be present.
The Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.

Figure 8.38-3: GSM Key, Used Cipher and Quintuplets
As depicted in Figure 8.38-4, the UMTS Key, KSI and unused Authentication
Quintuplets in the old SGSN may be transmitted to the new SGSN/MME when the
UMTS subscriber is attached to UTRAN/GERAN in the old system, but it is not
allowed to send quintuplets to an MME in a different serving network domain
(see 3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.6). The MME may forward the UMTS Key, KSI
and unused Authentication Quintuplets which were previously stored back to the
same SGSN, for further details, refer to 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. An array of at
most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field \'Number of
Quintuplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\' if no Authentication Quintuplet
is included (i.e. octets \'40 to h\' are absent).
If the UGIPAI (Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm Indicator), bit 3 of
octet 6, is set to 1, then bits 1 to 3 of octet 7 shall contain the Used GPRS
integrity protection algorithm field, otherwise these bits shall be set to 0
and ignored by the receiver.
The GUPII (GPRS User Plane Integrity Indicator), bit 4 of octet 6, shall be
set to 1 if the subscriber profile indicated that user plane integrity
protection is required and set to 0 otherwise.
NOTE 3: The encoding of the bits is not identical with GTPv1 as the spare bits
are encoded differently.
The source S4-SGSN shall include the IOV_updates counter if it is supported
and available. The IOV_updates counter is encoded as an integer with a length
of 1 octet. The use of the IOV_updates counter is specified in 3GPP TS 43.020
[78]. If IOVI (IOV_updates Indicator), bit 5 of octet 6, is set to \"1\", then
the IOV_updates counter parameter field shall be present, otherwise it shall
not be present.
The Extended Access Restriction Data is to store the extra access restriction
data received from the HSS (other than ECNA, NBNA, HNNA, ENA, INA, GANA, GENA
and UNA). If Length of Extended Access Restriction Data is zero, then the
field of Extended Access Restriction Data shall not be present. The Extended
Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as Secondary RAT Not
Allowed). The presence of the Extended Access Restriction Data for the case in
UMTS Key as depicted in Figure 8.38-4 is optional.
NOTE: In Figure 8.34-4, including the Extended Access Restriction Data allows
optimized selection of SGW in case of handover from GSM/UTRAN to E-UTRAN.
The Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.

As depicted in Figure 8.38-5, the current EPS Security Context, a non-current
EPS Security Context (if available), and unused Authentication Quadruplets in
the old MME may be transmitted to the new MME/AMF. If the new MME/AMF is not
in the same serving network domain, then only the current EPS Security Context
may be transmitted. The mapping of an EPS security context to a 5G security
context in the new AMF is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [86]. An array of at
most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may be included. The field \'Number of
Quadruplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\' if no Authentication Quadruplet
is included (i.e. octets \'46 to g\' are absent). Authentication Quintuplets
shall not be transmitted to the new MME/AMF (i.e. octets \'g+1 to h\' shall be
absent) even if the old MME has the Authentication Quintuplets for this UE.
The field \'Number of Quintuplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\'. The
reasons for not sending Quintuplets are specified in3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause
6.1.6.
The current EPS Security Context may be transmitted by the old AMF to the new
MME, where the mapping of a 5G security context to an EPS security context is
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [86]. The field \'Number of Quadruplets\' and
\'Number of Quintuplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\'. The AMF shall not
transmit un-used authentication vectors to an MME and shall discard any un-
used authentication vectors received from an MME, regardless of whether the
MME and AMF pertain to the same or different serving network domains.
The Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are
specified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.
The value of the NAS Downlink Count shall be set to the value that shall be
used to send the next NAS message.
The value of the NAS Uplink Count shall be set to the largest NAS Uplink Count
that was in a successfully integrity verified NAS message.
In Figure 8.38-5, the fields for the Old EPS Security Context (i.e. octets
from s to s+64) may be present only in S10 Forward Relocation Request message
according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of Security Procedures, which are
specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. The octets for Old EPS Security Context
shall be present if the OSCI (Old Security Context Indicator), bit 1 of octet
6) is set to \"1\"; otherwise they shall not be present.
If NHI_old (Next Hop Indicator for old EPS Security Context), bit 1 of octet
s, is set to \"1\", then the parameters old NH (Next Hop) and old NCC (Next
Hop Chaining Count) shall be present; otherwise the octets for old NH
parameter shall not be present and the value of old NCC parameter shall be
ignored by the receiver. .
Multiple APN Rate Control Statuses (including the number of packets still
allowed in the given time unit, the number of additional exception reports
still allowed in the given time unit and the termination time of the current
APN Rate Control validity period) may be included by the MME.
The MM context shall contain the APN Rate Control Status(s) for PDN connection
which are released and currentlty not re-established. Once a PDN connection is
re-established, the related APN Rate Control Status shall be deleted.
The UAMBRI shall be set to \"0\" by the old AMF, and then the Uplink/downlink
Used UE AMBR parameter field are not present.The SAMBRI shall be set to \"1\"
by the old AMF, if the AMF has the Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR received
from the MME, or the Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR in 5G.

If NHI (Next Hop Indicator), bit 5 of octet 5, is set to \"1\", then the
optional parameters NH (Next Hop) and NCC (Next Hop Chaining Count) are both
present, otherwise their octets are not present.
The UE Radio Capability for Paging information is specified in the clause
9.2.1.98 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [10]. If Length of UE Radio Capability for Paging
information is zero, then the UE Radio Capability for Paging information shall
not be present. The old MME shall, when available, include UE Radio Capability
for Paging information to the new MME as specified in the clause 5.11.4 of
3GPP TS 23.401 [4].
The Extended Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as Secondary
RAT Not Allowed) and of USSRNA (Unlicensed Spectrum in the form of LAA or
LWA/LWIP as Secondary RAT Not Allowed).
The UE additional security capability coding is specified in clause 9.9.3.53
of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23]. If Length of UE additional security capability is
zero, then the field UE additional security capability in octets \"(v+2) to
x\" shall not be present.
The UE NR security capability coding is specified in clause 9.8.3.57 of 3GPP
TS 24.501 [87]. If Length of UE NR security capability is zero, then the field
UE NR security capability in octets \"(x+2) to y\" shall not be present.
As depicted in Figure 8.38-6, the old MME will derive CK\' and IK\' from
K~ASME~ and transmit the CK\' and IK\' to the new SGSN. Authentication
Quintuplets, if available, shall be transmitted to the SGSN if, and only if
the MME received them from this SGSN earlier, according to 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]
clause 6.1.5. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be
included. The field \'Number of Quintuplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\'
if no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets \'g+1 to h\' are
absent). An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may be included. The
field \'Number of Quadruplets\' shall be set to the value \'0\' if no
Authentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets \'40 to g\' are absent). A
key K~ASME~ shall never be transmitted to an SGSN according to 3GPP TS 33.401
[12] clause 6.4.
The Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are
specified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.
The old SGSN/MME may deliver both Authentication Quadruplets and
Authentication Quintuplets it holds to the peer combo node to optimize the
procedure.
NOTE: 3GPP TS 33.401 [12] states that \"EPS authentication data shall not be
forwarded from an MME towards an SGSN\". The statement above assumes that the
old MME can determine by local configuration that the peer node is a combo
SGSN/MME (as opposed to a single SGSN).

## 8.39 PDN Connection
The PDN connection is a grouped IE containing a number of other IEs and shall
be coded as depicted in Table 8.39-1.
The PDN Connection IE may be repeated within a message when more than one PDN
Connection is required to be sent. If so, the repeated IEs shall have exactly
the same Instance values to represent a list of grouped IEs.

NOTE: This table uses a 5-column format in order to match the format used in
clauses of clause 7, where the usage of this IE is further detailed for each
specific GTP message including it.
## 8.40 PDU Numbers
The PDU Numbers information element contains the sequence number status
corresponding to a Bearer context in the old SGSN. This information element
shall be sent only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for
the Bearer context or when the \"delivery order\" QoS attribute is set in the
Bearer context QoS profile.
NSAPI identifies the Bearer context for which the PDU Number IE is intended.
DL GTP-U Sequence Number is the number for the next downlink GTP-U T-PDU to be
sent to the UE when \"delivery order\" is set.
UL GTP-U Sequence Number is the number for the next uplink GTP-U T-PDU to be
tunnelled to the S-GW when \"delivery order\" is set.
The Send N-PDU Number is used only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC
operation is used for the Bearer context. Send N-PDU Number is the N-PDU
number to be assigned by SNDCP to the next down link N-PDU received from the
S-GW.
The Receive N-PDU Number is used only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC
operation is used for the Bearer context. The Receive N-PDU Number is the
N-PDU number expected by SNDCP from the next up link N-PDU to be received from
the UE.
The PDU Number IE will be repeated for each Bearer Context for which this IE
is required.
PDU Numbers IE is coded as depicted in Figure 8.40-1.

most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 10 is the least significant bit. The
coding of the location area code is the responsibility of each administration.
Coding using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding)
shall be used.
The RNC-ID consists of 2 octets and contains 12 bits long value (see 3GPP TS
25.413 [7]). Bit 4 of octet 12 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet
13 is the least significant bit (bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 are set to 0). The
coding of the RNC-ID is the responsibility of each administration. Coding
using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) shall be
used.
The Extended RNC-ID consists of 2 octets and contains 16 bits long value
within the range 4096 to 65535. Bit 8 of octet a is the most significant bit
and bit 1 of octet (a+1) is the least significant bit. The coding of the
Extended RNC-ID is the responsibility of each administration. Coding using
full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) shall be used. If
the optional Extended RNC-ID is included, then the receiver shall ignore the
RNC-ID.
If the optional Extended RNC-ID is not included, then the length variable
\'n\' = 8 and the overall length of the IE is 13 octets. Otherwise, \'n\' = 10
and the overall length of the IE is 15 octets.
NOTE 3: In the \"TargetRNC-ID\" ASN.1 type definition in 3GPP TS 25.413 [7]
the \"RAC\" parameter is marked as optional. RAC is however always available
at an SGSN/MME when it sends the RAC in e.g. a GTPv2 Forward Relocation

The gNodeB ID Length field, in bits 1 to 6 of octet 9, indicates the length of
the gNodeB ID in number of bits.
The gNodeB ID consists of 22 to 32 bits. The coding of the gNodeB ID is the
responsibility of each administration. Coding using full hexadecimal
representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) shall be used. Bit 1 of Octet 13
is the least significant bit. The most significant bit is determined as
follows:
\- if the gNodeB ID Length is 32, bit 8 of octet 10 is the most significant
bit;
\- if the gNodeB ID Length is 24, bit 8 of octet 11 is the most significant
bit; all the bits of octet 10 shall be set to 0 by the sender and ignored by
the receiver;
\- if the gNodeB ID Length is between 22 and 31, other than 24, the most
significant bit is the bit determined by the operation \"gNodeB ID Length
modulo 8\", of octet 10 if the length is greater than 24, or of octet 11 if
the length is smaller than 24. All the bits from bit 8 of octet 10 down to the
most significant bit (excluded) shall be set to 0 by the sender and ignored by
the receiver.
The 5GS TAC consists of 3 octets. Bit 8 of Octet 14 is the most significant
bit and bit 1 of octet 16 the least significant bit. The coding of the
tracking area code is the responsibility of each administration. Coding using
full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) shall be used.

The Target Cell ID shall be same as the Octets 3 to 10 of the Cell Identifier
IEI in 3GPP TS 48.018 [34].
Source Type values are specified in Table 8.59-1.
If the Source Type is Cell ID, this indicates PS handover from GERAN A/Gb
mode. In this case the coding of the Source ID field shall be same as the
Octets 3 to 10 of the Cell Identifier IEI in 3GPP TS 48.018 [34].
If the Source Type is RNC ID, this indicates PS handover from GERAN Iu mode or
for inter-RAT handover from UTRAN. In this case the Source ID field shall
include a transparent copy of the corresponding parameter (see clause 8.2.2),
the Source RNC-ID as specified within the \"Source ID\" parameter in 3GPP TS
25.413 [33].
NOTE: In fact, the ASN.1/PER encoded binary value of the \"Source RNC ID\"
shall be copied into octets 14 to (n+4).

## 8.62 Fully qualified PDN Connection Set Identifier (FQ-CSID)
A fully qualified PDN Connection Set Identifier (FQ-CSID) identifies a set of
PDN connections belonging to an arbitrary number of UEs on a MME, SGW, TWAN,
ePDG or PGW. The FQ-CSID is used on S5, S8, S2a, S2b and S11 interfaces.

Where Node-ID Type values are:
0 indicates that Node-ID is a global unicast IPv4 address and p = 9.
1 indicates that Node-ID is a global unicast IPv6 address and p = 21.
2 indicates that Node-ID is a 4 octets long field with a 32 bit value stored
in network order, and p= 9. The coding of the field is specified below:
\- Most significant 20 bits are the binary encoded value of (MCC * 1000 \+
MNC).
\- Least significant 12 bits is a 12 bit integer assigned by an operator to an
MME, SGW, TWAN, ePDG or PGW. Other values of Node-ID Type are reserved.
Values of Number of CSID other than 1 are only employed in the Delete PDN
Connection Set Request.
The node that creates the FQ-CSID, (i.e. MME for MME FQ-CSID, SGW for SGW FQ-
CSID, TWAN for TWAN FQ-CSID, ePDG for ePDG FQ-CSID and PGW for PGW FQ‑CSID),
is responsible for making sure the Node-ID is globally unique and the CSID
value is unique within that node.
When a FQ-CSID is stored by a receiving node, it is stored on a PDN basis even
for messages impacting only one bearer (i.e. Create Bearer Request). See 3GPP
TS 23.007 [17] for further details on the CSID and what specific requirements
are placed on the PGW, TWAN, ePDG, SGW and MME.

The FQDN field encoding shall be identical to the encoding of a FQDN within a
DNS message of section 3.1 of IETF RFC 1035 [31] but excluding the trailing
zero byte.
NOTE 1: The FQDN field in the IE is not encoded as a dotted string as commonly
used in DNS master zone files.
A \"PGW node name\" IE in S3/S10/S16 GTP messages shall be a PGW host name as
per clause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32] when the PGW FQDN IE is populated from
3GPP TS 29.303 [32] procedures. Specifically, the first DNS label is either
\"topon\" or \"topoff\", and the canonical node name of the PGW starts at the
third label. The same rules apply to \"SGW node name\" IE on S3/S10/S16 and
\"SGW-U node name\" IE on S5.
NOTE 2: The constraint of clause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.303 format is on
populating the IE by 3GPP nodes for 3GPP nodes, the receiver shall not reject
an IE that is otherwise correctly formatted since the IE might be populated
for a non-3GPP node.
An \"MME node name\" IE and an \"SGSN node name\" IE in S3 GTP messages
indicate the associated ISR node when the ISR becomes active.

## 8.73 MBMS IP Multicast Distribution
The MBMS IP Multicast Distribution IE is sent by the MBMS GW to the MME/SGSN
in the MBMS Session Start Request. Source Specific Multicasting is used
according to IETF RFC 4607 [40].
The IP Multicast Distribution Address and the IP Multicast Source Address
fields contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address. The Address Type and Address Length
fields shall be included in each field:
  * The Address Type, which is a fixed length code (of 2 bits) identifying the type of address that is used in the Address field.
```{=html}
``` \- The Address Length, which is a fixed length code (of 6 bits)
identifying the length of the Address field.
```{=html}
``` \- The Address, which is a variable length field shall contain either an
IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.
Address Type 0 and Address Length 4 shall be used when Address is an IPv4
address.
Address Type 1 and Address Length 16 shall be used when Address is an IPv6
address.
Other combinations of values are not valid.
MBMS HC Indicator represents an indication if header compression should be
used for MBMS user plane data, as specified in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33]. MBMS HC
Indicator field is encoded as a one octet long enumeration.
NOTE: Currently, 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] specifies two enumeration values: 0
(indicates \"uncompressed-header\") and 1 (indicates \"compressed-header\").
Common Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is allocated at the source Tunnel Endpoint
and signalled to the destination Tunnel Endpoint. There is one Common Tunnel
Endpoint Identifier allocated per MBMS bearer service. The recommendations on
how to set the value of C-TEID are provided in 3GPP TS 23.246 [37].

The CSG ID consists of 4 octets. Bit 3 of Octet 5 is the most significant bit
and bit 1 of Octet 8 is the least significant bit. The coding of the CSG ID is
the responsibility of the operator that allocates the CSG ID by administrative
means. Coding using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII
encoding) shall be used.

The BSSID and SSID shall be encoded as described in IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [52].
The TWAN identifier shall contain the SSID and, unless otherwise determined by
the TWAN operator\'s policies, it shall contain at least the BSSID, the civic
address of the access point to which the UE is attached or the Circuit-ID with
the identity of the Relay (e.g. TWAG) which has allocated it (see clause
16.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]). It may also contain the identifier of the TWAN
operator, i.e. either the TWAN PLMN-ID if the TWAN is operated by a mobile
operator or the TWAN Operator Name otherwise.
The SSID Length in octet \'6\' indicates the length of the SSID field. The
SSID is an Octet String which shall have a maximum length of 32 octets (see
IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [52]).
The BSSIDI flag in octet 5 indicates whether the BSSID in octets \'k+1\' to
\'k+6\' shall be present. If BSSIDI is set to \'1\', then the BSSID shall be
present. If BSSIDI is set to \'0\', then the BSSID shall not be present. The
BSSID is an Octet String which shall be 6 octets long (see IEEE Std
802.11-2012 [52]).
The CIVAI flag in octet 5 indicates whether the Civic Address Length and Civic
Address Information in octets \'q\' and \'q+1\' to \'q+r\' shall be present.
The Civic Address Length and Information shall be present if and only if the

Operator Name shall indicate the identifier of the TWAN operator.
The LAII flag in octet 5 indicates whether the Logical Access ID information
is present in the TWAN Identifier IE. The Logical Access ID is encoded by the
Relay Identity information in octets \'v\' to \'v+w\' and the Circuit-ID
information in octets \'x\' to \'x+y\'. The Relay Identity information and the
Circuit-ID information shall be present if the LAII flag is set to \'1\'. The
Relay indicates a DHCP relay agent as defined in IETF RFC 3046 [60]. The Relay
Identity Type indicates the type of the Relay Identity as described in Table
8.100-1. The Relay Identity Length indicates the length of the Relay Identity.
In case the Relay Identity Type indicates an IP address, the length indicates
if it is IPv4 or IPv6 address of the Relay. The length is 4 octets for IPv4
and 16 octets for IPv6. If the Relay Identity type is set to 1 (i.e. an FQDN),
it is encoded as described in section 3.1 of IETF RFC 1035 [31] but excluding
the trailing zero byte. The Circuit-ID length indicates the length of the
Circuit-ID. The Circuit-ID is as defined in IETF RFC 3046 [60], it is encoded

identifier of the PRA the UE is entering or leaving. It shall be encoded using
full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding). The PRA
Identifier is defined in clause 19.10 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
The PRA Identifier in the Octets 5 to 7 shall be set to the PRA Set ID if the
MME/SGSN is requested to report the change of UE presence in a PRA Set. In
this case:
\- the Additional PRA (APRA) flag in octet 8 shall be set to 1 if the
reporting of change of UE presence for the PRA Set is active and the UE
presence has changed for at least one PRA within the PRA Set (i.e. if the UE
enters or leaves the PRA Set, or the UE moves between the PRAs within the PRA
Set). The subsequent 4 octets shall then be present and shall contain the
identifier of the individual PRA within the PRA Set which the UE has newly
entered or left, with the information of whether the UE is inside or outside
this PRA.
\- the Additional PRA (APRA) flag in octet a+3 shall be set to 1 if the UE
presence status has changed for more than one individual PRA within the PRA
Set. In that case, the subsequent 4 Octets shall be included and encoded as
specified above for the octets a to a+3. The MME/SGSN shall report each
individual PRA(s) within the PRA Set that the UE has newly entered or left.
\- if the reporting of change of UE presence for the PRA Set is inactive, i.e.
the INAPRA flag in octet 8 is set to 1, then the Additional PRA (APRA) flag in
octet 8 shall not be set to 1 and no Additional PRA Identifier shall be
included.
The Inside PRA flag (IPRA) shall be set to 1 if the UE is inside or enters the
Presence Reporting Area identified by the PRA Identifier.
The Outside PRA flag (OPRA) shall be set to 1 if the UE is outside or leaves
the Presence Reporting Area identified by the PRA Identifier.
The Inactive PRA (INAPRA) flag in octet 8 shall be set to 1 if the PRA is
inactive in the MME/SGSN, i.e. the reporting of change of UE presence in this
PRA is currently deactivated in the MME/SGSN, e.g. due to an overload
situation.
Either the IPRA or the OPRA flag or the INAPRA shall be set to 1, not several
ones, for a given Presence Reporting Area Identifier.

## 8.137 Monitoring Event Extension Information

Figure 8.137-1: Monitoring Event Extension Information
The SCEF Reference ID, the SCEF ID shall be encoded as specified in clause
8.4.4 and 8.4.5 of 3GPP TS 29.336 [69].
The SCEF ID Length indicates the length of the SCEF ID in octets.
The following bits within Octet 5 indicate:
\- Bit 1 -- LRTP (Remaining Minimum Periodic Location Reporting Time Present):
This flag is used to indicate that Remaining Minimum Periodic Location
Reporting Time shall be present.
\- Bit 2-8 Spare.
Remaining Minimum Periodic Location Reporting Time indicates the current value
of the timer for minimum periodic location reporting. It shall be encoded as
specified in clause 8.4.29 of 3GPP TS 29.336 [69]. The target MME/SGSN shall
start the timer with the Remaining Minimum Periodic Location Reporting Time to
continue detecting the location change. If the timer expires, the target
MME/SGSN shall restart the timer with the value of the Periodic-Time AVP
within the Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP provided by the HSS.
# 9 Security
GTPv2-C communications shall be protected according to security mechanisms
defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].
# 10 IP - The Networking Technology used by GTP
## 10.1 IP Version
GTPv2 entities shall support both versions of the Internet Protocol, version 4
(IPv4) as defined by IETF RFC 791 [6], and version 6 (IPv6) as defined by IETF
RFC 2460 [16].
## 10.2 IP Fragmentation
It is specified here how the fragmentation mechanism shall work with GTP-C.
Fragmentation should be avoided if possible. Examples of fragmentation
drawbacks are:
\- Fragmentation is inefficient, since the complete IP header is duplicated in
each fragment.
\- If one fragment is lost, the complete packet has to be discarded. The
reason is that no selective retransmission of fragments is possible.
Path MTU discovery should be used, especially if GTPv2-C message is
encapsulated with IPv6 header. The application should find out the path MTU,
and thereby utilise more efficient fragmentation mechanisms.
## 10.3 DSCP
Based on operator policy, if:
\- GTPv2 entities support using the GTPv2 message priority mechanism as
specified in clause 5.4 and clause 12.3.9.3.4 for DSCP marking,
\- the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and
\- message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack for
transporting GTPv2 messages,
then the DSCP marking as defined by IETF RFC 2474 [81] shall be set for IP
packet carrying this GTPv2 messages based on the priority set in the GTPv2
message header.
# 11 Notification of supported features between peer GTP-C entities
## 11.1 General
### 11.1.1 Introduction
New functionality, i.e. functionality beyond the Rel-9 standard, which can not
be specified without backward incompatible changes (e.g. requiring support of
a new message or a specific receiver node\'s behaviour) should be introduced
as a feature, see clause 11.1.2.
A GTP-C entity should verify that a backward incompatible feature is supported
by its peer GTP entities before starting to use it.
NOTE: GTPv2 does not support a Comprehension Required mechanism allowing a
sender to force the receiver to support comprehension of some specific IEs as
a precondition to process a backward incompatible message.
Features may be generic node capabilities supported homogeneously for all GTP
tunnels, UEs and PDN connections. Such features are referred in this
specification as \"Node Features\". They are signalled with the granularity of
a node on all GTPv2 interfaces (i.e. S11, S4, S5, S8, S10, S3, S16, Sv, S101,
S121, Sm, Sn, S2a, S2b). A GTP-C entity may discover the features supported by
a peer GTP-C entity with which it is in direct contact as specified in clause
11.2.1.
### 11.1.2 Defining a feature
A feature is a function extending the base GTPv2 functionality that has a
significant meaning to the operation of GTPv2, i.e. a single new parameter
without a substantial meaning to the functionality of the GTPv2 endpoints
should not be defined to be a new feature.
A functionality requiring the definition of a new GTPv2 message or extending
the use of an existing message over a new interface should be defined as a
feature.
NOTE: Features are ultimately defined on a case-by-case basis on the merits of
defining an extension as a feature.
Features should be defined so that they are independent from each other. A
GTP-C entity may support the same feature over different interfaces, e.g. an
SGW may support a feature over both S11 and S4 interface, however support of a
feature on a given interface shall not depend on the support of the same or
another feature on another interface.
## 11.2 Dynamic discovery of supported features
### 11.2.1 General
A node supporting at least one feature defined in the Node Features IE shall
support dynamic discovery of supported features as specified in the following
clauses.
### 11.2.2 Features supported by direct peer GTP-C entities
A node shall signal to a direct peer node the list of features it supports by
sending the Sending Node Features IE in every Echo Request and Echo Response
messages to that node.
An exception to this is where the sending node does not support or use any
features towards the peer node and is not prepared to accept a message which
is constructed by making use of any features.
The peer receiving the Sending Node Features IE shall store the list of
features supported by the sending node per IP address and only update this
list based on the Sending Node Features IE in the Echo Request and Echo
Response messages, and it shall only use common supported features to initiate
subsequent GTPv2 messages towards this IP address. Receipt of an Echo Request
or an Echo Response message without the Sending Node Features IE shall
indicate that the sending node does not support any feature specified in Table
8.83-1 on the corresponding interface.
# 12 GTP-C load & overload control mechanism
## 12.1 General
### 12.1.1 GTP-C overload problem
GTP-C entities can communicate with other GTP-C peers in direct contact (e.g.
MME and SGW) or remote GTP-C peers through intermediate GTP-C entities (e.g.
MME and PGW via the SGW). In normal conditions, requests sent by a GTP-C
entity can be processed by the receiving GTP-C entity which can send back a
message indicating the result of the request (success/failure).
Overload situations in a GTP-C entity occur when the number of incoming
requests exceeds the maximum request throughput supported by the receiving
GTP-C entity, e.g. when the internal available resources of the GTP-C entity,
such as processing power or memory, are not sufficient to serve the number of
incoming requests. As a consequence of the overload situation, the receiving
GTP-C entity cannot successfully process the exceeding proportion of requests.
These requests can be either simply dropped or extremely delayed in the
processing. At best, the GTP-C entity may have enough internal resources to
send back to the request initiator a message indicating that the requests
cannot be successfully processed. Whatever the behaviour of the overloaded
GTP-C entities, the rate of successfully processed requests and consequently
the overall performances of the network decrease.
NOTE: GTP-C overload control does not target to address transport network
congestion. It assumes a transport network that is still capable to exchange
signalling traffic.
Given the nature of GTP-C protocol in how it relies on retransmissions of
unacknowledged requests (GTP-C is carried over UDP transport), when a GTP-C
entity experiences overload (or severe overload) the number of unacknowledged
GTP-C messages compounds exponentially and can lead to a node congestion or
even collapse. An overload or failure of a node can lead to an increase of the
load on the other nodes in the network and, in the worst case, turn into a
complete network issue via a snowball effect.
The impact of GTP-C overload to services can be such as:
\- loss of PDN connectivity (IMS, Internet ...) and associated services;
\- loss of ability to setup and release radio and core network bearers
necessary to support services e.g. GBR bearers for VoLTE or dedicated bearers
for Voice over WLAN;
\- loss of ability to report to the PGW/PCRF user\'s information changes, e.g.
location information for emergency services and lawful intercept, changes in
RAT or QoS;
\- and billing errors and a loss of revenue.
### 12.1.2 Scenarios leading to overload
Reasons for these temporary overload cases can be many and various in an
operational network, such as insufficient internal resource capacity of a
GTP-C entity faced with a sudden burst of requests, e.g. after network
failure/restart procedures affecting a large number of users, deficiency of a
GTP-C entity component leading to a drastic reduction of the overall
performances of the GTP-C entity.
Examples of GTP-C signalling based scenarios which can cause GTP-C overload
are:
\- a traffic flood resulting from the failure of a network element, inducing a
signalling spike, e.g. when the network needs to re-establish the PDN
connections affected by the failure of an EPC node;
\- a traffic flood resulting from a large number of users performing TAU/RAU
or from frequent transitions between idle and connected mode;
\- an exceptional event locally generating a traffic spike, e.g. a large
amount of calls (and dedicated bearers) being setup almost simultaneously upon
a catastrophic event or an exceptional but predictable event (e.g. Christmas,
New year) via a 3GPP access or a WLAN access;
\- Frequent RAT-reselection due to scattered non-3GPP (e.g. WiFi) coverage or
massive mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP coverage may potentially cause
frequent or massive intersystem change activities, i.e. UEs trying to either
create PDN connections over the new access or moving PDN connections between
3GPP and non-3GPP coverage.
Besides, GTP-C load balancing based only on semi-static DNS weights can lead
to a load imbalance and thus GTP-C signalling scenarios, such as those
mentioned above, may result in an overload of the SGWs or PGWs with the
highest load while there is still remaining capacity on other SGWs or PGWs.
### 12.1.3 Load & overload control concepts
**_Load control refers to \"GTP-C signalling based Load Control\" as defined
in clause 4.3.7.1a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS
23.060 [35]._**
**_Overload control refers to \"GTP-C signaling based Overload Control\" as
defined in clause 4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP
TS 23.060 [35]._**
Load control and overload control are two distinct but complementary concepts:
\- load control enables a GTP-C entity (e.g. an SGW/PGW) to send its load
information to a GTP-C peer (e.g. an MME/SGSN, ePDG, TWAN) to adaptively
balance the session load across entities supporting the same function (e.g. an
SGW cluster) according to their effective load. The load information reflects
the operating status of the resources of the GTP-C entity.
\- overload control enables a GTP-C entity becoming or being overloaded to
gracefully reduce its incoming signalling load by instructing its GTP-C peers
to reduce sending traffic according to its available signalling capacity to
successfully process the traffic. A GTP-C entity is in overload when it
operates over its signalling capacity which results in diminished performance
(including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).
Load control allows for better balancing of the session load, so as to attempt
to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action). Overload control
aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the traffic source as
possible generally when an overload has occurred (reactive action), so to
avoid spreading the problem inside the network and to avoid using resources of
intermediate nodes in the network for signalling that would anyhow be
discarded by the overloaded node.
Load control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the GTP-C
entity reports a high load.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently
in the network.
## 12.2 Load control solution
### 12.2.1 Principles of load control
The stage 2 requirements on GTP-C load control solution are defined in clause
4.3.7.1a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].
The high level principles are summarized below:
a) Load Control is an optional feature;
b) a GTP-C node may signal its Load Control Information to reflect the
operating status of its resources, allowing the receiving GTP-C peer node to
use this information to augment the existing GW selection procedures;
c) the calculation of the Load Control Information is implementation dependent
and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to
the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes;
d) the Load Control Information may provide load information of a GTP-C node
(e.g. a PGW) or, if the APN level load control feature is supported, may
provide the load information about specific APN(s);
e) the SGW may send its Load Control Information to the MME/S4-SGSN. The PGW
may send its Load Control Information to the MME/S4-SGSN via the SGW. For
non-3GPP access based interfaces, the PGW may send its Load Control
Information to the ePDG and TWAN;
f) the Load Control Information shall be piggybacked in GTP-C request or
response messages such that the exchange of Load Control Information does not
trigger extra signalling;
NOTE: The inclusion of Load Control Information in existing messages means
that the frequency of transmission of load control information increases as
the session load increases, allowing for faster feedback and thus better
regulation of the load.
g) a node supporting Load Control sends Load Control Information to a peer
GTP-C node based on local configuration (see clause 12.2.6);
h) the format of the Load Control Information shall be specified with enough
precision to guarantee a common interpretation of this information allowing
interoperability between nodes of different vendors;
i) for the inter-PLMN case, local configuration may restrict the exchange and
use of Load Control Information across PLMNs;
j) the GTP-C node may decide to send different values of Load Control
Information on inter-network (roaming) and on intra-network (non-roaming)
interfaces based on local configuration, i.e. the values sent on intra-network
interfaces may differ from the values sent on inter-network interfaces.
However, on intra-network interfaces, the node should send the same values
between the 3GPP and non-3GPP access based interfaces.
k) the Load Control Information received via GTP-C signalling shall be used in
conjunction with the information received from the DNS, during the node
selection procedure. Refer to 3GPP TS 29.303 [32] for further details.
### 12.2.2 Applicability to 3GPP and non-3GPP access based interfaces
Load Control may be supported on the 3GPP & non-3GPP access based interfaces
and nodes as summarized by the Table 12.2.2-1.
Table 12.2.2-1: Applicability of Load Control to GTP-C interfaces and nodes
+------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+ | Originator | Consumer | Applicable Interfaces | +============+==========+============================================+ | PGW | MME | S5/S8, S11 | | | | | | | | SGW relays Load Control Information from | | | | S5/S8 to S11 interface. | +------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+ | PGW | S4-SGSN | S5/S8, S4 | | | | | | | | SGW relays Load Control Information from | | | | S5/S8 to S4 interface. | +------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+ | SGW | MME | S11 | +------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+ | SGW | S4-SGSN | S4 | +------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+ | PGW | ePDG | S2b | +------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+ | PGW | TWAN | S2a | +------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
NOTE: Refer to Annex D.1 for information on the GTP-C interfaces for which
Load Control is not supported.
### 12.2.3 Node level load control
Node level load control refers to advertising of the load information at node
level -- i.e. load information at node level granularity -- and selection of
the target node based on this information. It helps to achieve an evenly load
balanced network by the use of the dynamic load information provided within
the Load Control Information.
### 12.2.4 APN level load control
#### 12.2.4.1 General
APN level load control refers to advertising of the load information at APN
level granularity and selection of the target node based on this information.
It helps to achieve an evenly load balanced network at APN granularity by the
use of the dynamic load information provided within the Load Control
Information with the APN scope. Only a PGW may advertise APN level load
information.
APN level load control is an optional feature that may be supported when the
following pre-condition is applicable.
**Pre-Condition:**
In the given network, when the ratio of the configured APN resource to the
overall capacity of the PGW is not the same across all the PGWs in the
network.
NOTE: In other cases, e.g. when all the resources of the PGW are available for
all the APNs served by that PGW, the node level load information is exactly
the same as APN level load information, for each of its APNs, and hence
performing node load control is sufficient.
If APN load control is supported and activated at the PGW, the PGW should
advertise the APN load information. If the APN level load control feature is
supported at the node performing the PGW selection, i.e. an MME, S4-SGSN,
ePDG, TWAN, the node shall utilize this information when selecting the PGW.
#### 12.2.4.2 Justifications for APN load control support
Following are the justifications to support the APN level load control in the
network when the pre-condition specified in 12.2.3.1 is applicable:
**1) To achieve load balancing at the APN level granularity:** The PGW may be
configured to handle more than one APN in the network. In such a case, the PGW
may be additionally configured to allocate different resources for each of the
configured APNs, e.g. the PGW may be configured to handle \"X\" number of
sessions for the \"consumer\" APN and to handle \"Y\" number of session for
the \"corporate\" APN. The ratio of this limit, i.e. \"X\" and \"Y\", to the
PGW\'s capacity may not be the same across all the PGWs in the network. In
this case, the load information with node level granularity is not sufficient
and could result in a network where one PGW has more sessions for the
\"consumer\" APN while another PGW has more sessions for the \"corporate\"
APN. Thus, an evenly load balanced network at APN level load granularity
cannot be realized.
**2) To ensure effective overload control in the network:** If the
distribution of sessions at APN level is uneven, then there is a higher risk
of overload of some PGWs, as compared to other PGWs, e.g. the PGW handling
more sessions for \"consumer\" APN may have to handle more messages, (e.g.
generated due to mobility events resulting from a change of ULI, RAT type,
Serving GW, etc.) as compared to the PGW handling more sessions for the
\"stationary-machine\" APN. Hence, the PGW handling \"consumer\" APN sessions
may be at higher risk of overload, as compared to the other PGWs in the
network, and hence, this situation may result in poor overload control of the
network.
**3) To ensure an efficient node selection algorithm:** Based on the node
level load information, the source node, (e.g. the MME) may end-up selecting
the PGW for a new session for the given APN. However, the selected PGW may
reject the new session request, if it is running at 100% load capacity for the
given APN, or the new session request may be throttled by the source node
based on the overload information of the APN for the given PGW. Thus the new
session request may be denied, (i.e. rejected by the selected PGW or throttled
by the source node based on PGW\'s APN level overload information) while the
other PGW may have the capacity to handle the same. Thus, the lack of APN
level load information may result in inefficient node selection algorithm by
the source node.
#### 12.2.4.3 Elements of APN load control
To allow for an effective APN load control, at least the following information
(in addition to the other applicable information for load control as defined
in clause 12.2.5.1.2) is required to be advertised by the PGW, as part of the
APN level load information:
**APN** : The APN for which the PGW wants to advertise the load information.
**APN-Load-Metric** : It indicates the current resource utilization for a
particular APN, as a percentage, compared to the total resources reserved for
that APN at the target PGW. Its computation is implementation dependent and it
has same characteristics as \"Load-Metric\", as described in clause
12.2.5.1.2.2, when applied at the APN level.
**APN-relative-capacity** : It indicates the total resources configured for a
given APN, compared to the total resources of the target PGW, as a percentage.
It is a static parameter and does not change unless the resources configured
for the APN change. Using APN-relative-capacity and the DNS weight-factor of
the given PGW, the source node can judge the PGW\'s APN related resources as
compared other PGWs in the network, i.e. the PGW\'s APN-weight-factor can be
calculated by multiplying the APN-relative-capacity and DNS-weight-factor of
the PGW (PGW\'s-APN-weight-factor = PGW\'s-APN-relative-capacity X DNS-weight-
factor).
For the following example configuration:
PGW1-APN1-relative-capacity = 50%; PGW2-APN1- relative-capacity = 20%;
PGW3-APN1- relative-capacity = 10%
PGW1-weight-factor = 20; PGW2-weight-factor = 20; PGW3-weight-factor = 60;
The APN level weight-factor for each of the PGWs can be calculated as below:
PGW1-APN1-weight-factor = 50% X 20 = 10.
PGW2-APN1-weight-factor = 20% X 20 = 4.
PGW3-APN1-weight-factor = 10% X 60 = 6.
Thus, based on the APN-weight-factor it can be concluded that the PGW1 has
highest APN1 related resources reserved, as compared to the other PGWs in the
network. Hence the source node should use this information to favour PGW1 over
other PGWs for APN1 related new session requests.
### 12.2.5 Load Control Information
#### 12.2.5.1 Definition
##### 12.2.5.1.1 General description
Within a message, one or multiple instances of the Load Control Information
(LCI) IE may be included by the same GTP-C entity.
When providing load control information in a message for the first time or
subsequently, the GTP-C entity shall always include the full set of load
control information, i.e. all the node level and APN Level applicable
instances of the Load Control Information, even if only a subset of the load
control information has changed. All the instances of the LCI IE provided by a
given GTP-C entity in a message shall contain the same Load-Control-Sequence-
Number. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the
load control information is changed (see clause 12.2.5.1.2.1).
The receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer
with the newly received load control information (via one or multiple
instances) from the same peer node if the new load control information is more
recent than the old information as indicated by the Load Control Sequence
Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored \'X\' instances of the load control
information for a peer node, it overwrites those \'X\' instances with the new
set of \'Y\' instances received in a message from the same peer node, where X,
Y are any integer number.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance
of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for node selection.
When more than one instance of the LCI IE is received, the receiver shall
consider the parameters included in each instance independently, when using
this information for node selection.
The parameters are further defined in clauses 12.2.5.1.2 and 12.2.5.1.3.
Load control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized
as:
  * Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _not critical_ for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the load control information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.
  * Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _critical_ for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the load control information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any
instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver\'s
capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or
more critical optional parameter in any instance of the LCI IE towards a
receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters.
The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by
configuration; (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new
parameter in future).
Each instance of the LCI IE shall be associated to the node identity (FQDN or
IP address of the GW node received from the HSS or the DNS) of the serving SGW
or PGW, i.e. the identity determined during the SGW or PGW selection.
NOTE: The Node type is derived based on the instance number of the LCI IE.
##### 12.2.5.1.2 Parameters
###### 12.2.5.1.2.1 Load Control Sequence Number
The Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the sequence
number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be used to
differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances by the same
GTP-C entity. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be supported (if load
control is supported) and shall always be present in the LCI IE.
The GTP-C entity generating this information shall increment the Load Control
Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the Load Control
Information IE. The Load Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented
otherwise. The node may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer
format, of the generation of the Load Control Information to populate the Load
Control Sequence Number.
When multiple instances of the LCI IE are provided in a message by a given
GTP-C node, each of them shall contain the same Load Control Sequence Number
value.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the Load Control Information
IE to properly collate out-of-order load control information, e.g. due to
GTP-C retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of
the LCI IE to determine whether the newly received load control information
has changed compared to load control information previously received from the
same node earlier.
NOTE: The GTP-C sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-order load
control information as e.g. load control information may be sent in both GTP-C
requests and responses, using independent GTP-C sequence numbering.
If the receiving entity has already received and stored load control
information from the peer GTP-C entity, the receiving entity shall update its
load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number received in
the new load control information is higher than the stored value of the Load
Control Sequence Number associated with the peer GTP-C entity. However due to
roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or restart of the node, the Load
Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer
GTP-C entity, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and
process) a Load Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the
previous value.
###### 12.2.5.1.2.2 Load Metric
The Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the
originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to
implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as: the used
capacity of the node based on activated bearers in relationship to maximum
number of bearers the node can handle, the load that these active bearers
produce in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in relationship to the total
memory/CPU available, etc.).
The Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a
percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100
means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).
The Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load
Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control
Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node selection
algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender should refrain
from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2),
in the Load Metric which does not result in useful improvement in node
selection logic at the receiver. During the typical operating condition of the
sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be
considered as reasonable enough for advertising the new Load Control
Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new
information) of the receiver.
NOTE: The range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender
to collect its own load information at every increment/decrement and hence to
advertise the change of Load Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various
implementation specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and
signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free to define
its own logic and periodicity with which its own load information is
collected.
###### 12.2.5.1.2.3 List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity
The List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity parameter contains a list of the tuple
(APN, Relative Capacity) and this indicates one or more APNs for which the
Load Control Information is applicable. The \"APN\" contains the name of the
APN and the Relative Capacity indicates the resources configured for a given
APN, compared to the total resources configured at the target PGW, as a
percentage.
When present in the LCI IE, the scope of the load information shall be the
list of indicated APNs for the PGW that sends the load control information. In
that case, the \"Load Metric\" shall be interpreted as an \"APN-Load-Metric\"
and shall indicate the current resource utilization for the indicated APNs, as
a percentage, as compared to the total resources configured for the indicated
APNs at the target PGW.
Its computation is implementation dependent and it has the same
characteristics as \"Load Metric\". Only one instance of the List-Of-
APN_and_Relative Capacity IE may be included within one Load Control
Information instance.
NOTE 1: The maximum number of tuples (APN, Relative Capacity) in the List-of-
APN_and_Relative Capacity IE is set to 10. More than 10 occurrences of (APN,
Relative Capacity), within one single instance of the List-of-APN_and_Relative
Capacity IE is treated as protocol error by the receiver.
If the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE has not been included, the scope
of the Load Control Information shall be the entire PGW node (unless
restricted by other parameters in the LCI IE).
This parameter may be supported (if load control is supported) and shall be
supported when APN level load control is supported.
The receiver shall handle this parameter, when it is received, if it supports
APN level load control. The receiver shall ignore a Load Control Information
instance applicable for an APN, if it does not support APN level load control.
NOTE 2: The PGW encodes the APN level load information and node level load
information using different instance numbers in the message, so that the
receiver will ignore the APN level load information, if it does not support
the APN level load control feature.
The maximum number of APNs, for which the PGW may advertise the Load Control
Information, shall be limited to 10, i.e. the maximum number of occurrences of
the tuple (APN, Relative Capacity) within and across various instances of the
LCI IE shall be limited to 10, for a given PGW. Hence, if the PGW supports
more than 10 APNs, it shall advertise the load control information for at most
10 of the most important APNs. In future, if needed, this limit may be
increased to allow the PGW to advertise the load information for more APNs. In
that case, the receiver not supporting the higher limit shall handle the first
10 APNs and shall ignore the load information for the remaining APNs.
NOTE 3: The limit of the number of APN\'s takes into account various aspects
such as: the processing and storage requirements at the overloaded node and
the receiver, the number of important APNs for which load control
advertisement will be necessary and interoperability between the nodes.
When including load control information for some APN(s), the PGW shall also
provide node level load control information by providing one instance of the
Load Control Information without the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity
parameter.
A node selecting a PGW for a given APN shall apply the APN level load
information, if available for that APN. If this parameter is not received for
a given APN but it has been received for other APN(s) from the same PGW, then
for this given APN, the node performing PGW selection shall calculate the load
metric, as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [32], for the target PGW.
##### 12.2.5.1.3 Handling of parameters
If the PLMN supports the Load Control feature (see clause 12.2.6), the
support, inclusion and handling of the parameters, within Load Control
Information, is summarized in table 12.2.5.1.3-1.
Table 12.2.5.1.3-1: Parameters of the Load Control Information
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Parameter | Support by | Support by | Inclusion | Handling by | | | the sender | the | by the | the | | | | receiver | sender | receiver | +=============+=============+=============+=============+=============+ | Load | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | | Control | | | | | | sequence | | | | | | number (as | | | | | | defined in | | | | | | clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .2.5.1.2.1) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Load Metric | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | | (as defined | | | | | | in clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .2.5.1.2.2) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | List | Optional | Optional | Optional | Conditional | | -of-APN_an | | | | | | d_Relative | (NOTE 1) | (NOTE 1) | (NOTE 2) | (NOTE 3) | | Capacity | | | | | | (as defined | | | | | | in clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .2.5.1.2.3) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | NOTE 1: | | | | | | This is an | | | | | | optional | | | | | | parameter | | | | | | that shall | | | | | | be | | | | | | supported, | | | | | | if APN | | | | | | level load | | | | | | control is | | | | | | supported. | | | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: The | | | | | | PGW shall | | | | | | send this | | | | | | parameter | | | | | | whilst | | | | | | providing | | | | | | APN level | | | | | | load | | | | | | control | | | | | | i | | | | | | nformation, | | | | | | if the APN | | | | | | level load | | | | | | control | | | | | | feature is | | | | | | supported | | | | | | and | | | | | | enabled. | | | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 3: If | | | | | | this | | | | | | parameter | | | | | | is | | | | | | received, | | | | | | the | | | | | | receiver | | | | | | supporting | | | | | | the APN | | | | | | load | | | | | | control | | | | | | feature | | | | | | shall | | | | | | handle and | | | | | | process APN | | | | | | load | | | | | | control | | | | | | i | | | | | | nformation. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
#### 12.2.5.2 Frequency of inclusion
How often the sender includes the load control information is implementation
specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load control information is
propagated to the target receivers within an acceptable delay, such that the
purpose of the information (i.e. effective load balancing) is achieved. The
sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as follows:
\- the sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only when
the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;
\- the sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every
message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;
\- the sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e. include
the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second
period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control
Information only in a subset of the applicable GTP-C messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in any
of the GTP-C messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception, shall
be able act upon the received load control information.
#### 12.2.5.3 Limit on maximum number of instances
A GTP-C entity may signal one or multiple instances of the LCI IE, with each
providing load control information for a different scope. In order to limit
the processing of the message on the receiver side and the size of the message
on transport level, the number of load control information instances shall be
limited:
\- at message level: there shall be at most one instance of node level LCI IE
per node (i.e. per SGW or PGW) and at most 10 APN level instances.
\- at node level: the maximum number of instances of LCI IE which may be
provided across multiple messages by a given node shall be the same as the
maximum number of instances of LCI IE at message level.
### 12.2.6 Discovery of the support of the feature by the peer node
A GTP-C entity shall determine whether to use the load control feature (i.e.
provide or handle load control information)
\- within the PLMN, based on the operator\'s policy (local PLMN-wide
configuration);
\- across the PLMN boundaries, based on the operator\'s policy (local
configuration per PLMN).
> NOTE: The feature may be activated when all or some of the nodes in the PLMN
> support the feature. The GTP-C entity assumes that all of the peer nodes
> support this feature when the feature is activated, i.e. it does not need to
> determine which peers support the feature.
The above operator policy/local configuration may allow the use of load
control at node level, load control at node level and APN level, or none.
### 12.2.7 Issues in the network with partial support of the feature
The Load Control feature should be supported homogenously across all the SGWs
and PGWs in the network. Not supporting this feature homogeneously across the
SGWs and PGWs may result in poor load balancing in the network such that the
SGWs or PGWs not supporting the feature may operate near their maximum
capacity (thus being more vulnerable to overload conditions) while SGWs or
PGWs supporting the feature have free capacity.
The Load Control feature should be supported homogenously across all the MMEs,
S4-SGSNs, ePDGs and TWANs. However, use of the feature when not all of these
nodes support the feature may not necessarily create a problem since the load
may remain fairly balanced across the SGWs and PGWs assuming that the network
imbalance caused by the non-supporting node may get rectified by the
supporting nodes making use of dynamic load information while selecting the
SGWs and PGWs.
## 12.3 Overload control solution
### 12.3.1 Principles of overload control
The stage 2 requirements on GTP-C overload control are defined in clause
4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].
The high level principles are summarized below:
a) Overload control is an optional feature;
b) a GTP-C entity may signal its overload to its GTP-C peers by including
Overload Control Information in GTP-C signalling which provides guidance to
the receiving GTP-C entity to decide actions which lead to signalling traffic
mitigation towards the sender of the information;
c) the Overload Control Information may provide the overload information of a
GTP-C entity, e.g. a PGW, or a specific APN(s) associated with the GTP-C
entity;
d) an MME/S4-SGSN may signal an overload to the PGW, via the SGW. An SGW may
signal an overload to the MME/S4-SGSN and to the PGW. A PGW may signal an
overload to the MME/S4-SGSN, via the SGW. For non-3GPP access based
interfaces, a PGW may signal an overload to the ePDG and the TWAN; the ePDG
and the TWAN may signal an overload to the PGW.
NOTE 1: An MME/S4-SGSN will not signal an overload to the SGW (i.e. the SGW
will not perform overload control towards the MME/S4-SGSN), as this is
redundant with DDN throttling (see clause 12.3.3).
e) the overload control feature should continue to allow for preferential
treatment of priority users (eMPS) and emergency services;
f) the Overload Control Information is piggybacked in GTP control plane
request or response messages such that the exchange of the Overload Control
Information does not trigger extra signalling;
NOTE 2: The inclusion of Overload Control Information in existing messages
means that the frequency increases as the signalling load increases, thus
allowing faster feedback and better regulation.
g) the computation and transfer of the Overload Control Information shall not
add significant additional load to the GTP-C entity itself and to its
corresponding peer GTP-C entities. The calculation of Overload Control
Information should not severely impact the resource utilization of the GTP-C
entity, especially considering the overload situation;
h) clause 4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 4.5 of 3GPP TS 23.402
[45] provides examples of various potential overload mitigation actions based
on the reception of the overload related information exchanged between GTP-C
entities, for 3GPP access based interfaces and non-3GPP access based
interfaces, respectively. However, the exact internal processing logics of a
GTP-C entity will not be standardized;
i) for the inter-PLMN case, local configuration may restrict the exchange and
use of Overload Control Information across PLMNs;
j) the GTP-C entity may decide to send different values of Overload Control
Information on inter-network (roaming) and on intra-network (non-roaming)
interfaces based on local configuration, i.e. the values sent on intra-network
interfaces may differ from the values sent on inter-network interfaces.
However, on intra-network interfaces, the GTP-C entity should send the same
values between the 3GPP and non-3GPP access based interfaces;
### 12.3.2 Applicability to 3GPP and non-3GPP access based interfaces
The Overload Control feature may be supported on the 3GPP & non-3GPP access
based interfaces and nodes as summarized by the Table 12.3.2-1.
Table 12.3.2-1: Applicability of overload control to 3GPP & non-3GPP access
based GTP-C interfaces and nodes

NOTE: Refer to Annex D.2 for information on the GTP-C interfaces for which
Overload Control is not supported.
### 12.3.3 Node level overload control
Node level overload control refers to advertising of the overload information
at node level, i.e. overload information at node level granularity, and
applying the mitigation policies towards the target node based on this
information. This helps in preventing severe overload and hence potential
breakdown of the GTP-C node.
When a GTP-C entity determines that the offered incoming signalling traffic is
growing (or is about to grow) beyond its nominal capacity, it may signal an
Overload Control Information IE to instruct its GTP-C peers to reduce the
offered load accordingly.
Overload Control is performed independently for each direction between two
GTP-C entities. Overload Control may run concurrently, but independently, for
each direction between the two GTP-C entities.
Overload control of SGW originated traffic towards the MME/S4-SGSN shall rely
on Downlink Data Notification throttling, as specified in clause 4.3.7.4.1a of
3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 5.3.6.5 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], with the addition that
the SGWs should be allowed, by configuration, to throttle DDN requests for low
priority, as well as normal priority traffic (the SGW shall then throttle by
priority DDN requests for low priority traffic).
### 12.3.4 APN level overload control
#### 12.3.4.1 General
APN level overload control refers to advertising of the overload information
at APN level granularity and hence applying the mitigation policies based on
this information to the signalling traffic related to this APN only. Only a
PGW may advertise APN level overload information when it detects overload for
certain APNs, e.g. based on shortage of internal or external resources for an
APN (e.g. IP address pool).
NOTE: When all the internal and external resources, applicable to the APNs,
are available for all the APNs served by a PGW, the node level overload
information is exactly the same as APN level overload information of that PGW,
for each of its APNs, and hence, performing node overload control can be
sufficient.
#### 12.3.4.2 Elements of APN overload control
For allowing the effective APN overload control, at least the following
information (in addition to the other applicable information for overload
control as defined in clause 12.3.5.1.2) are required to be advertised by the
source node, as part of the APN level overload information:
**APN** : The APN for which the source node wants to advertise the overload
information;
**APN-Overload-Reduction-Metric** : It indicates the requested overload
reduction for the signalling traffic corresponding to a particular APN, as a
percentage. Its computation is implementation dependent and it has the same
characteristics as the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\", described in
clause12.3.5.1.2.1, when applied at APN level.
### 12.3.5 Overload Control Information
#### 12.3.5.1 Definition
##### 12.3.5.1.1 General description
Within a message, one or multiple instances of the Overload Control
Information (OCI) IE may be included by the same GTP-C entity. Each instance
shall provide information about the overload condition to allow the receiver
to apply mitigation actions which will result in an efficient alleviation of
the overload condition at the sender.
The GTP-C entity shall always include the full set of overload control
information, i.e. all the node level and/or APN level applicable instances of
the OCI IE, when signalling overload control information in a message for the
first time or subsequently towards the receiver, even when only a subset of
the overload control information has changed. All the instances of the OCI IE
provided by a given GTP-C entity in a message shall contain the same Overload
Control Sequence Number. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall be
incremented whenever the overload control information is modified (see clause
12.3.5.1.2.1).
When including overload control information for some APN(s), the PGW should
not provide any node level Overload Control Information unless the node level
information is also applicable.
The receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a peer
with the newly received overload control information (received via one or
multiple instances of OCI IE) from the same GTP-C peer entity, if the new
information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the
Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored \'X\'
instances of the OCI IE for a peer GTP-C entity, it shall overwrite those
\'X\' instances with the new set of \'Y\' instances received in a message from
the same GTP-C peer entity, where X, Y are any integer numbers.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance
of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload mitigation action.
When more than one instance of the OCI IE is included, the receiver shall
consider the parameters included in each instance independently, while
applying the overload mitigation action.
The parameters are further described in clauses 12.3.5.1.2 and 12.3.5.1.3.
Overload control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized
as:
\- Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not
critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly
comprehend the Overload Control Information instance, containing one or more
of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-
critical optional parameters.
\- Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical
for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the Overload Control
Information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameter(s) within
any instance of Overload Control Information, without having the knowledge of
the receiver\'s capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only
include one or more critical optional parameter(s) in any instance of Overload
Control Information towards a receiver, if the corresponding receiver is known
to support these parameter(s). The sender may be aware of this either via
signalling methods or by configuration; this will have to be defined when
introducing any such new parameter in the future.
Each instance of the OCI shall be associated by default to the GTP-C entity
corresponding to the peer node\'s IP address of the PDN connection, over which
the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the \"Sender
F-TEID for control plane\" IE, the \"PGW S5/S8/ S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based
interface or for GTP based Control Plane interface\" IE or within the
\"MME/S4-SGSN Identifier\" IE.
Alternatively, the GW (i.e. SGW and PGW) nodes may send Overload Control
Information which is associated with the GW node\'s identity, i.e. the FQDN or
IP address of the GW node received from the HSS (for a PGW) or the DNS (for an
SGW or PGW), the identity determined during the GW selection. In that case,
the GW node shall provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE included in
the message belongs to the GW node\'s identity.
##### 12.3.5.1.2 Parameters
###### 12.3.5.1.2.1 Overload Control Sequence Number
The GTP-C protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same contents
as the original message (see clause 7.6). Due to GTP-C retransmissions, the
overload control information received by a GTP-C entity at a given time may be
less recent than the overload control information already received from the
same GTP-C entity. The Overload Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the
overload control information received from an overloaded GTP-C entity. The
Overload Control Sequence Number contains a value that indicates the sequence
number associated with the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence
number shall be used to differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two
different instants, by the same GTP-C entity.
The Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when
supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the
Overload Control Information IE.
The GTP-C entity generating this information shall increment the Overload
Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE. The
Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The GTP-C
entity may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the
generation of the overload control information, to populate the Overload
Control Sequence Number.
When multiple instances of the OCI IE are provided in the same message by a
given GTP-C entity, each of the Overload Control Sequence Numbers shall have
the same value.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly collate
out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to GTP-C retransmissions. This parameter shall
also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine whether the newly
received overload control information has changed compared to the overload
control information previously received from the same GTP-C entity. If the
newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control
Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information from
the same GTP-C peer, then the receiver may simply discard the newly received
overload control information whilst continuing to apply the overload abatement
procedures, as per the previous value.
NOTE 1: The timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see 12.3.5.1.2.2)
is not restarted if the newly received overload control information has the
same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload
control information. If the overload condition persists and the overloaded
GTP-C entity needs to extend the duration during which the overload
information applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload control
information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number (even if the
parameters within the overload control information have not changed).
NOTE 2: The GTP-C Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-order
overload information as e.g. overload control information may be sent in both
GTP-C requests and responses, using independent GTP-C sequence numbering.
If the receiving GTP-C entity already received and stored overload control
information, which is still valid, from the overloaded GTP-C entity, the
receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the
Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information is
larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated with
the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload Control
Sequence Number or restart of the GTP-C entity, the Overload Control Sequence
Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer GTP-C entity,
hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) an
Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the
previous value.
###### 12.3.5.1.2.2 Period of Validity
The Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the overload
condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid (unless
overridden by subsequent new overload control information).
An overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE is
received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE with a
new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number)
is received from the same GTP-C entity (at which point the newly received
overload control information shall prevail). The timer corresponding to the
period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI IE with a new set of
information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is
received. When this timer expires, the last received overload control
information shall be considered outdated and obsolete, i.e. any associated
overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.
The Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload
control).
The Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:
\- it avoids the need for the overloaded GTP-C entity to include the Overload
Control Information IE in every GTP-C messages it signals to its GTP-C peers
when the overload state does not change; thus it minimizes the processing
required at the overloaded GTP-C entity and its GTP-C peers upon
sending/receiving GTP-C signalling;
\- it allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the GTP-C
peers having received an overload indication from the overloaded GTP-C entity,
e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these GTP-C entities for
some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes the need for
the overloaded GTP-C entity to remember the list of GTP-C entities to which it
has sent a non-null overload reduction metric and to which it would
subsequently need to signal when the overload condition ceases, if the Period
of Validity parameter was not defined.
###### 12.3.5.1.2.3 Overload Reduction Metric
The Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100
(inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender of
the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An Overload
Reduction Metric of \"0\" always indicates that the GTP-C entity is not in
overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be applied) for
the indicated scope.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload Control
Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated Overload
Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every small
variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload Reduction
Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating the overload
situation. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger
variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be
considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction
Metric Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle
the new information) of the receiver.
NOTE: The range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate
the sender to collect its own overload information at every
increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload Reduction
Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific
criteria, such as the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the
current load/overload situation and so on, the sender is free to define its
own logic and periodicity with which its own overload control information is
collected.
The computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an
implementation choice at the sending GTP-C entity.
The Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload
control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.
The inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occuring, unless
the Overload Reduction Metric is set to 0, which signals that the overload
condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a message does
not mean that the overload has abated.
###### 12.3.5.1.2.4 List of APNs
The List of APNs IE indicates one or more APNs for which the Overload Control
Information is applicable. When present in the OCI IE, the scope of the
overload control information shall be the list of the indicated APNs for the
PGW that sends the overload control information. At most one instance of the
List of APNs IE shall be included within one Overload Control Information
instance.
NOTE 1: The maximum number of APNs in the List of APNs is set to 10. More than
10 occurrences of APN within one single instance of the List of APNs IE is
treated as a protocol error by the receiver.
If the List of APNs IE has not been included, the scope of the Overload
Control Information shall be the entire GTP-C entity (unless restricted by
other parameters in the Overload Control Information IE).
The List of APNs parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload
control). The List of APNs may be present or absent in the Overload Control
Information IE (depending on the scope of the reported overload control
information).
NOTE 2: The instance number of both the node-level and APN-level overload
control information is \"0\" and the instance number is therefore not used to
indicate if the scope of the overload control information is on PGW node level
or APN level.
This parameter may be provided by the PGW only and it shall be used by the
MME/S4-SGSN and the TWAN/ePDG only.
The maximum number of APNs, for which the PGW may advertise the Overload
Control Information, shall be limited to 10, i.e. the maximum number of
occurrences of APNs within and across various instances of the Overload
Control Information IE shall be limited to 10 for a given PGW. Hence, if the
PGW supports more than 10 APNs, it shall advertise the overload control for at
most 10 of the most important APNs. In future, if needed, this limit may be
increased to allow the PGW to advertise the overload information for more
APNs. In that case, the receiver that does not support the higher limit shall
only handle the first 10 APNs and ignore the overload information for the
remaining APNs to enable future compatibility.
NOTE 3: Considering various aspects such as: the processing and storage
requirements at the overloaded GTP-C entity and the receiver, the number of
important APNs for which overload control advertisement could be necessary,
interoperability between the nodes of various vendors, etc. it was decided to
define a limit on maximum number of APNs for advertising the overload control
information. It was decided to fix this limit to 10 whilst also ensuring that
the mechanism exists to extend this limit in future releases, if required.
##### 12.3.5.1.3 Handling of parameters
If the PLMN supports the Overload Control feature (see clause 12.3.11), the
support, inclusion and handling of the parameters, within overload control
information, is summarized in table 12.3.5.1.3-1.
Table 12.3.5.1.3-1: Parameters of the Overload Control Information
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Parameter | Support by | Support by | Inclusion | Handling by | | | the sender | the | by the | the | | | | receiver | sender | receiver | +=============+=============+=============+=============+=============+ | Overload | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | | Control | | | | | | Sequence | | | | | | Number (as | | | | | | defined in | | | | | | clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .3.5.1.2.1) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Period of | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | | Validity | | | | | | (as defined | | | | | | in clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .3.5.1.2.2) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Overload | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | Mandatory | | Reduction | | | | | | Metric (as | | | | | | defined in | | | | | | clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .3.5.1.2.3) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | List of | Mandatory | Mandatory | Optional | Conditional | | APNs (as | | | | | | defined in | | | (NOTE 1) | (NOTE 2) | | clause | | | | | | 12 | | | | | | .3.5.1.2.4) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | NOTE 1: The | | | | | | PGW shall | | | | | | send this | | | | | | parameter | | | | | | whilst | | | | | | providing | | | | | | APN level | | | | | | overload | | | | | | control | | | | | | i | | | | | | nformation. | | | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: If | | | | | | this | | | | | | parameter | | | | | | is | | | | | | received, | | | | | | the | | | | | | receiver | | | | | | shall | | | | | | handle and | | | | | | process APN | | | | | | level | | | | | | overload | | | | | | control | | | | | | i | | | | | | nformation. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
#### 12.3.5.2 Frequency of inclusion
How often or when the sender includes the overload control information is
implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload
control information is propagated to the target receivers with an acceptable
delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the effective overload
control protection) is achieved. The following are some of the potential
approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI IE:
  * the sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to the given receiver;
  * the sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards the receiver;
  * the sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a subset
of the applicable GTP-C messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information
received in any of the GTP-C messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such
reception, shall be able act upon the received information.
#### 12.3.5.3 Limit on maximum number of instances
A GTP-C entity may signal one or multiple instances of the OCI IE, each
instance providing overload control information for a different scope. The
receiver shall handle all these instances, from each of the peer GTP-C
entities, by processing, storing and acting upon the same foroverload control.
In order to limit the processing of the message on the receiver side and the
size of the message, the number of overload control information instances
shall be limited:
\- at message level: there shall be at most one instance of node-level
Overload Control Information IE per node and at most 10 APN-level instances.
\- at node level: the maximum number of instances of the OCI IE which may be
provided across multiple messages by a given node shall be the same as the
maximum number of instances of the OCI IE at message level.
### 12.3.6 Propagating the MME/S4-SGSN identity to the PGW
When the Overload Control feature is supported by the MME/S4-SGSN and the SGW,
and it is also activated for the PLMN to which the PGW belongs (see clause
12.3.11), the following shall apply:
  * The MME/S4-SGSN shall include the MME/S4-SGSN identity towards the SGW during:
\- the PDN connection establishment, any mobility with an MME/S4-SGSN change
or any SGW change procedures;
\- the dedicated bearer activation procedure, PGW initiated bearer
modification procedure and PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure as per
the conditions specified in the corresponding messages.
  * The SGW shall forward the MME/S4-SGSN identifier to the PGW if it is received in the Create/Update/Delete Bearer Response messages. When it is received in other GTP-C messages, the SGW shall store the received MME/S4-SGSN identity and shall include the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN\'s identity in subsequent Modify Bearer Request messages which are sent over the S5/S8 interface, whenever there is signalling over the S5/S8 interface.
NOTE: This allows updating of the PGW with the identity of the new MME/S4-SGSN
during inter-MME/SGSN mobility scenarios as early as possible and without
generating extra signalling over the S5/S8 interface. Inter-MME/inter-SGSN
intra SGW mobility scenarios not requiring to send any S5/S8 signalling could
result in the PGW not being updated with the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN\'s
identity, for a given subscriber, until subsequent S5/S8 signalling takes
place for the same PDN connection. However, considering these scenarios are
not so frequent and considering that several features anyway require S5/S8
signalling during these scenarios (e.g. for user location reporting), the PGW
will most often get the identity of the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN. Hence
the risk that the PGW wrongly throttles PGW initiated signalling for that PDN
connection, if the old MME/S4-SGSN is in overload, is low.
  * The PGW shall store the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN identity, received from the SGW, to be able to reduce the PGW initiated signalling messages for the PDN connections during an overload situation at the serving MME/S4-SGSN.
### 12.3.7 Updating the PGW with overload control information of the target
MME/S4-SGSN
During inter-MME/S4-SGSN mobility without SGW change scenarios, the SGW shall
forward the MME/S4-SGSN\'s overload control information over the S5/S8
interface only if the Modify Bearer Request message needs to be sent over the
S5/S8 for another reason, e.g. if the ULI, CGI, Serving Network, needs to be
reported to the PGW, i.e. the SGW shall not generate a Modify Bearer Request
message over the S5/S8 interface for the sole purpose of reporting the
MME/S4-SGSN\'s overload control information. This avoids generating extra
signalling over the S5/S8 interface.
NOTE: If the MME/S4-SGSN provides overload control information during the
scenarios which do not result in S5/S8 signaling, e.g. during an inter
MME/S4-SGSN and intra SGW mobility, when no other information such as: the
ULI, CGI or Serving Network, needs to be reported to the PGW, the overload
information will not be relayed on to the PGW. Hence, the MME/S4-SGSN needs
consider this when including overload control information.
### 12.3.8 The interaction with APN congestion control using the PGW Back-Off
Time
When detecting that a given APN is congested, the PGW shall either use the PGW
Back-Off Time mechanism (see clause 4.3.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]) or the APN
level overload control mechanism (i.e. providing an Overload Control
Information IE with an APN-List included) for that APN, but not both together
for the same APN, e.g. if the PGW provides an Overload Control Information IE
with an APN-List set to \"APN1\", it shall not reject Create Session Request
messages for \"APN1\" with a PGW Back-Off Time until the Period-Of-Validity of
the overload information previously sent has expired.
The PGW may however use both mechanisms concurrently for different APNs, e.g.
the PGW may reject Create Session Request messages for the\"APN2\" with a PGW
Back-Off Time IE, if the APN2 is also congested and if there is no on-going
APN-level overload control mechanism for that APN.
When rejecting a Create Session Request due to APN congestion, the PGW shall
set the \"APN Congestion\" cause, regardless of the aforementioned mechanisms.
If the MME/S4-SGSN or ePDG/TWAN has one mechanism active for a given APN and
PGW, (e.g. an MME has received a PGW Back-Off Time) and if subsequently it
receives information for the same APN and PGW for another mechanism, (e.g. the
MME receives an Overload Control Info IE with APN-List included for the same
APN), then it shall deactivate/stop the earlier mechanism and consider only
the information received for the latter mechanism.
Different PGWs may use concurrently different mechanisms for the same APN.
### 12.3.9 Message throttling
#### 12.3.9.1 General
As part of the overload mitigation, a GTP-C entity shall reduce the total
number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the
overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload Control
Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the messages
in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is called message
throttling.
Message throttling shall only apply to initial messages. Triggered request or
response messages should not be throttled since that would result in the
retransmission of the corresponding request message by the sender.
Before piggybacking the initial message over a response message, the initial
message should be subject to the message throttling in the similar manner as
any other non-piggybacked initial message. If the node decides to throttle
this initial message then the response message should be sent without any
piggyback message.
A GTP-C entity supporting GTP-C overload control shall support and use the
\"Loss\" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.
#### 12.3.9.2 Throttling algorithm -- \"Loss\"
##### 12.3.9.2.1 Description
An overloaded GTP-C entity shall ask its peers to reduce the number of
requests they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control Information
including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage, within the
\"Overload-Reduction-Metric\", as specified in clause 12.3.5.1.2.1.
The recipients of the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\" shall reduce the number of
requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an alternate
destination if possible (e.g. the Create Session Request message may be
redirected to an alternate SGW/PGW), or by failing the request and treating it
as if it was rejected by the destination GTP-C entity.
For example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is
sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would
have otherwise been sent to this GTP-C entity.
The overloaded GTP-C entity should periodically adjust the requested traffic
reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is currently in use,
the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level) and the desired
system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the rate of the
current overall received traffic.
Annex D.3.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation of
the \"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
NOTE 1: This algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic towards the
overloaded GTP-C entity will be less than the past traffic but it ensures that
the total traffic sent towards the overloaded GTP-C entity is less than what
would have been sent without any throttling in place. If after requesting a
certain reduction in traffic, the overloaded GTP-C entity receives more
traffic than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the worsening
rather than an improvement in the overload level, then the overloaded GTP-C
entity can request for more reduction in traffic. Thus, by periodically
adjusting the requested traffic reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that
it receives, approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.
NOTE 2: Since the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an
absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput towards the
overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the source nodes
(depending upon the events generated towards these source nodes by other
entities in the network), as a potential increase of traffic from some source
nodes can possibly be compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from
other source nodes.
#### 12.3.9.3 Message prioritization
##### 12.3.9.3.1 Description
When performing message throttling:
\- GTP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in 3GPP TS
22.153 [62]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending on
regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these GTP requests
shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic reduction, and the
priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling due to GTP overload control
up to the point where the requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved
without throttling the priority traffic;
\- for other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the
relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are considered as
low priority are considered for throttling before the other messages. The
relative priority of the messages may be derived from the relative priority of
the procedure for which the message is being sent (as specified in clause
12.3.9.3.2) or may be derived from the session parameters (as specified in
clause 12.3.9.3.3).
NOTE: A random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages without any
special consideration, could result in an overall poor congestion mitigation
mechanism and bad user experience.
An overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when
handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part of
the self-protection mechanism (see clause 12.3.10.2.3).
##### 12.3.9.3.2 Based on procedures
Message prioritization may be performed based on the relative priority of the
procedure for which the message is being sent. Procedures are grouped into
various categories and each of these categories is assigned a priority.
Additionally, within a given category of procedures, messages may be further
prioritized based on session parameters such as: APN, QCI, ARP and/or LAPI (as
described in clause 12.3.9.3.3).
Subsequently, messages with a high priority shall be given lower preference to
throttle and messages with low priority shall be given higher preference to
throttle.
The grouping of the procedures is not performed based on an individual GTP-C
entity but whilst considering all the procedures in general. A GTP-C entity
should consider the procedures applicable to it and apply prioritized message
throttling based on the category of the procedure, as described below. The
categories are listed in decreasing order of priority with category 1 having
the highest priority. For each category a non-exhaustive list of messages is
provided. Any existing or newly defined message in future should be considered
based on the category (as specified below) of the procedure for which the
message is sent.
1\. **UE session mobility within and across 3GPP or non-3GPP access:**
Procedures involving active or idle mode UE mobility, such that GTP-C
signalling is involved, shall be classified under this category. Some examples
are X2/S1 based handover with/without an SGW change, TAU/RAU with a change of
MME/SGSN with/without an SGW change, 3GPP access to trusted non-3GPP access
handover, etc. Throttling of these messages, during the procedures related to
UE session mobility, would result in the failure of the corresponding
procedures. This could result potentially in the loss of the PDN connection
and/or the interruption of the services. Hence, the messages, as identified
below, when sent during the procedures belonging to this category, shall be
considered with the highest priority and hence, shall be given the lowest
preference to throttle.
\- Create Session Request,
\- Create Session Request with \"handover\" indication bit set,
\- Modify Bearer Request,
\- Modify Bearer Request with \"handover\" indication bit set,
\- Modify Access Bearer Request.
2\. **Release of PDN connection or bearer resources:** Procedures resulting in
the deactivation of an existing PDN connection, the deactivation of bearer(s)
or of data forwarding tunnel of an UE leads to freeing up of the resources at
the overloaded node and hence, can potentially ease the overload situation,
since the freed up resources can be used for serving the remaining of the UEs.
Thus, the messages belonging to this category resulting in the deactivation of
PDN connection or bearer(s) or data forwarding tunnel(s), as identified below,
shall be treated with the next lower level of priority and hence shall be
given the corresponding preference whilst throttling:
\- Delete Session Request,
\- Delete Bearer Request,
\- Delete Bearer Command,
\- Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request.
3\. **Miscellaneous session management procedures:** This category shall
consist of the session management procedures, except PDN connection creation
and bearer creation/modification procedures. Some examples are location
reporting, when it is not combined with other mobility procedures, Service
request and S1 release procedure. These procedures do not severely impact the
on-going service of the UE. Hence, the messages, as identified below, when
sent during the procedures identified under this category, shall be treated
with the next lower level of priority and hence, shall be given the
corresponding preference whilst throttling:
\- Release Access Bearer Request,
\- Modify Bearer Request,
\- Change Notification,
\- Suspend Notification,
\- Resume Notification.
4\. **Request for new PDN Connection or bearer resources:** Procedures
requesting the creation of PDN connection, creation or modification of
bearer(s) or creation of data forwarding tunnel shall be classified in this
category. Throttling of the messages belonging to this category would result
in denial of new services while continuing with the existing services.
However, this is the natural outcome of an overload condition, i.e. the
overloaded node, due to lack of resources, is not able to provision new
services while the trying to maintain the existing services and hence, the
messages, as identified below, when sent during the procedures belonging to
this category, shall be considered with the lowest level of priority and hence
shall be given highest preference to throttle:
\- Create Session Request during PDN connection request,
\- Create Bearer Request,
\- Update Bearer Request,
\- Bearer Resource Command,
\- Modify Bearer Command,
\- Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request.
##### 12.3.9.3.3 Based on session parameters
Message prioritization may be performed based on the session parameters, such
as: APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator (LAPI). The procedures
and messages associated with the higher priority sessions shall be given
lesser preference whilst throttling, as compared to the procedures and
messages associated with the lower priority sessions. Within each group of
sessions, the messages may be further prioritized based on the category of the
procedure for which the message is being sent (as described in clause
12.3.9.3.2).
NOTE: This type of prioritization scheme ensures a good handling of all the
messages and procedures related to higher priority sessions but can lead to
throttle messages related to a critical procedure, e.g. UE mobility, for lower
priority sessions over messages related to less critical procedures, e.g.
location reporting, for a higher priority session.
##### 12.3.9.3.4 Based on the Message Priority signalled in the GTP-C message
Message prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when handling
incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the relative GTP-C
message priority signalled in the GTP-C header (see clauses 5.4 and 5.5).
A GTP-C entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority in
GTP-C signalling within the PLMN and/or across the PLMN boundaries, based on
operator policy and roaming agreements. The following requirements shall apply
if being used.
A sending GTP-C entity shall determine the relative message priority to signal
in the message according to the principles specified in clause 12.3.9.3.1. If
the message affects multiple bearers (e.g. Modify Bearer Request), the
relative message priority should be determined considering the highest
priority ARP among all the bearers.
A GTP-C entity should set the same message priority in a Triggered message or
Triggered Reply message as received in the corresponding Initial message or
Triggered message respectively.
The message priority values sent on intra-network interfaces may differ from
the values sent on inter-network interfaces. When messages cross PLMN
boundaries, the Message Priority in the GTP-C header may be stripped or
modified in these messages.
NOTE : This is to take into account that the priority definitions can vary
between PLMNs and avoid messages from a foreign PLMN to gain unwarranted
preferential treatment.
For incoming GTP-C messages that do not have a message priority in the GTP-C
header, the receiving GTP-C entity:
\- shall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is an Initial
message;
\- should apply the message priority sent in the Initial message or Triggered
message, if the incoming message is a Triggered or Triggered Reply message
(respectively).
This feature should be supported homogenously across the nodes in the network,
otherwise an overloaded node will process initial messages received from the
non-supporting nodes according to the default priority while initial messages
received from supporting nodes will be processed according to the message
priority signalled in the GTP-C message.
### 12.3.10 Enforcement of overload control
#### 12.3.10.1 General
When a GTP-C entity receives Overload Control Information from its peer, it
shall apply the overload abatement algorithm, based on the received
information, for the messages sent towards the peer GTP-C entity. This is
called \"enforcement of overload control\" and it involves throttling of the
messages targeted for the overloaded peer.
#### 12.3.10.2 Aspects related to enforcement of the overload control
##### 12.3.10.2.1 Good throughput of the network
A source GTP-C entity should avoid any mechanism resulting in over throttling
of the messages. Enforcement of the overload control whilst ensuring that good
throughput (i.e. measured in terms of the rate of total number of messages the
overloaded GTP-C entity can successfully process) of the network remains
consistent to that when no overload control is applied, should be one of the
prime objective of the source GTP-C entity.
NOTE: Over throttling of messages would negatively affect end user services
and cause potential additional signalling in the network e.g. if the
corresponding procedure is retried at a later time.
##### 12.3.10.2.2 Message processing efficiency at the source GTP-C entity
Enforcement of overload control requires extra logic and extra processing at
the source GTP-C entity. This is an overhead since the source GTP-C entity has
to spend its resources in an activity other than processing of the messages.
Hence, the implementation as well as the processing complexity of the
enforcement of the overload control, should not result in a significantly
poorer efficiency of the source GTP-C entity.
##### 12.3.10.2.3 Self-protection by the overloaded GTP-C entity
A source GTP-C entity enforcing the overload control cannot ensure that the
overloaded peer will not receive more messages than what it can handle during
the overload condition, e.g. the \"loss\" algorithm does not guarantee that
the future traffic reaches perfectly that requested by the overloaded GTP-C
entity. Hence, the overloaded target GTP-C entity shall protect itself from
the risk of meltdown even in a network where all the sending GTP-C entities
support the overload control mechanism. As a part of this self-protection, the
overloaded target GTP-C entity may reject the messages which it cannot handle
during an overloaded state. A GTP-C entity which decides to not process an
incoming request message due to overload should still send a reject response
message, if possible, indicating the temporary unavailability of the
resources; otherwise the request message may be dropped.
NOTE: Without a response message, the source GTP-C entity cannot determine
whether the request did not reach the target GTP-C entity due to a network
error or whether the target GTP-C entity was in overload and not able to
process the request and send a response message. This will cause the source
GTP-C entity to retransmit the request message and hence will increase further
the overload at the target node.
The GTP-C entity may apply message prioritization as described in clause
12.3.9.3 when selecting the incoming request messages to be throttled.
While rejecting the message due to overload, the GTP-C entity shall set the
cause to \"GTP-C Entity Congestion\" or \"APN congestion\" (for node level or
APN level overload respectively) and may include the Overload Control
Information in the rejection response as specified in clauses 12.3.5.1.1 and
12.3.11.
#### 12.3.10.3 Enforcement of overload control between GTP-C entities in
direct contact
A source GTP-C entity shall enforce overload control for traffic destined to a
GTP-C entity in direct contact based on the overload reduction metric received
from that peer, e.g. the MME applies the overload control for the messages
targeted for the SGW based on the overload information of the SGW.
#### 12.3.10.4 Enforcement of overload control between remote GTP-C entities
##### 12.3.10.4.1 Description
For messages destined to a remote GTP-C entity (i.e. a GTP-C entity not in
direct contact but reached via an intermediate GTP-C entity), the source GTP-C
entity shall enforce the overload control based on the overload information of
the target of the message, as well as the overload information of the
intermediate GTP-C entity, e.g. the MME applies the overload control for
messages targeted for the PGW based on the overload information of the SGW and
PGW.
For the received messages, the intermediate GTP-C entity shall not further
enforce any overload control and hence, shall not reject any message towards
the source GTP-C entity.
Annex D.4.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation.
NOTE 1: This approach ensures the overload protection of the Target as well as
Intermediate GTP-C entities.
NOTE 2: The source GTP-C entity may be connected to the same Target GTP-C
entity via multiple different Intermediate GTP-C entities. The exact algorithm
used at the source GTP-C entity to enforce the overload control, as per the
aforementioned requirements, is implementation specific.
### 12.3.11 Discovery of the support of the feature by the peer node
A GTP-C entity shall determine whether to use the overload control feature:
\- within the PLMN, based on operator\'s policy (local PLMN-wide
configuration);
\- across the PLMN boundaries, based on operator\'s policy (local
configuration per PLMN).
> NOTE: The feature can be activated when all or some of the nodes in the PLMN
> support the feature. The GTP-C entity assumes that all the peer nodes
> support this feature when the feature is activated, i.e. it does not need to
> determine which peers support the feature.
The above operator policy/local configuration may allow the use of overload
control at node level and APN level, or none.
### 12.3.12 Issues in the network with partial support of the feature
The Overload Control feature should be supported homogenously across the nodes
in the network, otherwise:
\- an overloaded node will get messages beyond its acceptable processing
capacity, even after announcing its overload status. This may result in severe
overload and possibly a breakdown of the node;
\- a non-supporting node will get an unfair advantage in sending all the
messages to an overloaded node, whereas a supporting node, would be requested
to throttle more messages.
### 12.3.13 Implicit overload control mechanisms
Implicit overload control mechanisms are mechanisms used between GTP-C
entities when GTP-C overload control is not supported or not enabled between
them, e.g. across PLMN boundary based on operator\'s policy, to help reducing
the overload at the overloaded node:
\- a GTP-C entity which decides to not process an incoming request message due
to overload should still send a reject response message, if possible,
indicating the temporary unavailability of the resources, e.g. No resources
available; otherwise the GTP-C entity may drop the incoming request message.
NOTE: Without a response message, the source GTP-C entity cannot determine
whether the request did not reach the target GTP-C entity due to a network
error or whether the target GTP-C entity was in overload and not able to
process the request and send a response message. This will cause the source
GTP-C entity to retransmit the request message and hence will increase further
the overload at the target node.
\- a GTP-C entity in overload may support messages throttling as a self
protection mechanism and may apply message prioritization as described in
clause 12.3.9.3 when selecting the incoming request messages to be throttled;
\- based on the number and rate of reject responses indicating temporary
unavailability of resources, e.g. No resources available, a source GTP-C
entity should try to assess the overload level of the target GTP-C entity and
apply correspondingly message throttling as described in clause 12.3.9 to
reduce the amount of traffic sent towards the overloaded GTP-C entity.
# 13 Detection and handling of late arriving requests
## 13.1 General
The procedures specified in this clause aim at handling more efficiently
requests which may arrive late at upstreams entities, e.g. in networks
experiencing processing or transport delays.
These procedures are optional to support. When supported, the use of these
procedures is dependent on operator policy.
The procedure specified in clause 13.2 may be used with or without the
procedure specified in clause 13.3. The procedure specified in clause 13.3
shall only be used in conjunction with the procedure specified in clause 13.2.
## 13.2 Detection and handling of requests which collide with an existing
session context
### 13.2.1 General
This procedure enables an entity, which receives a request colliding with an
existing session context, to know the time at which the new request and the
existing session were originated, and to accept the new request only if it is
more recent than the existing session.
The originating entities within the PLMN (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN and ePDG) shall
be NTP synchronized.
### 13.2.2 Principles
The following principles shall apply if this procedure is supported and
enabled by operator policy.
A GTP-C entity originating a Create Session Request (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN or
ePDG) shall include in the message the Origination Time Stamp indicating the
absolute time at which the request is initiated.
The SGW shall forward this parameter over the S5/S8 interface, if it is
received from the MME/SGSN.
Upon receipt of a session establishment request which collides with an
existing session context, the PGW shall accept the new session establishment
request only if it contains a more recent time stamp than the time stamp
stored for the existing session. An incoming session request shall be
considered as more recent than an existing session and be accepted if no
Origination Time Stamp information was provided for at least one of the two
sessions. The PGW shall reject an incoming request whose time stamp is less
recent than the time stamp of the existing session with the cause \'Late
Overlapping Request\'.
3GPP TS 29.212 [29] and 3GPP TS 29.273 [68] further specify:
\- the PGW requirements regarding the forwarding of the Origination Time Stamp
parameter over the Gx and/or S6b interfaces, when received from the SGW or
TWAN/ePDG;
\- the handling of the Origination Time Stamp parameter by the PCRF and 3GPP
AAA Server for an incoming request colliding with an existing session context.
An originating entity which detects a NTP failure shall not include the
Origination Time Stamp towards other entities.
## 13.3 Detection and handling of requests which have timed out at the
originating entity
### 13.3.1 General
This procedure enables an entity which receives a request to know when the
request times out at the originating entity, and to stop further processing,
at the receiver and further upstream entities, a request which has timed out
at the originating entity.
The originating entities (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN and ePDG) and the receiving
entities (i.e. SGW, PGW, PCRF, 3GPP AAA Server) shall be NTP synchronized.
This procedure may be used between entities pertaining to the same PLMN, and
if allowed by operator policy, between entities pertaining to different PLMNs.
This procedure shall not affect the setting of the retransmission timers by
intermediate entities. E.g. the SGW shall set its T3 and N3 retransmission
parameters as specified in this specification, irrespective of the time at
which the request times out at the originating entity.
### 13.3.2 Principles
The following principles shall apply if this procedure is supported, enabled
by operator policy and if the PGW pertains to the same PLMN as the originating
entity or if the PGW pertains to a different PLMN and operator policy in the
originating entity allows to use this procedure towards this PLMN.
A GTP-C entity originating a Create Session Request (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN or
ePDG) shall include in the message the Origination Time Stamp indicating the
absolute time at which the request is initiated, as specified in clause
13.2.2, and the Maximum Wait Time indicating the maximum time period to
complete the processing of the request. The Maximum Wait Time, together with
the Origination Time Stamp, indicates the absolute time at which the request
times out at the originating entity.
**The MME/SGSN shall set the Maximum Wait Time to a value** smaller or equal
to (N3+1) x T3 set in the SGW, to avoid upstream entities continuing to
process requests which would have ceased to be processed by the SGW, which
could result in hanging contexts in upstream entities.
NOTE 1: If the Maximum Wait Time is set to a value smaller than N3 x T3 set in
the SGW, the SGW actually stops retransmitting a given GTP-C Create Session
Request as soon as it receives a rejection response from the PGW due to the
expiry of the Maximum Wait Time. I.e. the Maximum Wait Time actually leads to
shorten the duration during which the SGW retransmits the GTP-C request.
The SGW shall forward the Origination Time Stamp over the S5/S8 interface as
specified in clause 13.2.2. The SGW shall also forward the Maximum Wait Time
over the S5/S8 interface, if received from the MME/SGSN.
Upon receipt of a request which contains the Origination Time Stamp and the
Maximum Wait Time parameters, the receiving entity should check that the
request has not already timed out at the originating entity. The receiving
entity may perform additional similar checks during the processing of the
request, e.g. upon receipt of a response from the next upstream entity.
The receiving entity should reject a request that is known to have timed out
with the cause \'Timed Out Request\'; it may alternatively drop the request.
Besides, the receiving entity should initiate the release of any session it
may have successfully created towards an upstream entity, to avoid hanging
sessions in the network.
NOTE 2: Sending a rejection response over the last hop towards the originating
node, i.e. over S11/S4 or S2a/S2b, is not useful as the request has timed out
at the originated entity.
In the context of this specification, the receiving entity refers to an SGW or
PGW.
3GPP TS 29.212 [29] and 3GPP TS 29.273 [68] further specify:
\- the PGW requirements regarding the forwarding of the Maximum Wait Time
parameter over the Gx and/or S6b interfaces, when received from the SGW or
TWAN/ePDG;
\- the handling of the Maximum Wait Time parameter by the PCRF and 3GPP AAA
Server.
An originating entity which detects a NTP failure shall not insert the
Origination Time Stamp and the Maximum Wait Time parameters towards other
entities. A receiving entity which detects a NTP failure shall ignore the the
Maximum Wait Time parameter.
# 14 Handling of Bearer Contexts Mismatch
## 14.1 General
Bearer Contexts mismatch among different EPC entities, e.g. MME/SGW/PGW, can
happen due to various reasons, e.g. transport network delay, signalling
overload.
## 14.2 Detection of Bearer Context Mismatch
Bearer Context mismatch can be detected by a receiving GTP-C entity in the
following cases:
\- when at least one dedicated bearer context in the request message is
unknown; or
\- when at least one dedicated bearer context is missing in the request
message in comparison to the bearer contexts stored; or
\- when receiving a response message indicating that one of the dedicated
bearer context(s) was unknown, by using the cause code \"Context not found\"
at the Bearer Context level. See also clause 8.4.
The Modify Bearer Request/Response and the Modify Access Bearer
Request/Response in particular enables an easy detection of bearer contexts
mismatch since all the bearer contexts, either of the PDN connection for a
Modify Bearer Request/Response or of all the UE\'s PDN connections for a
Modify Access Bearer Request/Response, need to be included in the messages.
## 14.3 Handling of Bearer Context Mismatch
### 14.3.1 General
The following requirements should apply:
1) When an EPC entity receives a response message, where one or more dedicated
bearer context(s) is associated with the Cause code \"Context Not Found\"
while the PDN connection is known by the peer, the EPC entity shall delete the
corresponding bearer context(s);
2) When an SGW receives a Modify Bearer Request, where one or more dedicated
bearer context(s) is missing in the request message in comparison to the
Bearer Context(s) stored for the UE\'s PDN connection, the SGW shall accept
the Modify Bearer Request message and delete the corresponding bearer
context(s) locally. The PGW shall apply the same behavior if the Modify Bearer
Request received at the PGW includes the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE;
3) When a SGW receives a Modify Bearer Request, where only one or more
dedicated bearer context(s) is unknown, the SGW shall accept the Modify Bearer
Request message partially and set the cause code \"Context Not Found\" for
those unknown bearer context(s) at Bearer Context level. The PGW shall apply
the same behavior if the Modify Bearer Request received at the PGW includes
the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE;
4) When a SGW receives a Modify Access Bearer Request, where one or more
dedicated bearer context(s) is missing in the request message in comparison to
the Bearer Context(s) stored for all the UE\'s PDN connections, the SGW shall
delete the corresponding bearer context(s) locally;
5) When a SGW receives a Modify Access Bearer Request, where only one or more
dedicated bearer context(s) is unknown, the SGW shall accept the Modify Access
Bearer Request message partially and set the cause code \"Context Not Found\"
for those unknown bearer context(s) at Bearer Context level.
NOTE: It is assumed the PGW can at least use a subsequent Modify Bearer
Request to resolve Bearer Context mismatch, so that the SGW need not send
explicit message to delete unknown Bearer Context.
### 14.3.2 Exceptional scenarios
During a dedicated bearer creation procedure, temporary Bearer Context
mismatch may occur at the SGW, e.g. due to the collision between Create Bearer
Request and Modify (Access) Bearer Request messages. Applying the general
requirements of clause 14.3.1 may in such case lead to unnecessary signalling
and cause extra latency. The SGW should handle such Bearer Context mismatch in
an implementation specific way, but in such a way to accept the Modify
(Access) Bearer Request message and to not locally delete the missing Bearer
Context.
During a Network Triggered Service Request procedure, which is triggered by a
dedicated bearer creation procedure towards a UE in Idle mode, the MME shall
include only the existing Bearer Contexts (not the new Bearer Contexts just
created) in the corresponding Modify (Access) Bearer Request message. The same
principle shall apply when piggybacking is used, i.e. when the Modify Bearer
Request is piggybacked in the Create Bearer Response message, the MME shall
include only the existing Bearer Contexts (not the new Bearer Contexts just
created) in the corresponding Modify (Access) Bearer Request message.
NOTE: During a Network Triggered Service Request procedure, which is triggered
by a dedicated bearer creation procedure towards a UE in Idle mode, bearer
mismatches can be avoided by the MME sending the Create Bearer Response only
after it receives the Modify Bearer Response message, however in some rare
cases, the signalling can be delayed for the UE, e.g. if the Modify Bearer
Response is lost.
###### ## Annex A (Informative): Backward Compatibility Guidelines for
Information Elements
In order to preserve backward compatibility, the following rules should apply
when adding or modifying information elements for existing messages.
\- No new mandatory (M) information elements should be added.
\- No new conditional (C) information elements should be added.
\- Any new IEs should be either:
optional (O), having no conditions on their presence, or
conditional-optional (CO), having conditions that should apply only to the
sender and not to the receiver.
Such conditions should be worded generally as follows: \"This IE shall be sent
over the xxx interface \. The receiving entity need not check the
IE\'s presence.\"
  * If any new conditions are added to a previously specified conditional (C) information element, these new conditions should apply only to the sender and not to the receiver.\ \ Such additional conditions should be worded generally as follows: \"This IE shall be sent over the xxx interface \. For this optional condition, the receiving entity need not check the IE\'s presence.\"\ \ Existing conditions for such conditional (C) IEs should be treated as before, and the presence of the IEs should remain conditional (C).
###### ## Annex B (Informative): Transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP IEs into
GTP IEs
## B.1 General
This annex provides details on how a GTPv2 entity transparently copies
information received from RANAP or S1AP into GTPv2 IE or IE field.
RANAP and S1AP ASN.1 encoding details in this annex are informative. The
reference specifications are 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10]
respectively.
The respective RANAP/S1AP Information Elements are transported on the Iu/S1
interface within a \"protocol-IE container\" which is composed of:
\- an Information Element Identity (referred to below as \"IE-ID\"),
\- an indication how the receiver shall react if the Information Element is
not comprehended (referred to below as \"criticality\"),
\- and an \"open type field\" which consists of a length indication (\"OT-
LI\") and the Information Element itself (referred to below as \"IE\").
RANAP/S1AP PDUs and the contained IEs are defined by means of ASN.1, the
specified encoding is PER (packed encoding rule), Octet aligned variant:
\- PER minimises the information sent on the respective interface to the
absolute minimum;
\- Hence, type definitions of fixed length are encoded without any type or
length indication, only type definitions of variable length contain a length
indication, e.g.
\- an OCTET STRING with indefinite length would need to contain a length
indication (referred to below as \"OCT-LI\") followed by the actual octets
(referred to below as \"octets\");
\- a SEQUENCE neither contains a type, nor a length-indication. Only in case
of optional elements it contains a kind of bit string with each position of
this bitstring indicating the presence of an OPTIONAL element (an encoded
SEQUENCE type is referred to below as \"sequence\").
## B.2 Handover/Relocation related generic transparent Containers over RANAP,
S1-AP and GTP
Handover/Relocation related generic transparent containers are defined in 3GPP
TS 25.413 [33] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] (\"Source to Target Transparent
Container\" IE and \"Target to Source Transparent Container\" IE) to carry
UTRAN, E-UTRAN or GERAN specific information via CN interfaces in a RAT-
agnostic way.
The encoding of these handover/relocation related generic transparent
containers is different in RANAP and S1-AP. See 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] Annex C.
The difference is that the \"Source to Target Transparent Container\" IE and
\"Target to Source Transparent Container\" IE are ASN.1 encoded over RANAP as
\"IE-ID\|\|criticality\|\|OT-LI\|\|octets\" (i.e. one length field only for
the open type field) and over S1AP as \"IE-ID\|\|criticality\|\|OT-LI\|\|OCT-
LI\|\|octets\" (i.e. with 2 length fields, one for the open type field (\"OT-
LI\"), one for the octet string encoding (\"OCT-LI\")), while \"octets\"
contain the actual RAT specific handover/relocation information.
_This gives the following chain of encodings (represented in the notation
introduced in the Notes above) end-to-end._
**[LTE to LTE]{.underline}**
**Figure B.2-1: LTE to LTE - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers**
In the case of LTE-LTE handover, the \"octets\" contain the \"Source eNB to
Target eNB Transparent Container\" (defined as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE in 3GPP TS
36.413[10]).
The source MME, after decoding the HO REQUIRED message of S1AP, passes
transparently the \"sequence\" to the target MME.
The target MME encodes similarly at target side with the same definitions: it
feeds the received \"sequence\" into the S1AP ASN.1 encoder in order to encode
the HO REQUEST message towards the target eNB. The \"sequence\" is then
extracted from the S1AP ASN.1 of eNB and given to application part of eNB.
**[LTE to 3G]{.underline}**
**Figure B.2-2: LTE to 3G - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers**
At source side, the same encoding is done but for LTE to 3G handover, this
time the \"octets\" on the line is the \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container\" (encoded according to the target system RANAP i.e. as an ASN.1
SEQUENCE in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33]).
Again the source MME passes transparently the \"sequence\" to the target MME
i.e. the \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\".
At the target side, the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message was not upgraded: the
\"sequence\" received from the Gn or S3 interface (\"Source RNC to Target RNC
Transparent Container\") is not encoded as an OCTET STRING as on S1, but
directly represent the \"Source To Target Transparent Container\" within the
RANAP:RELOCATION REQUEST message, which in case of inter-RAT handover to 3G
represent the \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\", transported
on the Iu interface as the \"IE\" part of the \"IE container\". There is no
additional length field added as on the S1 interface (\"OCT-LI\").
The target side remains therefore fully backwards compatible with UMTS release
7.
**[3G to LTE]{.underline}**
**Figure B.2-3: 3G to LTE - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers**
The RELOCATION REQUIRED message was upgraded from release 8 onwards renaming
the previously contained \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\" to
\"Source to Target Transparent Container\", being able to transport also a
\"Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container\".
Despite being defined as an octet string, in order to not impact the R7 SGSN,
the octet string was specified as \"to be replaced\" by either the UTRAN or
E-UTRAN specific container. This fact is explained e.g. within the NOTE in the
ASN.1 of 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] ], as shown in this excerpt:
Source-ToTarget-TransparentContainer ::= OCTET STRING
\-- This IE is a transparent container, the IE shall be encoded not as an
OCTET STRING but according to the type specifications of the target system.
_\-- Note: In the current version of this specification, this IE may either
carry the Source RNC to_
_\-- Target RNC Transparent Container or the Source eNB to Target eNB
Transparent Container IE as_
_\-- defined in [49]_
By so doing, the Release 7 source SGSN receives only one length field (the
\"OT-LI\") instead of two (the \"OT-LI and the \"OCT-LI\") as if it would
receive an \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\" from a Release 7
RNC, ensuring fully Release 7 backwards compatibility as requested by 3GPP TS
23.401 [3] Annex D. This is illustrated in Figure B.1-3 above.
As explained above, this Release 7 backwards compatibility constraint only
applies to RANAP to cope with Release 7 SGSN nodes and does NOT apply to LTE.
This is why the note is NOT present in the ASN.1 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] for
LTE i.e. the S1AP octet string does not need \"to be replaced\".
Then \"sequence\" is passed transparently to the target MME. The target MME
encodes the \"sequence\" within an OCTET STRING resulting in two length fields
as expected by target eNB ASN.1 S1AP decoder.
## B.3 Other RANAP and S1-AP IEs
When transparently copying a RANAP/S1AP IE, other than the handover/relocation
related generic transparent containers (see Annex B.1) into GTP IE, or GTP IE
field the following applies:
\- a transparent copy of a RANAP/S1AP IE, which is transported on the Iu/S1

###### ## Annex C (Normative): MME/S4-SGSN mapping table between S11/S4 and
NAS Cause values
The MME/S4-SGSN initiates session management requests towards the SGW and PGW
or mobility management requests towards the source/target MME/S4-SGSN. If this
operation is not successful, there are several possible cause codes, which
need to be mapped to the appropriate cause codes over NAS to the UE.
Additionally, the MME/S4-SGSN initiates session management requests towards
the UE. If this operation is not successful, there are several possible NAS
cause codes which need to be mapped to the appropriate GTP cause codes over
S11/S4 interface towards the SGW.
The MME/S4-SGSN should map these cause codes as defined in tables C.1 to C.5
unless specified otherwise in the tables.

###### ## Annex D (Informative): GTP-C load and overload control mechanism
## D.1 GTP-C interfaces not supporting Load Control
Load Control has been designed as a generic mechanism possibly applicable to
any GTP-C node. However, for the reasons clarified below, in the current
release, Load Control is not supported for the following GTP-C based
interfaces:
\- S3, S10, S16 (limited GTP-C signalling traffic, to minimize impact to the
MME/S4-SGSN);
\- Sm, Sn (limited GTP-C signalling traffic, to avoid impact to the MBMS GW);
\- Sv (limited GTP-C signalling traffic, to avoid impact to the legacy CS
products);
\- S101, S121 (to avoid impacts to the legacy HRPD products);
\- Gn/Gp (to avoid impact to the legacy Gn-SGSN/GGSN products and GTPv1-C
protocol).
## D.2 GTP-C interfaces not supporting Overload Control
Overload Control has been designed as a generic mechanism possibly applicable
to any GTP-C based interface and any direction. However for the reasons
clarified below, in the current release, Overload Control is not supported for
the following GTP-C based interfaces:
\- S3, S10, S16 (see considerations below, to minimize impact to MME and
S4-SGSN);
\- most of the S3 traffic would remain internal to the combo-node with the
deployment of combo-MME/S4-SGSN nodes. The traffic over S10/S16 is also
reduced with the deployment of MME and SGSN pools. It is therefore not
essential to throttle the traffic on these interfaces when an MME or S4-SGSN
experiences overload;
\- throttling signalling on these interfaces resulting from a user\'s mobility
(inter-MME/S4-SGSN TAU, RAU and Handover) would result in bad end user\'s
perception (handover failure, loss of PDN connections) and so needs to be
avoided as far as possible;
\- an MME or S4-SGSN in overload may drop locally incoming RIM messages
without causing GTP-C retransmissions (although this may cause the RAN to
retransmit the message).
\- S11/S4 (from an MME/S4-SGSN to an SGW, with SGW as consumer; see
consideration below);
\- by allowing the SGW to throttle DDN requests for normal priority traffic,
the overload control of the messages originated by the SGW towards the
MME/S4-SGSN is covered and hence, an SGW performing overload control towards
the MME/S4-SGSN using Overload Control Information would be redundant.
\- S5/S8 (from a PGW to an SGW, with the SGW as a consumer; no signalling
message, originated by the SGW towards the PGW, that is identified as
requiring overload control);
\- Sm, Sn (no overload scenario identified, limited GTP-C traffic, to avoid
impact to the MBMS GW);
\- Sv (no overload scenario identified, to avoid impact to the legacy CS
products);
\- S101, S121 (no overload scenario identified, to avoid impact to the legacy
HRPD products);
\- Gn/Gp (to avoid impact to the legacy Gn-SGSN/GGSN products and GTPv1-C
protocol);
## D.3 \"Loss\" throttling algorithm
## D.3.1 Example of possible implementation
This clause provides an example of a possible implementation of the \"Loss\"
algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
It is possible to make use of a statistical loss function (e.g., random
selection of messages to throttle based on the indicated percentage) to decide
if the given message can be sent or need to be throttled. For example, the
source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for each message which
is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10% throttling, messages
with a random number 10 or less are throttled and hence this achieves
approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic. The actual traffic
reduction might vary slightly from the requested percentage, albeit by an
insignificant amount.
The algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For
example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-
priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of dropping
the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in traffic
conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For example, in the
50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority messages, 20% reduction
to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high priority messages need to be
applied in order to achieve the effective reduction in traffic by 10% towards
the overloaded node.
## D.4 Enforcement of overload control between remote GTP-C entities
## D.4.1 Example of possible implementation
This clause provides an example of a possible implementation of the
enforcement of overload control between remote GTP-C entities, amongst other
possible methods, considering the example network topology described in Figure
D.4.1-1.
{width="6.686111111111111in" height="2.4881944444444444in"}
Figure D.4.1-1: Example network topology
The source GTP-C entity can apply message throttling according to the maximum
of the overload reduction metric reported by the intermediate and target GTP-C
entities, i.e. max (Intermediate_Overload-Metric, Target_Overload-Metric), for
each of the path between the source and the target GTP-C entities. Each path
is considered independently whilst performing the message throttling.
Considering the following example overload condition for the topology above:
Target_Overload-Metric = 30%
IntermediateA_Overload-Metric = 10%
IntermediateB_Overload-Metric = 20%
IntermediateC_Overload-Metric = 40%
Target_Terminated-Messages = 100
IntermediateA-Target_Messages = 20
IntermediateB-Target_Messages = 50
IntermediateC-Target_Messages = 30
the source GTP-C entity applies message throttling as follows:
Source-IntermediateA_Messages = 14 (message throttling of 30% applied)
Source-IntermediateB_Messages = 35 (message throttling of 30% applied)
Source-IntermediateC_Messages = 18 (message throttling of 40% applied)
Source-Target_Messages = 67 (the Target GTP-C entity receives 67 messages
although it could have handled 70 messages in the overloaded condition).
###### ## Annex E (Normative): TWAN mapping table between GTPv2 S2a Cause and
non-3GPP access Cause values
The TWAN initiates session establishment requests or mobility management
requests towards the PGW. If this operation is not successful, there are
several possible cause codes, which need to be mapped to the appropriate cause
codes over non-3GPP access to the UE.
The TWAN should map these cause codes as defined in Table E.1, Table E.2,
Table E.3 and Table E.4.
