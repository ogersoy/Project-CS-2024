# 1 Scope
This document contains a study of the security aspects of the Mission-Critical
service. It enhances the security solutions defined for MCPTT in TS 33.179 [3]
to support the common functional architecture (MC_ARCH), enhancements to MCPTT
(eMCPTT), data services (MCData), video services (MCVideo) and migration and
interconnect services with partner systems (MCSMI).
In each case, this study includes an analysis of the threats to the service,
the security requirements to mitigate those threats and an evaluation of
possible technical solutions designed to meet the security requirements of the
service.
Stage 2 aspects of the mission critical services are defined within TS 23.179
[2], TS 23.280 [8], TS 23.281 [9], TS 23.282 [10], TR 23.781 [11], TR 23.782
[12] and TS 33.179 [3]. Stage 1 requirements are defined in TS 22.179 [4], TS
22.280 [5], TS 22.281 [6] and TS 22.282 [7].

# 4 Overview of enhanced Mission Critical Services
## 4.1 Introduction
This document is intended to investigate and chose the appropriate security
solutions for the mission critical stage 1 requirements and stage 2
architecture definitions relating to mission critical enhancements for PTT,
Video, Data, Interconnect, Multicast and inter-domain operations. An overview
of the architecture is provided in clause 4.2.
This document addresses the key issues relating to protecting and securing the
information for the above mission critical features and architectures (clause
5), and from the key issues a set of potential security requirements are
derived (clause 6).Clause 7 provides the set of potential security solutions
aimed at providing coverage of the key issues and derived security
requirements, while clause 8 evaluates, draws conclusions, and selects the
appropriate security solutions for normative work.
## 4.2 Architecture
The mission critical architecture consists of a signalling plane, common
services core and an application plane. Figure 4.2-1 shows the functional
model for the signalling plane.
Figure 4.2-1: Signalling plane functional model
The signalling plane functional model shows the major signalling interfaces
associated with the mission critical architecture. The MC service server in
figure 4.2-1 may represent the MCPTT server, the MCVideo server or the MCData
server. Inter-domain signalling traverses the SIP-3 and the HTTP-3 interfaces
and is applicable to each of the MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData services as well.
As the signalling plane functional model is applicable to each of the MCPTT,
MCVideo and MCData services, the existing signalling plane security (for SIP
and HTTP) may be reused regardless of which service is actively transmitting
on the signalling plane.
Figure 4.2-2 shows the functional model for the common services core.
Figure 4.2-2: Common services core functional model
The common services core (CSC) functional model shows the major interfaces
associated with the various mission critical servers and clients. The MC
service server in figure 4.2-2 may represent the MCPTT server, the MCVideo
server or the MCData server, while the MC service client(s) may represent the
MCPTT client, MCVideo client or the MCData client. As the CSC functional model
is applicable to each of the MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData features, it is likely
that the existing security mechanisms may be reused.
The CSC reference points use variations of SIP and HTTP to fulfil the CSC
architecture for the various CSC functional servers (group management servers,
configuration management servers, identity management server key management
server, location management servers, etc). As there are existing solutions for
SIP and HTTP, it is likely that the existing SIP and HTTP protection
mechanisms will be reused.
Figure 4.2-3 shows the existing SIP and HTTP interface protection mechanisms.
Figure 4.2-3: SIP and HTTP security architecture
Protection of the application data itself depends on the service (i.e. MCPTT,
MCVideo or MCData) and the protocols chosen for each service. In this case,
each service may require different and specific security solutions. It is
assumed that MCVideo will reuse the real-time SRTP and SRTCP security
mechanisms while MCData will be dependent upon the protocol chosen by stage 3.
For signalling, it is assumed that MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData will share the
common signalling security architecture previously defined in 33.179 [3],
which uses a CSK to protect application data on the signalling plane.
End to end protection of application specific data from client to client(s)
will be required, as will protection of application specific data from the
client to the MCX server in some cases.
This document will explore the specific security requirements for each service
and address them independently.
# 5 Security analysis of Mission Critical services
## 5.1 General
This clause contains key security issues which impact the mission critical
service.
## 5.2 Cross-service key issues
### 5.2.1 Key Issue #1.1: Denial of service
#### 5.2.1.1 Issue details
An adversary attempts to prevent a valid MCX User or MCX Service Group from
obtaining service.
#### 5.2.1.2 Security threats
a) Malicious deregistration of user. The adversary sends registration or
deregistration commands which purport to have originated from the target user,
or manipulates some control interface of the MCX Service.
b) Network flooding. Adversaries create large volumes of traffic to reduce
available capacity and impede communications between users.
c) Misuse of secure disable protocols. Adversary uses a disable protocol to
put user device out of service.
#### 5.2.1.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-1.1-1]: All users of the MCX Service shall be authenticated to prevent
an adversary impersonating a user for the purpose of denial of service.
[MCSEC-1.1-2]: The MCX Service should take measures to detect and mitigate DoS
attacks to minimise the impact on the network and on MCX users.
### 5.2.2 Key Issue #1.2: Data communication security between MCX network
entities
#### 5.2.2.1 Issue details
MCX network entities will be required to communicate with each other. It is
important that this may be performed securely.
#### 5.2.2.2 Security threats
There are several threats to the communication between network entities
including forged or replayed messages and eavesdropping on the contents of the
messages.
#### 5.2.2.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirement serves as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-1.2-1] A security mechanism shall exist that allows transmission of
data between MCX network entities to be authenticated, confidentiality
protected, integrity protected and protected from replays.
NOTE: UE-to-UE and UE-to-network relays are not considered to be \'network
entities\'.
### 5.2.3 Key Issue #1.3: User impersonation
#### 5.2.3.1 Issue details
An imposter may attempt to impersonate a valid MCX User for the purposes of
fraud, misinformation or eavesdropping.
#### 5.2.3.2 Security threats
a) Impersonation of individual user. Adversary masquerades as a valid system
user, accessing from a UE within the 3GPP network for purposes of fraud,
misdirection etc.
b) Impersonation of group. A group communication is impersonated to misinform
or misdirect group members. The modes of attack may be different depending on
the bearer service in use.
c) Impersonation of MCPTT server. The user is persuaded to connect to a false
MCX Service in order to deny service, manipulate the user etc.
d) Man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker inserts himself between the user and
the MCX Service to intercept information, generate false calls or deny service
to calls, or to modify the security of the service, e.g. force the user to
negotiate a lower security level.
e) Misuse of client terminal. A client terminal is stolen (which may still be
logged on to the service), or illegally loaned, and used to receive or
generate communications whilst purporting to be the valid user. Credentials
could be obtained from a stolen terminal and used to impersonate the valid
user, even after the terminal has been recovered.
#### 5.2.3.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-1.3-1] The MCX User shall be authenticated by the Mission Critical
Application(s).
[MCSEC-1.3-2] A mechanism shall exist that allows the Mission Critical
Application(s) to be authenticated by the MCX User.
[MCSEC-1.3-3] The MCX UE and the MCX Service should enforce the result of the
authentication for the duration of use (e.g. by integrity protection or
implicit authentication by encryption with a key that is derived from the
authentication and is unknown to the adversary).
[MCSEC-1.3-4] The security solution should minimise the impact of a
compromised MCX UE on other MCX UEs.
### 5.2.4 Key Issue #1.4: Manipulation
#### 5.2.4.1 Issue details
An adversary may attempt to manipulate information relating to an MCPTT user
or group.
#### 5.2.4.2 Security threats
a) Falsification of call records. An adversary manages to modify call record
information for purposes of fraud, or to falsify an audit trail.
b) Alteration of configuration. An adversary changes programming information
in the client application, or changes configuration e.g. to change or deny
access permissions in client application or MCPTT server.
c) Hijacking of calls. An adversary takes over a call in progress and replaces
call information from one party with his own, clears the call etc.
d) Generation of false signalling messages which initiates an action on an MC
client with the intention of disrupting the client or extracting information
from the client. This could include initiating Ambient Listening, Video Pull,
etc.
#### 5.2.4.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-1.4-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to ensure
integrity of all user signalling at the application layer.
[MCSEC-1.4-2] The Mission Critical Service shall protect the administrative
and security management parameters from manipulation by individuals who are
not explicitly authorized by the Mission Critical Organization.
[MCSEC-1.4-3] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to
authenticate the origin of signalling which initiates an action on the MC
client.
### 5.2.5 Key Issue #1.5: Traffic analysis
#### 5.2.5.1 Issue details
MCX Users require their identities to be confidential, and some specialist
users will be particularly sensitive to any form of traffic analysis which
could result in details of their operations or operational roles being
deduced. Additionally, recovery of identities and signalling patterns may
reveal information concerning organisational structure, or ongoing operational
activities. Identified users may also become targets for impersonation, or for
denial of service attacks such as jamming.
#### 5.2.5.2 Security threats
a) Matching of user identity with subscriber terminal identity. The user can
be identified by the subscription in use, enabling tracking by non-security
cleared personnel or a skilled adversary intercepting identities sent in clear
at registration or finding a vulnerable point in the network.
b) Identifying highly secure users within user pool. Certain specialist users
have much higher demands for security and are very sensitive to identity and
location, and should not stand out within the greater volume of public safety
users.
c) Identification of group addresses. Group addresses relate to operational
roles, and identification of these allows analysis of user movements and
operational behaviour.
d) Identifying user affiliation to groups. Identification of user affiliation
to groups can provide information on the operational roles of a user at a
particular point of time, and the numbers of affiliations to a group at any
one time provides further information to an adversary.
e) Identification of called or calling numbers. Identification of called or
calling parties of calls made to or from any user both can provide information
about that user\'s current role, and also can expose the identities and roles
of the that other party.
f) Identification of users by consistent use of higher priorities. Some users
may need to consistently use higher priority, for example due to role or
seniority, and may become visible due to this.
#### 5.2.5.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-1.5-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to support
confidentiality of MCX Service User IDs from all entities outside the Mission
Critical Service.
[MCSEC-1.5-2] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to support
confidentiality of MCX Service signalling from all entities outside the
Mission Critical Service.
### 5.2.6 Key Issue #1.6: Privacy of MCX Service identities
#### 5.2.6.1 Issue details
To allow the Mission Critical Service to meet the Stage 1 requirements and
align with the Stage 2, it is expected that each plane operates in an
independent manner, especially when Mission Critical Application and the IMS
core are administered by different parties (Operator (carrier) and PS Agency).
As a consequence of this, each plane should manage on its own behalf:
a) Use of identities. Each plane is therefore responsible for the privacy of
that plane\'s own identities; and
b) Security for that plane. This does not preclude a plane requesting security
services from another plane, but that is a decision made within the plane, as
to whether to use offered security services or mechanisms within the plane
itself.
#### 5.2.6.2 Security threats
The identity usually identifies a UE or user or a client, if that plane\'s own
identities are leaked and exposed to other planes, there will be some security
problems like privacy information exposure, tracing and so on.
#### 5.2.6.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-1.6-1] The MCX Service identities of each plane shall be used within
the corresponding plane and concealed to other planes.
[MCSEC-1.6-2] When required by the MXC Service provider, MCX Service
identities and other MCX Service sensitive information, shall be contained
within the application plane and shall provide a means to support
confidentiality and integrity of the application plane from the SIP signalling
plane.
[MCSEC-1.6-3] When protection of identities and other sensitive application
information is NOT required by the MCX Service provider, the MCX Service
identities and other MCX Service sensitive information, shall remain contained
within the application plane but do not require confidentiality protection.
### 5.2.7 Key issue #1.7: Use of multiple security domains for media security
#### 5.2.7.1 Issue details
In TS 33.179 [3], only one security domain was supported per user, and
communicating between security domains was not defined explicitly. Clearly, it
is not acceptable for all MCX users across different MCX services to be within
a single security domain. To better support multiple MC Services working
together, support for multiple security domains is required. This will also
aid support for interconnection, roaming and interworking.
#### 5.2.7.2 Security threats
The following threats apply to the use of multiple security domains for media
security:
a) Impersonation: An external security domain may pretend to have a user on
the domain that does not use the domain. By doing this in both directions it
would be possible to perform a MitM attack on the connection.
b) Misuse: An external security domain could be used without permission of the
Home Security Domain or the MCX service(s) that support the communication.
This would impact the service(s) ability to effectively manage the user\'s
communications.
#### 5.2.7.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-1.7-1] When using external security domains, the Home Security Domain
shall apply policies which ensure that only trusted external security domains
are used.
[MCSEC-1.7-2] Use of external security domains shall be logged to detect
impersonation and misuse.
[MCSEC-1.7-3] MCX Services shall be able to permit/deny the use of security
domains over their service.
### 5.2.8 Key issue #1.8: Control of use of MBMS within the MC Domain
#### 5.2.8.1 Issue details
The solution for MCPTT currently uses MKFC to encrypt signalling from the
MCPTT Server to the MCPTT client when using MBMS. See clause 9.4.4. of TS
33.179 [3]. The MKFC is distributed from the Group Management Server (GMS).
This key issue considers whether a similar approach could be used within an
MCX system.
As background, use of MBMS is managed by the MCX Server acting as the GCS AS.
The MCX Server uses the MB2 interface to the network operator\'s BM-SC to
activate and deactivate MBMS bearers as required. Hence MBMS is under control
of the MC Domain that uses the MBMS service, with no requirement external MC
Domains for support. In fact, knowledge on the use of MBMS need not be shared
beyond the home MC Domain.
However, it is possible that the GMS is in a different MC Domain to the MCX
Server. This could occur if a group is used across multiple MC Domains.
However, based on the existing security solution, MCX Servers within the home
MC Domain will not be able to use MBMS for group signalling unless the MKFC is
distributed by the GMS. In the case that the GMS is in a different MC Domain
to the MCX Server, control of the use of MBMS is in one domain, and control of
the security of MBMS is in a different domain. If the GMS does not provide the
MKFC, then signalling over MBMS cannot be secured in all domains where that
group is used. This could prevent MBMS from being used, or cause MBMS to be
used insecurely.
This issue does not apply to media content (protected using GMK) as the MCX
Server does not decrypt media content. As a consequence, the MCX Server can
always send media over an MBMS bearer without introducing a security issue.
#### 5.2.8.2 Security threats
MBMS is used insecurely as the MCX Server requires MBMS support but does not
have the MKFC from the GMS.
#### 5.2.8.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-1.8-1] The security of signalling transmitted between the MCX client
and MCX server shall be controlled by the MCX server. As a consequence of this
requirement, the MCX Server shall not require key material from external MC
Domains to enable the use of MBMS.
### 5.2.9 Key Issue #1.9: Edge protection of the MC Domain
#### 5.2.9.1 Issue details
The Mission Critical System should be able to be deployed in such a way that
it is possible to properly enforce security and policy functions at the edge
of the network, and hide the internal topology of the network. This is
particularly important as the MC system supports migration, interworking and
interconnection.
In principle, in should be possible to apply the functions performed by the
IBCF in the IMS Core (see Annex I of TS 23.228 [23]), or the Session Border
Controller in the SIP Core (RFC 5853 [24]) to the Mission Critical application
layer.
Furthermore, it should be possible for signalling within the MC Domain to be
unencrypted to allow network monitoring and analytics to take place. It should
be possible that the only data transmitted by the MC Domain is permitted
within the network (e.g. meets access and policy criteria). It should be
possible to unify security and policy enforcement in the MC Domain.
#### 5.2.9.2 Security threats
a) Extraction of information about internal topology of the mission critical
network. This allows individual network elements to be targeted.
b) Compromise of processing function also compromises security functions (e.g.
policy function). Where policy is applied at the point that a message is
processed, this could mean that a compromise of the processing function will
also compromise the system\'s ability to apply security and policy measures.
c) Should part of the network be compromised, the compromise may not be
detected unless internal network monitoring may be performed.
d) Should security and policy be applied by each individual server,
configuration is more complex meaning a configuration flaw is more likely.
e) Should security and policy be applied by each individual server, a DoS
attack must be transmitted by the network before it can be detected. This
increases the chance of a successful attack.
#### 5.2.9.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-1.9-1]: It shall be possible to hide the internal network topology of
the MC Domain from entities outside of the MC Domain.
[MCSEC-1.9-2]: It shall be possible to apply security and policy functions
independently of existing network elements (such as the MCX Server).
[MCSEC-1.9-3]: It shall be possible to decrypt any data that will be processed
by the MC Domain, at the edge of the MC Domain.
[MCSEC-1.9-4]: It shall be possible to unify the security and policy
enforcement functions across the MC Domain.
[MCSEC-1.9-5]: It shall be possible to prevent any data that does not meet the
MC Domain\'s access, security or policy criteria from being routed within the
MC Domain.
## 5.3 Key issues on Common Functional Architecture (MC_ARCH)
Editor\'s Note: The Common Functional Architecture was previously known as the
Common Services Core within Rel-13.
### 5.3.1 Key Issue #2.1: Configuration & service access
#### 5.3.1.1 Issue details
In order to use the Mission Critical Application, the Mission Critical Service
needs to configure the Mission Critical UEs to use the service. Furthermore,
in order to allow a MCX User access to user-specific services, the MCX Service
needs to configure the MCX UE with user-profile information.
MCX UE configuration may include application configuration, cryptographic
algorithms, available services (e.g. ProSe), global policies, etc. The MCX
user-profile may include authorisation to use specific services, groups, group
affiliations, the default selected group. The configuration process(es) may be
used to enable or to disable access to Mission Critical Services.
Both these access/configuration processes need to be appropriately secured,
both in terms of authenticating the Mission Critical Service, UE and user and
in terms of ensuring the transfer of data is protected.
#### 5.3.1.2 Security threats
There are several threats to the downloading of configuration data to the UE.
\- An attacker pretending to be the Configuration Management Server may
maliciously configure the MCX UE with false configuration data, thus causing
improper operation of the MCX Application.
\- An attacker pretending to be the Configuration Management Server may
maliciously delete MCX UE configuration or user-profile data, rendering the
MCX Application inoperable.
\- Similarly, an attacker pretending to be an MCX UE or MCX User may download
configuration or profile information intended for another UE or user. Such an
attack may allow an escalation of the attacker\'s privileges.
\- An attacker may manipulate or modify the data being transmitted between the
MCX Service and the MCX UE, thus adversely affecting the configuration or
user-profile data.
\- An attacker may eavesdrop on transmitted configuration data or user-profile
data and further distribute it to unauthorized parties for improper use.
\- An attacker may replay intercepted configuration data or user-profile data
thus affecting an expected configuration state at the MCX UE and/or MCX
network entity.
#### 5.3.1.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-2.1-1] The MCX UE and the Configuration Management Server, shall
mutually authenticate each other prior to MCX UE configuration to use the
Mission Critical Service.
[MCSEC-2.1-2] The MCX User and the Mission Critical Service shall mutually
authenticate each other prior to providing the MCX UE with the MCX Service
User Profile and access to user-specific services.
[MCSEC-2.1-3] The transmission of configuration data and user profile data
between the Configuration Management Serverand the MCX UE shall be
confidentiality protected, integrity protected and protected from replays.
### 5.3.2 Key Issue #2.2: Group key management
#### 5.3.2.1 Issue details
An essential part of the Mission Critical Service is to be able to communicate
within a MCX Service Group. To securely use a MCX Service Group a group
security context will need to be established by the Mission Critical Service.
During establishment and distribution of a group security context, it is
essential that the group key material is appropriately protected.
Based upon TS 22.280 [5], there are a variety of ways to create a new group:
\- Group creation via an MCX Administrator -- normal association of a user to
a group to allow communication. The MCX Service Group could be a normal group,
or a broadcast group, and could support off-network operation.
\- Group creation via \"Group-Regroup\" -- dynamically combining groups. MCX
Service Groups may be at different security levels. Groups may be combined by
entities other than Administrators (e.g. Dispatchers).
\- Group creation via \"User-Regroup\" -- temporary groups dynamically created
by authorised users.
To support these group creation mechanisms, the group key distribution
process(es) needs to be able to support the secure distribution of key
material from a variety of authorised sources, and the ability to re-establish
the security association (rekey) at any time.
#### 5.3.2.2 Security threats
The following threats apply during group key distribution:
\- Interception of group key material. This would enable an attacker to
compromise the communications of the group.
\- Undetected modification of group key material. This would enable an
attacker to deny service to group members or potentially compromise the
communications of the group.
\- Impersonation of a distributor of group key material. This would enable an
attacker to rekey a group and thus compromise communications, or enable the
unauthorised creation/combining of groups.
\- Unauthorised receipt of group key material, e.g. for a group for which the
MCX User is not a member.
\- Unauthorised modification of group key material, e.g. through overwriting
of group key material via an authorised creation of a new group.
\- Failure to update a group security context. Should it not be possible to
update a group security context, the group\'s communications may be vulnerable
in the event a group key is compromised.
\- Failure to revoke a group security context. If it is not possible to revoke
a group security context, MCX UEs may continue to use compromised key material
without knowledge of compromise.
#### 5.3.2.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-2.2-1] Key material for a MCX Service Group shall be integrity and
confidentiality protected for a specific MCX User during distribution from the
MCX Service to MCX UEs.
[MCSEC-2.2-2] Key material for a MCX Service Group shall be authenticated as
coming from a valid, authorised source. The authorised source may be MCX
Administrator or may be another authorised entity (e.g. an authorised user or
dispatcher).
[MCSEC-2.2-3] It shall be possible for authorised entities to dynamically
create and distribute a new group security context at any time. This may be as
part of a group creation process, be due to a periodic update to maintain key
freshness, or due to compromise of group key material.
[MCSEC-2.2-4] The creation of a new group security context (e.g. via User-
Regroup operation) shall not change or compromise an existing group security
context.
[MCSEC-2.2-5] It shall be possible for an authorised, authenticated entity to
revoke and update a group security context from use.
## 5.4 Key issues on push-to-talk enhancements (eMCPTT)
### 5.4.1 Key Issue #3.1: Interception of user traffic
#### 5.4.1.1 Issue details
Traffic and signalling sent to and from UEs is at risk of interception,
compromising information appertaining to on-going operations.
#### 5.4.1.2 Security threats
a) Eavesdropping at air interface. Signalling or traffic information is
recovered by an adversary using a radio receiver. Adversary could be any
member of the public.
b) Eavesdropping in mobile network. Signalling or traffic information is
recovered by an adversary intercepting a link or at a network element in the
mobile network. This could be achieved by non-security cleared personnel, or
by adversary finding vulnerable points in network, e.g. unprotected ground
based network link. It is expected that in most cases mobile networks will not
have undergone a formal government security evaluation.
c) Eavesdropping on connected networks (e.g. non 3GPP networks). Signalling or
traffic information is intercepted whilst routed to or from a user connected
over a non 3GPP network, e.g. WiFi network or line connected user.
d) Man in the middle on connected networks. Signalling or traffic information
is intercepted and altered whilst routed over a non 3GPP network. This could
be achieved by an attacker placing himself between the users or between the
user and the Mission Critical Service. As a consequence, the attacker can
jeopardize ongoing PS operations.
#### 5.4.13 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-3.1-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to support
end to end confidentiality and integrity protection for all media traffic
transmitted between MCX UEs.
### 5.4.2 Key Issue #3.2: Key stream re-use
#### 5.4.2.1 Key issue details
In a group communication multiple group UEs may communicate using a shared
group key. In such a scenario, it is essential that two users do not generate
and use the same key stream, derived from the shared group key. If this were
to happen then compromise of user traffic is possible.
For example, in the particular case where SRTP is used to protect traffic
generated by a UE, with all UEs deriving their key stream from a shared group
key, the key stream for each user needs to be unique. Based on the RFC 3711
[7], key stream uniqueness is achieved by each user picking a random SSRC
(synchronisation source identifier) and actively detecting any collisions.
Were SRTP to be used as implied within the RFC as part of a solution, key
stream re-use would be highly likely, if not certain. For example, it could be
assumed that the system should support more than 10000 users in a group, with
each user able to produce 8 communication streams at any one time and be able
to start new communication stream at any time. In this conservative scenario,
as the SSRC is 32 bits long, the probability that two UEs in this group would
have two simultaneous streams with the same SSRCs is 0.53. This is an
unacceptably high probability of compromise. Furthermore, depending on the
length of time a stream lasts, the probability of collision will increase with
each new stream created.
As an additional complication, should two UEs decide to use the same SSRC, it
may be extremely difficult to resolve this collision on the fly.
#### 5.4.2.2 Security threats
Accidentally, or due to a malicious action, the Mission Critical System uses a
key stream that has already been used previously to protect traffic. As a
result of this key stream reuse, it is possible that both traffic streams
could be compromised.
#### 5.4.2.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirement serves as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-3.2-1] The Mission Critical System shall ensure that key streams are
not reused.
### 5.4.3 Key Issue #3.3: Late entry to group communication
#### 5.4.3.1 Issue details
To allow the Mission Critical Service to meet the Stage 1 requirements, it
needs to be possible for the authorised MCX Users to be able to perform late
entry for a MCX Service Group while communication is on-going. This implies
that an authorised MCX UE is able to obtain all information required to derive
the key stream currently in use to protect the group communication.
For example, in the case of SRTP, this may include the association between a
MCX Service Group and a particular SRTP session, the cryptographic algorithms
in use to protect the session, the SRTP Master Key in use to protect the
session (and any information required to derive the SRTP Master Key), the SRTP
Roll-Over-Counter (ROC) and the SRTP salt (if used).
#### 5.4.3.2 Security threats
The threat in this case is that a MCX User is unable to perform late entry to
a group communication as it is unable to establish the information required to
build the group security context and decrypt the traffic.
#### 5.4.3.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-3.3-1] An authorised MCX User shall be able to obtain the information
necessary to derive the group security context for the MCX Service Group while
a group communication is on-going. As a result, the MCX User shall be able to
listen to the group communication within 350ms. This requirement applies for
both on-network and off-network MCX operation.
### 5.4.4 Key Issue #3.4: Private call confidentiality
#### 5.4.4.1 Issue details
Private calls are used to establish a secure communication path between a pair
of authorised MCX Users. A Private Call may or may not use floor control and
may be setup while the MCX User is operating either on or off-network.
To support private calls, the Mission Critical System requires a mechanism for
establishing end-to-end secure between any pair of MCX Users.
#### 5.4.4.2 Security threats
The following threats apply to private calls:
\- The content of a private call is accessible to unauthorised MCX Users. As a
consequence of this threat, confidential conversations may be compromised, and
user\'s confidence in Private Call functionality may be undermined, pushing
them towards less secure communication mechanisms for private conversations.
\- A private call is replayed or modified within the Mission Critical System.
\- A private call is established by one MCX User appearing to be another MCX
User. As a consequence of this threat, confidential information may be
compromised to an unauthorised user. This threat is particularly serious
should Private calls be used to support Discreet Listening or Ambient
Listening functionality.
\- A pair of users are unable to establish a shared security context and hence
are unable to establish a Private Call.
#### 5.4.4.3 Potential security requirements
The following requirements serve as a guideline for future normative work:
[MCSEC-3.4-1] It shall be possible to establish a unique Private Call security
context between any pair of authorised MCX Users within the Mission Critical
System. The security context shall not be available to other MCX Users,
except, where necessary, authorised monitoring functions (e.g. LI, Discreet
Listening). If the security context is made available to monitoring functions,
appropriate controls and logging shall exist. This requirement applies when
MCX UEs are operating both on-network and off-network.
[MCSEC-3.4-2] The Private Call security context shall provide a means to
provide confidentiality and integrity protection of user traffic, and
authenticate the MCX Users involved in the Private Call.
5.4.5 Key Issue #3.5: MBMS subchannel control message protection
5.4.5.1 Issue details
When MBMS is used, the MCPTT Server generates MBMS subchannel control messages
as described in clause 4.2.3 of TS 24.380 [17]. These messages together with
the RTP media packets and floor control messages are distributed over MBMS
bearers. The MBMS subchannel control messages are for example used to signal
to MCPTT UEs participating in a group call when to switch from unicast to
multicast bearer or vice versa. The format and type of MBMS subchannel control
messages is described in clause 8.4 of TS 24.380 [17].
Currently, only two types of MBMS subchannel control messages are specified,
namely the Map Group to Bearer and the Unmap Group to Bearer messages. The
former is used to signal to MCPTT clients when to move from unicast to MBMS
bearer while the latter signals the move in the other direction.
An MBMS bearer is uniquely identified by a Temporary Mobile Group Identity
(TMGI) and defines a pool of resources on which media packets and floor
control messages for different ongoing group call sessions can be distributed
in parallel. With each MBMS bearer, a general purpose subchannel is
associated. This subchannel is accessible to any UE within the service area of
the MBMS bearer and is used in particular for the distribution of the MBMS
subchannel control messages.
5.4.5.2 Security threats
The MBMS subchannel control messages contain sensitive information such as the
MCPTT Group ID. In TS 33.179 [3] clause 9.3.2, MCPTT Group IDs are classified
as sensitive information to which confidentiality protection may be applied.
In this particular case, an unauthorized UE within the service area of an
active MBMS bearer can listen on the general purpose subchannel and gain
knowledge about the presence in high or low number of agents belonging to a
particular public organization (e.g. police). Such real-time knowledge can be
exploited for criminal activities.
A skilful attacker with radio capabilities (e.g. fake eNB) can construct and
broadcast fake MBMS subchannel control messages in order to deceive MCPTT
clients causing them for example to start receiving and rendering the media
and floor control messages via the MBMS bearer while no data is actually being
distributed. The attacker most likely won\'t be able to make MCPTT clients
blindly switch to MBMS bearers thus disrupting the ongoing session in what
could be considered as a denial of service attack. In fact, depending on the
implementation, the MCPTT client would probably detect that there is no or
fake data on the MBMS bearer. Nevertheless, the MCPTT UE has to go to the
extent of allocating and using some of the radio and processing resources
before detecting that the messages were fake.
5.4.5.3 Potential security requirements
> [MCSEC-3.5-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide means to support
> confidentiality and integrity protection for the MBMS subchannel control
> messages.
### 5.4.6 Key issue #3.6: Exposure of group identifiers
#### 5.4.6.1 Issue details
The MBMS subchannel control messages contain sensitive information such as the
MCPTT Group ID. In TS 33.179 [3], MCPTT Group IDs are classified as sensitive
information to which confidentiality protection may be applied (clause 9.3.2).
The security mechanism used for the protection of these messages is based on a
key, the MSCCK, that is shared among all the MCPTT clients served by a
specific MCPTT server.
#### 5.4.6.2 Security threats
Any UE within the service area of an active MBMS bearer in possession of the
MSCCK has access to the information provided on the general purpose MBMS
subchannel. The UE can therefore gain knowledge on which groups are active
within the same service area. This could be problematic in cases such as
\"police investigating the police\" and where it is beneficial and crucial to
hide group related activities from non-member UEs. If the MCPTT Group ID is
not changed or not bound to a particular group call session, then any other UE
within the service area of a bearer who is in possession of the general
purpose protection key can learn about ongoing sessions for any groups even
for groups where the UE doesn\'t belong.
#### 5.4.6.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-3.6-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide means to conceal
group identifiers.
Editor\'s Note: The severity of the exposure of group identifiers to other
clients is FFS. The proposed pseudonym based solutions are vulnerable to
traffic analysis. More precisely, for both solutions, it is possible to link
the messages based on the used pseudonyms. This aspect is slightly better for
solution #3.5 than solution #3.6 where the pseudonyms are further long-lived.
If this issue is to be properly mitigated, then the traffic analysis threat
should be addressed as well. A potential solution would require encrypting the
group identifiers with group specific keys. As this information is sent over a
shared RTCP channel, it would be cumbersome if technically feasible at all to
have such a protection.
## 5.5 Key issues on data communications (MCData)
### 5.5.1 Key issue #4.1: Protection of SDS
#### 5.5.1.1 Issue details
The MCData service shall support a Short Data Service (SDS) capability for
one-to-one, one-to-many, and group communications containing text or binary.
The MCData service shall support messages to be sent over the signalling plane
or the media plane. Both on and off-network is in scope.
TS 22.282 [7] expects that an equivalent level of security will be provided
for SDS as for MCPTT. It states that:
> \"The MCData Service will reuse functions including end-to-end encryption,
> key management, authentication of the sender, etc. defined in [3] in order
> to provide group communications for data services.\"
Additionally, TS 22.280 [5] contains the following requirements which are
applicable to all services:
> \"[R-5.12-008] Subject to regulatory constraints, the MCX Service shall
> provide a means to support confidentiality, message integrity, and source
> authentication for some information exchanges (e.g., MCX Service User
> Profile management, kill commands) that have the potential to disrupt the
> operation of the target MCX UE.\"
>
> \"[R-5.12-009] The MCX Service shall provide a means to support end-to-end
> security for all media traffic transmitted between MCX UEs.\"
>
> \"[R-5.12-010] End-to-end security shall be supported both within and
> without network coverage and regardless of whether the traffic is
> transmitted directly or via the network infrastructure.\"
Consequently, a level of protection for messaging is required that is
equivalent to MCPTT. Moreover, arguably for messaging ensuring authenticity of
the data is more important, as receivers are unable to gain a level of
authentication through recognition.
#### 5.5.1.2 Security threats
The following threats apply to the Short Data Service (SDS):
a) Eavesdropping at air interface. Signalling or traffic information is
recovered by an adversary using a radio receiver. Adversary could be any
member of the public.
b) Eavesdropping in mobile network. Signalling or traffic information is
recovered by an adversary intercepting a link or at a network element in the
mobile network.
c) Eavesdropping on connected networks (e.g. non 3GPP networks). Signalling or
traffic information is intercepted whilst routed to or from a user connected
over a non 3GPP network, e.g. WiFi network or line connected user.
d) Man-in-the-middle on connected networks. Signalling or traffic information
is intercepted and altered whilst routed over a non 3GPP network. This could
be achieved by an attacker placing himself between the users or between the
user and the Mission Critical Service. As a consequence, the attacker can
jeopardize ongoing PS operations.
e) False message transmission. A member of an MCX group may produce a message
pretending to be from another specific member of the MCX group (e.g.
commander). This could cause disruption to on-going PS operations.
#### 5.5.1.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-4.1-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to support
end-to-end confidentiality and integrity protection for messaging transmitted
between MCX UEs in both media and signalling streams.
[MCSEC-4.1-2] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to
authenticate messages in both media and signalling streams.
## 5.6 Key issues on video communications (MCVideo)
### 5.6.1 Key Issue #5.1: Equivalence with MCPTT
#### 5.6.1.1 Issue details
From a security point-of-view, video communications are equivalent to voice
communications, but with a different (video-enabled) codec. Hence the security
requirements on eMCPTT also apply to MCVideo.
Requirements for MCVideo can be found in TS 22.280 [5] and TS 22.281 [6].
Document TS 22.280 [5] provides the security requirements that are common to
all MCX services (MCVideo, MCPTT, and MCData) and therefore should be
addressed here.
#### 5.6.1.2 Security threats
Threats applicable to MCPTT may be applied to MCVideo.
#### 5.6.1.3 Potential security requirements
##### 5.6.1.3.1 General
[MCSEC-5.6-001] The security requirements from clause 5.4 also apply to the
MCVideo service.
##### 5.6.1.3.2 Group key management

may be another authorized entity (e.g. an authorized MCX User or Dispatcher).
[MCSEC-5.6-004] It shall be possible for authorized entities to dynamically
create and distribute a new group security context at any time. This may be as
part of a group creation process, be due to a periodic update to maintain key
freshness, or due to compromise of group key material.
[MCSEC-5.6-005] The creation of a new group security context (e.g. via User-
Regroup operation) shall not change or compromise an existing group security
context.
[MCSEC-5.6-006] It shall be possible for an authorized, authenticated entity
to revoke and update a group security context from use.
##### 5.6.1.3.3 On-network operation
[MCSEC-5.6-007] All users of the MCX service shall be authenticated to prevent
an adversary impersonating a user for the purpose of denial of service.
[MCSEC-5.6-008] The MCX service should take measures to detect and mitigate
DoS attacks to minimize the impact on the network and on MCX users.
[MCSEC-5.6-009] The MCX user shall be authenticated by the MCX application.
[MCSEC-5.6-010] A mechanism shall exist that allows the MCX application to be
authenticated by the MCX user.
[MCSEC-5.6-011] The MCX UE and MCX service should enforce the result of the
authentication for the duration of communications (e.g. by integrity
protection or implicit authentication by encryption with a key that is derived
from the authentication and is unknown to the adversary).
[MCSEC-5.6-012] The security solution should minimize the impact of a
compromised MCXUE on other MCX UEs.

confidentiality of MCX user identities from all entities outside the MCX
service.
[MCSEC-5.6-016] The MCX service shall provide a means to support
confidentiality of MCX signalling from all entities outside the MCX service.

confidentiality and integrity protection for all media traffic transmitted
between MCX UEs.
[MCSEC-5.6-018] The MCX Service shall provide a means to support the
confidentiality and integrity protection of location information transmitted
from the MCX UE to the MCX application server.
##### 5.6.1.3.3 Ambient listening
[MCSEC-5.6-019] Specific roles in the organization and shall be identified to
authorize and activate Ambient Listening and privileges shall be assigned to
these roles to activate and register the use of ambient listening.
[MCSEC-5.6-020] The activation of the Ambient Listening functionality shall be
automatically registered by the system and will be stored as an \'event\' by
the system.
[MCSEC-5.6-021] Any decision to activate Ambient Listening, or review of such
a decision, may also be recorded in a suitable incident log unless to do so
would interfere with the purpose for which the functionality is being used
i.e. an investigation tool for evidence gathering in cases of suspected gross

case the authorization needs to be recorded elsewhere as appropriate.
[MCSEC-5.6-022] A radio user should be told as soon as possible that they are,
or have been, subject to Ambient Listening and the reason why the
functionality was activated. The fact they have been informed, by whom and
when, should be recorded in a suitable log.
##### 5.6.1.3.3 Data communication between MCVideo network entities
[MCSEC-5.6-023] A security mechanism shall exist that allows transmission of
data between 3GPP MCX network entities to be authenticated, confidentiality
protected, integrity protected and protected from replays.

## 5.7 Key issues on migration and interconnect (MCSMI)
### 5.7.1 Key Issue #6.1: Maintaining security during migration and
interconnection
#### 5.7.1.1 Issue details
Migration and interconnect should not reduce the security of the Mission
Critical solution. Hence security requirements defined for other parts of the
service should also apply to in this case.
#### 5.7.1.2 Security threats
Threats applicable to the Mission Critical Service during normal operation may
apply during migration and interconnection.
#### 5.7.1.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-6.1-1] The security requirements from elsewhere in clause 5 also apply
during migration and interconnection.
### 5.7.2 Key issue #6.2: Inter-domain user authentication and authorisation
#### 5.7.2.1 Issue details
Users whose identity is managed by an identity management service in one
domain may need access to interconnect services in a different domain. For
example, a user home to IdM service in domain A may be a member of a group
video service in domain B, a member of a group data service in domain C, and
may engage in individual or group voice service with users in domain D. In
order to support these scenarios, identity management services in different
domains need to support the user authentication and authorisation of visiting
users.
Theft of service, impersonation, and denial of service are possible security
threats for an MCX System that accepts visiting users. To mitigate these
threats, a secure method of authenticating and authorising a visiting user is
needed.
When a user is home to one identity management service, the home identity
management service needs to provide some verifiable credential to the other
identity management services, thereby proving the authenticity of the user.
The partner identity management service must have a method to authenticate and
verify the user before granting the user authorisation to local services,
thereby eliminating the theft of service, impersonation, and denial of service
security threats.
#### 5.7.2.2 Security threats
If users are allowed to access a service in a different domain without user
authentication and authorisation, the following security threats may occur:
a) Theft of service -- an adversary could be granted access to a particular
service without being held financially responsible for that service. This is
especially true if combined with the impersonation threat.
b) Impersonation -- an adversary could falsely present themselves as a
legitimate user without being required to prove their identity, thereby acting
as the legitimate user without their knowledge or consent.
c) Denial of service -- an adversary that is freely granted PTT, data, or
video services without authorisation can access and overload mission critical
resources preventing other authentic mission critical users from using these
service(s). Combined with the impersonation threat, an adversary could act as
a legitimate user and obtain mission critical resources, thereby denying the
resources from other mission critical users.
#### 5.7.2.3 Potential security requirements
The following inter-domain user authentication and authorisation security
requirements address the security threats identified in clause 5.7.2.2 and the
inter-domain authentication and authorisation requirements from TS 22.179 [4].
[MCSEC-6.2-1] All Mission Critical Users shall be authenticated with their
home identity management service prior to authentication or authorisation with
a partner domain.
[MCSEC-6.2-2] An identity management service shall authenticate a visiting
user prior to authorising that user for local service(s).
[MCSEC-6.2-3] A visiting user shall be authorised with the local server(s) at
the partner MCX System before being granted local services.
[MCSEC-6.2-4] A user requiring services at a partner domain shall first
acquire a verifiable credential from the user\'s primary identity management
service.
[MCSEC-6.2-5] The partner identity management service shall have full and
overruling authorisation control of all visiting users requesting services in
the partner MCX System.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether an access token revocation method is needed.
### 5.7.3 Key Issue #6.3: Protection against external systems
#### 5.7.3.1 Issue details
The Mission Critical System requires the ability to interconnect with other,
external MC Domains and potentially other types of external systems. External
systems could be used as an attack vector towards the MC Domain, either due to
malicious action, fault, or compromise within the external system.
It is important that the MC Domain is able to protect itself from external
systems.
#### 5.7.3.2 Security threats
The following security threats are applicable in this scenario:
\- The external system performs a DoS attack towards the MC Domain (e.g. a
signalling storm or media overload).
\- The external system sends malformed packets into the 3GPP system causing a
disruption of service.
\- The MC Domain exposes its internal network topology, enabling more
effective attacks from the non-3GPP system.
\- The external system spoofs users in the MC system, compromising the
integrity of the MC System. This could include:
\- Access to user communications (e.g. via MitM attack);
\- Generation of user signalling;
\- The external system could spoof network entities within the MC System.
NOTE: Where the SIP Core is not a trusted part of the MC Domain, the SIP Core
will route both internal and external traffic towards network entities within
the MC Domain. Depending on the network deployment, distinguishing between
internal and external network traffic may be difficult.
\- The external system could send sensitive signalling requests into the 3GPP
system (e.g. Ambient Listening).
\- The external system spoofs another external MC Domain.
#### 5.7.3.3 Potential security requirements

MC System to hide its internal network topology towards external systems.
[MCSEC-6.3-3] The MC Domain shall be able to limit the signalling and media
which may be routed to/from external systems. This includes limiting both the
type and quantity of signalling and media.

which uses source identifiers used by network entities inside the MC Domain,
but did not originate inside the MC Domain.
[MCSEC-6.3-5] The MC Domain shall block signalling entering the MC Domain

## 5.8 Key Issues on interworking with non-3GPP systems
### 5.8.1 Key Issue #7.1: Terminating MC security mechanisms for non-3GPP
systems
#### 5.8.1.1 Issue details
The Mission Critical System requires the ability to interwork with non-3GPP
systems that do not share security mechanisms with the MC System. For example,
should the non-3GPP system not support TS 33.180 [21], the non-3GPP system
will not be able to process native MC signalling and media. To allow
interworking to be successful in this instance, the MC Domain needs to
terminate security mechanisms for the non-3GPP system.
#### 5.8.1.2 Security threats
The following security threats are applicable in this scenario:
\- The non-3GPP system is an external system and the threats described in
Clause 5.7.3.2 apply in this case.
\- The non-3GPP system is unable to process signalling/media received from the
MC system due to an inability to decrypt the signalling/media.
\- Signalling/media received from the non-3GPP system is compromised inside
the MC system as it is not properly protected.
#### 5.8.1.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-7.1-1] The security requirements from Clause 5.7.3.3 apply with respect
to an external non-3GPP system.
[MCSEC-7.1-2] The MC System shall enable the decryption of signalling and
traffic routed to the non-3GPP system. This shall not compromise signalling or
traffic that is not routed to the non-3GPP system.
[MCSEC-7.1-3] The MC System shall be able to apply MC security mechanisms to
signalling/media received from the non-3GPP system to ensure that equivalent
protections are applied to this data as for native MC system data.
### 5.8.2 Key Issue #7.2: Interworking security data
#### 5.8.2.1 Issue details
To support interworking between a non-3GPP system and 3GPP interworking UEs,
security data needs to be protected between 3GPP interworking UEs and the
interworking function (IWF).
#### 5.8.2.2 Security threats
The following security threats are applicable in this issue:
\- Eavesdropping -- Security data passing between the IWF and 3GPP
interworking UEs may be intercepted exposing the key material or other private
information.
\- Man in the middle attacks -- MIM attacks may allow an attacker to intercept
security data exposing the key material or other private information.
\- Impersonation -- An attacker may attempt to impersonate a legitimate user
causing the key management source to provide security data or other private
information to the attacker exposing the key material or other private
information.
#### 5.8.2.3 Potential security requirements
[MCSEC-7.2-1] Security data transferred between the IWF and a 3GPP
interworking UE shall be confidentiality protected and integrity protected.
[MCSEC-7.2-2] When required by the mission critical operator, application
signaling information transferred between the IWF and a 3GPP interworking UE
shall be confidentiality protected and may be integrity protected.
[MCSEC-7.2-3] The 3GPP interworking MC user shall be authenticated and
authorised for interworking using 3GPP identity management user authentication
and user authorization methods.
[MCSEC-7.2-4] The transfer of security data shall not reduce the security of
the wider MC System.
Editor\'s note: Further analysis of the security data transfer may be needed
based on development of the interworking architecture.
Editor\'s note: Whether identity hiding is required during interworking is
ffs.

# 7 Potential security solutions
## 7.1 General
This clause contains potential security solutions for consideration for
inclusion in normative work.
## 7.2 Cross-service security solutions
### 7.2.1 Solution #1.1 : KMS Discovery and redirection
#### 7.2.1.1 Overview
In TS 33.179 [3], only one security domain was supported per user, and
solutions for communicating between security domains was not defined
explicitly. To better support multiple MC Services working together, support
for multiple security domains is required. This will also aid support for
interconnection, roaming and interworking.
Using multiple security domains is a requirement for multiple MCX security
applications and hence is a cross service security solution.
#### 7.2.1.2 Motivating security requirements
This solution is intended to provide a means for allowing multiple MCX
Security Domains. Specifically, it meets requirements [MCSEC-1.7-1],
[MCSEC-1.7-2] and [MCSEC-1.7-3].
#### 7.2.1.3 Solution description
##### 7.2.1.3.1 Overview of KMS Redirect Response (KRR)
###### 7.2.1.3.1.1 General
The purpose of KMS Discovery / Redirection procedures is to allow key
distribution where the KMS used by the receiver is not known. It also allows
policy to be applied to ensure the KMS used by the receiver and initiator is
acceptable along the path of the communication.
The key message is a KMS Redirect Response (KRR) which conveys KMS policy to
the initiator. The initiator could be a MC client or GMS. Sometimes multiple
messages and KRR exchanges will be required to establish a suitable choice of
(KMS initiator, KMS receiver) pair. It is also possible that there is no
acceptable choice, and as a result of the process the communication fails. The
partner (external) security domains (KMS URIs) and certificates are typically
provisioned to the UE by the user\'s Home KMS (see Annex D of TS 33.180 [21]).
The KRR procedure does not provision KMS certificates, but shares information
about which KMS may be used with the target key management client.
The following scenarios may trigger a KRR procedure in order to communicate
KMS information to the initiating entity:
\- The KMS URI (IDRkmsr) used in the MIKEY message may be incorrect for the
target; or
\- While the specified KMS URI may be correct for the receiver, the primary or
partner application server may for various reasons still disallow
communications with the target entity using the specified receiver KMS URI
(IDRkmsr); or
\- While the specified KMS URI may be correct for the receiver, the primary or
partner application server may for various reasons still disallow
communications with the receiver using the specified initiator KMS URI
(IDRkmsi);
The KRR procedure may be initiated by application servers in the signalling
path or by the terminating MCX entity.
###### 7.2.1.3.1.2 KMSs and KMS URIs
The KMS URI is the URI used to identify a logical KMS. This represents a
security domain of users with shared trust. A user (Key management client)
only communicates with a Home KMS. The Primary Home KMS provides the list of
allowable external security domains (External KMS URIs) with which the user
may communicate. The Primary Home KMS also provides the public KMS certificate
for the External KMSs.
The Primary Home KMS also provides the list of Secondary Home KMSs by which
the user may be keyed. Secondary Home KMSs are used primarily to support
migration and roaming, allowing the user to use a KMS in the destination
system/region.
If a secondary KMS resides in a partner MCX security domain then prior to
communicating with the KMS, the UE (i.e. the user) shall perform inter-domain
MCX user service authentication and authorisation as described in clause
5.1.4.
Consequently, a user has exactly one Primary Home KMS, zero or more Secondary
Home KMSs and zero or more External KMS.
###### 7.2.1.3.1.3 Types of KMS
From a user\'s perspective, there are three types of KMS:
\- The Home KMS. This is the primary KMS used by the user.
\- Secondary Home (or Migration) KMSs. These are other KMSs that the user may
be keyed to use.
\- External KMSs. These are other KMSs that the user has the KMS certificate
and hence is able to communicate with users keyed by this KMS. External KMSs
always include the Home KMS and any Secondary Home KMSs.
NOTE 1: Without provisioning the KMS certificate of an External KMS, secure
communication with the corresponding external security domain is not possible.
NOTE 2: Secondary Home KMSs allow a user\'s keys to be revoked in the Home KMS
(e.g. due to compromise), but still be able to communicate using user keys
provisioned by a Secondary Home KMS.
In the above description, the \'user\' could be a GMS, MCX Server, Signalling
Proxy or any other entity containing a KM client.
##### 7.2.1.3.2 Use of KRRs
###### 7.2.1.3.2.1 Content of KRRs
The KMS Redirect Response (KRR) contains a list of KMS URIs for both the
initiator and the receiver. Both the initiator list and receiver list is an
ordered list, with the preferred KMS URIs first. The KMS URI list can also be
\'Any\' meaning that any KMS is acceptable.
The content of a KRR is:
\- An identifier for this type of response.
\- The date and time.
\- The identity of the KRR creator.
\- The MIKEY initiating identity used within the MIKEY message (IDRi).
\- The MIKEY receiving identity used within the MIKEY message (IDRr).
\- The initiator KMS URI used within the MIKEY message (IDRkmsi).
\- The receiver KMS URI used within the MIKEY message (IDRkmsr).
\- An initiator list containing a list of acceptable initiating KMS(s) (KMS
URIs).
\- A receiver list containing a list of acceptable receiving KMS(s) (KMS
URIs).
\- An embedded received KRR (if this KRR is generated as a result of a
received KRR).
\- A signature (using the originating identity) over the entire message
(optional, but recommended).
All fields, except for the signature, are required content.
###### 7.2.1.3.2.2 KRR creation procedure by a receiver
The KRR initiator and receiver lists (as defined in clause 7.2.1.3.2.1) are
populated based on the received MIKEY message from the initiator. The message
contains an initiating KMS URI (IDRkmsi) and receiving KMS URI (IDRkmsr).
1) The KRR initiator list is populated as follows:
a) If this is the first received MIKEY message from the initiator, the
receiver may respond with a preferred list of KMS URIs based on local policy.
If IDRkmsi corresponds to one of the receiver\'s External KMSs, the initiator
list shall contain, at minimum, the IDRkmsi.
b) Otherwise, the IDRkmsi does not correspond to one of the receiver\'s
External KMSs, and a list of KMS URIs corresponding to External KMSs is
provided based on local policy (not all KMS URIs need be included).
2) The KRR receiver list is populated as follows:
a) If this is the first received MIKEY message from the initiator, the
receiver may respond with a preferred list of KMS URIs based on local policy.
If the IDRkmsr corresponds to one of the receiver\'s Primary Home KMS or
Secondary Home KMS, the receiver list shall include, at minimum, the IDRkmsr.
b) Otherwise, the IDRkmsr does not correspond to one of the receiver\'s
Primary Home KMS or Secondary Home KMS, and a list of KMS URIs corresponding
to the Primary Home KMS and Secondary Home KMSs is provided based upon local
policy (not all KMS URIs need be included).
###### 7.2.1.3.2.3 KRR creation procedure by a MCX server or signalling proxy
A MCX Server or Signalling proxy can create a KRR on receipt of a MIKEY
message from the initiator en route to the receiver. The message contains an
initiating KMS URI (IDRkmsi) and receiving KMS URI (IDRkmsr). A KRR is created
under the following conditions.
Case A: For MIKEY messages entering from a MC client (inbound CS Proxy), a KRR
is created if the IDRkmsi is not acceptable. This could be either that the KMS
is not supported within the domain, or that the KMS is not supported for the
user given the user\'s current state, location or jurisdiction. In this case:
1\. the initiator KMS URI list contains a list of acceptable KMS URIs
supported by the domain for the user based on the user\'s current state.
2\. the receiver KMS URI list shall be \'ANY\'.
Case B: For MIKEY messages entering/leaving a domain (IS Proxy), if the
initiating user (IDRi) relates to this domain and the IDRkmsi is not
acceptable then:
1\. the initiator KMS URI list contains a list of acceptable Home and
Secondary Home KMS URIs used by the IDRi for this domain.
2\. the receiver KMS URI list is \'ANY\'.
NOTE: This case is primarily used where the initiator has migrated out of the
domain, meaning that the user\'s traffic is transiting the domain, but
ultimately enters/exits the domain via an IS Proxy.
Case C: For MIKEY messages entering/leaving a domain (IS Proxy), if the
receiving user (IDRr) relates to this domain and the IDRkmsr is not acceptable
then:
1\. the initiator KMS URI list is \'ANY\'.
2\. the receiver KMS URI list contains a list of acceptable Home and Secondary
Home KMS URIs used by the IDRr for this domain.
NOTE: This case is primarily used where the receiver has migrated out of the
domain, meaning that the user\'s traffic is transiting the domain, but
ultimately enters/exits the domain via an IS Proxy.
Case D: For MIKEY messages exiting towards a MC client (outbound CS Proxy), a
KRR is created if the IDRkmsr is not acceptable. This could be as the KMS is
not supported given the user\'s current state, location or jurisdiction. In
this case:
\- the initiator KMS URI list shall be \'ANY\'
\- the receiver KMS URI list contains a list of acceptable KMS URIs supported
by the domain based on the user\'s (IDRr) current state.
Should any network entity create a KRR, the network entity shall drop the
received MIKEY message. Entities in the path receiving a KRR shall forward the
KRR towards the initiating IDRi.
###### 7.2.1.3.2.4 Processing a KRR at a MCX server or signalling proxy
A MCX Server or Signalling proxy can create a new KRR on receipt of a KRR. The
content of the KRR is based on local policy of which KMSs are supported within
the domain. A new KRR is created under the following conditions:
Case A: For KRRs entering the domain from a MC client (inbound CS Proxy), a
new KRR is created if the contents of the receiver KMS URI list contains a KMS
URI that is not acceptable. This could be as the KMS is not supported given
the user\'s current state, location or jurisdiction. In this case in the new
KRR:
1\. the initiator list is unchanged.
2\. the receiver list is reduced to remove the unacceptable KMS URIs. If the
list is empty, an empty list is returned within the KRR (and consequently, the
communication will fail).
Case B: For KRRs entering/existing the domain towards another domain (IS
Proxy), a new KRR is created if the receiving user (IDRr) relates to this
domain and the receiver list contains a KMS that is not acceptable then in the
new KRR:
1\. the initiator list is unchanged.
2\. the receiver list is reduced to remove the unacceptable KMS URIs. If the
list is empty, an empty list is returned within the KRR (and consequently, the
communication will fail).
Case C: For KRRs entering/exiting the domain from another domain (inbound IS
Proxy), a new KRR is created if the initiating user (IDRi) relates to this
domain and the initiator list contains a KMS that is not acceptable then in
the new KRR:
1\. the initiator list is reduced to remove the unacceptable KMS URIs. If the
list is empty, an empty list is returned within the KRR (and consequently, the
communication will fail).
2\. the receiver list is unchanged.
Case D: For KRRs exiting the domain towards a MC client domain (outbound CS
Proxy), a new KRR is created if the contents of the initiator KMS URI list
contains a KMS URI that is not acceptable. This could be as the KMS is not
supported given the user\'s current state, location or jurisdiction. In this
case in the new KRR:
1\. the initiator list is reduced to remove the unacceptable KMS URIs. If the
list is empty, an empty list is returned within the KRR (and consequently, the
communication will fail).
2\. the receiver list is unchanged.
Should the network entity create a new KRR, the received KRR is dropped and
the new KRR is forwarded to the initiator. Entities in the path receiving a
KRR shall forward the KRR towards the initiating IDRi.
NOTE: The new KRR contains the received KRR. Consequently, the KRR could
contain multiple sub-KRRs. It is recommended that a maximum of 5 sub-KRRs are
supported.
###### 7.2.1.3.2.5 KMS Selection at the initiator
Where the initiator is distributing a key to a receiver (e.g. at the beginning
of a private call) it is possible that a KMS selection procedure needs to be
performed by the initiator. The KMS selection procedure results in the choice
of an initiator and receiver KMS (IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr) for the MIKEY message.
The KMS selection procedure is only required in two situations:
\- Initial distribution of a key where the receiver\'s KMS is not known (e.g.
the receiver\'s KMS is not listed in the user profile, the group document, or
known due to previous communication)
\- Upon receipt of a KRR due to a previous attempt to distribute a key.
In the first case, (ANY, ANY) is used as the initiator KMS list and receiver
KMS list pair. Otherwise the initiator KMS list and receiver KMS list is
provided within the KRR.
Using the provided initiator KMS list and receiver KMS list, the initiator
shall select the initiator KMS and receiver KMS based on the following
procedure:
1\. For the initiator KMS list, the initiator shall:
a. If the initiator KMS list is \'ANY\' the initiator shall populate the KMS
list with the Home KMS and with all Secondary Home KMSs (as provided by the
Home KMS).
b. If the KMS list is not empty, the initiator shall create a reduced list of
all KMS URIs that do not belong to the Home KMS or Secondary Home KMSs of the
initiator. If the reduced list still contains at least one KMS URI; then:
i. The initiator may apply local policy to select a KMS URI from the reduced
list; the initiator shall use the selected KMS (to sign the MIKEY message);
else
ii. If the KMS list contains the Home KMS URI; the initiator shall use the
Home KMS (to sign the MIKEY message); else
> ii. The initiator shall select the first KMS URI from the list. The
> initiator shall use the selected KMS ) to sign the MIKEY message);
d. If the reduced list contains no KMS URIs, then the communication fails.
2\. For the receiver KMS list, the initiator shall:
a. If the receiver KMS list is \'ANY\' the initiator shall populate the
receiver KMS list with the initiator\'s Home KMS and with all Secondary Home
KMSs and External KMSs of the receiver (as provisioned by the Home KMS).
b. If the receiver KMS list is not empty, the initiator shall create a reduced
list of all KMS URIs that do not belong to the initiator\'s Home KMS,
Secondary Home KMSs or to an External KMS. If the reduced list still contains
at least one KMS URI; then:
i. The initiator may apply local policy to select a KMS URI from the reduced
list; the initiator shall use the selected KMS (to encrypt the MIKEY message);
else
ii. If the KMS list contains the initiator\'s Home KMS URI; the initiator
shall use the Home KMS (to encrypt the MIKEY message); else
> ii. The initiator shall select the first KMS URI from the list. The
> initiator shall use the selected KMS (to encrypt the MIKEY message);
c. If the reduced list contains no KMS URIs, then the communication fails.
If an initiating and receiving KMS has been successfully selected, the
initiator shall send a new MIKEY message using the selected KMSs. If not, the
communication fails.
The purpose of KMS Discovery / Redirection procedures is to allow session key
distribution where the KMS used by the receiver is not known. It also allows
policy to be applied to ensure the KMS used by the receiver and initiator is
acceptable along the path of the communication.
The key message is a KMS Redirect Response (KRR) which conveys KMS policy to
the initiator. The initiator could be a MC client or GMS. Sometimes multiple
messages and KRR exchanges will be required to establish a suitable choice of
(KMS initiator, KMS receiver) pair. It is also possible that there is no
acceptable choice, and as a result of the process the communication fails.
##### 7.2.1.3.3 Security procedures for KMS Redirection Response
The KMS Redirect Response (KRR) procedure allows for MC Services to negotiate
and inform an MCX entity about which security domains (KMS URIs) are
acceptable for an MCX session.
Prior to beginning this process, it is assumed that:
\- The initiating user has been provisioned by its Home KMS with some
information on the permitted external security domains, including the KMS
certificate of External KMSs.
\- The terminating user has been provisioned by its Home KMS with some
information on the permitted external security domains, including the KMS
certificate of External KMSs.
A user shall only communicate with its Home KMS. External KMS Certificates
shall be manually loaded onto the Home KMS and distributed to the user as part
of the KMS\'s user key management processes.
The procedure for security domain redirection is shown in Figure 7.2.1.3.3-1.
Figure 7.2.1.3.3-1: Security domain redirection
The procedures in Figure 7.2.1.3.3-1 are now described in detail. Where the
security domains (KMS URIs) used by the initiating client are acceptable to
the MC Service(s) and terminating client, communication proceeds as normal.
However, where the initiating client uses security domain(s) (KMS URIs) that
are rejected along the signalling path or by the terminating client, the
following procedures take place:
The initiating client or function initiates a session with a user or function.
It is assumed that the receiver\'s KMS is not known (not listed in the user
profile or group document and there has not been a previous successful
communication), hence the client performs the procedure in clause 7.2.1.3.2.5
to select the KMS URIs to use in the MIKEY message.
1\. The initiating client sends the communication request to the initiating
application server. Under normal conditions the server routes the request on
the normal signalling path.
1a. Should the incorrect security domain(s) (KMS URIs) be used (based on local
policy or the policies of the terminating security domain), the server will
not forward on the request and may send a KRR message back to the client using
the procedures in clause in 7.2.1.3.2.3.
2\. If the communication request is forwarded on the normal signalling route,
the other application server should receive the request.
2a. Should an unacceptable security domain(s) be used (based on local policy
or the policies of the terminating security domain), the other application
server shall not forward on the request and may send a KRR message to the
initiating application server using the procedures in clause in 7.2.1.3.2.3.
2b. Upon receiving a KRR message from the other application server, the
application server may replace the \'security domain redirect response\'
message with another KRR message using the procedures in clause 7.2.1.3.2.4,
before forwarding the message down the normal signalling path.
3\. Should the request be forwarded on the normal signalling route to the
terminating client or function, the terminating MCX entity should receive the
request.
3a. The terminating client may determine that the security domains used by the
initiating client are not permitted. In this case, the terminating client may
send a KRR message containing permitted security domains back to the
initiating client using the procedures in clause 7.2.1.3.2.2.
3b. Upon receiving a KRR message and based on local policy, the other
application server may replace the KRR message using the procedures in clause
7.2.1.3.2.4, before forwarding the message down the normal signalling path to
the initial application server.
3c. Upon receiving a KRR message and based on local policy, the initial
application server may replace the KRR using the procedures in clause
7.2.1.3.2.4, before forwarding the message down the normal signalling path to
the client.
4\. On receiving a KRR, the initiator will perform the procedures in clause
7.2.1.3.2.5, and may repeat the above procedure from step 1. Upon next
connection to the Home KMS, the initiating client should upload the received
KRR message to allow fraud detection.
A MC client shall only accept external security domains that have been
permitted by the home security domain and provisioned by the Home KMS. The
Home KMS may also provision policy around the use of external security
domains, see clause 7.2.1.3.5.
NOTE 1: It is possible that the MC client receives a KRR either unsigned or
signed using a KMS URI that is not recognised/provisioned. In this case, it is
subject to policy (determined by the Home KMS) whether the redirect is
accepted, see clause 7.2.1.3.5.
NOTE 2: Under the most stringent policy, the KMS may implement policy that
require the client to hold the communication until the Home KMS has responded
with notification that the redirect is acceptable, see clause 7.2.1.3.5.
##### 7.2.1.3.4 Security Procedures for reporting external security domain use
Domain administrators should only allow users to communicate with trusted
external security domains. Should an external security domain be misused, it
is possible that users could be impersonated within the MCX system (in the
same way that misuse of a CA compromises communications that trust that CA).
To allow such misuse to be detected, and the associated KMS certificates to be
revoked, clients should report the use of external security domains to the
Home KMS.
##### 7.2.1.3.5 Policy around use of external security domains
The following are policies that the Home KMS may apply around the use of
external security domains.
\- Allow KRRs (yes/no). If no, all KRRs shall be ignored.
\- Report KRRs to the Home KMS (yes/no).
\- Require signed KRRs (yes/no). If no, all unsigned KRRs shall be ignored.
\- Request unknown KMS certificates (yes/no). If yes, should an unknown
external KMS certificate be in the list of receiving KMS URI(s) in the KRR,
the client shall request this certificate from the Home KMS.
\- Hold communication until KMS acceptance (yes/no). If yes, the client will
not act upon any KRRs until the Home KMS has provided a notification that the
redirect is acceptable (or otherwise).
#### 7.2.1.4 Evaluation against requirements
##### 7.2.1.4.1 Overview
This solution provides a flexible mechanism for meeting the requirements:
[MCSEC-1.7-1], [MCSEC-1.7-2] and [MCSEC-1.7-3]. The approach allows different
organisations to strike their own balance between availability (make the call
at any cost) and security (do not allow calls unless the destination is
authenticated). Whatever the organisation\'s choice, mechanisms exist to allow
the detection of false messages in this trust system.
##### 7.2.1.4.2 Security of 'Security Domain Redirect Response\'
When initiating a key across security domains, the only recipient that can
decrypt the key is the recipient with the correct identity that is keyed by
the correct external KMS. In effect, the recipient is authenticated by the
external KMS. If the external KMS behaves maliciously, the key could be
received by anyone. One way to hijack a call would be to persuade the
initiator to use the wrong external KMS, an untrustworthy external KMS. This
could be achieved by adding a false KMS URI to a Security Domain Redirect
Response.
If a false KMS URI is added to the Security Domain Redirect Response, this
allows this false KMS to spoof the identity of any user, allowing the
compromise of user traffic.
To prevent this fraud, the following mechanisms exist:
\- Only trusted KMS Certificates are loaded by the Home KMS into the client.
The client is unable to begin a communication with arbitrary security domains.
\- The Security Domain Redirect Response is signed. This allows a false
message to be traced to a user or KMS.
\- The content of a Security Domain Redirect Response is reported to the Home
KMS. This allows fraudulent responses to be detected. If the response does not
match other responses for a target user, this should be easily observed.
\- Should fraud be detected, the fraud can be traced to a source user and KMS.
For the fraud to be possible, a KMS have issued key material to a user using
an identity that is not theirs. Should this happen, the KMS can be removed
from the trusted KMS list, and future fraud will not be possible.
These mechanisms mean that while fraudulent behaviour is possible, it is
straightforward to trace to the source and for action to be taken to prevent
future fraud.
### 7.2.2 Solution #1.2 : Distribution of key material to protect signalling
between the MCX Server and the MCX client
#### 7.2.2.1 Overview
The solution defined here allows the MCX Server to \'download\' keys to the
MCX client. This may be used to support:
\- Multicast key distribution (MSCCK/MKFC).
\- Key update (CSK/MSCCK/MKFC).
To allow this key download to be performed, new procedures are defined.
Additionally, the method for uploading CSKs to the MCX Server during a
registration is maintained from TS 33.179 [3].
If this solution is accepted, individual mechanism for distributing keys
described in 33.179 [3] (e.g. for MSCCK and MKFC) will not be required in TS
33.180 [21].
#### 7.2.2.2 Motivating security requirements
The motivating security requirement is [MCSEC-1.8-1]. An additional motivation
is to simplify security procedures where possible (as this generally results
in a more secure system).
#### 7.2.2.3 Solution description
##### 7.2.2.3.1 Introduction
The MCX client and MCX Server require use of a number of signalling channels
for communication. For the MCPTT Server, these are:
\- Uplink signalling over SIP, unicast, MCPTT-1
\- Uplink media signalling over SRTCP, unicast, MCPTT-4
\- Uplink floor control signalling over SRTCP, unicast, MCPTT-4
\- Downlink signalling over SIP, unicast, MCPTT-1
\- Downlink media signalling over SRTCP, unicast, MCPTT-4
\- Downlink media signalling over SRTCP, multicast, MCPTT-9
\- Downlink floor control signalling over SRTCP, unicast, MCPTT-4
\- Downlink floor control signalling over SRTCP, multicast, MCPTT-9
\- Downlink MBMS subchannel control signalling over SRTCP, multicast, MCPTT-6
If the signalling channels for MCVideo and MCData are also included, the list
is much longer.
Each signalling channel between the MCX Server and MCX client requires
confidentiality and integrity protection. To allow the channels to be
protected, key distribution mechanisms are required to distribute the keys
used to protect these channels. Two key distribution mechanisms are described
to provide the MCX Server and MCX client to perform the necessary key
distribution procedures to protect signalling:
\- CSK upload via SIP REGISTER or SIP PUBLISH
\- Key download via SIP NOTIFY
These two mechanisms are described in the following subclauses.
##### 7.2.2.3.2 CSK Upload to MCX Server
Key upload allows the \'CSK\' to be uploaded from the MCX client to the MCX
Server. It is only used at registration within a SIP REGISTER or SIP PUBLISH
command. Procedures for \'Key Upload\' are defined within Clause 9.1.3 of TS
33.179 [3].
##### 7.2.2.3.3 Key download from MCX Server
\'Key download\' messages allow keys to be sent from the MCX Server to the MCX
clients. It is used in the following contexts:
\- To provide a Multicast Signalling Key (MuSiK) for the protection of
multicast signalling. MKFC and MSCCK are examples of a MuSiK from TS 33.179
[3].
\- To update an existing key (e.g. CSK or MuSiK)
The MCX Server invokes a \'key download\' procedure to distribute a Multicast
Signalling Key (MuSiK) to a client when:
\- The MCX Server decides to use an MBMS bearer with the MCX client and
existing MuSiKs provided to the client are not suitable for protecting this
signalling. In this case, a MuSiK is distributed to the client to protect MBMS
subchannel control messages.
\- The MCX Server decides to transmit group signalling (e.g. media control or
floor control) over an MBMS bearer to the client, and existing MuSiKs provided
to the client are not suitable for protecting this traffic. In this case, a
MuSiK is distributed to protect this group signalling.
The MCX Server may update an existing key (CSK or MuSiK) at any time. This may
be due to revocation or expiry.
Keys (CSK or MuSiKs) within \'Key download\' messages are distributed
encrypted specifically to a MCX user and signed using an identity representing
the MCX Server. Prior to group key distribution, each MCX UE shall be
provisioned by the KMS with time-limited key material associated with the MCX
User as described in clause 7.2 of 33.179 [3]. The MCX Server shall also be
provisioned by the KMS with key material for an identity which is authorized
to act as an MCX Server.
##### 7.2.2.3.4 Security procedures for key download
The signalling key (CSK or MuSiK) is distributed with a 32-bit key identifier
(CSK-ID or MuSiK-ID) within a MIKEY payload within the SDP content of a SIP
NOTIFY message generated by the MCX Server. This payload is a MIKEY-SAKKE
I_MESSAGE, as defined in IETF RFC 6509 [20], which ensures the
confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the payload.
The payload is constructed in a similar manner as for private call keys within
TS 33.179 [3]. A CSK/MuSiK is generated along with a CSK-ID/MuSiK-ID. The
difference from private call procedures is that it is signed using (the KMS-
provisioned key associated to) the identity of the MCX Server. The security
processes are summarized in figure 7.2.2.3.4-1.
Figure 7.2.2.3.4-1: Security information within a Key Download message
At the MCPTT UE, the MCPTT Server\'s URI is extracted from the initiator field
(IDRi) of the message. Along with the time, this is used to check the
signature on the message. If valid, the UE extracts and decrypts the
encapsulated key (MuSiK or CSK) using the (KMS-provisioned) user\'s UID key.
The MCPTT UE also extracts key id (MuSiK-ID or CSK-ID). This process is shown
in figure 7.2.2.3.4-2.
Figure 7.2.2.3.4-2: Processing the security content of a Key download message
As a result of this mechanism, the MCX UEs that have received a \'key
download\' message will receive a new signalling key, CSK or MuSiK, identified
by the 4 most significant bits of the key ID.
If the key is a CSK:
\- the MCX UE shall discard any previous CSKs associated with the MCX Server
URI, and
\- the MCX UE shall use the new CSK for uplink signaling with the MCX Server
If the key is a MuSiK:
\- the MCX UE shall store the MuSiK and MuSiK-ID. Upon receipt of multicast
signalling which indicates that the MuSiK has been used via the MuSiK-ID, the
MuSiK shall be used to decrypt the signalling.
Key derivation proceeds as previously described in TS 33.179 [3].
##### 7.2.2.3.5 Key download procedures
The procedures for key download are described in the following
Figure 7.2.2.3.5-1: Procedures for key download
0\. The MCX UE has been provisioned by a KMS with key material associated with
the MCX user. The MCX UE has also registered with an MCX Server. As a
consequence of this registration, the MCX UE has implicitly subscribed to key
download notifications from the MCX Server.
1\. The MCX Server sends a key download message (SIP NOTIFY) to the MCX UE.
The MCX UE extracts the signalling key from the key download message.
2\. Upon successful extraction of the signalling key, the MCX UE returns a key
download success message (200 OK response) to the MCX Server.
#### 7.2.2.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution meets the requirements within this TR using a simple mechanism
that is consistent with previous approaches within TS 33.179 [3]. It removes
the need for specific procedures to support MKFCs, MSCCKs, and updating CSKs.
It would be straight forward to use this approach to distribute other types of
keys if they are required to support different services, reducing the long-
term complexity of the MC system.
A 'key download message\' is an additional signalling message and hence
increases the initial signalling overhead when setting up a multicast bearer.
However, it allows for more flexible key management which reduces signalling
in the following circumstances:
\- Allows an MKFC to be the same key as a MSCCK. This reduces signalling and
key processing as the key need not be sent as both an MKFC and as a MSCCK.
\- Allows multiple multicast bearers to share the same MSCCK without including
that key in every bearer announcement message. This reduces the amount data
transmitted over signalling bearers and the amount of key processing required.
\- Similarly, as UEs change MBSFN areas, this means that a (new or the same)
MSCCK need not be redistributed in the bearer announcement message for the new
area. This reduces the amount data transmitted over signalling bearers and the
amount of key processing required.
\- Allows multiple groups to share the same MKFC. This reduces signalling by
reducing the number of group key distribution messages required.
\- Allows key update of MSCCK without making a new bearer announcement
message. Where the same key is used for multiple bearers/groups, this
significantly reduces the number of messages required to update this key.
In extremis, there could only be a single MKFC/MSCCK for protecting multicast
signalling for all groups and all multicast bearers. This is a natural
approach if the signalling security is only required to protect signalling
from those not part of the MC service, and not for separation within the
service. In this case, this solution results in only one 'key download
message\' rather than repeatedly redistributing this key for every group and
every bearer.
In summary, while the 'key download message\' is an additional signalling
message, it removes the need to distribute or redistribute keys in other
messages, which will reduce the amount of signalling, data and key processing.
### 7.2.3 Solution #1.3 : Adding KMS security domain details to configuration
data
#### 7.2.3.1 Overview
This solution adds details of the KMS Security Domain to configuration data
used within the mission critical system. This is required to tell the
encrypting entity which KMS is used by the receiving entity, and thus which
security parameters to use for encryption. The information is required to
support MCPTT private call, MCVideo private call, and for group key
distribution. The choice of Security Domain is associated with the user,
specifically the user\'s MC Service ID (MCPTT ID, MCVideo ID, MCData ID). The
Security Domain could be the Home Security Domain (the same security domain as
the encrypting entity) or an External Security Domain (a different Security
Domain to the encrypting entity).
The distribution of security parameters themselves is already defined.
Security parameters are always distributed by the home KMS over the CSC-8,
CSC-9 or CSC-10 interface. Security parameters are contained within a KMS
Certificate as defined in Annex D.3.1 of TS 33.180 [21].
\- The security parameters for the Home Security Domain are within the KMS
Certificate with \'Role = \"Home\"\'. This is distributed as part of a
\'KMSInit\' response, which provides the UE with the KMS\'s certificate.
\- The security parameters for an External Security Domain are within a KMS
Certificate with \'Role = \"External\"\'. This is distributed as part of a
\'KMSCertCache\' response, which provides the UE with a set of external
certificates for External Security Domains.
#### 7.2.3.2 Motivating security requirements
The primary motivation is the practical requirement to provide specific data
to allow cross-domain communications. Additionally, the following security
requirement motivates this solution:
[MCSEC-1.7-1] When using external security domains, the Home Security Domain
shall apply policies which ensure that only trusted external security domains
are used.
#### 7.2.3.3 Solution description
##### 7.2.3.3.1 Provisioning security parameters to support external security
domains
The KMS distributes security parameters, known as external KMS Certificates,
to entities in the MC service as required. These entities are the MC Users,
the GMS(s) and MCX Server(s) which require communication with an external
security domain. These entities request external KMS certificates as required
via a \'KMSCertCache\' request from the MC client to the KMS as decribed in
clause 5.2.2.3 of TS 33.180 [21].
Upon receipt of a KMSCertCache request, the KMS shall authenticate the
requesting client. Based upon policy, the KMS shall return only those external
KMS Certificates that the client is permitted to use.
The external KMS Certificates are contained in the response to the
\'KMSCertCache\' response from the KMS to the MC client. On receipt of a
'KMSCertCache\' response, the client shall verify signatures within the
response and reject the message should verification fail.
The KMS Certificates within the response shall have the parameter \'Role\' set
to \'External\' to indicate that the certificate belongs to an External
Security Domain. Certificates are identified by the KMS (KMSUri) and a unique
identifier (CertUri) as defined in Annex D.3.1 of TS 33.180 [21]. A (logical)
KMS should only have a single KMS certificate active at any one time (based
upon the KMSUri). Certificates may be updated using the CertURI. Should the
client receive a certificate with a CertURI of an existing certificate, the
client shall replace this existing certificate with the newly provisioned
certificate.
##### 7.2.3.3.2 Identification of External Security Domains
To support multiple security domains, the security domain used by each user is
recorded alongside the user\'s MC Service ID within configuration parameters
in the MC system. Furthermore, the security domain of the GMS is recorded
alongside the GMS FQDN and the security domain of the MCX Server is recorded
alongside the MCX Server FQDN. Security domains are identified by a unique
identifier, the \'KMSUri\'. Specifically, the following describes the
situations where security domain information is needed:
1) The MCX Server(s) requires knowledge of the security domain (KMSUri) of
users connected to the server.
2.1) On initiating a MCPTT private call, the initiating UE requires knowledge
of the security domain (KMSUri) of the receiving user.
2.2) On receiving a MCPTT private call, the receiving UE requires knowledge of
the security domain (KMSUri) of the initiating user.
3.1) On initiating a MCVideo private call, the initiating UE requires
knowledge of the security domain (KMSUri) of the receiving user.
3.2) On receiving a MCVideo private call, the receiving UE requires knowledge
of the security domain (KMSUri) of the initiating user.
4.1) On initiating a MCData one-to-one SDS or file transfer, the initiating UE
requires knowledge of the security domain (KMSUri) of the receiving user.
4.2) On receiving a MCData one-to-one SDS or file transfer, the receiving UE
requires knowledge of the security domain (KMSUri) of the initiating user.
5) The Group Management Server requires knowledge of the security domain
(KMSUri) of each member of the group.
6) Group members require knowledge of the security domain (KMSUri) of the
group management server.
7) MC users require knowledge of the security domain (KMSUri) of the MCX
Server(s) to which they connect.
NOTE: In most cases, the required security domain will be the Home security
domain, meaning that the required KMSUri will be the user\'s Home KMSUri. It
may be more space efficient to only keep a record where the KMSUri is not the
Home KMSUri.
This information can be added to configuration data or pre-configuration data.
Considering the configuration data already defined, the following are
suggestions of modifications to the configuration database:
1a) Within \'MCPTT user profile data\', Table A.3-1 of TS 23.379: Below
\'MCPTT user identity (MCPTT ID)\', an entry called the \'MCPTT user security
domain\' containing the \'KMSUri\' of the user\'s security domain.
1b) Within \'MCVideo user profile data\', Table A.3-1 of TS 23.281: Below
\'MCVideo identity (MCVideo ID)\', an entry called the \'MCVideo user security
domain\' containing the \'KMSUri\' of the user\'s security domain.
1c) Within \'MCData user profile data\' Table A.3-1 of TS 23.282: Below
\'MCData identity (MCData ID)\', an entry called the \'MCData user security
domain\' containing the \'KMSUri\' of the user\'s security domain.
2) Within \'MCPTT user profile data\', Table A.3-1 of TS 23.379: within the
\'List of user(s) who can be called in private call\', an entry per-user
called the \'MC user security domain\' containing the \'KMSUri\' of the called
user\'s security domain.
3) Within an equivalent place as (C2) within the MCVideo user profile data for

##### 7.2.3.3.3 Use of Multiple Security Domains
On encrypting to an entity within the MC System using an I_MESSAGE, the client
shall lookup the KMSUri from the appropriate configuration data, then lookup
the appropriate KMS Certificate with that KMSUri from the certificate cache
downloaded from its home KMS. The security parameters within the KMS
Certificate are used to perform encryption. The KMSUri is added to the
I_MESSAGE within the IDRkmsr field.
Equivalently, when verifying a received I_MESSAGE, the receiving client shall
extract the KMSUri from the I_MESSAGE (if present) and check this matches the
KMSUri from the appropriate configuration data. The client shall then lookup
the appropriate KMS Certificate with that KMSUri from the certificate cache
downloaded from its home KMS. The security parameters within the KMS
Certificate are used to perform verification.
Should a matching certificate not be found, the client may request the
certificate based on the KmsUri from its home KMS using an appropriate
KMSCertCache request.
#### 7.2.3.4 Evaluation against requirements
Requirement [MCSEC-1.7-1] is met by the KMS choosing which external KMS
Certificates will be sent to MCX UEs. Furthermore, the addition of the KMS URI
to configuration parameters allows the home MC System to choose which security
domains are used by its users when communicating externally.
### 7.2.4 Solution #1.4 : Encryption of entire XML signalling content
#### 7.2.4.1 Overview
This solution suggests that in TS 33.180 [21], the entire XML signalling
content should be allowed to be protected.
#### 7.2.4.2 Motivating security requirements
The motivating security requirements are those that require protection of
signalling from those outside the MC Domain. While these are currently met,
the existing solution is non-standard and inefficient which makes use of the
solution less likely to be used, leaving signalling content vulnerable to
attack.
#### 7.2.4.3 Solution description
The restriction on what content may be protected by XMLenc is removed.
Specifically, the following text in TS 33.180 [21] is removed:
> _Confidentiality protection may only be applied to the following identifiers
> and values:_
>
> _\- MCPTT ID_
>
> _\- MCPPT Group ID_
>
> _\- User location information_
>
> _\- Alerts_
>
> _\- Access token_
>
> _\- KMS provisioned key material._
Instead, where required, confidentiality protection may be applied to the
entire XML signalling payload. This removes the need for protecting individual
elements or a bespoke solution for the protection of attributes.
Where encryption is applied, the \'type\' of message is clearly stated within
the EncryptedData payload. This will allow the operator to understand how
their network is being used.
#### 7.2.4.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution is clearly simpler, more efficient in terms of the quantity of
data, easier to implement and faster to process.
The reason the restriction on confidentiality is currently in place is to
allow the operator the ability to understand how their network is being used
to correctly bill, perform analytics and detect fraud. In particular, it would
allow the operator to check that XML signalling is not being fraudulently used
to tunnel data out of the operator network, potentially at a reduced cost.
By including detailed information within the \'type\' of message (which is not
encrypted), it should be possible for the operator to understand how their
network is being used. By also placing limits on the quantity of encrypted
data, the operator can limit any exposure to fraud.
### 7.2.5 Solution #1.5 : Signalling Proxy
#### 7.2.5.1 Overview
For the Mission Critical Services defined up to this point, signalling
security functions were performed by the MCX Server itself. Where these are
used, this introduces a number of disadvantages:
\- The mission critical core network architecture is exposed to Mission
Critical clients, in that the client needs to know the SIP URI of each
distinct MCX Server.
\- Intrusion detection within the XML signalling link is impossible outside of
the mission critical server (as the mission critical server itself is the only
entity able to decrypt the traffic.
\- Assigning edge policies to signalling on entry to the Mission Critical
network is impossible.
\- The client will need to setup a different CSK for each MCX Server. In large
or complex network may result in a large number of CSKs.
\- When multicast signalling is used, each MCX Server may establish its own
MuSiK. This could result in multiple MuSiKs being distributed, increasing
complexity.
\- When multicast signalling is used and different MCX Servers use difference
MuSiK keys, this could prevent the sharing of multicast bearers between MCX
Servers.
Effectively, for XML protected application signalling, the mission critical
network is unable to use the equivalent functions performed by a Session
Border Controller (SBC) in a SIP network. This proposed solution suggests that
the use of a signalling proxy, able to remove signalling security at the edge
and potentially apply policies, should be supported in the mission critical
system.
#### 7.2.5.2 Motivating security requirements
The motivating security requirements are those in Key Issue #1.9 on applying
security at the network edge.
#### 7.2.5.3 Solution description
##### 7.2.5.3.1 Overview
This solution defines the role of a Signalling Proxy within the Mission
Critical System. Signalling Proxies are optional elements providing a
deployment option, but it is essential that they can be supported due to the
various security and functional advantages that they provide.
The primary function of the signalling proxy is to perform key management of
signalling keys, and encryption/decryption of application signalling
transiting the edge of the mission critical domain.
This solution defines two types of signalling proxy:
\- Client Signalling proxy (CS Proxy)
\- Interconnection Signalling Proxy (IS Proxy)
The Client Signalling Proxy performs security operations towards the client on
behalf of the mission critical domain. This includes:
\- Topology hiding
\- Resilience against signalling storm
\- CSK key management (per client);
\- MuSiK key management (where protection of multicast signalling is
required);
\- Protection of application layer signalling (XML in SIP);
\- Protection of floor control signalling, transmission control signalling and
media signalling (SRTCP);
\- Protection of MCData signalling payloads.
\- Generation of KMS Redirect Responses (KRRs)
The Interconnection Signalling Proxy performs security operations towards
other mission critical domains. This includes:
\- Topology hiding
\- Resilience against signalling storm
\- Storage of SPK(s);
\- Protection of application layer signalling (XML in SIP);
\- Protection of floor control signalling, transmission control signalling and
media signalling (SRTCP);
\- Protection of MCData signalling payloads.
\- Generation of KMS Redirect Responses (KRRs)
Signalling proxies may present one or multiple identifiers externally. A CS
proxy requires keying by the Key Management Server (KMS) to receive key
material associated with the identifiers that it represents externally.
NOTE: Where signalling proxies are used, MCX Servers may not require keying by
the KMS as they may not perform any security functionality.
##### 7.2.5.3.2 Location of a Signalling Proxy
###### 7.2.5.3.2.1 Overview
A signalling proxy should be located at the logical edge of the MC Domain.
Signalling routed via the SIP Core should be routed via the signalling proxy
on entry or exit of the MC Domain.
###### 7.2.5.3.2.2 Deployment with an untrusted SIP Core
Where the SIP Core is not trusted by the Mission Critical provider, the
Signalling Proxy should be located between Mission Critical Functions (MCX
Server, GMS, etc.) and the external SIP Core. The use of Signalling Proxies
within a MC System where the SIP Core is untrusted is shown in Figure
7.2.5.3.2.2-1.
Figure 7.2.5.3.2.2-1: Signalling proxies (with untrusted SIP Core)
Internal signalling within the MC Domain (between MCX Server(s) and GMS(s))
routes via the SIP Core. Consequently, in this scenario, the IS Proxy will
route all internal signalling to/from itself via the SIP core. Each time it
receives an internal signalling message, the IS Proxy should apply an SPK for
protection and it should perform topology hiding towards the SIP Core.
NOTE: There may be a performance impact of locating the SIP Core outside of
the MC Domain due to the increased load on the IS Proxy.
The use of the signalling proxy at the edge of the Mission Critical network
does not remove the need to deploy a SIP Session Border Controller (as defined
in RFC 5853 [24]), or IMS IBCF (as defined in Annex I of 3GPP TS 23.228 [23]),
to protect the SIP core.
###### 7.2.5.3.2.3 Deployment with a trusted SIP Core
Where the SIP Core is trusted by the Mission Critical provider, the Signalling
Proxy should be located at the edge of the external SIP Core, allowing data
transiting the SIP core to be unencrypted. The use of Signalling Proxies
within a MC System where the SIP Core is trusted is shown in Figure
7.2.5.3.2.3-1.
Figure 7.2.5.3.2.3-1: Signalling proxies (with trusted SIP Core)
In this deployment scenario, the MC Signalling Proxy may be co-located with
the SIP Core\'s Session Border Controller (as defined in RFC 5853 [24]), or
IMS IBCF (as defined in Annex I of 3GPP TS 23.228 [23]). This has the security
benefit that the SIP identities and the Mission Critical identities can be
correlated at the edge, increasing the system\'s ability to detect misuse,
associate signalling and media and apply system policies.
NOTE: In this deployment scenario, signalling security (e.g. XMLSec) and SIP
security (e.g. TLS/IPSec) are performing the same function within the MC
System. Consequently, the use of both signalling protection methods may not be
necessary.
NOTE: In this deployment scenario, the IS Proxy is not involved in the routing
of internal signalling.
##### 7.2.5.3.3 Functions of a signalling proxy
###### 7.2.5.3.3.1 Overview
A signalling proxy may perform the functions specified in this clause.
###### 7.2.5.3.3.2 Identifier modification (topology hiding)
One function of a signalling proxy is to change the source and destination
identifiers in signalling messages to prevent the network topology being
exposed externally.
\- Messages received on the external interface will be forwarded to an
appropriate MC Server based on the type of message and consequently the
destination identifier of the message will be changed by the proxy.
\- Messages received on the internal interface will have their source
identifier replaced with the proxy\'s identifier.
Modification of identifiers applies to all signalling handled by the proxy.
Specifically:
\- SIP;
\- Application layer signalling (XML in SIP);
\- Floor control signalling, transmission control signalling and media
signalling (SRTCP);
\- MCData signalling payloads.
###### 7.2.5.3.3.3 Resilience against signalling storm
The signalling proxy is able to monitor the quantity and type of signalling
entering the MC Domain. Signalling Proxy should be resilient to receiving a
large amount of signalling, such as a high number of MCX Server registrations.
The Signalling Proxy should be able to block, throttle or prioritise the
signalling routed into the MC Domain to prevent overload of application
signalling at the MCX Server, while maintaining the most critical MC services.
Applying limits to signalling could be performed at a service-level or to a
specific user\'s signalling.
###### 7.2.5.3.3.4 Client connection to a CS Proxy
When an MC client first connects to a CS Proxy, it will provide an
encapsulated CSK along with an access token as part of a SIP SUBSCRIBE or SIP
PUBLISH message. The CS Proxy will extract and store the CSK and decrypt the
access token. The CS Proxy will then forward the SIP SUBSCRIBE or SIP PUBLISH
message onto an appropriate MCX Server with an unencrypted access token and
without the encapsulated CSK.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether only the MC Servers verify the access
tokens, or this function may be performed by the CS Proxy.
From this point onwards, signalling received from the client will be decrypted
using the CSK, and signalling sent to the client will be encrypted using the
CSK. This functionality is as currently defined for a MCX Server.
###### 7.2.5.3.3.5 CSK key download from a CS Proxy
The CS Proxy is responsible for CSK key management. Hence, should the CSK
require renewal, the CS Proxy will create and send a 'key download\' message
to the MC client containing the new CSK. This functionality is as currently
defined for a MCX Server.
As signalling proxies may present the one or multiple SIP URIs externally, the
same client may attempt to connect to the same CS Proxy twice, using different
URIs and CSKs each time. In this scenario, the CS Proxy may remove CSK
ambiguity by using the 'CSK key download\' procedure as follows:
1) The MC client connects to the CS Proxy using the URI 'A\'. The MC client
provides CSK~A~.
2) The CS Proxy receives CSK~A~ and the MC client and CS Proxy use CSK~A~ to
protect application signalling.
3) The MC client connects to the CS Proxy using the URI 'B\'. The MC client
provides CSK~B~.
4) The CS Proxy observes that the same client has connected again using a
different URI.
5) The CS Proxy performs a 'CSK key download\' to update CSK~B~. The CS Proxy
sets CSK~B~ to CSK~A~.
6) The MC client and CS Proxy use CSK~A~ to protect application signalling
(regardless of source URI).
###### 7.2.5.3.3.6 MuSiK and MSCCK key download from a CS Proxy
Should multicast signalling be required, the CS Proxy is also responsible for
MuSiK key download from the CS Proxy to the client. To support this, the CS
Proxy performs a MuSiK key download procedure toward the MC clients that will
receive multicast signalling. This functionality is as currently defined for a
MCX Server.
On receipt of signalling from the MC domain towards a multicast bearer, the CS
Proxy protects the signalling with a MuSiK and forwards the message
externally. This functionality is as currently defined for a MCX Server.
NOTE: As multiple MCX Servers can use the same CS Proxy for multicast
signalling, this allows multiple MCX Servers to share multicast bearers.
Similarly, the CS Proxy is able to attach a MSCCK to MBMS Bearer Annoucement
messages, and encrypt MBMS subchannel control messages with the
###### 7.2.5.3.3.7 Signalling protection by the IS Proxy
The IS Proxy is configured with one, or more, SPKs for protection of
signalling and each SPK will be associated with specific interconnection end-
point(s). On receipt of signalling from the MC domain towards an
interconnection end-point, the IS Proxy will encrypt the signalling using the
appropriate SPK and forward the message externally. On receipt of signalling
from an interconnection end-point towards the MC Domain, the IS Proxy will
decrypt the signalling and forward the message internally.
###### 7.2.5.3.3.8 Creation of KMS Redirect Responses (KRRs)
The Signalling Proxy may create KRRs to enforce local policy around the use of
KMSs within the MC Domain. For example, should a MIKEY message be sent through
the domain using a KMS that is unacceptable within the domain, the CS or IS
Proxy may drop the MIKEY message, create a KRR and return the KRR to the
sender of the MIKEY message.
###### 7.2.5.3.3.9 Policy enforcement
As gateways to the MC domain, signalling proxies may also be appropriate
locations to enforce policy within the MC domain.
Editor\'s Note: Defining the policies that could be enforced at the signalling
proxy is FFS.
#### 7.2.5.4 Evaluation against requirements
The proposed deployment option allows for a simplification of security and
policy enforcement within the MC Domain, allowing an increase in network
efficiency. It also meets the requirements in Key Issue 1.9, allowing security
to be applied at the edge.
### 7.2.6 Solution #1.6 : Authentication of a sensitive signalling request
(EAR)
#### 7.2.6.1 Overview
The MC System contains a number of sensitive signalling requests where a
remote 'requester\' causes an action to occur on a target MC client, either
with or without that client\'s permission. These requests include Ambient
Listening, Ambient Video, Video Pull, etc. It is a requirement that the
ability to use these features should be controlled; only certain users may be
permitted to make these requests.
Currently, signalling is protected hop-by-hop within the MC System. This
causes a challenge for the above requirement. In an MC Domain which is
interconnected or supporting migration, signalling may pass through multiple
MCX Servers from the requester to the target client. In this scenario, both
the target\'s MCX Server and the target\'s client are unable to check the
identity of the requester, or whether the requester has permission to perform
the action. This leaves the client open to attack via misuse of sensitive
signalling requests.
The solution proposed attaches an Element for Authenticating Requests (EAR) to
the application signalling message from the requester to the target client.
#### 7.2.6.2 Motivating security requirements
The following security requirements highlight the need for authentication of
sensitive signalling requests:
[MCSEC-1.4-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to ensure
integrity of all user signalling at the application layer.
[MCSEC-1.4-3] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to
authenticate the origin of signalling which initiates an action on the MC
client.
[MCSEC-5.6-019] Specific roles in the organization and shall be identified to
authorize and activate Ambient Listening and privileges shall be assigned to
these roles to activate and register the use of ambient listening.
[MCSEC-5.6-020] The activation of the Ambient Listening functionality shall be
automatically registered by the system and will be stored as an \'event\' by
the system.
#### 7.2.6.3 Solution description
##### 7.2.6.3.1 Overview
When sending a sensitive signalling message, the requester creates the message
as normal, then attaches an EAR to the message. The EAR contains the purpose
and constraints of the request (type of request, restrictions on request,
origin, destination) and is signed by the requester. When used correctly, the
EAR should provide a definitive record of the 'request that was made,
including evidence that the request was not disproportionate.
Messages which should be authenticated with an EAR are defined in Solution
1.7.
##### 7.2.6.3.2 Contents of an EAR
An EAR shall contain the following information elements:
\- Time of request.
\- EAR identifier.
\- The MCX user ID (URI) associated with the requester.
\- The KMS URI associated with the requester.
\- The MCX user ID (URI) associated with the target.
\- The type of request (e.g. Ambient Listening), including limitations to the
request (e.g. maximum session length).
\- The signature algorithm/type
\- A signature over the whole EAR element.
The EAR may also be extended to support additional information elements as
required by a particular MC domain(s) or jurisdiction(s).
##### 7.2.6.3.3 EAR Signatures
All MC clients are keyed by a KMS to perform ECCSI signatures, therefore
signing EARs using ECCSI is a straight forward to support. There may also be
value in supporting ECDSA.
The mandatory algorithm for EAR signatures is ECCSI. The signature shall be
applied as defined in TS 33.180 [21], Clause 8.8.5.
##### 7.2.6.3.4 Relationship with MCData SDS
MCData SDS provides a format for a authenticating a MCData 'Data Payload\'
message. Consequently, it is feasible that this format could be re-used to
support the EAR. The EAR could be embedded in a signed MCData 'Data Payload\'
and the MCData 'Data Payload\' could be attached to the signalling request.
Editor\'s Note: The format (XML, TLV) of EAR messages is FFS.
##### 7.2.6.3.5 EAR Encryption
EARs are designed to transfer authentication information along the application
signalling channel. The application signalling channel, including the EARs,
are protected hop-by-hop using a CSK or SPK. In addition to this, there may be
value in encrypting the EAR from the signer to the verifier.
The value in encryption is that MCX Servers or signalling proxies may choose
to hide the identities of internal system entities or users, particularly upon
signalling messages leaving the domain. As the EAR is signed, it will not be
possible for the EAR to be modified on transit to hide the originating entity.
To prevent the leaking of internal identifiers, the EAR would need to be
encrypted.
For encryption of EARs to be possible, who will need to verify the EAR will
need to be known in advance by the signer (along with the parameters required
to encrypt).
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS if all the potential \'users\' of the EAR is known
by the creator of the EAR.
Editor\'s Note: Whether encryption is valuable for EAR signatures is FFS.
#### 7.2.6.4 Evaluation against requirements
The proposed mechanism defines a way to authenticate a sensitive signalling
request and meet the requirements described in 7.2.6.4. The approach is to add
an additional authentication element to the existing signalling. Consequently,
existing signalling is not changed and there should be no back-compatibility
impact.
EAR encryption does not appear to be feasible as the 'users\' of the EAR are
not known at the time of EAR generation.
### 7.2.7 Solution #1.7 : EAR authorisation
#### 7.2.7.1 Overview
The MC System contains a number of sensitive signalling requests where a
remote 'requester\' causes an action to occur on a target MC client, either
with or without that client\'s permission. These requests include Ambient
Listening, Ambient Video, Video Pull, etc. It is a requirement that the
ability to use these features should be controlled; only certain users may be
permitted to make these requests.
Currently, signalling is protected hop-by-hop within the MC System. This
causes a challenge for the above requirement. In an MC Domain which is
interconnected or supporting migration, signalling may pass through multiple
MCX Servers from the requester to the target client. In this scenario, both
the target\'s MCX Server and the target\'s client are unable to check the
identity of the requester, or whether the requester has permission to perform
the action. This leaves the client open to attack via misuse of sensitive
signalling requests.
While Solution #1.6 allows a request to be signed and hence associated to the
originating a MC entity, it does not convey to the receiver that a requester
is authorised to make a request. The solution proposed allows the user\'s
authorisation to be conveyed to the receiver.
#### 7.2.7.2 Motivating security requirements
The motivating security requirements are the same as those for Solution #1.6.
#### 7.2.7.3 Solution description
##### 7.2.7.3.1 Overview
The purpose of authorisation is to convey to the receiver that the requester
has permission to take an action. Most authorisations are managed by the MCX
Server. However, some authorisations cannot be managed by the MCX server. The
following situations describe authentication and authorisation mechanisms in
the MC system.
\- Network access: Authentication and authorisation of the MC client are
provided by the access token.
\- Signalling between the home MC Domain and a directly-connected MC client:
Authentication is provided by the SIP core or by use the CSK. Authorisation of
the MC client is provided by user configuration document. Authorisation of the
MC domain is implicit due to the direct connection.
\- Privileged signalling sent within the MC network (e.g. Ambient listening
request): Authentication should be provided by an EAR. **The signalling may be
authorised by the mechanism defined in this solution** (the receiving client
needs to rely on the MC domain to only allow authorised requests through, and
for privileged signalling, this is insufficient).
NOTE 1: Privileged signalling is signalling which allows one client to
remotely cause an intrusive action on another client.
\- Signalling from a network entity in a partner domain towards a network
entity in the home domain (e.g. group call request from partner MCPTT server
to primary MCPTT server): Authentication may be provided by an EAR. **The
signalling may be authorised by the mechanism defined in this solution** (e.g.
the home domain does not know if the requesting entity is a MCPTT server).
\- Signalling from a group client attached to a partner MC Domain.
Authentication should be provided by an EAR attached to the request.
Authorisation of the MC client is provided by the user configuration document.
**The Group Management Server may be authorised by the mechanism defined in
this solution.**
NOTE 2: Apart from group signalling, signalling from a partner client
connected to a partner domain is authenticated and authorised by the partner
domain. For non-privileged signalling, where this signalling impacts the home
domain, the signalling is authenticated and authorised by the partner domain
(as above), rather than the partner client.
\- Signalling between the home network and a home client who has migrated to a
partner MC Domain: Authentication should be provided by an EAR attached to the
request. Authorisation of the MC client is provided by the user configuration
document. **The home MC Domain may be authorised by the mechanism defined in
this solution.**
**-** Off-network signalling between MC clients: Authentication should be
provided by an EAR attached to the request. **The signalling may be authorised
by the mechanism defined in this solution** (e.g. the MC client does not know
if the requesting client is permitted to initiate this signalling flow).
The above analysis demonstrates that a solution is required in a number of
scenarios to convey authorisation within the MC System. In each case, an EAR
is used to convey authentication. The following are the authorisations that
need to be conveyed:
\- The role of entities within the MC domain (e.g. only Group Management
Servers are authorised to send group notifications, only MCX servers are
authorised to send key download messages). The following roles are required:
\- MCPTT client
\- MCVideo client
\- MCData client
\- MCPTT Server
\- MCVideo Server
\- MCData Server
\- CS Proxy
\- IS Proxy
\- Group Management Server
\- The permission to send privileged signalling within the network (e.g. only
specific clients are able to send Ambient Listening requests). Privileged
signalling is signalling which allows one client to remotely cause an
intrusive action on another client. The following are privileged signalling
requests which should be explicitly authorised:
\- MCPTT Private call request in automatic commencement mode (TS 23.379 [19]).
\- MCPTT Ambient listening call request (TS 23.379).
\- MCPTT Remotely initiated MCPTT call request, in unnotified mode (TS
23.379).
\- MCVideo Private call request (including private call, video pull and video
push) in automatic commencement mode (TS 23.281 [9]).
\- MCVideo Remote video push request in automatic commencement mode (TS
23.281).
\- MCVideo Ambient viewing call request (TS 23.281).
\- MCData standalone data request for application consumption (TS 23.282
[10]).
\- MCData standalone session data request for application consumption (TS
23.282).
\- MCData session data request for application consumption (TS 23.282).
\- MCData group standalone data request for application consumption (TS
23.282).
\- MCData group data request for application consumption (TS 23.282).
\- MCData FD request with mandatory indication (TS 23.282).
\- MCData group standalone FD request with mandatory indication (TS 23.282).
\- The permission to send off-network signalling requests to another MC client
(e.g. MCData standalone data request). All off-network signalling requests may
be explicitly authorised. The following are the off-network signalling
requests:
\- MCPTT Group call announcement (TS 23.379 [19]).
\- MCPTT emergency alert announcement (TS 23.379).
\- MCPTT Call setup request (TS 23.379).
\- MCVideo Group communication announcement (TS 23.281 [9]).
\- MCVideo emergency alert announcement (TS 23.281).
\- MCVideo Private communication request (TS 23.281).
\- MCVideo Capability request (TS 23.281).
\- MCVideo Activity request (TS 23.281).
\- MCData standalone data request (Clause 7.4.3.3.2, TS 23.282 [10]).
\- MCData group standalone data request (Clause 7.4.3.4.2, TS 23.282).
##### 7.2.7.3.2 Conveying authorisation
Authorisation is conveyed using the MC entity\'s SIP URI (e.g. MC Service ID)
that is used to sign the EAR. Authorisation information is contained within a
SIP URI Header (known as an MC authorisation field). MC authorisation fields
are added to the SIP URI to provide information on the MC entity\'s
authorisations. Each set of authorisations are described using a hexadecimal
string.
MC authorisation fields are encoded using the standard SIP URI Header
mechanism (RFC 3261). After a \'?\', the fields are encoded as ampersand
separated hname = hvalue pairs. Each authorisation hvalue is a bit field
denoting the entity\'s permissions. The bit fields are defined in Clause
7.2.7.3.4. The bit field is encoded in hex within the SIP URI.
Table 7.2.7.3.2-1 contains the defined SIP URI header names (hname) for the
authorisation fields.

##### 7.2.7.3.3 Adding authorisation to an EAR
An EAR contains the following information elements (as defined in 7.2.6.3.2):
\- Time of request.
\- The SIP URI (e.g. MC Service ID) associated with the requester.
\- The KMS URI associated with the requester.
\- The SIP URI (e.g. MC Service ID) associated with the target.
\- The type of request (e.g. Ambient Listening)
\- A signature over the whole EAR element.
To add authorisation information to the EAR, the SIP URI associated with the
requester shall contain authorisation field(s), and the identity-based
signature will be created using this SIP URI, including authorisation
field(s).
NOTE: The only entity that could create the signature, and hence the whole
EAR, is an entity granted the means to sign using the SIP URI containing the
authorisation field(s). The KMS provides the means to sign using a particular
SIP URI. By doing so, the KMS has provide authorisation to create the EAR and
authorise the specific action.
##### 7.2.7.3.3 Gaining authorisation
Authorisation is originally requested and provided by the IdM. If
authorisation is granted, the IdM provides the authorisation information
within the scope of an access token. The scope values contained within the
access token are defined in Clause 7.2.7.3.4.
The access token is provided to the KMS as defined in TS 33.180 [21].
The KMS provisions the entity\'s keys the entity as defined in Annex D of TS
33.180 [21]. As part of the key provisioning process, the KMS may provision
the entity keys for multiple SIP URIs that are associated with the entity.
If supported, where the scope of an access token contains one of the values
defined in Clause 7.2.7.3.4, the KMS provides multiple SIP URIs including
authorisation fields in the SIP URI. Specifically, for each SIP URI associated
with the entity, the KMS provisions:
\- Key material for the SIP URI.
\- Key material for the SIP URI with the applicable authorisation fields
included.
The keyed entity may use either SIP URI when signing within the MC System.
##### 7.2.7.3.4 Bit fields for authorisation
###### 7.2.7.3.4.1 General
The tables contained in this clause define the bit fields used for
authorisation. In the tables, the byte ordering is left-most byte first. The
bit ordering is least-significant bit first.
The bit fields may be extended with further bytes in future specifications.
Any bytes within the authorisation fields of a MC Service ID that do not
correspond with a bit in a table below shall be ignored. The maximum length of
a bit field shall be 1024 bits (or 256 hex characters).

###### 7.2.7.3.5.1 PTT User (on and off-network)
If a user has the following MC Service ID (without authorisation):
mc.user\@example.org
If the user is authorised to use a mcptt client, on and off-network (but no

will contain the following values in the scope:
\"3gpp:mc:auth:role:client:ptt\"
\"3gpp:mc:auth:offnet:mcptt:use\"
\"3gpp:mc:auth:offnet:mcptt:group_call_announcement\"

### 7.4.1 Solution #3.1 : New bearer specific key for MBMS subchannel control
message protection
#### 7.4.1.1 Overview
This mechanism is based on the introduction of a new key: the MBMS SubChannel
Control Key (MSCCK). Upon the activation of an MBMS bearer, the MCPTT server
generates an MSCCK and distributes it to the MCPTT clients.
#### 7.4.1.2 Motivating security requirements
The solution addresses security requirement [MCSEC-3.5-1].
#### 7.4.1.3 Solution description
The MBMS SubChannel Control Key (MSCCK) is a new key that is used solely for
the protection of the MBMS subchannel control messages. The MSCCK is bearer-
specific. It is created by the MCPTT server upon the activation of an MBMS
bearer and is distributed to all the served MCPTT clients in the bearer
announcement message described in clause 10.10 of TS 23.179 [4].
##### 7.4.1.3.1 MSCCK distribution
Figure 7.4.1.3.1-1 illustrates how the new key is distributed in the procedure
for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment. In the scenario depicted by the figure,
the MCPTT server uses a unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the DL
at the start of the group communication session. When the MCPTT server decides
to use an MBMS bearer for the DL media transmission, the MCPTT server
establishes an MBMS bearer using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[18]. The MCPTT server provides MBMS service description information
associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE
starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL media and stops using the
unicast bearer for the DL media transmission.
Figure 7.4.1.3.1-1: Dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. An MCPTT group call is established.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The MCPTT server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[18]. The MCPTT server generates a new bearer specific MSCCK. The key has to
be fresh and is bearer specific.
4\. The MCPTT server provides service description information associated with
the MBMS bearer to the UE together with the newly generated MSCCK. The MCPTT
UE obtains the TMGI and the MSCCK from the announcement message. How the key
is transported in the message is described in the following clause.
5\. The MCPTT UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI,
while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
6\. The MCPTT UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated
with the TMGI.
7\. The MCPTT client notifies the MCPTT server that it is successfully
receiving the TMGI. MCPTT server stops sending media data over unicast way to
the MCPTT client.
8\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT
group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated
MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer
broadcasting the call. The message is protected with the MSCCK. The message is
sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
9\. MCPTT server sends the downlink media for the group call over the MBMS.
##### 7.4.1.3.2 MSCCK transport
The MSCCK is distributed encrypted specifically to a user and signed using an
identity representing the MCPTT Server. Prior to group key distribution, each
MCPTT UE within the group shall be provisioned by the MCPTT KMS with time-
limited key material associated with the MCPTT User as described in clause
7.2. The MCPTT Server shall also be provisioned by the MCPTT KMS with key
material for an identity which is authorized to manage MBMS bearers. The MSCCK
is encapsulated in a MIKEY payload in a similar manner to how private call
keys are except that it is signed using the identity of the MCPTT server (see
Figure 7.4.1.3.2-1).

Figure 7.4.1.3.2-1: Security information within an MBMS bearer announcement
message
#### 7.4.1.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution fulfils the security requirements it is claiming to address. The
solution incurs an increase in size for some of the signalling messages.
### 7.4.2 Solution #3.2 : MKFC based protection for MBMS subchannel control
messages
#### 7.4.2.1 Overview
The keys already specified in the MCPTT security solution are described in
clause 7.3.3 of TS 33.179 [3]. The solution is based on reusing one of the
group specific keys, namely the MKFC, for the protection of the MBMS
subchannel control messages. The other keys are either user-specific and hence
cannot be used for protection of broadcast data (PCK, CSK); or they have
completely a different purpose and are used on different communication
channels (GMK, SPK).
#### 7.4.2.2 Motivating security requirements
The solution addresses security requirement [MCSEC-3.5-1].
#### 7.4.2.3 Solution description
This mechanism is based on using the MKFC as the protection key for the
generation of the security material of SRTCP. This is because the currently
specified MBMS subchannel control messages are group specific. In fact, each
message includes one (and only one) MCPTT Group ID. Therefore, if a message
containing a particular group ID is protected by the MKFC of that group, then
only the members of the group would be able to decipher and check the
integrity of the message.
#### 7.4.2.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution fulfils the security requirements it is claiming to address.
On the upside, there is not much needed on the key management side since there
are already procedures for the generation and distribution of the MKFC to
group members. On the downside, using this key for another purpose goes
against the best practises and requires care in order to achieve cryptographic
separation. Furthermore, the mechanism is not future proof. For example, it
would not support new types of messages that are not group specific.
### 7.4.3 Solution #3.3 : New server specific key for MBMS subchannel control
message protection
#### 7.4.3.1 Overview
This mechanism is based on the introduction of two new keys, the Participating
Function Key (PFK) and the MBMS SubChannel Control Key (MSCCK). Upon the
activation of an MBMS bearer, the MCPTT server and the MCPTT clients generate
a bearer specific MSCCK from the PFK and use it for the protection of the
subchannel control message on that particular bearer.
#### 7.4.3.2 Motivating security requirements
The solution addresses security requirement [MCSEC-3.5-1].
#### 7.4.3.3 Solution description
##### 7.4.3.3.1 General
The Participating Function Key (PFK) is a new high-level key used for the
derivation of bearer specific MBMS SubChannel Control Keys (MSCCK). The name
of the PFK key is related to the participating MCPTT function, a function in
the MCPTT server from which the MBMS subchannel control messages originate.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 PFK distribution
Initially, the PFK could be provisioned to MCPTT clients alongside other key
material to support end to end security as described in clause 7.2.4 of TS
33.179 [3]. New procedures are still required for the revocation and
provisioning of new keys.
##### 7.4.3.3.3 MSCCK generation
Upon the activation of an MBMS bearer, the MCPTT server derives the MSCCK for
example using bearer specific information such as the TMGI. On the receiver
side, the MCPTT client derives the MSCCK using the same bearer specific
information provided in the bearer announcement message.
> Editor\'s note: It is ffs if other freshness parameters could be used for
> the MSCCK derivation.
Figure 7.4.3.3.3-1 illustrates how the new key is generated in the procedure
for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment. In the scenario depicted by the figure,
the MCPTT server uses a unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the DL
at the start of the group communication session.

3\. The MCPTT server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[18]. The MCPTT server derives from the PFK a new bearer specific MSCCK.
4\. The MCPTT server provides service description information associated with
the MBMS bearer to the UE. The MCPTT UE obtains the TMGI and derives the MSCCK
from the pre-provisioned PFK.
5\. The MCPTT UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI,
while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
6\. The MCPTT UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated
with the TMGI.
7\. The MCPTT client notifies the MCPTT server that it is successfully
receiving the TMGI. MCPTT server stops sending media data over unicast way to
the MCPTT client.
8\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT
group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated
MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer
broadcasting the call. The message is protected with the MSCCK. The message is
sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
9\. MCPTT server sends the downlink media for the group call over the MBMS.
#### 7.4.3.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution fulfils the security requirements it is claiming to address. The
solution requires that the MCPTT server generates and manages security keys, a
functionality that is currently only performed in the KMS and GMS.
One problem with this solution is the revocation of the PFK for example in
case one of the MCPTT clients is compromised. It is not clear how that could
be handled efficiently so that all the clients in possession of the
compromised keys are properly informed and provisioned with a new one. An
additional mechanism is required to make sure that the MCPTT clients regularly
check the status of the current PFK.
### 7.4.4 Solution #3.4 : Key management for Temporary Group Call -- regroup
call
#### 7.4.4.1 Overview
'Temporary Group call -- user regroup\' is a new feature in MCPTT, defined in
clause 10.6.2.8 in TS 23.379 [19]. A group is created using a list of users
sent to the MCPTT server, rather than created by a GMS. Consequently, the
existing security mechanisms defined in TS 33.179 [3] for group key management
are not applicable.
To meet the security requirements defined in this document, a new key
management solution is required for 'Temporary Group call -- user regroup\'.
This contribution defines a security solution which meets the security
requirements for distribution of group keys.
#### 7.4.4.2 Motivating security requirements
The security requirements are those related to distribution of group keys:
[MCSEC-2.2-1] Key material for a MCX Service Group shall be integrity and
confidentiality protected for a specific MCX User during distribution from the
MCX Service to MCX UEs.
[MCSEC-2.2-2] Key material for a MCX Service Group shall be authenticated as
coming from a valid, authorised source. The authorised source may be MCX
Administrator or may be another authorised entity (e.g. an authorised user or
dispatcher).
[MCSEC-2.2-3] It shall be possible for authorised entities to dynamically
create and distribute a new group security context at any time. This may be as
part of a group creation process, be due to a periodic update to maintain key
freshness, or due to compromise of group key material.
[MCSEC-2.2-4] The creation of a new group security context (e.g. via User-
Regroup operation) shall not change or compromise an existing group security
context.
[MCSEC-2.2-5] It shall be possible for an authorised, authenticated entity to
revoke and update a group security context from use.
#### 7.4.4.3 Solution description
##### 7.4.4.3.1 Introduction
The following procedures define a method for performing key distribution for a
'Temporary Group call -- user regroup\' group. From a security point-of-view,
the approach described is to perform a 'private call\' key distribution for
each user, but using the same key to create the security context for the
group.
The security procedures described below do not conform to those described in
TS 23.379 [19] clause 10.6.2.8.
##### 7.4.4.3.2 New Group Call Setup Procedures (including security)
Figure 7.4.4.3.2-1 below illustrates the group call setup procedure initiated
by an authorized user.
Figure 7.4.4.3.2-1: Group call setup and key management for temporary group
call -- user regroup
1\. MCPTT client 1 (of an authorized user) initiates the group call by sending
the group call request to the MCPTT server containing a single user id. The
MCPTT client generates a Temporary Group Master Key (TGMK) and encrypts the
TGMK to the receiving user. The encrypted TGMK is attached to the group call
request.
2\. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT client 1 can initiate the group
call.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the client to the group.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the group call request towards the MCPTT client.
The message contains the temporary group indicator. The message also contains
the encrypted TGMK.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client is notified about the incoming group call. The
users verify they are authorized to participate in the temporary group call.
The MCPTT client decrypts and extracts the TGMK.
6\. The receiving MCPTT client accept the group call request and send group
call response to the MCPTT server. This response may contain an
acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be based on
configuration.
For each additional MCPTT user who is a member of the group:
7\. The initiating MCPTT user sends a 'add group call user\' request to the
MCPTT Server indicating the additional MCPTT user id. The initiating client
encrypts the TGMK to the receiving user. The encrypted TGMK is attached to the
'add group call user\' request.
8\. Steps 4-6 are repeated by the MCPTT Server for the added MCPTT user.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the group call response to MCPTT client 1 through
the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.
NOTE: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 6a, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
10\. MCPTT clients establish media plane and floor control resources. The
MCPTT media plane is protected using the TGMK.
#### 7.4.4.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution meets the security requirements defined above by reusing the key
distribution mechanisms from private calls to support this type of group call.
The following are advantages of the solution:
\- Maintains the same security properties of other types of call.
\- Previously defined mechanisms may be reused to support this type of call.
\- The call may begin while users are being added to the group.
\- Scales to support a large group, although a delay to call setup is likely
while all group members are each joined to the group individually.
\- Could allow new users to be added after call setup.
The following are disadvantages of the solution:
\- Modifies SA6\'s call flow. Would require an LS to SA6 and modification of
TS 23.379 [19].
\- Introduces additional signalling (depending on number of users added to the
group).
### 7.4.5 Solution #3.5 : Concealment of group identifiers using group
specific pseudonyms
#### 7.4.5.1 Overview
It is proposed to use a group-specific pseudonym instead of the MCPTT Group ID
in the MBMS subchannel control messages. The pseudonym can be generated and
distributed by the GMS to the group members alongside the other group call
protection material such as the GMK. In another option, the group pseudonym
could be generated using the group call protection material such as the GMK
and the MCPTT Group ID.
#### 7.4.5.2 Motivating security requirements
The solution addresses security requirement [MCSEC-3.6-1].
#### 7.4.5.3 Solution description
Two alternatives are described for the generation and distribution of the
group pseudonyms.
##### 7.4.5.3.1 GMS provided pseudonyms - Explicit pseudonyms
For each group, the GMS generates a pseudonym and distribute it alongside the
GMK. As described in clause 7.3.1 of TS 33.179 [3], the GMS constructs a
MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE containing the necessary information. Figure 7.4.5.3.1-1
below shows the structure of the GMK transport message with an indication on
where the pseudonym could be included.
{width="6.040277777777778in" height="2.7583333333333333in"}
Figure 7.4.5.3.1-1: Payload structure for GMK distribution
The payload is then distributed to the MCPTT clients (members of the group) in
a group notification message as described in TS 33.179 [3] clause 7.3.2.
Figure 7.4.5.3.1-2 illustrates a scenario where the pseudonym is provided in
the payload.
{width="4.59375in" height="2.25625in"}
Figure 7.4.5.3.1-2: Group pseudonym provisioning along GMK
##### 7.4.5.3.2 Implicit pseudonyms
In this option, the group pseudonym is generated using a hash function from
group specific information such as the MCPTT group ID the GMK of the group. In
such case, the pseudonym does not need to be provided by the GMS since each
member is capable of producing it. Figure 7.4.5.3.2-1 illustrates the scenario
where the pseudonym is generated based on the GMK and the MCPTT group ID
provided in the payload of the group notification request message.

Figure 7.4.5.3.2-1: Generation of the group pseudonym based on information
provided in the GMK payload
#### 7.4.5.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution satisfies the motivating security requirement.
### 7.4.6 Solution #3.6 : Concealment of group identifiers using session
specific pseudonyms
#### 7.4.6.1 Overview
The solution is based on the introduction of a call session-specific pseudonym
to be used instead of the MCPTT Group ID in the MBMS subchannel control
messages. The pseudonym can be generated and distributed by the MCPTT server
during the call setup procedure.
#### 7.4.6.2 Motivating security requirements
The solution addresses security requirement [MCSEC-3.6-1].
#### 7.4.6.3 Solution description
The pseudonyms are call session specific. The pseudonym is generated and
distributed during the call setup procedures described in TS 23.179 clause
10.6.2.4.1.1 [2]. The generation of the pseudonyms could be left entirely to
the MCPTT server or could be defined based on information available during the
call setup.
One possible scenario could be the following. Upon the reception of a group
call request, the MCPTT server generates a pseudonym and distributes it to the
active group members and the initiating MCPTT client. Figure 7.4.6.3-1
highlights the required additional steps in the call setup procedures.
Figure 7.4.6.3-1: Generation and distribution of the MCPTT Group pseudonym on
the originating side
Another option would be to provide the pseudonym to Partner MCPTT servers as
well so that the pseudonym gets possibly distributed to the MCPTT clients of
the affiliated MCPTT users. In this option, the group call setup procedures
are modified as shown in Figure 7.4.6.3-2 and Figure 7.4.6.3-3
Figure 7.4.6.3-2: Generation and distribution of the MCPTT Group pseudonym on
the originating side
Figure 7.4.6.3-3: Distribution of the MCPTT Group pseudonym on the terminating
side
#### 7.4.6.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution satisfies the motivating security requirement. Compared to
solution #3.5, the current solution has better security properties since
pseudonyms could be randomly changed in each session. Even within the same
session, different pseudonyms could be used depending on how many
participating functions (PFs) are involved.
Within an MCPTT server, the PF is the logical function that serves the clients
and applies user specific handling on the calls. Each PF can also own a
specific MBMS bearer and send media and floor control messages via its own
bearer. In addition, each PF can be in a different MCPTT provider or an MCPTT
provider can own several PFs (e.g. when the MCPTT provider serves a large
number of users).
### 7.4.7 Solution #3.7 : Key management for First-to-answer call
#### 7.4.7.1 Overview
'First-to-answer\' call is a new feature in MCPTT, defined in clause 10.15 in
TS 23.379 [1]. A call is requested from many users, but only initiated with
the first of those users to answer. As a consequence, the existing key
distribution procedures for private call will not work in this context.
To meet the security requirements defined in this document, a new key
management solution is required for \'first-to-answer\' calls. This
contribution defines a security solution which meets the security requirements
for distribution of private call keys in this context.
#### 7.4.7.2 Motivating security requirements
Related stage 1 MCPTT security requirements are as follows:
[R-5.12-001] The MCX Service shall provide a means to support the
confidentiality and integrity of all user traffic and signalling at the
application layer.
[R-5.12-008] Subject to regulatory constraints, the MCX Service shall provide
a means to support confidentiality, message integrity, and source
authentication for some information exchanges (e.g., MCX Service User Profile
management, kill commands) that have the potential to disrupt the operation of
the target MCX UE.
[R-5.12-009] The MCX Service shall provide a means to support end-to-end
security for all media traffic transmitted between MCX UEs.
[R-5.12-010] End-to-end security shall be supported both within and without
network coverage and regardless of whether the traffic is transmitted directly
or via the network infrastructure.
Derived stage 2 MCPTT security requirements are as follows:
[MCSEC-4.1-1] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to support
end-to-end confidentiality and integrity protection for messaging transmitted
between MCX UEs in both media and signalling streams.
[MCSEC-4.1-2] The Mission Critical Service shall provide a means to
authenticate messages in both media and signalling streams.
Additional MCPTT security requirements related to the distribution of private
calls:
[MCSEC-3.4-1] It shall be possible to establish a unique Private Call security
context between any pair of authorised MCX Users within the Mission Critical
System. The security context shall not be available to other MCX Users,
except, where necessary, authorised monitoring functions (e.g. LI, Discreet
Listening). If the security context is made available to monitoring functions,
appropriate controls and logging shall exist. This requirement applies when
MCX UEs are operating both on-network and off-network.
[MCSEC-3.4-2] The Private Call security context shall provide a means to
provide confidentiality and integrity protection of user traffic, and
authenticate the MCX Users involved in the Private Call.
#### 7.4.7.3 Solution description
##### 7.4.7.3.1 Introduction
The following procedures define a method for performing key distribution for a
'first-to-answer\' call. From a security point-of-view, the approach described
is to perform a 'private call\' key distribution from the \'answering\' client
to the \'initiating client of the call.
In the First to Answer feature, there are two signalling messages that require
confidentiality and integrity protection. They are the First to Answer Request
and the First to Answer Response.
##### 7.4.7.3.2 First to Answer Request
The First to Answer Request is sent by an initiating UE to the MCPTT server
containing a list of target MCPTT IDs. When required by the MCPTT service
operator, confidentiality and Integrity of the First to Answer Request message
is performed.
When confidentiality and integrity of the First to Answer Request message is
applied, it is per normal signalling protection methods as per clause 6 and
clause 9 of 33.179 [3]. Furthermore, the list of target user identities (MCPTT
IDs) in the First to Answer Request is considered sensitive application
information and therefore when required by the MCPTT service provider, is
confidentiality protected with the CSK or SPK as per clause 9.3 of 33.179 [3].
##### 7.4.7.3.3 First to Answer Response
The First to Answer Response is sent by a target UE in response to a First to
Answer Request. The First to Answer Response contains both a PCK for the
private call and a set of MCPTT IDs corresponding to the initiating and target
UEs. When required by the MCPTT service operator, confidentiality and
Integrity of the First to Answer Response message is performed.
When confidentiality and integrity of the First to Answer Request message is
applied, it is per normal signalling protection methods as per clause 6 and
clause 9 of 33.179 [3]. The list of target user identities (MCPTT IDs) in the
First to Answer Request is considered sensitive application information and
when required by the service provider, is confidentiality protected with the
CSK or SPK as per clause 9.3 of 33.179 [3].
##### 7.4.7.3.4 First-to-answer Call Setup Procedures (including security)
Figure 7.4.7.3.4-1 below illustrates the group call setup procedure initiated
by an authorized user.
Figure 7.4.7.3.4-1: First-to-answer call setup and key management
1 to 6. First-to-answer call signalling occurs as defined in TS 23.379 [1].
7\. MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 accepts the call which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server.
MCPTT client 2 generates a Private Call Key, PCK, and encapsulates the PCK
(PCK_1) to the user associated with the initiating client, MCPTT client 1. The
PCK is encapsulated using the same mechanism as for a private call
communication. The encapsulated PCK is included with the SDP content of the
response.
8\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to MCPTT
client 1 indicating that MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 has accepted the
call, including the accepted media parameters and the encapsulated PCK. MCPTT
client 1 extracts the PCK from the message.
9\. The media plane for communication is established. The media is protected
using the shared PCK.
10\. **MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 has also accepted the call which causes
MCPTT client 3 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT
server. MCPTT client 3 will also include an encapsulated PCK (PCK_2) in the
response.**
**11\. Since the MCPTT first-to-answer call response from MCPTT client 2 is
already accepted, the MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel
request to MCPTT client 3. The encapsulated PCK provided by MCPTT client 3
(PCK_2) is discarded.**
**12-16.** First-to-answer call signalling occurs as defined in TS 23.379 [1].
#### 7.4.7.4 Evaluation against requirements
The solution meets the security requirements defined above by reusing the key
distribution mechanisms from private calls to support this type of private
call. The security properties from private calls are maintained in this case.
## 7.5 Security solutions for data (MCData)
### 7.5.1 Solution #4.1 : SDS key distribution through signalling channel
#### 7.5.1.1 Overview
MCPTT provided a set of key distribution mechanisms through the SIP signalling
channel. These included distribution of a PCK as part of call setup, and
distribution of a GMK as part of group creation.
This solution proposes that keys for SDS are distributed using the same
mechanisms.
#### 7.5.1.2 Motivating security requirements
This solution is intended to provide part of the mechanism that provides end-
to-end confidentiality, integrity and authentication of SDS messaging,
specifically requirements [MCSEC-4.1-1] and [MCSEC-4.2-2].
#### 7.5.1.3 Solution description
##### 7.5.1.3.1 General
The solution described in the following procedures show how the key
distribution mechanism for MCPTT may be applied directly to the SDS service
##### 7.5.1.3.2 Procedures for one-to-one key distribution for SDS
The procedures in Figure 7.5.1.3.2-1 apply to the flows described in Clause
10.1 of TS 23.282 [10]. The messages used in each flow have different names,
but the request/response flow is equivalent to that shown in the figure.
Figure 7.5.1.3.2-1: One-to-one short data service session
In Figure 7.5.1.3.2-1, Steps 2 and 4 result in a SDS request being transported
from the initiating client to the receiving client. This message contains an
encapsulated \'PCK\'. This procedure is equivalent to that described in clause
7.4 of TS 33.179 [3], where the PCK is transported within the \'call setup
request\'.
##### 7.5.1.3.3 Procedures for group key distribution for SDS
Within Clause 7.3 of TS 33.179 [3], a mechanism for distributing a GMK from a
group management server to MCX clients using the signalling channel is
provided. This mechanism is reused without modification to distribute a GMK
for the purpose of SDS.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs whether a SDS \'GMK\' key may also be used for MCPTT
and/or MCVideo.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs how keys (PCK, GMK) should be named given the
proposed expansion in their scope.
##### 7.5.1.3.4 Protection of SDS messaging
Once a SDS key has been shared between MCX clients, this key may be used to
provide confidentiality and integrity protection of SDS message(s) between MCX
clients.
Editor\'s Note: The protection mechanism for SDS messages is ffs.
#### 7.5.1.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution provides a key management mechanism which can meet the
requirements in clause 7.5.1.2. The solution has the following benefits:
\- Reuse of existing security flows from MCPTT.
\- Efficient security mechanism where multiple messages are sent within SDS
session.
However, there are the following disadvantages:
\- Complexity: Signalling mechanisms require interaction within both the
signalling layer and media layer.
\- Diversity: Different (but related) flows will need to be defined for every
type of SDS communication.
### 7.5.2 Solution #4.2 : SDS key distribution alongside messages
#### 7.5.2.1 Overview
SDS messages are distributed via both signalling and media channels. In
addition, file transfer may be viewed as another method for distributing
\'messages\' (from a security point-of-view). Consequently, an approach for
protecting a subset of data within MCData is to perform key distribution
alongside the encrypted data. This removes any security dependence on the
signalling path.
#### 7.5.2.2 Motivating security requirements
This solution is intended to provide part of the mechanism that provides end-
to-end confidentiality, integrity and authentication of SDS messaging,
specifically requirements [MCSEC-4.1-1] and [MCSEC-4.1-2].
Procedures in this section may also be applicable to other forms of data
within MCData, such as file distribution.
#### 7.5.2.3 Solution description
##### 7.5.2.3.1 General
The solution described in the following procedures show how key distribution
may be performed by concatenating the the key distribution packets to the
encrypted data itself. This approach was not possible for MCPTT as there was
not space in the media path to perform key distribution, and such an approach
would not have met the late-entry requirement. Neither of these concerns are
an issue for SDS messaging.
##### 7.5.2.3.2 Procedures for protection of data
The approach is that where data is to be protected, key distribution is
performed as part of the data protection procedure. Figure 7.5.2.3.2-1 shows
this approach to key distribution.
Figure 7.5.2.3.2-1: Key distribution alongside the data
Unsecured data content is protected using a data encryption mechanism and a
data protection key. The data protection key is also encapsulated to the
terminating users. The encapsulated key, encrypted data content and a
signature are concatenated to form the secured data message. Importantly, the
secured data message contains within itself all the information required by
the terminating client to decrypt the data and recover the unsecured data
content.
Examples of security protocols where this kind of solution has been used in
the past include S/MIME and XMLSec.
Editor\'s Note: The data encryption mechanism for SDS messages is ffs.
Editor\'s Note: The key encapsulation mechanism for one-to-one and group
communications is ffs.
Editor\'s Note: The encrypted data format is ffs.
#### 7.5.2.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution provides a key management mechanism which can meet the
requirements in clause 7.5.2.2. The solution has the following benefits:
\- Simplicity: One mechanism can be used to protect a wide variety of traffic.
\- Self-dependent: No requirement on out-of-band signalling.
However, there are the following disadvantages:
\- Overhead: Where multiple messages are sent within a single session, there
is a key distribution overhead as keys are attached to every message.
\- New solution: Does not reuse mechanisms from TS 33.179 [3] (as the
situation differs slightly).
\- Possible network management issues: Should the network need to interact
with a messaging flow (e.g. to redirect), the MC Service could be limited in
its ability to manage the flow without complex message introspection. Clients
would likely need to understand the correct behaviour rather than the network.
Editor\'s Note: How LI will be supported is ffs.
### 7.5.3 Solution #4.3 : MCData SDS protection
#### 7.5.3.1 Overview
The MCData service consists of SDS, file download, IP connectivity and data
streaming. This solution addresses the MCData SDS data service only. MCData
SDS allows transmission of short data messages over both, signalling control
plane and media control plane.
The solution addresses all the procedures defined in TS 23.282 [10]:
\- One-to-one standalone SDS using signalling control plane on-network
\- One-to-one standalone SDS using signalling control plane off-network
\- One-to-one standalone SDS using media plane on-network
\- One-to-one SDS session on-network
\- Group standalone SDS using signalling control plane on-network
\- Group standalone SDS using signalling control plane off-network
\- Group standalone SDS using media plane on-network
\- Group SDS session on-network
As the MCData server will need to have sight of the content of MC Service and
MCData signalling parameters within the SDS, these elements are protected
using the signalling protection mechanisms already defined in clause 6 and
clause 9 of 33.179 [3].
The MCData user payload is end-to-end confidentiality and integrity protected
according to the parameters contained in an end to end security context
provided alongside the SDS. This end-to-end security context can be either a
new key or a key identifier indicating which key has been used to protect the
SDS.
#### 7.5.3.2 Motivating security requirements
Related stage 1 MCData security requirements are as follows:
> [R-5.12-001] The MCX Service shall provide a means to support the

Additional MCData security requirements may be found in clause 5.3.1.3.
#### 7.5.3.3 Solution description
##### 7.5.3.3.1 Key management for one-to-one SDS protection
A private symmetric key PDK (Private Data Key) is used for end to end
protection of one-to-one SDS messages.
The PDK and PDK-ID is distributed within the SDS message and is encapsulated
in a MIKEY-SAKKE message encrypted to the receiving user identity. It is
signed using the source identity\'s private signing key and the signature is
verified at the destination with the source identity.
Once the PDK is established between the source and destination, SDS exchanges
between this same source and destination may continue to use the same PDK for
subsequent MCData communications by simply providing the PDK-ID in every SDS
message. Alternatively, a new PDK may be generated and distributed to the
destination in every SDS message.
Generation and encapsulation of the PDK is as defined in clause 7.4 of 33.179
[3], similar to the PCK.
##### 7.5.3.3.2 Key management for group SDS protection
A group symmetric key GDK (Group Data Key) associated with the group is used
for end to end protection of group SDS messages.
GDK is distributed in advance by the GMS thanks to the group key distribution
as described in clause 5.2.6 of 33.179 [3].
The identifier of the group key (GDK-ID) is provided in every SDS message sent
to the group.
##### 7.5.3.3.2 SDS protection (group and one-to-one SDS)
The same SDS protection mechanism applies to all the SDS procedures defined in
TS 23.282 [10] (session or standalone mode, group or one-to-one SDS, on-
network or off-network)
The following information is protected in a SDS message:
\- A payload containing **MC Service signalling parameters** : generic mission
critical services signalling elements e.g. MCData Group ID, MCData ID. This
payload is confidentiality protected between the MCData Client and the MCData
server with signalling plane security mechanisms defined in in clause 6 and
clause 9 of 33.179 [3].
\- A payload containing **MCData signalling parameters** : information
elements necessary for identification and management of the MCData SDS
messages e.g. conversation identifiers, session identifiers, transaction
identifiers, disposition requests, date and time, etc... This payload is
confidentiality protected between the MCData Client and the MCData server with
signalling plane security mechanisms (i.e. CSK and SPK) as defined in clause 6
and clause 9 of 33.179 [3].
NOTE: As in TS 33.179 [3], the use of signalling protection is optional and is
used based on the security of the transport layer provided and the trust in
the SIP Core and HTTP Proxy.
\- A payload containing the **End to end security parameters** (i.e.
information specifying the cryptographic elements used to protect the MCData
payload). This payload can be used to either distribute a new PDK or to
provide the key id of the PDK or GCK used for SDS protection. It can contain
either:
\- a MIKEY-SAKKE message containing a PDK which defines a new individual
security context. This is used only in the one-to-one SDS case. This message
is end to end confidentiality and integrity protected using the methods
defined in clause 7.4 of 33.179 [3], or
\- The necessary security parameters used for MCData payload protection when
the protection key (PDK or GDK) has been previously provided. For example, if
MCData is encrypted with XmlEnc, those parameters are the encryption method
and the key identifier of the key used to protect the MCData payload (GDK-ID
for group SDS or PDK-ID for one-to-one SDS). This payload is confidentiality
protected between the MCData Client and the MCData server with signalling
plane security mechanisms (i.e. CSK and SPK) as defined in clause 6 and clause
9 of 33.179 [3].
\- The **MCData payload:** the actual user SDS payload for MCData user or
application consumption. This payload is end to end confidentiality and
integrity protected with the AES-128-GCM algorithm, using either the GDK for
group SDS or the PDK for one-to-one SDS. For example, using XmlEnc as defined
in clause 9.3.4 of 33.179 [3].
Editor\'s note: it is assumed that the protection mechanism for SDS is XmlEnc
but it is subject to modification according to CT1 decision.
The whole content of the SDS message (security context, MC Service signalling
parameters, MC Data signalling parameters and MCData payload) is integrity
protected between the MCData Client and the MCData server with the signalling
plane security mechanisms defined in clause 6 and clause 9 of 33.179 [3].
The scheme shown in Figure 7.5.3.3.2-1 summarizes the SDS protection:
Figure 7.5.3.3.2-1: Protection of SDS message
> NOTE: With an end-to-end encrypted message, MCData payload is not readable
> at the MCData servers. MCData servers may store the encrypted MCData
> payload, which can be obtained and decrypted by the authorized entities
> using the appropriate keys.
#### 7.5.3.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution meets the Stage 1 and Stage 2 security requirements identified
in clause 7.5.3.2 for the confidentiality and integrity protection of the
MCData SDS service in both the signalling and media plane.
### 7.5.4 Solution #4.4 : MCData SDS/FD signalling and payload protection
#### 7.5.4.1 Overview
The MCData service consists of SDS, file download, IP connectivity and data
streaming. This solution addresses the encryption of MCData payloads by
describing a method for protecting TLV messages. These payloads are used
within messages in the MCData SDS data service and file distribution service
to for MCData signalling and data. The solution applies whether the payload is
transferred in the signalling or media plane.
The following TLV payloads have been defined in TS 24.282 [7]:
\- SDS Signalling Payload
\- FD Signalling Payload
\- Data Payload
\- SDS notification message
\- FD notification message
The choice of key, and the key distribution solution is defined elsewhere.
The solution would be used in all the SDS and file distribution procedures
defined in TS 23.282 [10].
#### 7.5.4.2 Motivating security requirements
Related stage 1 MCData security requirements are as follows:
> [R-5.12-001] The MCX Service shall provide a means to support the

Additional MCData security requirements may be found in clause 5.3.1.3.
#### 7.5.4.3 Solution description
##### 7.5.4.3.1 Defined protected MCData payloads
The following protected (encrypted and integrity protected) payloads are
defined for MCData SDS and file distribution:
\- Protected SDS Signalling Payload
\- Protected FD Signalling Payload
\- Protected Data Payload
\- Protected SDS notification message
\- Protected FD notification message
The following authenticated payloads are defined for MCData SDS and file
distribution:
\- Authenticated Data Payload
The following authenticated and protected (encrypted and integrity protected)
payloads are defined for MCData SDS and file distribution:
\- Authenticated and Protected Data Payload
In this case both the procedures for protecting a payload and authenticating a
payload are applied
##### 7.5.4.3.2 Requirements for protected payloads Payload
The perquisites for encryption and integrity protection of a protected payload
is that the MC client(s) or MC server(s) have a shared MCData Payload
Protection Key (DPPK). This shall be the CSK, SPK, MuSiK, GMK or PCK depending
on the payload that will be protected. The DPPK will also have a shared key
identifier, the DPPK-ID. This shall be the CSK-ID, MuSiK-ID, SPK-ID, GMK-ID or
PCK-ID respectively, based upon the type of key used.
##### 7.5.4.3.3 Requirements for authenticated payloads
The perquisites for authentication of an authenticated payload is that the MC
client will have been keyed by a KMS as defined in clause 5.3 of TS 33.180
[21].
##### 7.5.4.3.4 Key derivation for protected payloads
Before protecting an MCData payload, the DPPK is hashed through a KDF (similar
to the process used for XML protection for application signalling), to produce
a MCData Payload Cipher Key (DPCK)
The following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the KDF that is
specified in annex B of 3GPP TS 33.220 [27]. The key used by the KDF shall be
the DPPK:
\- FC = 0xaa, (for MCData Payload Protection),
\- P0 = DPPK-ID.
\- L0 = length of above, expressed in number of bytes (i.e. 0x00 0x17).
The DPPK-ID follow the encoding also specified in annex B of 3GPP TS 33.220
[17].
Where the DPPK is 128-bits, the DPCK shall be 128-bits and hence the 128 least
significant bits of the 256 bits of the KDF output shall be used as the
signalling protection key. Where the DPPK is 256-bits, the output DPCK shall
be 256-bits and hence the entire output of the KDF shall be used.
##### 7.5.4.3.5 Format of protected payloads
All protected payloads shall have the format defined in table 7.5.4.3.5-1:
Table 7.5.4.3.5-1: MCData Protected Payload message content
* * *
Information Element Type/Reference Presence Format Length Message Type Message
type M V 1 Date and Time Date and Time of creation of protected payload
message. M V 5 Payload ID The identifier for the payload. M V 4 Payload
sequence number The sequence number of the protected payload. M V 1 Algorithm
See 7.5.4.3.6 M V 1 IV Initialisation vector (or nonce) for message M V 16
DPPK-ID Key identifier M V 4 Payload Protected Payload (Ciphertext) M TLV-E x
* * *
Where 'Payload\' will be the encrypted and integrity-protected payload encoded
in a binary format.
NOTE 1: Date and Time is included as plaintext to allow the MCData server to
order end-to-end protected messages and assess whether end-to-end protected
messages may have expired.
NOTE 2: Payload ID and Payload sequence number allow protected payloads to be
split over multiple SIP messages.
##### 7.5.4.3.6 Encryption of protected payloads
Protection of payloads shall support the following algorithms (cipher suites):
Table 7.5.4.3.6-1: DP_AES_128_GCM algorithm parameters
* * *
Parameter Value/Reference Algorithm ID DP_AES_128_GCM Cipher AEAD_AES_128_GCM

#### 7.5.4.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution meets the Stage 1 and Stage 2 security requirements identified
in Clause 7.5.4.2 for the confidentiality, integrity and authentication
protection of the MCData SDS and FD service in both the signalling and media
plane.
### 7.5.5 Solution #4.5 : MCData Key management
#### 7.5.5.1 Overview
Solution #4.4 on MCData payload security requires a MCData Payload Protection
Key (DPPK) to be shared per communication channel between entities using
payload protection.
Key management for MCData follows the same model as MCVideo and MCPTT. Where a
key is used for protection of MCData or MCVideo data, the same type of key
shall be used in the same circumstance for MCData.
#### 7.5.5.2 Motivating security requirements
Security requirements are as defined in Solution #4.4.
#### 7.5.5.3 Solution description
Solution #4.5 on MCData payload security requires a MCData Payload Protection
Key (DPPK) to be shared per communication channel between entities using
payload protection.
Key management for MCData follows the same model as MCVideo and MCPTT. Where a
key is used for protection of MCData or MCVideo data, the same type of key
shall be used in the same circumstance for MCData.
MCData signalling payloads are protected as follows:
\- Unicast MCData signalling payloads between client and server are protected
using the CSK (e.g. the DPPK is the CSK).
\- Multicast MCData signalling payloads from server to client are protected
using a MuSiK (e.g. the DPPK is a MuSiK).
\- MCData signalling payloads between servers are protected using the SPK
(e.g. the DPPK is the SPK).
\- MCData signalling payloads between two offline clients are protected using
a PCK (e.g. the DPPK is the PCK).
\- MCData signalling payloads between a group of offline clients are protected
using a GMK (e.g. the DPPK is the GMK).
MCData data payloads are protected as follows:
\- MCData data payloads end-to-end protected between two online clients are
protected using a PCK (e.g. the DPPK is the PCK).
\- MCData data payloads end-to-end protected between two offline clients are
protected using a PCK (e.g. the DPPK is the PCK).
\- MCData data payloads end-to-end protected between a group of online clients
are protected using a GMK distributed by a GMS (e.g. the DPPK is the GMK).
\- MCData data payloads end-to-end protected between a group of offline
clients are protected using a GMK distributed by a GMS (e.g. the DPPK is the
GMK).
NOTE: The DPPK is not a new type of key, it describes how the MC system\'s
existing key types are used to protect MCData. Consequently, there will be
multiple DPPKs in the MC System depending on the communication channel.
Furthermore, while a PCK and a GMK may both be used as a DPPK to protect
MCData in different channels, the PCK and the GMK should never be the same
key.
#### 7.5.5.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution meets the Stage 1 and Stage 2 security requirements identified
in clause 7.5.5.2 for the confidentiality, integrity and authentication
protection of the MCData SDS and FD service in both the signaling and media
plane. Where possible, already agreed mechanisms are re-used.
### 7.5.6 Solution #4.6 : MCData key distribution
#### 7.5.6.1 Overview
Solution #4.4 on MCData payload security requires a MCData Payload Protection
Key (DPPK) to be shared between entities using payload protection. Solution
#4.5 requires that the DPPK shall be a CSK, MuSiK, SPK, PCK or GMK.
Key distribution for MCData follows the same model as MCVideo and MCPTT. Key
distribution methodologies for CSK, MuSiK, SPK and GMK are already defined and
are service independent. The key distribution methodology for the PCK to
support MCData reflects that used for MCPTT and MCVideo.
#### 7.5.6.2 Motivating security requirements
Security requirements are as defined in Solution #4.4.
#### 7.5.6.3 Solution description
##### 7.5.6.3.1 General
Solution #4.4 on MCData payload security requires a MCData Payload Protection
Key (DPPK) to be shared between entities using payload protection. Solution
#4.5 requires that the DPPK shall be a CSK, MuSiK, SPK, PCK or GMK.
Key distribution for MCData follows the same model as MCVideo and MCPTT. Key
distribution methodologies for CSK, MuSiK, SPK and GMK are already defined and
are service independent. The key distribution methodology for the PCK to
support MCData reflects that used for MCPTT and MCVideo.
##### 7.5.6.3.2 Distribution of CSK, MuSiK, SPK and GMK
No MCData specific procedures are used for the distribution of the CSK, MuSiK,
SPK and GMK. The procedures defined in TS 33.180 [21] are sufficient to
support the MCData service.
##### 7.5.6.3.3 Distribution of PCK to support one-to-one MCData service
The PCK and PCK-ID is distributed using service-specific signalling. For all
MCData services, SIP signalling is used to establish or send the MCData
communication. The PCK and PCK-ID is distributed within a MIKEY payload
contained within the SDP offer sent from the initiator to the receiver in the
same way as for MCPTT and MCVideo.
This key distribution mechanism applies to the following messages defined in
TS 23.282 [10]:
\- MCData standalone data request
\- MCData session data request
\- MCData FD request
#### 7.5.6.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution meets the Stage 1 and Stage 2 security requirements identified
in Clause 7.5.6.2 for the confidentiality, integrity and authentication
protection of the MCData SDS and FD service in both the signaling and media
plane. Where possible, already agreed mechanisms are re-used.
## 7.6 Security solutions for video (MCVideo)
### 7.6.1 Solution #5.1: Mission critical video (MCVideo)
#### 7.6.1.1 General
This solution addresses security for the MCVideo service including key
management, protected MCVideo private communications, and protected MCVideo
group communications. Requirements for MCVideo can be found in TS 22.280 [5]
and TS 22.281 [6].
#### 7.6.1.2 MCVideo key management functional model
The intent of the common key management functional model is to create a common
architecture for MCX services consistent with the existing PTT key management
functional model already defined in TS 33.179 [3]. As the intent is to create
a common key management functional model, it is proposed that the MCVideo key
management functional model aligns with the MCPTT key management functional
model defined in Clauses 7.2 through 7.2.2 of TS 33.179 [3].
#### 7.6.1.3 MCVideo private and group key management
The intent of the common key management architecture for MCX services is that
individual identity based encryption key material assigned to a user will be
used consistently across all MC services to protect the delivery of private
and group communication keys. MCVideo key management for private and group
communications should be architecturally consistent with the existing PTT key
management architecture as already defined in TS 33.179 [3]. Key management
for private keys consists of the initiator randomly generating a session key.
This session key is encrypted and signed using IBE. The protected session key
is then shared with the target of the private communication.
Key management for group keys consists of the GMS generating a group master
key (GMK), encrypting and signing the GMK using IBE, and delivering the GMK to
the members of the group.
With the above in mind, it is proposed that key management for MCVideo align
with the MCPTT key management architecture using IBE as the protection
mechanism for delivering MCVideo private and group communication keys.
#### 7.6.1.4 Protected MCVideo private communications
In MCPTT for a protected private call, a symmetric key is created and passed
to the target device using IBE during call setup. The symmetric key is
subsequently used for SRTP protection of the media throughout the session. The
intent is to reuse this private call structure as part of the common
architecture for MCX protected private communications. MCVideo should follow
the common architecture for protecting private video communications and
therefore it is proposed that MCVideo protected private communications align
with MCPTT protected private communications by using a symmetric key created
and passed to the target device using IBE during video private communications
setup.
#### 7.6.1.5 Protected MCVideo group communications
In MCPTT for a protected group call, a symmetric master key (GMK) is created
and passed by the group home GMS to each group member using IBE. The traffic
key derived from the GMK is subsequently used for SRTP protection of the media
throughout a unicast group session and for inbound SRTP protection of the
media during multicast group communications. The intent is to reuse this group
call structure as part of the common architecture for protected group
communications. MCVideo should follow this architecture for protecting group
video communications and therefore it is proposed that MCVideo protected group
communications align with MCPTT protected group communications by using a
master symmetric key created and distributed by the group home GMS to derived
the group traffic key as defined in clause 7.3 of TS 33.179 [3].
#### 7.6.1.6 Application plane protection for MCVideo
Application plane protection for MCPTT requires private and group application
parameters to be carried in a payload separated from the signalling plane and
protected using a symmetric key. The Client-Server Key (CSK) is used for this
purpose. The intent is to reuse the signalling plane protection schema as the
common architecture for application plane protection. MCVideo should follow
this schema for protecting the application plane, and therefore it is proposed
that MCVideo application plane protection align with MCPTT application plane
protection by using the CSK as defined in Clauses 9.1 and 9.3 of 33.179 [3].
#### 7.6.1.7 Floor control protection for MCVideo
Floor control protection for MCPTT requires the creation of a Key for Floor
Control (KFC) derived from the CSK and in the case of multicast, the
distribution of a Multicast Key for Floor Control (MKFC) by the group home
GMS. The intent is to reuse the MCPTT floor control protection schemas as the
common architecture for floor control protection. MCVideo should follow these
schemas for protecting unicast and multicast floor control and therefore it is
proposed that MCVideo floor control protection align with MCPTT floor control
protection by using a KFC and MKFC as defined in Clause 9.4 of TS 33.179 [3].
## 7.7 Security solutions for migration and interconnect (MCSMI)
### 7.7.1 Solution #6.1: Inter-Domain Identity Management
#### 7.7.1.1 General
When a MCX User requires service authorisation and the service is in a domain
different from the primary domain of the user, coordination between the
identity management services of the two MCX domains is required. For example,
a MCX User from one domain may be a member of a group, where the group is home
to a different domain.
#### 7.7.2.2 Inter-domain identity management functional model
The inter-domain identity management functional model is shown in Figure
7.7.2.2-1.
Figure 7.7.2.2-1: Functional Model for Inter-Domain MC Identity Management
In Figure 7.7.2.2-1, the IdMS located in the primary domain (MCX Domain A) is
the home identity management server for the user. The partner IdMS is located
in a second domain (MCX Domain B) and is home to the group where the primary
user requires access.
The CSC-1 reference point between the UE IdM client and the partner IdM server
endpoints shall be a direct connection and shall be protected with HTTPS
(TLS).
As defined in Clause 5.6, an access token is required for user service
authorisation. The same principle applies for inter-domain user service
authorisation in that the user must present an access token issued from the
partner IdMS in MCX Domain B for authorisation to services in MCX Domain B.
In order for the UE to obtain this local access token, a token exchange
procedure with the primary IdM service shall be used to obtain a credential
that identifies the user to the partner IdM service. This credential shall be
an ID token specific to the partner IdM service, signed by the primary IdM
service per IETF RFC 7515 [15]. Upon validation, the partner IdM service shall
provide an access token to the UE specifically scoped for that user. This
access token shall provide the user with authorisation to the service(s) in
the partner domain.
The token exchange profile for accessing the partner MCX identity management
services shall consist of RFC 7521 [13] and RFC 7523 [14] and shall be
implemented as defined in Annex A.
NOTE: A specific and independent ID token is required for each partner
identity management domain.
#### 7.7.2.3 Inter-domain identity management for interconnect operation
Figure 7.7.2.3-1 shows the message sequence for inter-domain authentication
and authorisation for interconnect operation.

Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how the TLS tunnel between the visiting user and the
partner systems IdM server is authenticated.

>
> Step 9: For each group membership, the GM client in the UE follows the
> \"Retrieve group configurations at the group management client\" flow as
> shown in clause 10.1.2 of TS 23.179 [2], presenting an access token in the

NOTE: Steps 5--9 are repeated for each partner domain.
## 7.8 Security solutions for interworking between LTE and non-LTE systems
(MCCI)
### 7.8.1 Solution #7.1: MC Security Gateway (SeGy) acts as a single MC client
#### 7.8.1.1 Overview
The MC Security Gateway (SeGy) is a function which terminates MC security to
allow for interworking with external systems that do not support mission
critical security mechanisms. This includes external MC Domains that do not
have MC security enabled, and non-3GPP systems, such as LMR.
NOTE: This solution is applicable to migration, interconnection and
interworking with non-3GPP systems.
In the case of interworking with Land Mobile Radio, the SeGy may be integrated
with the Interworking Function (IWF) as defined in TS 23.283 [25].
The solution defines that a SeGy acts as MC client(s) within the MC Domain. In
this instance, the SeGy is part of the same security domain as the rest of the
MC system and is dependent on the MC Domain to operate. The single SeGy
identity (i.e. MC client) is used to represent all users in the external
system.
#### 7.8.1.2 Motivating security requirements
The following security requirements are applicable to the SeGy:
[MCSEC-7.1-2] The MC System shall enable the decryption of signalling and
traffic routed to the non-3GPP system. This shall not compromise signalling or
traffic that is not routed to the non-3GPP system.
[MCSEC-7.1-3] The MC System shall be able to apply MC security mechanisms to
signalling/media received from the non-3GPP system to ensure that equivalent
protections are applied to this data as for native MC system data.
#### 7.8.1.3 Solution description
The SeGy acts as MC Client(s) within the MC domain, fulfilling all the
security functions of the MC Client. The SeGy represents the identity of users
in the external system within the MC Domain.
1\. The SeGy authenticates to and requests an access token from the IdM as an
MC client.
2\. The SeGy requests user-specific key material from the KMS as an MC client.
3\. The SeGy communicates with the GMS to join groups as an MC client.
4\. The SeGy connects with MCX Server(s), using CSK as an MC client. The SeGy
acts as an MC client to the MCX Server. This includes:
a. The SeGy may initiate protected private or group calls on behalf of users
in the external system.
b. The SeGy may receive protected private or group calls on behalf of users in
the external system.
#### 7.8.1.4 Evaluation against requirements
In this case the SeGy represents all external users with a single identity.
This approach may be most applicable where the SeGy is not transparent. To
clarify, MC clients secure communications to the SeGy to reach the external
user. Further signalling would be required after establishing this security
connection to reach a specific external user (e.g. providing the identity of
the external user to an IWF or equivalent). Resolving identities between LTE
and non-3GPP users is the responsibility of the IWF and beyond the scope of
this solution. However, the MC client will need to link the identity of the
non-3GPP user and the identity of the SeGy, and transmit the identity of the
external user to the IWF. Advantages of the approach are:
A1-1 The approach is simple and scalable for the SeGy and the MC Domain.
Disadvantages of the approach are:
D1-1 There is a security risk of spoofing by the SeGy. By representing
multiple users using one identity, the SeGy is going against the security
principles of the MC system. Controls would have to be put in place to prevent
the SeGy from spoofing identities that it isn\'t allowed to represent.
D1-2 Requires a \'host\' domain. Connecting to other systems, the SeGy (and
the external system it represents) appear as part of the MC Domain that
supports it.
D1-3 Using a SeGy non-transparently impacts the usability of the gateway.
D1-4 To use a SeGy of this type transparently would require modifying clients
to use a different cryptographic identity when dialling external users behind
the SeGy, introducing a major security and configuration impact.
### 7.8.2 Solution #7.2: MC Security Gateway (SeGy) acts as many MC clients
#### 7.8.2.1 Overview
For background, see Clause 7.8.1.1.
The solution defines that a SeGy acts as MC clients within the MC Domain, one
MC client identity per external identity in the external system. In this
instance, the SeGy is part of the same security domain as the rest of the MC
system and is dependent on the MC Domain to operate.
#### 7.8.2.2 Motivating security requirements
For requirements, see Clause 7.8.1.2
#### 7.8.2.3 Solution description
The SeGy acts as multiple MC Clients within the MC domain, fulfilling the
security functions of each of the MC Clients. The SeGy represents the identity
of each user in the external system within the MC Domain.
1\. The SeGy individually authenticates to and requests access tokens from the
IdM for each identity that it represents.
2\. The SeGy individually requests user-specific key material from the KMS for
each identity that it represents.
3\. The SeGy individually communicates with the GMS to join groups for each
identity that it represents. This will mean the SeGy joins the same group many
times.
4\. The SeGy individually connects with MCX Server(s), using a CSK, for each
MC client that it represents. This will result in multiple connections to the
same MCX Servers.
#### 7.8.2.4 Evaluation against requirements
The proposed approach creates a user in the MC Domain for every user in the
external domain. From the point of view of the MC Domain, it has multiple MC
clients connecting to the domain from the same signalling entry point (the
SeGy\'s address).
Advantages of this approach:
A2-1 The approach is completely transparent to the MC clients and the MC
Domain.
A2-2 The security principles of the MC System are maintained.
Disadvantages of this approach:
D2-1 The proposed approach still has scaling issues. A large amount of
connection signalling (to IdM, KMS, GMS, MCX Servers) is required for each
user that the SeGy supports. If the external system is large, it would require
the MC Domain to scale similarly.
D2-2 Requires a \'host\' domain. Connecting to other systems, the SeGy (and
the external system it represents) appear as part of the MC Domain that
supports it.
D2-3 Connectivity to the MC Domain appears clumsy, using multiple CSKs to
connect to the same server.
### 7.8.3 Solution #7.3: MC Security Gateway (SeGy) acts as many migrated MC
clients
#### 7.8.3.1 Overview
For background, see Clause 7.8.1.1.
The solution defines that a SeGy acts as an external MC Domain containing many
migrated MC clients from the MC Domain, one per external identity in the
external system. In this instance, the SeGy\'s clients are part of the same
security domain as the rest of the MC Domain and hence it is dependent on the
MC Domain to operate.
#### 7.8.3.2 Motivating security requirements
For requirements, see Clause 7.8.1.2.
#### 7.8.3.3 Solution description
The SeGy acts as multiple MC Clients within the MC domain, fulfilling the
security functions of each of the MC Clients. The SeGy represents the identity
of each user in the external system within the MC Domain.
1\. The SeGy individually authenticates and requests access tokens from the
IdM for each identity that it represents.
2\. The SeGy individually requests user-specific key material from the KMS for
each identity that it represents.
3\. The SeGy individually communicates with the GMS to join groups for each
identity that it represents. This will mean the SeGy joins the same group many
times.
4\. The SeGy connects individually with each MCX Server(s), using SPK as an
external MC Domain.
#### 7.8.3.4 Evaluation against requirements
The proposed approach creates a migrated user in the MC Domain for every user
in the external domain. From the point of view of the MC Domain, it has
multiple migrated MC clients connecting to the domain from the same external
system. This reduces some of the signalling overhead of solution #7.2.
Advantages of this approach:
A3-1 The approach is completely transparent to the MC clients.
A3-2 The MC Domain only has to setup a single interconnection with an external
MC system.
A3-3 The security principles of the MC System are maintained.
Disadvantages of this approach:
D3-1 The proposed approach still has scaling issues. A large amount of
connection signalling (to IdM, KMS, GMS) is required for each user that the
SeGy supports. If the external system is large, it would require the MC Domain
to scale similarly.
D3-2 Requires a \'host\' domain. Connecting to other systems, the SeGy (and
the external system it represents) appear as part of the MC Domain that
supports it.
### 7.8.4 Solution #7.4: MC Security Gateway (SeGy) acts as an external MC
Domain
#### 7.8.4.1 Overview
For background, see Clause 7.8.1.1.
The solution defines that the SeGy acts as an entirely external MC Domain
towards the MC Domain. This involves associating sub-functions of a separate
IS Proxy, KMS, IdM, and an external MC client with the SeGy. The advantage of
this approach is that the SeGy is independent of existing MC Domains.
#### 7.8.4.2 Motivating security requirements
For requirements, see Clause 7.8.1.2.
#### 7.8.4.3 Solution description
1\. The SeGy has its own (integrated) KMS and IdM and internally creates its
own \'user\' for any user of the external system that requires connection
through the SeGy.
NOTE: Extracting the SeGy\'s KMS into a truly separate function would have the
security benefit that compromise of the SeGy would not compromise the KMS.
2\. The SeGy connects to MC Domains as an external MC Domain, using a single
connection (SIP and HTTP) and with SIP secured using an SPK.
3\. The SeGy (integrated) IdM supports inter-domain identity management for
any required service authorisations needed with another MC Domain.
4\. The SeGy could also integrate a GMS, allowing the SeGy to add MC System
users into its own groups. The SeGy would need to connect to GMSs in MC
Domains to add each of its users into existing groups.
5\. From the point of view of the MC Domain, communications to/from the SeGy
come from MC clients in the SeGy\'s external system.
#### 7.8.4.4 Evaluation against requirements
In this case the SeGy acts as a full external domain.
Advantages of this approach:
A4-1. No host domain is required. The SeGy acts independently of any existing
MC Domain.
A4-2. Compromise of the SeGy has minimal impact on the security of existing MC
Domains (as only the users of an external system are compromised).
A4-3. The SeGy can create new external system users on the fly, with minimal
signalling. This allows the SeGy to dynamically scale.
Disadvantages of this approach:
D4-1. The SeGy needs to support a range of features and servers (IdM, KMS,
GMS, and possibly others) to appear as a full external system (but fewer
client features).
D4-2. A large amount of signalling is required to register each external user
to groups in the MC Domain.
### 7.8.5 Solution #7.5: MC Security Gateway (SeGy) acts as a single user in
an external MC Domain
#### 7.8.5.1 Overview
For background, see Clause 7.8.1.1.
The solution defines that the SeGy acts as an entirely external MC Domain
towards the MC Domain, but with only one user. This involves associating sub-
functions of a separate IS Proxy, KMS, IdM, and an external MC client with the
SeGy. The advantage of this approach is that the SeGy is independent of
existing MC Domains, but requires less signalling than if it contained
multiple users.
#### 7.8.5.2 Motivating security requirements
For requirements, see Clause 7.8.1.2.
#### 7.8.5.3 Solution description
1\. The SeGy has its own (integrated) KMS and IdM and internally creates a
single \'user\' to represent all users of the external system that it
represents.
2\. The SeGy connects to MC Domains as an external MC Domain, using a single
connection and secured using an SPK.
3\. The SeGy (integrated) IdM supports inter-domain identity management for
any required service authorisations needed with another MC Domain.
4\. The SeGy could also integrate a GMS, allowing the SeGy to add MC System
users into its own groups. The SeGy would need to connect to GMSs in MC
Domains to its user into existing groups.
5\. From the point of view of the MC Domain, communications to/from the SeGy
come from the MC client in the SeGy\'s external system. To perform a private
call to the external system represented by the SeGy would require some form of
translation at the MC client or SeGy.
#### 7.8.5.4 Evaluation against requirements
In this case the SeGy acts as a full external domain with one user.
Advantages of this approach:
A5-1 No host domain is required. The SeGy acts independently of any existing
MC Domain.
A5-2 Compromise of the SeGy has minimal impact on the security of existing MC
Domains (as only the users of an external system are compromised).
A5-3 The SeGy uses minimal signalling to integrate into existing MC Domains.
Disadvantages of this approach:
D5-1 The SeGy needs to support a range of features to appear as a full
external system (but fewer client features).
D5-2 There is a security risk of spoofing by the SeGy. By representing
multiple users using one identity, the SeGy is going against the security
principles of the MC system. The risk is lower as this only impacts its own
domain.
D5-3 Using a SeGy non-transparently impacts the usability of the gateway.
D5-4 To use a SeGy of this type transparently would require modifying clients
to use a different cryptographic identity when dialling external users behind
the SeGy, introducing a security and configuration impact (although this only
impacts one security domain in this case).
### 7.8.6 Solution #7.6: Interworking security data management using MCData
SDS when security data is home to non-3GPP system.
#### 7.8.6.1 Overview
To support interworking security data management between various non-3GPP
systems and 3GPP interworking UEs, a secure and generic security data
management solution that supports the transport of non-3GPP security data (SD)
needs to be supported by the 3GPP mission critical architecture. The SD itself
should be agnostic to the 3GPP network and the SD format and content are
considered out of scope for this document. The SD is simply passed as a
payload inside a MCData SDS message.
In this solution, the non-3GPP system is home to the interworking security
data.
#### 7.8.6.2 Motivating security requirements
For requirements, see Clause 5.8.2.3.
#### 7.8.6.3 Solution description
In this solution, management of interworking security data is carried out
using an Interworking Security Data message (InterSD). InterSDs may be
generated by either the IWF or the 3GPP interworking UE. InterSDs pass through
the 3GPP network (between the IWF and the 3GPP interworking UEs) via an MCData
SDS message carrying the non-3GPP security data as a payload.
InterSDs may be initiated by either the non-3GPP system (i.e. the IWF) or the
3GPP interworking UEs.
The formatting and content of non-3GPP SD are defined by the non-3GPP system
security architecture and are out of scope for this document. The InterSD
shall support the transfer of non-3GPP SD regardless of the SD content,
format, or the non-3GPP system architecture beyond the IWF.
Elements of an MCData SDS InterSD:
\- **MCData signalling parameters** : generic Mission Critical Services
signalling elements e.g. KMF ID, MCData user ID. These parameters are
confidentiality protected between the MCData Client, MCData server and IWF
with signalling plane security mechanisms.
\- **MCData** **Data signalling payload** : information elements necessary for
identification and management of the MCData messages e.g. conversation
identifiers, session identifiers, transaction identifiers, disposition
requests, etc. This payload is confidentiality protected between the MCData
Client, MCData server and IWF with signalling plane security mechanisms.
\- **End to end security parameters** : information specifying the
cryptographic elements used to protect the SD payload between the IWF (KMF ID)
and 3GPP interworking capable UE (MCData ID).
\- **SD payload** : This payload consists of non-3GPP security data defined by
the specific non-3GPP security system. The contents and formatting of the SD
are out of scope for this document. This payload is end to end confidentiality
and integrity protected between the IWF (KMF ID) and the 3GPP interworking
capable UE (MCData ID).
Components of the MCData message (MCData signalling parameters and MCData Data
signalling payload) are integrity protected between the MCData Client, MCData
server and IWF with the signalling plane security mechanisms.
Editor\'s Note: It is TBD whether the SD payload requires integrity
protection.
Figure 7.8.6.3-1 shows the contents of an MCData SDS based InterSD message.

This solution meets the interworking security data management requirements
specified in Clause 5.8.2.3.
### 7.8.7 Solution #7.7: Interworking security data management using SIP
MESSAGE message when security data is home to non-3GPP system.
#### 7.8.7.1 Overview
To support interworking security data management between various non-3GPP
systems and 3GPP interworking UEs, a secure and generic security data
management solution that supports the transport of a non-3GPP security data
(SD) needs to be supported by the 3GPP mission critical architecture. The SD
should itself be agnostic to the 3GPP network and the SD format and content
are considered out of scope for this document. The SD is simply passed as a
payload inside a SIP MESSAGE message.
In this solution, the non-3GPP system is home to the interworking security
data.
#### 7.8.7.2 Motivating security requirements
For requirements, see Clause 5.8.2.3.
#### 7.8.7.3 Solution description
In this solution, key management of interworking security data is carried out
using an Interworking Security Data message (InterSD). An InterSD may be
generated by either the IWF or the 3GPP interworking UE. InterSDs pass through
the 3GPP network (between the IWF and the 3GPP interworking UEs) via a SIP
MESSAGE message carrying the non-3GPP SD as a payload.
InterSDs may be initiated by either the non-3GPP system (i.e. the IWF) or the
3GPP interworking UEs.
The formatting and content of non-3GPP SD are defined by the non-3GPP system
security architecture and are out of scope for this document. The InterSD
shall support the transfer of non-3GPP SD regardless of the SD content,
format, or the non-3GPP system architecture beyond the IWF.
Elements of an InterSD:
\- **SIP header and addressing:** SIP header and routing information based on
the 3GPP SIP/IMS architecture.
\- **Signalling parameters** : These are the Mission Critical services
signalling elements e.g. KMF ID (IWF) and MCPTT ID endpoints. These parameters
are confidentiality and integrity protected between the MCX Client, MCX
Service server, and between the MCX Service server and the IWF using existing
signalling plane security mechanisms (i.e. CSK and SPK).
\- **SD payload** : This payload consists of the non-3GPP security data
defined by the specific non-3GPP security data management system. The contents
and formatting of the SD are out of scope for this document. This SD payload
shall be confidentiality and integrity protected between the MCX Client, MCX
Service server and the IWF using existing signalling plane security mechanisms
(i.e. CSK and SPK).

#### 7.8.7.4 Evaluation against requirements
This solution meets the interworking security data management requirements
specified in Clause 5.8.2.3.
# 8 Evaluation and conclusion
## 8.1 Evaluation of Solution #1.2: Distribution of key material to protect
signalling
The solution meets the applicable security requirements listed in Clause 5.2,
allowing a means to distribute keys for the protection of signalling between
the MC client and a MCX Server. The approach also simplifies the security
procedures already defined in TS 33.179 [3].
It is the only defined solution for updating CSK (which was not defined in TS
33.179 [3]) and meeting requirement [MCSEC-1.8-1] for distribution of MKFC.
For distribution of MSCCK, there are three other solutions: Solution #3.1,
#3.2 and #3.3. Solution #1.2 is effectively an adaptation of Solution #3.1 to
distribute the new key within its own channel (rather than within the
multicast bearer announcement message). This should be more efficient over the
lifetime of the service.
Support for the MSCCK and support for distributing the MSCCK (within a bearer
announcement message) should be maintained from TS 33.179 [3] to allow for
back-compatibility. Note, the MSCCK is not used unless required to communicate
with a legacy server or client (as defined by the functionality in TS 33.179
[3]).
In terms of back-compatibility for MKFC functionality, the following shall be
the functionality within the system:
1) The GMS shall not produce MKFCs.
2) The MCPTT PF shall:
a) attempt MuSiK \'key download\' prior to establishing an MBMS bearer. Should
the MuSiK be accepted, multicast signalling shall be protected using the MuSiK
(or another MuSiK/MSCCK subsequently delivered by the server). If the MuSiK is
rejected, only unicast signalling shall be used for MCPTT signalling with the
MC client.
b) reject any MKFCs provided from a GMS.
3) The MC client shall:
a) Support receipt and use of MKFCs (alongside MuSiK and MSCCK).
b) Reject MKFCs received from other MC systems (based upon the GMS identity).
c) Discard previously received MKFCs upon attaching to a new MC system.
Where a MuSiK is established at the same time as a MBMS bearer is established,
MuSiK distribution may be optimised by attaching the MuSiK to a MBMS bearer
announcement message rather than creating a separate \'key download\' message.
The approach applies across the MC services, and is flexible allowing
distribution of future keys for future MC services.
It is recommended that Solution #1.2 is used as the method for distribution
signalling keys to support the mission critical service.
## 8.2 Evaluation of Solution #1.3 : Multiple Security Domains
With respect to the Stage 1 security requirements in TS 22.280 [5], 22.281 [6]
and the derived security requirements in Clause 5.2.7, support is required for
multiple security domains.
Solution #1.3 provides a means for entities within the MC System to store the
security domain (KMS URI) of another entity within the MC System. Without this
capability, a remote lookup would need to be performed every time
communication with an external security domain is required (such as described
in Solution #1.1). This would increase overhead and latency. Solution #1.1 (or
an equivalent approach) may also be required to support user roaming and
migration, but with Solution #1.3, this reduces the frequency of remote
lookups.
Consequently, it is recommended that Solution #1.3 be selected as a method for
supporting multiple security domains. This approach is applicable to all
services within the MC System.
## 8.3 Evaluation of Solution #3.7: Key management for first-to-answer call
With respect to the Stage 1 and Stage 2 security requirements identified in
Clause 7.4.7.2, Solution #3.7 proposes a method to key manage and provide
security for the first-to-call feature.
Solution #3.7 meets the Stage 1 and Stage 2 requirements in Clause 7.4.7.2 by:
1) providing a way to establish privacy between only the initiating user and
the first-to-answer responding user, and
2) protecting the session key (PCK) and MCPTT IDs within the first-to-answer
request and first-to-answer response messages.
It is therefore proposed that Solution #3.7 be selected as the first-to-answer
key management and security solution.
## 8.4 Evaluation of Solution #5.1: Mission critical video (MCVideo)
With respect to the Stage 1 MCVideo security requirements in 22.280 [5],
22.281 [6] and the derived security requirements in Clause(s) 5.6, MCVideo key
management, MCVideo protected private communications and MCVideo protected
group communications should share a common security architecture with the
other MCX services wherever possible.
Solution #5.1 proposes that all aspects of the MCVideo security architecture
(key management functional model, key distribution, protected private MCVideo
communications, and protected group MCVideo communications) align with the MCX
common architecture (i.e. the MCPTT security architecture) as proposed in
Clause 7.6.1.
With alignment to the common MCX security architecture as a goal, and using
the MCPTT security architecture as the baseline, it is recommended that
Solution #5.1 be selected as the way forward for the MCVideo security
architecture as it fully aligns with the MCPTT security architecture and
therefore also aligns with the common MCX security architecture.
## 8.5 Evaluation of Solution #6.1: Inter-Domain Identity Management
With respect to the Stage 1 inter-domain authorisation requirements in Clause
6.17.2 of 22.280 [5], Solution #6.1 proposes that the OAuth 2.0 token exchange
procedure be used to enable the authentication and authorisation of an MCX
user for services that are home to a partner domain.
Solution #6.1 meets all of the inter-domain authentication and authorisation
requirements specified in Clause 6.17.2 of 22.280 [5]. Solution #6.1 provides
a method for an MCX UE to obtain a security token that can be validated by the
partner IdMS that in turn provides an access token to the MCX user. The access
token authorises the MCX user to receive services owned and hosted in the
partner domain.
Solution #6.1 addresses and meets all of the requirements for authentication
and authorisation by the primary IdMS as part of inter-domain communications.
Solution #6.1 also addresses and meets all of the requirements that the
partner system shall be able to authenticate, authorise, and control access to
partner services by visiting MCX UEs.
It is therefore proposed that Solution #6.1 be selected as the inter-domain
identity management solution.
## 8.6 Evaluation of Solution #1.4: Encryption of entire XML signalling
content
Supporting encryption of the entire XML signalling content will make the
application signalling solution more usable in real terms, meaning that it is
more likely that application signalling will be protected. This will ensure
the requirements around the protection of signalling are met.
It is therefore proposed that Solution #1.4 be supported within TS 33.180
[21].
## 8.7 Evaluation of MCData Solutions
Within MCData there are six proposed solutions: #4.1, #4.2, #4.3, #4.4, #4.5
and #4.6.
#4.1 and #4.2 compare the merits of doing key distribution in the signalling
channel or alongside the media. Based upon the decision by CT to use SIP for
the signalling channel to setup media paths over SIP or MSRP, the natural
choice is to use the signalling channel for key distribution, hence #4.1 is
preferred.
#4.4 simply defines a methodology for protecting MCData payloads and is
independent of the key distribution solution.
#4.3, #4.5 and #4.6 define key distribution and key support mechanisms that
are compatible. #4.3 asserts that separate keys are used for media and
signalling protection, and that the payloads for media and signalling
protection should be protected separately. #4.5 asserts that the keys used for
protection of MCPTT and MCVideo for signalling protection (CSK, MuSiK, MSCCK)
or for media protection (PCK, GMK) should be reused for MCData. #4.6 defines
the means by which keys are distributed. This approach reflects that used for
MCPTT and MCVideo, and hence allows the maximum of existing functionality to
be reused.
In summary, the approach defined across #4.1, #4.3, #4.4, #4.5 and #4.6 shall
be adopted for protection of MCData within TS 33.180 [21]. Moreover, #4.4
notes that the approach for protecting payloads for SIP transport may also be
applied to media transport (MSRP), and hence these five solutions allow for
SDS and FD protection across SIP or media plane.
## 8.8 Evaluation of Solution #1.1: KMS Discovery
With respect to the Stage 1 security requirements in TS 22.280 [5], TS 22.281
[6] and the derived security requirements in Clause 5.2.7, support is required
for multiple security domains across multiple mission critical systems through
interconnection.
It is not practical for Solution #1.3 to be sufficient to support
interconnection. For this to be possible, all mission critical systems would
have to share information about which security domain (KMS) is used by each
user. This breaks the requirement for mission critical systems to maintain the
confidentiality of the users in the system. Hence, there needs to be a real-
time mechanism for sharing KMS information within and between mission critical
systems.
Solution #1.1 provides a means for entities within the MC System to return KMS
information in response to a received MIKEY message which uses the wrong
KMS(s). Annex A shows the variety of use cases which this mechanism supports.
Consequently, it is recommended that Solution #1.1 be selected as a method for
supporting multiple security domains (KMSs) across multiple MC Systems.
## 8.9 Evaluation of Solution #1.5: Signalling Proxies
With respect to the Stage 1 security requirements and the derived security
requirements in Clause 5.2.9, support is required for providing security
control at the edge of the mission critical domain.
Solution #1.5 provides a deployment option for providing security control at
the edge of the mission critical domain. This solution does not require any
change to external protocols or interfaces, and hence is fully compatible with
this release and back-compatible with previous releases.
Consequently, it is recommended that Solution #1.5 be recorded as a deployment
option within TS 33.180 [21], and that future solutions are designed to be
usable in systems where this deployment option is used.
## 8.10 Evaluation of Security Gateways
Each of the security solutions for security gateways (Solutions #7.1, #7.2,
#7.3, #7.4 and #7.5) have their pluses and minuses as described in their
evaluations.
A number of the gateway solutions are non-transparent. For the purposes of the
MC System, it is of great benefit if gateways are transparent as this enables
back-compatibility with MC clients from earlier releases. Consequently,
Solution #7.1 and Solution #7.5 are excluded.
Other gateway solutions require a host domain to perform the various functions
to support the gateway. This causes issues around the sharing of the gateway
and the scalability of the gateway. Consequently, Solution #7.2 and Solution
#7.3 are excluded.
The remaining solution is #7.4. This 'standalone\' solution scales well and
maintains the security properties of the MC System by not impacting the
security of any other domain. Correspondingly, Solution #7.4 shall be adopted
for use within the MC System.
## 8.11 Evaluation of signalling authentication and authorisation
Within this document there are two proposed solutions for signalling
authentication and authorisation: #1.6, #1.7
Analysis of signalling within the MC System (see Clause 7.2.7.3.1) shows that
there are a number of potentially damaging signalling flows within the MC
system that should be authenticated and authorised, especially when being
generated outside of the home system.
Solution #1.6 and #1.7 are both required to allow signalling to be
authenticated and authorised. Correspondingly, both these solutions shall be
adopted for use within the MC System.
## 8.12 Evaluation of Interworking security data transport solutions
Interworking security data solutions include solution #7.6 Interworking
security data management using MCData SDS when security data is home to
non-3GPP system (clause 7.8.6), and solution #7.7 Interworking security data
management using SIP MESSAGE message when security data is home to non-3GPP
system (clause 7.8.7).
Solution #7.6 reuses the existing MCData architecture where the non-3GPP
security data is carried in the MCData payload. Solution #7.7 uses the SIP
MESSAGE message (InterSD) to carry the non-3GPP security data.
Both solutions #7.6 and #7.7 meet the requirements for transparent and
protected delivery of interworking end-to-end key management messages between
a non-3GPP system and 3GPP interworking MC UEs in the 3GPP system equally.
Based on interworking architectural decisions made in SA6, the solution
selected as the interworking security data transport mechanism is based on
solution #7.7. Details of this mechanism are defined in 23.283 [23].
###### ## Annex A: Use Cases for KMS Discovery (Solution #1.1)
## A.0 Introduction
### A.0.1 General
This annex contains use cases which use the KMS Discovery process described in
Solution #1.1 to identify the correct KMS to use as the initiator (IDRkmsi)
and receiver (IDRkmsr). The purpose of recording how the process is used in a
variety of increasingly complex scenarios is to ensure that the KMS Discovery
process supports each situation, and the expected message flow in each case.
### A.0.2 KMS Certificate Requests
When an entity receives a MIKEY message or KRR containing a KMS URI that has
not been provisioned, it may request the KMS Certificate from its Home KMS
(specifically using a \'CertCache\' request containing a specific KMS URI).
The KMS may then provision the KMS Certificate, and should this happen, no
further KRR will be necessary.
However, in the procedures below, it is assumed that all possible Secondary
Home and External KMSs have been provisioned by the Home KMS to the client, so
while the KMS Certificate Request may occur by both the initiator and
receiver, no KMS certificate request is shown in the procedures.
## A.1 Use Case 1: Basic KMS Discovery
### A.1.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made:
\- initiating MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS B as an External KMS.
\- receiving client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS B as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS A as an External KMS
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- MC Domains do not enforce any KMS policy.
### A.1.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.3.2-1.
Figure A.1.2-1: Example Information Flow for Basic KMS Discovery
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (KMS A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The receiver receives the MIKEY message. IDRkmsi (KMS A) references an
External KMS for the receiving client and hence is acceptable. IDRkmsr (KMS A)
does not reference a Home or Secondary Home KMS for the receiver.
Correspondingly, the receiver produces a KRR. The receiver populates the
initiator list with IDRkmsi received from the initiator (KMS A). The receiver
populates the receiver list with its Home KMS (KMS B).
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list and uses
KMS \'A\' as this is the initiator\'s Home KMS. The initiator extracts the
receiver list and uses KMS \'B\' as this is an External KMS for the initiator.
Based on local policy, a new MIKEY message is sent with these values and is
successfully received.
## A.2 Use Case 2: KMS Discovery using Secondary Home
### A.2.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made:
\- initiating MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS,
\- KMS C as a Secondary Home KMS, and
\- KMS B as an External KMS.
\- receiving client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS B as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS A as an External KMS
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- MC Domains do not enforce any KMS policy.
### A.2.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.2.2-1.
Figure A.2.2-1: Example Information Flow for KMS Discovery using Secondary
Home
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (KMS A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The receiver receives the MIKEY message. IDRkmsi references KMS A which is
not an External KMS for the receiving client and hence is not acceptable.
IDRkmsr also references KMS A which is not a Home or Secondary Home KMS for
the receiver and hence is not acceptable. Correspondingly, the receiver
produces a KRR. The receiver populates the initiator list with its Home,
Secondary and External KMSs (B,C). The receiver populates the receiver list
with its Home KMS (B).
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list. KMS \'B\'
is neither a Home nor a Secondary Home KMS, but KMS \'C\' is a Secondary Home
KMS. Hence, the initiator uses KMS \'C\' as IDRkmsi. The initiator extracts
the receiver list and uses KMS \'B\' as IDRkmsr (as this is an External KMS
for the initiator). Based on local policy, a new MIKEY message is sent with
these values and is successfully received.
## A.3 Use Case 3: KMS Discovery failure
### A.3.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made:
\- initiating MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS B as an External KMS.
\- receiving client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS B as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS C as an External KMS
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- MC Domains do not enforce any KMS policy
### A.3.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.3.2-1.
Figure A.3.2-1: Example Information Flow for KMS Discovery Failure
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (KMS A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The receiver receives the MIKEY message. IDRkmsi references KMS A which is
not an External KMS for the receiving client and hence is not acceptable.
IDRkmsr also references KMS A which is not a Home or Secondary Home KMS for
the receiver and hence is not acceptable. Correspondingly, the receiver
produces a KRR. The receiver populates the initiator list with its Home,
Secondary and External KMSs (B,C). The receiver populates the receiver list
with its Home KMS (B).
3\. The initiator extracts the initiator list. KMS \'B\' and \'C\' are neither
a Home nor a Secondary Home KMS. Hence, the initiator is unable to communicate
with the receiver and the communication fails. No new MIKEY message is sent.
NOTE: In the above process the initiator and receiver may request their
respective KMS Certificates from their Home KMS (CertCache request with a
specific KMS URI). The flow assumes that these requests fail.
## A.4 Use Case 4: KMS Discovery to support a preferred security-domain
### A.4.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made:
\- initiating MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS S as a Secondary Home KMS
\- receiving client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS S as a Secondary Home KMS
\- The receiving client has local policy that prefers the use of KMS S when
KMS S is supported by the other endpoint.
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- MC Domains do not enforce any KMS policy
### A.4.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.4.2-1.
Figure A.4.2-1: KMS Discovery using a preferred Secondary Home KMS
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The receiver receives the MIKEY message. IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr are both
acceptable. However, the receiver applies local policy and sends a KRR. The
receiver populates the initiator list based on local policy, and includes
IDRkmsi (KMS A) as this is acceptable. Hence the list [S,A] is produced. The
receiver populates the receiver list based on local policy, and includes
IDRkmsr (KMS A) as this is acceptable. Hence the list [S,A] is produced.
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list. KMS \'S\'
is first and is a Secondary Home KMS to the initiator. Hence, the initiator
uses KMS \'S\' as IDRkmsi. The initiator extracts the receiver list. KMS \'S\'
is first and is a Secondary Home KMS to the receiver. Hence, the initiator
uses KMS \'S\' as IDRkmsr. A new MIKEY message is sent with these values and
is successfully received. Consequently, KMS S is used for the communication.
NOTE: Should KMS \'S\' not be acceptable to the initiator, either as it is not
a secondary Home KMS or due to the initiator\'s local policy, the initiator
would select IDRkmsi to be \'A\' and IDRkmsr to be \'A\', causing a resend of
the first MIKEY message, which would be accepted by the receiver.
## A.5 Use Case 5: KMS Discovery using Proxies
### A.5.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made:
\- the initiating client is in Domain 1.
\- the receiving client is in Domain 2.
\- initiating MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS B as an External KMS.
\- receiving client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS B as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS A as an External KMS
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- MC Domain 2 has policy that its MC clients only use KMS \'B\', enforced by
its CS Proxy.
### A.5.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.5.2-1.
Figure A.5.2-1: KMS Discovery using Network Proxies
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The CS Proxy of MC Domain 2 receives the MIKEY message. It does not check
IDRkmsi. IDRkmsr is not supported in this domain. Correspondingly, the CS
Proxy produces a KRR. The CS Proxy populates the initiator list with \'ANY\'.
The CS Proxy populates the receiver list with the acceptable Home KMSs for the
targeted domain, in this case KMS \'B\'.
3\. The initiator extracts the initiator list (ANY) and uses KMS \'A\' as this
is its Home KMS. The initiator extracts the receiver list and uses KMS \'B\'
as this is an External KMS for the initiator. A new MIKEY message is sent with
these values and is successfully received.
## A.6 Use Case 6: KMS Discovery to support initiator roaming
### A.6.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the initiating domain:
\- initiating MC client is in MC Domain 1. The initiating MC client is
currently roaming on a visited network.
\- initiating MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS A as its Home KMS,
\- KMS C as a Secondary Home KMS, and
\- KMS B as an External KMS.
\- KMS \'C\' is used by Domain 1 as a \'Roaming KMS\'; a KMS shared with the
visited network\'s LEA. MC Domain 1 has policy that its MC clients shall use
KMS \'C\' while roaming on the visited network, enforced only by the MC Domain
1 CS Proxy.
NOTE: The roaming KMS is shared with the visiting network\'s LEA to allow LI
in the visiting network. The reason that a separate KMS is required is that
this permits access to roamer\'s encrypted traffic in both the visited and
home juristrictions, without compromising the protection of user\'s traffic
who are not using the visited network.
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the receiving domain
(Domain 2):
\- receiving client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS \'B\' as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS \'A\' and KMS \'C\' as External KMSS.
\- MC Domain 2 has policy that its MC clients only use KMS \'B\', enforced
only by the MC Domain 2 CS Proxy.
### A.6.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.6.2-1.
Figure A.6.2-1: KMS Discovery during initiator roaming
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The CS Proxy of MC Domain 1 receives the MIKEY message. It is aware that
the MC Client is roaming and applies its local policy to produce a KRR (as
IDRkmsi is \'A\' and should be \'C\'). Domain 1\'s CS Proxy populates the
initiator list with the acceptable initiator Home KMSs, in this case \'C\'.
Domain 1\'s CS Proxy populates the receiver list with \'ANY\'.
3\. The initiator extracts the initiator list and uses KMS \'C\' as IDRkmsi as
this is a Secondary Home KMS to the initiator. The initiator extracts the
receiver list and uses KMS \'A\' as IDRkmsr as this is an External KMS for the
initiator. A new MIKEY message is sent with these values.
4a. The MIKEY message passes through Domain 1\'s CS Proxy as it meets local
policy. The MIKEY message continues to the CS Proxy of MC Domain 2\. Domain
2\'s CS Proxy does not check IDRkmsi, but IDRkmsr is not supported in this
domain. Correspondingly, the Domain 2\'s CS Proxy produces a KRR. It populates
the initiator list with \'ANY\' and the receiver list with the acceptable
receiver Home KMSs in the domain, in this case KMS \'B\'.
4b. The KRR is received by Domain 1\'s CS Proxy. Domain 1\'s CS Proxy does not
check the receiver list. However, the initiator list (ANY) does not adhere to
local policy. Hence Domain 1\'s CS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 1\'s CS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable initiator Home KMSs
intersected with the initiator list from the original KRR (ANY âˆ© C = C). The
receiver list is copied from the original KRR.
5\. The KRR passes back to the initiator without change. The KRR extracts the
initiator list and uses KMS \'C\' as IDRkmsi as this is a Secondary Home KMS.
The initiator extracts the receiver list and uses KMS \'B\' as this is an
acceptable External KMS for the initiator. A new MIKEY message is sent with
these values and is successfully received by the receiver.
## A.7 Use Case 7: KMS Discovery to support receiver roaming
### A.7.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the initiating domain:
\- initiating client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS \'A\' as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS \'B\' and KMS \'D\' as External KMSs.
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- There are no KMS policies being enforced in MC Domain 1.
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the receiving domain:
\- receiving MC client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS B as its Home KMS,
\- KMS D as a Secondary Home KMS, and
\- KMS A as an External KMS.
\- KMS \'D\' is used by Domain 2 as a \'Roaming KMS\'; a KMS shared with the
visited network\'s LEA. MC Domain 2 has policy that its MC clients shall use
KMS \'D\' while roaming on the visited network, enforced only by the MC Domain
2 CS Proxy.
NOTE: The roaming KMS is shared with the visiting network\'s LEA to allow LI
in the visiting network. The reason that a separate KMS is required is that
this permits access to roamer\'s encrypted traffic in both the visited and
home jurisdictions, without compromising the protection of user\'s traffic who
are not using the visited network.
### A.7.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.7.2-1.
Figure A.7.2-1: KMS Discovery during receiver roaming
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The CS Proxy of MC Domain 2 receives the MIKEY message. It does not check
IDRkmsi. IDRkmsr (KMS A) is not supported in this domain. Correspondingly, the
CS Proxy produces a KRR. The CS Proxy populates the initiator list with
\'ANY\'. As the receiving client is roaming, the CS Proxy applies local policy
and populates the receiver list with the Roaming KMS that the user should use,
in this case KMS \'D\'.
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list (ANY) and
uses KMS \'A\' as this is its Home KMS. The initiator extracts the receiver
list and uses KMS \'D\' as this is an External KMS for the initiator. A new
MIKEY message is sent with these values and is successfully received.
## A.8 Use Case 8: KMS Discovery to support initiator migration
### A.8.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the initiating MC
client.
\- Has migrated from Domain 2 to Domain 1.
\- initiating client uses (and is provisioned with):
\- KMS \'A\' as its Home KMS, and
\- KMS \'D\' (Migration KMS) as a Secondary Home KMSs.
\- KMS \'B\' as an External KMS.
\- Does not know the KMS of the receiver.
The following assumptions are made on the initiator\'s migrated domain (Domain
1):
\- Supports KMS \'C\' as the local Home KMS for its MC clients.
\- Supports KMS \'D\' as a shared \'Migration KMS\' between Domain 1 and 2.
\- Only allows clients attached to its network to use KMS \'C\' or \'D\',
enforced by its CS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the initiator\'s originating domain
(Domain 2)
\- Supports KMS \'A\' as the local Home KMS for its MC clients.
\- Supports KMS \'D\' as a shared \'Migration KMS\' between Domain 1 and 2.
\- Requires that its MC users use a Home KMS or Secondary Home (KMS \'A\' or
KMS \'D\'), enforced by its IS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the receiver\'s domain (Domain 3)
\- Uses KMS \'B\' as the domain\'s Home KMS.
\- Only allows clients attached to its network to use KMS \'B\', enforced by
its CS Proxy.
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the receiver:
\- Uses KMS \'B\' as its Home KMS.
\- Has KMS \'A\', \'D\' as External KMSs.
### A.8.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.8.2-1.
Figure A.8.2-1: KMS Discovery during initiator migration (not calling home)
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client to the receiving MC
Client. As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its Home
KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The CS Proxy of MC Domain 1 receives the MIKEY message. IDRkmsi in the
MIKEY message is not acceptable hence a KRR is created. The CS Proxy populates
the initiator list with the acceptable initiator Home KMSs, in this case \'C\'
and \'D\'. The CS Proxy populates the receiver list with \'ANY\'.
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list and uses
KMS \'D\' as IDRkmsi as this is a Secondary Home KMS. The initiator extracts
the receiver list (ANY) and uses KMS \'A\' as this is the Home KMS for the
initiator. The initiator sends this MIKEY message towards the receiver.
4a. The MIKEY message is acceptable to Domain 1\'s CS Proxy (IDRkmsi ok) and
Domain 2\'s IS Proxy (Domain 2 user\'s IDRkms \'D\' is acceptable). The
message is received by Domain 3\'s CS Proxy. It does not check IDRkmsi.
IDRkmsr (A) is not supported in this domain. Correspondingly, the CS Proxy
produces a KRR. The CS Proxy populates the initiator list with \'ANY\'. The CS
Proxy populates the receiver list with the acceptable receiver Home KMSs in
the domain, in this case KMS \'B\'. The KRR is sent on towards the initiator.
4b. The KRR is received by Domain 2\'s IS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the IS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 2\'s IS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable initiator Home KMSs
intersected with the initiator list from the original KRR (ANY âˆ© [A,D] =
[A,D]). The receiver list is copied from the original KRR (B). The new KRR is
sent on towards the initiator.
4c. The KRR is received by Domain 1\'s CS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the CS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 1\'s CS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable initiator Home KMSs
intersected with the initiator list from the original KRR ([A,D] âˆ© [C,D]=
[D]). The receiver list is copied from the original KRR (B). The new KRR is
sent on towards the initiator.
5\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list (D) and
uses KMS \'D\' as this is a Secondary Home KMS. The initiator extracts the
receiver list and uses KMS \'B\' as this is an External KMS for the initiator.
A new MIKEY message is sent with these values and is successfully received.
## A.9 Use Case 9: KMS Discovery to support receiver migration
### A.9.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the initiating MC
client:
\- is in MC Domain 1
\- KMS \'A\' is its Home KMS.
\- KMS \'B\' and KMS \'D\' are provisioned External KMSs (the KMS certificate
has been provided).
\- does not know the KMS URI of the receiving client.
The following assumptions are made on the initiating clients originating
domain (Domain 1):
\- There are no KMS policies being enforced in MC Domain 1.
The following assumptions are made on the receiving clients originating domain
(Domain 2):
\- Uses KMS \'B\' as the domain\'s Home KMS
\- Supports KMS \'D\', a shared \'Migration KMS\' between Domain 2 and 3.
\- Requires that its MC users use a Home KMS or Secondary Home (KMS \'B\' or
KMS \'D\'), enforced by its IS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the receiving client\'s migrated domain
(Domain 3):
\- Uses KMS \'C\' as the domain\'s Home KMS
\- Supports KMS \'D\', a shared \'Migration KMS\' between Domain 2 and 3.
\- Only allows clients attached to its network to use KMS \'C\' or \'D\',
enforced by its CS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the receiving client:
\- receiving MC client has migrated from MC Domain 2 to MC Domain 3.
\- KMS \'B\' is its Home KMS.
\- KMS \'D\' is provisioned as a \'Secondary Home KMS\' for the receiving MC
client.
\- KMS \'A\' is a provisioned External KMS.
### A.9.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.9.2-1.
Figure A.9.2-1: KMS Discovery during receiver migration
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client to the receiving MC
Client. As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its Home
KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The IS Proxy of MC Domain 2 receives the MIKEY message. The IDRr relates
to a user from MC Domain 2, but IDRkmsr (KMS A) is not acceptable. Hence the
CS Proxy produces a KRR. The CS Proxy populates the initiator list with
\'ANY\'. The CS Proxy populates the receiver list with the acceptable Home KMS
and Secondary Home KMSs in the domain, in this case [B,D].
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list (ANY) and
uses KMS \'A\' as this is its Home KMS. The initiator extracts the receiver
list and uses KMS \'B\' as this is an External KMS for the initiator. A new
MIKEY message is sent with these values.
4a. The MIKEY message is acceptable to Domain 2\'s IS Proxy and is passed to
Domain 3. The CS Proxy in Domain 3 does not accept IDRkmsr (KMS B). Hence the
CS Proxy produces a KRR. The CS Proxy populates the initiator list with
\'ANY\'. The CS Proxy populates the receiver list with the acceptable Home KMS
and Secondary Home KMSs in the domain, in this case [C,D]. The KRR is sent
towards the initiator.
4b. The KRR is received by Domain 2\'s IS Proxy. The initiator list is copied
from the original KRR. Domain 2\'s IS Proxy populates the receiver list with
the acceptable Home KMSs intersected with the receiver list from the original
KRR ([C,D] âˆ© [B,D] = [D]). The new KRR is sent on towards the initiator.
5\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list (ANY) and
uses KMS \'A\' as this is its Home KMS. The initiator extracts the receiver
list and uses KMS \'D\' as this is an External KMS for the initiator. A new
MIKEY message is sent with these values.
## A.10 Use Case 10: KMS Discovery to support initiator & receiver migration
### A.10.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the initiating MC
client.
\- Has migrated from Domain 2 to Domain 1.
\- KMS \'A\' is its Home KMS.
\- KMS \'C\' (Migration KMS) is a Secondary Home KMS.
\- KMS \'X\' and \'Z\' are External KMSs.
\- Does not know the KMS of the receiver.
The following assumptions are made on the initiator\'s migrated domain (Domain
1):
\- KMS \'B\' is the domain\'s Home KMS
\- Supports KMS \'C\' as a shared \'Migration KMS\' between Domain 1 and 2.
\- Only allows clients attached to its network to use KMS \'B\' or \'C\',
enforced by its CS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the initiator\'s originating domain
(Domain 2)
\- KMS \'A\' is the domain\'s Home KMS
\- Supports KMS \'C\' as a Secondary Home KMS, shared \'Migration KMS\'
between Domain 1 and 2.
\- Requires that its MC users use a Home KMS or Secondary Home (KMS \'A\' or
KMS \'C\'), enforced by its IS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the receiver\'s originating domain
(Domain 3)
\- KMS \'X\' is the domain\'s Home KMS
\- Supports KMS \'Z\' as a Secondary Home KMS, shared \'Migration KMS\'
between Domain 3 and 4.
\- Requires that its MC users use a Home KMS or Secondary Home (KMS \'X\' or
KMS \'Z\'), enforced by its IS Proxy.
The following assumptions are made on the receiver\'s migrated domain (Domain
4):
\- KMS \'Y\' is the domain\'s Home KMS
\- Supports KMS \'Z\' as a shared \'Migration KMS\' between Domain 3 and 4.
\- Only allows clients attached to its network to use KMS \'Y\' or \'Z\',
enforced by its CS Proxy.
In this use case, the following assumptions are made on the receiver:
\- Has migrated from Domain 3 to Domain 4.
\- KMS \'X\' is its Home KMS.
\- KMS \'Z\' (Migration KMS) is a Secondary Home KMS.
\- KMS \'A\' and \'C\' are External KMSs.
### A.10.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.10.2-1.
Figure A.10.2-1: KMS Discovery during initiator migration (not calling home)
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client to the receiving MC
Client. As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its Home
KMS (A) in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key.
2\. The CS Proxy of MC Domain 1 receives the MIKEY message. IDRkmsi (KMS A) in
the MIKEY message is not acceptable hence a KRR is created. The CS Proxy
populates the initiator list with the acceptable Home KMSs, in this case \'B\'
and \'C\'. The CS Proxy populates the receiver list with \'ANY\'.
3\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list and uses
KMS \'C\' as IDRkmsi as this is a Secondary Home KMS. The initiator extracts
the receiver list (ANY) and uses KMS \'A\' as as this is the Home KMS for the
initiator. The initiator sends this MIKEY message towards the receiver.
4a. The MIKEY message is acceptable to Domain 1\'s CS Proxy (initiator ok) and
Domain 2\'s IS Proxy (Domain 2 user\'s IDRkmsi \'C\' is acceptable). The
message is received by Domain 3\'s IS Proxy. IDRkmsr (A) relates to a Domain 3
user and is not acceptable. Correspondingly, the CS Proxy produces a KRR. The
CS Proxy populates the initiator list with \'ANY\'. The CS Proxy populates the
receiver list with the acceptable receiver Home KMSs in the domain, in this
case [X,Z]. The KRR is sent towards the initiator.
4b. The KRR is received by Domain 2\'s IS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the IS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 2\'s IS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable Home KMSs intersected
with the initiator list from the original KRR (ANY âˆ© [A,C] = [A,C]). The
receiver list is copied from the original KRR [X,Z]. The new KRR is sent on
towards the initiator.
4c. The KRR is received by Domain 1\'s CS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the CS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 1\'s CS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable Home KMSs intersected
with the initiator list from the original KRR ([A,C] âˆ© [B,C]= [C]). The
receiver list is copied from the original KRR [X,Z]. The new KRR is sent on
towards the initiator.
5\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list and uses
KMS \'C\' as IDRkmsi as this is a Secondary Home KMS. The initiator extracts
the receiver list [X,Z] and uses KMS \'X\' as as this is the first External
KMS for the initiator in the list. The initiator sends this MIKEY message
[C,X] towards the receiver.
6a. The MIKEY message is acceptable to Domain 1\'s CS Proxy (initiator ok),
Domain 2\'s IS Proxy (Domain 2 user\'s IDRkms \'C\' is acceptable) and Domain
3\'s IS Proxy (Domain 3 user\'s IDRkms \'X\' is acceptable). The message is
received by Domain 4\'s CS Proxy. It does not check IDRkmsi. IDRkmsr (A) is
not supported in this domain. Correspondingly, the CS Proxy produces a KRR.
The CS Proxy populates the initiator list with \'ANY\'. The CS Proxy populates
the receiver list with the acceptable Home KMSs in the domain, in this case
[Y,Z]. The KRR is sent on towards the initiator.
6b. The KRR is received by Domain 3\'s IS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the IS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 3\'s IS
Proxy populates the receiver list with the acceptable Home KMSs intersected
with the receiver list from the original KRR ([Y,Z] âˆ© [X,Z] = [Z]). The
initiator list is copied from the original KRR (\'ANY\'). The new KRR is sent
on towards the initiator.
6c. The KRR is received by Domain 2\'s IS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the IS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 2\'s IS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable Home KMSs intersected
with the initiator list from the original KRR (ANY âˆ© [A,D] = [A,D]). The
receiver list is copied from the original KRR [Z]. The new KRR is sent on
towards the initiator.
6d. The KRR is received by Domain 1\'s CS Proxy. The contents of the KRR do
not adhere to policy and hence the CS Proxy creates a new KRR. Domain 1\'s CS
Proxy populates the initiator list with the acceptable Home KMSs intersected
with the initiator list from the original KRR ([A,C] âˆ© [B,C]= [C]). The
receiver list is copied from the original KRR [Z]. The new KRR is sent on
towards the initiator.
7\. The initiator receives the KRR and extracts the initiator list (C) and
uses KMS \'C\' as this is a Secondary Home KMS. The initiator extracts the
receiver list and uses KMS \'Z\' as this is an External KMS for the initiator.
A new MIKEY message is sent with these values and is successfully received.
## A.11 Use Case 11: Malicous KMS Redirect Response
### A.11.1 Description of Use Case
In this use case, the following assumptions are made:
\- initiating MC client uses KMS A as its Home KMS.
\- initiating MC client does not know the KMS used by the receiving MC client.
\- MC Domains do not enforce any KMS policy.
\- a malicious responder provides the malicious/compromised KMS 'Z\' in the
response. This is not the KMS used by the intended receipient.
### A.11.2 Example information flow
An information flow in this use case is shown in Figure A.11.2-1.
Figure A.11.2-1: Example Information Flow for KMS Discovery Failure
1\. A MIKEY message is sent from the initiating MC Client (I) to the receiving
MC Client (R). As the Initiator has no other information, the client uses its
Home KMS in the IDRkmsi and IDRkmsr to protect the key (A).
2\. A malicious responder receives the MIKEY message. The malicious responder
wishes the initiator to use KMS Z, as it is a malicious or compromised KMS.
Correspondingly, the receiver produces a KRR with this KMS in the receiver
list (Z).
3\. The initiator extracts the initiator list. KMS \'A\' is the Home KMS and
hence this is acceptable. KMS \'Z\' is not a provisioned External KMS. Hence,
the initiator is unable to communicate with the receiver and the communication
fails. No new MIKEY message is sent and the initiator\'s communication is not
compromised.
4\. The initiator reports the KRR to the Home KMS upon next connection. The
Home KMS is able to detect the malicious KRR and produce a security alert.
