# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1], in TS 33.102 [4] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if
any, in TR 21.905 [1].
**Access Security Management Entity:** entity which receives the top-level
keys in an access network from the HSS. For E-UTRAN access networks, the role
of the ASME is assumed by the MME
**Activation of security context** : the process of taking into use a security
context.
**Authentication data:** Data that is part of a security context or of
authentication vectors.
**Chaining of K~eNB~:** derivation of a new K~eNB~ from another K~eNB~ (i.e.,
at cell handover)
**Current EPS security context:** The security context which has been
activated most recently. Note that a current EPS security context originating
from either a mapped or native EPS security context may exist simultaneously
with a native non-current EPS security context.
**ECM-CONNECTED state:** This is as defined in TS 23.401 [2]. The term ECM-
CONNECTED state corresponds to the term EMM-CONNECTED mode used in TS 24.301
[9].
**ECM-IDLE state:** As defined in TS 23.401 [2]. The term ECM-IDLE state
corresponds to the term EMM-IDLE mode used in TS 24.301 [9].
**EPS-Authentication Vector:** K~ASME,~ RAND, AUTN, XRES
**EPS security context:** A state that is established locally at the UE and a
serving network domain. At both ends \"EPS security context data\" is stored,
that consists of the EPS NAS security context, and the EPS AS security
context.
NOTE 1: An EPS security context has type \"mapped\", \"full native\" or
\"partial native\". Its state can either be \"current\" or \"non-current\". A
context can be of one type only and be in one state at a time. The state of a
particular context type can change over time. A partial native context can be
transformed into a full native. No other type transformations are possible.
**EPS AS security context** : the cryptographic keys at AS level with their
identifiers, the Next Hop parameter NH, the Next Hop Chaining Counter
parameter NCC used for next hop access key derivation, the identifiers of the
selected AS level cryptographic algorithms, counters used for replay
protection and SCG Counter used as freshness input into S-K~eNB~ derivations.
Note that the EPS AS security context only exists when cryptographically
protected radio bearers are established and is otherwise void.
NOTE 2: NH and NCC need to be stored also at the MME during connected mode.
**EPS AS Secondary Cell security context** : This context consists of the
cryptographic keys for SeNB (K~UPenc~), the identifier of the selected AS SC
level cryptographic algorithm and counters used for replay protection.
**EPS NAS security context:** This context consists of K~ASME~ with the
associated key set identifier, the UE security capabilities, and the uplink
and downlink NAS COUNT values. In particular, separate pairs of NAS COUNT
values are used for each EPS NAS security contexts, respectively. The
distinction between native and mapped EPS security contexts also applies to
EPS NAS security contexts. The EPS NAS security context is called \"**full**
\" if it additionally contains the keys K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~ and the
identifiers of the selected NAS integrity and encryption algorithms.
**Full native EPS security context:** A native EPS security context for which
the EPS NAS security context is full according to the above definition. A full
native EPS security context is either in state \"current\" or state \"non-
current\".
**Forward security: In the context of K~eNB~ key derivation, forward security
refers to** the property that, for an eNB with knowledge of a K~eNB,~ shared
with a UE, it shall be computationally infeasible to predict any future
K~eNB,~ that will be used between the same UE and another eNB. More
specifically, n hop forward security refers to the property that an eNB is
unable to compute keys that will be used between a UE and another eNB to which
the UE is connected after n or more handovers (n=1 or 2).
**Legacy security context:** A security context which has been established
according to TS 33.102 [4].
**Mapped security context:** Security context created by converting the
current security context in the source system to a security context for the
target system in inter-system mobility, e.g., UMTS keys created from EPS keys.
The EPS NAS security context of a mapped security context is full and current.
**Native EPS security context:** An EPS security context whose K~ASME~ was
created by a run of EPS AKA.
**Non-current EPS security context** : A native EPS security context that is
not the current one. A non-current EPS security context may be stored along
with a current EPS security context in the UE and the MME. A non-current EPS
security context does not contain an EPS AS security context. A non-current
EPS security context is either of type \"full native\" or of type \"partial
native\".
**Partial native EPS security context** : A partial native EPS security
context consists of K~ASME~ with the associated key set identifier, the UE
security capabilities, and the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values, which are
initially set to zero before the first NAS SMC procedure for this security
context. A partial native EPS security context is created by an EPS AKA, for
which no corresponding successful NAS SMC has been run. A partial native
context is always in state \"non-current\".
**Re-derivation of NAS keys:** derivation of new NAS keys from the same
K~ASME~ but including different algorithms (and no freshness parameter)
**Refresh of K~eNB~:** derivation of a new K~eNB~ from the same K~ASME~ and
including a freshness parameter
**Re-keying of K~eNB~:** derivation of a new K~eNB~ from a new K~ASME~ in ECM-
CONNECTED (i.e., . to activate a partial native EPS security context, or to
re-activate a non-current full EPS security context)
**Re-keying of NAS keys:** derivation of new NAS keys from a new K~ASME~
**UE security capabilities:** The set of identifiers corresponding to the
ciphering and integrity algorithms implemented in the UE. This includes
capabilities for EPS AS and NAS, and includes capabilities for UTRAN and GERAN
if these access types are supported by the UE.
**UE EPS security capabilities:** The UE security capabilities for EPS AS and
NAS.
**User plane** : Within the context of TS 33.401, this means the data path
between UE and Serving Gateway that does NOT go via the MME.
**(User) Data via MME** : User Data sent to or from the UE that uses an RRC
connection established using the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation specified
in TS 23.401[2].
**IOPS-capable eNB** : an eNB that has the capability of IOPS mode operation,
which provides local IP connectivity and Public Safety services to IOPS-
enabled UEs via a Local EPC when the eNB has lost backhaul to the Macro EPC or
it has no backhaul to the Macro EPC.
**IOPS network** : an IOPS network consists of one or more eNBs operating in
IOPS mode and connected to a Local EPC.
**Local EPC** : a Local EPC is an entity which provides functionality that
eNBs in IOPS mode of operation use, instead of the Macro EPC, in order to
support Public Safety services**.**
**Macro EPC** : the EPC which serves an eNB when it is not in IOPS mode of
operation.
**Nomadic EPS** : a deployable system which has the capability to provide
radio access (via deployable IOPS-capable eNB(s)), local IP connectivity and
Public Safety services to IOPS-enabled UEs in the absence of normal
EPS.**IOPS-enabled UE:** is an UE that is configured to use networks operating
in IOPS mode.

## 3.4 Conventions
All data variables in the present document are presented with the most
significant substring on the left hand side and the least significant
substring on the right hand side. A substring may be a bit, byte or other
arbitrary length bitstring. Where a variable is broken down into a number of
substrings, the leftmost (most significant) substring is numbered 0, the next
most significant is numbered 1, and so on through to the least significant.
# 4 Overview of Security Architecture
Figure 4-1 gives an overview of the complete security architecture.
Figure 4-1: Overview of the security architecture
Five security feature groups are defined. Each of these feature groups meets
certain threats and accomplishes certain security objectives:
**\- Network access security (I):** the set of security features that provide
users with secure access to services, and which in particular protect against
attacks on the (radio) access link.
**\- Network domain security (II):** the set of security features that enable
nodes to securely exchange signalling data, user data (between AN and SN and
within AN), and protect against attacks on the wireline network.
**\- User domain security (III):** the set of security features that secure
access to mobile stations.
**\- Application domain security (IV):** the set of security features that
enable applications in the user and in the provider domain to securely
exchange messages.
**\- Visibility and configurability of security (V):** the set of features
that enables the user to inform himself whether a security feature is in
operation or not and whether the use and provision of services should depend
on the security feature.
NOTE 1: Relay nodes are not explicitly shown in Figure 4-1. They combine the
functionalities of ME and AN in a way described in 3GPP TS 36.300 [30]. The
present document describes how to apply security features to relay nodes.
NOTE 2: There is an option for some uplink and downlink user data to be sent
via the MME. This is referred to as \"data via MME\" and within the context of
TS 33.401 the abbreviation NASDVM is used.
# 5 Security Features
## 5.1 User-to-Network security
### 5.1.0 General
The statements relating to eNBs in clause 5.1 apply also to RNs regarding the
security between a UE and a relay node.
The statements relating to UEs in clause 5.1 apply also to RNs regarding the
security between a relay node and a Donor eNB and between a relay node and its
MME unless stated otherwise.
### 5.1.1 User identity and device confidentiality
User identity confidentiality is as defined by TS 33.102 [4] subclause 5.1.1
From subscriber\'s privacy point of view, the MSIN, the IMEI, and the IMEISV
should be confidentiality protected.
The UE shall provide its equipment identifier IMEI or IMEISV to the network,
if the network asks for it in an integrity-protected request.
The IMEI and IMEISV shall be securely stored in the terminal.
The UE shall not send IMEI or IMEISV to the network on a network request
before the NAS security has been activated.
NOTE 1: When the UE has no IMSI, no valid GUTI, or no valid P-TMSI during
emergency attach, the IMEI is included before the NAS security has been
activated.
The IMEI or IMEISV shall be sent in the NAS protocol.
NOTE 2: In some cases, e.g., the very first attach procedure, MSIN has to be
sent to network in cleartext. When NAS confidentiality protection is beyond an
operator option, IMEI and IMEISV can not be confidentiality protected.
### 5.1.2 Entity authentication
Entity authentication is as defined by TS 33.102 [4] subclause 5.1.2
### 5.1.3 User data and signalling data confidentiality
#### 5.1.3.1 Ciphering requirements
Ciphering may be provided to RRC-signalling to prevent UE tracking based on
cell level measurement reports, handover message mapping, or cell level
identity chaining. RRC signalling confidentiality is an operator option.
All S1 and X2 messages carried between RN and DeNB shall be confidentiality-
protected.
NOTE 0: Encryption is subject to national regulation.
Synchronization of the input parameters for ciphering shall be ensured for the
protocols involved in the ciphering.
The NAS signalling may be confidentiality protected. NAS signalling
confidentiality is an operator option.
NOTE 1: RRC and NAS signalling confidentiality protection is recommended to be
used.
When authentication of the credentials on the UICC during Emergency Calling in
Limited Service Mode, as defined in the TS 23.401 [2], can not be successfully
performed, the confidentiality protection of the RRC and NAS signaling, and
user plane shall be omitted (see clause 15). This shall be accomplished by the
network by selecting EEA0 for confidentiality protection of NAS, RRC and user
plane.
User plane confidentiality protection over the access stratum shall be done at
PDCP layer and is an operator option.
NOTE 2: User plane confidentiality protection is recommended to be used.
NOTE 3: Confidentiality protection for RRC and UP is applied at the PDCP
layer, and no layers below PDCP are confidentiality protected. Confidentiality
protection for NAS is provided by the NAS protocol.
User data sent via MME may be confidentiality protected
NOTE 4: Confidentiality protection of user data sent via MME is recommended to
be used.
#### 5.1.3.2 Algorithm Identifier Values
All algorithms specified in this subclause are algorithms with a 128-bit input
key except Null ciphering algorithm.
NOTE: Deviations from the above requirement have to be indicated explicitly in
the algorithm identifier list below.
Each EPS Encryption Algorithm (EEA) will be assigned a 4-bit identifier.
Currently, the following values have been defined for NAS, RRC and UP
ciphering:
\"0000~2~\" EEA0 Null ciphering algorithm
\"0001~2~\" 128-EEA1 SNOW 3G based algorithm
\"0010~2~\" 128-EEA2 AES based algorithm
\"0011~2~\" 128-EEA3 ZUC based algorithm
The remaining values have been reserved for future use.
UEs and eNBs shall implement EEA0, 128-EEA1 and 128-EEA2 for both RRC
signalling ciphering and UP ciphering. UEs and eNBs may implement 128-EEA3 for
both RRC signalling ciphering and UP ciphering.
UEs and MMEs shall implement EEA0, 128-EEA1 and 128-EEA2 for NAS signalling
ciphering. UEs and MMEs may implement 128-EEA3 for NAS signalling ciphering.
### 5.1.4 User data and signalling data integrity
#### 5.1.4.1 Integrity requirements
Synchronization of the input parameters for integrity protection shall be
ensured for the protocols involved in the integrity protection.
Integrity protection, and replay protection, shall be provided to NAS and RRC-
signalling.
All NAS signaling messages except those explicitly listed in TS 24.301 [9] as
exceptions shall be integrity-protected. All RRC signaling messages except
those explicitly listed in TS 36.331 [21] as exceptions shall be integrity-
protected.
When authentication of the credentials on the UICC during Emergency Calling in
Limited Service Mode, as defined in the TS 23.401 [2], can not be successfully
performed, the integrity and replay protection of the RRC and NAS signaling
shall be omitted (see clause 15). This shall be accomplished by the network by
selecting EIA0 for integrity protection of NAS and RRC. EIA0 shall only be
used for unauthenticated emergency calls.
User plane packets between the eNB and the UE shall not be integrity protected
on the Uu interface. User plane packets between the RN and the UE shall not be
integrity protected. All user plane packets carrying S1 and X2 messages
between RN and DeNB shall be integrity-protected. Integrity protection for all
other user plane packets between RN and DeNB may be supported.
All user data packets sent via the MME shall be integrity protected.
#### 5.1.4.2 Algorithm Identifier Values
All algorithms specified in this subclause are algorithms with a 128-bit input
key.
NOTE: Deviations from the above requirement have to be indicated explicitly in
the algorithm identifier list below.
Each EPS Integrity Algorithm (EIA) will be assigned a 4-bit identifier.
Currently, the following values have been defined:
\"0000~2~\" EIA0 Null Integrity Protection algorithm
\"0001~2~\" 128-EIA1 SNOW 3G based algorithm
\"0010~2~\" 128-EIA2 AES based algorithm
\"0011~2~\" 128-EIA3 ZUC based algorithm
The remaining values have been reserved for future use.
UEs and eNBs shall implement 128-EIA1 and 128-EIA2 for RRC signalling
integrity protection. UEs and eNBs may implement 128-EIA3 for RRC signalling
integrity protection.
UEs and MMEs shall implement 128-EIA1 and 128-EIA2 for NAS signalling
integrity protection. UEs and MMEs may implement 128-EIA3 for NAS signalling
integrity protection.
UEs shall implement EIA0 for integrity protection of NAS and RRC signalling.
As specified in clause 5.1.4.1 of this specification, EIA0 is only allowed for
unauthenticated emergency calls. EIA0 shall not be used for integrity
protection between RN and DeNB.
Implementation of EIA0 in MMEs, RNs and eNBs is optional, EIA0, if
implemented, shall be disabled in MMEs, RNs and eNBs in the deployments where
support of unauthenticated emergency calling is not a regulatory requirement.
## 5.2 Security visibility and configurability
Although in general the security features should be transparent to the user,
for certain events and according to the user\'s concern, greater user
visibility of the operation of following security feature shall be provided:
\- indication of access network encryption: the property that the user is
informed whether the confidentiality of user data is protected on the radio
access link, in particular when non-ciphered calls are set-up;
The ciphering indicator feature is specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [23].
Configurability is the property that the user can configure whether the use or
the provision of a service should depend on whether a security feature is in
operation. A service can only be used if all security features, which are
relevant to that service and which are required by the configurations of the
user, are in operation. The following configurability features are suggested:
> \- enabling/disabling user-USIM authentication: the user should be able to
> control the operation of user-USIM authentication, e.g., for some events,
> services or use.
## 5.3 Security requirements on eNodeB
### 5.3.1 General
The security requirements given in this section apply to all types of eNodeBs.
More stringent requirements for specific types of eNodeBs may be defined in
other 3GPP specifications.
### 5.3.2 Requirements for eNB setup and configuration
Setting up and configuring eNBs shall be authenticated and authorized so that
attackers shall not be able to modify the eNB settings and software
configurations via local or remote access.
1\. The support of security associations is required between the Evolved
Packet Core (EPC) and the eNB and between adjacent eNBs, connected via X2.
These security association establishments shall be mutually authenticated and
used for user and control plane communication between the entities. However,
in cases when a DeNB acts as proxy for control or user plane messages to and
from a RN, hop-by-hop security associations shall be used for user and control
plane. The security associations shall be realized according to clauses 11 and
12 of the present document except for the Un interface between RN and DeNB.
The decision on whether or not to use the certificate enrolment mechanism
specified in TS 33.310 [6] for eNB is left to operators.
2\. Communication between the O&M systems and the eNB shall be
confidentiality, integrity and replay protected from unauthorized parties. The
support of security associations is required between the eNB and an entity in
the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) or in an O&M domain trusted by the operator.
These security association establishments shall be mutually authenticated. The
security associations shall be realized according to clause 13 for eNBs and
clause D.2.5 for RNs.
3\. The eNB shall be able to ensure that software/data change attempts are
authorized
4\. The eNB shall use authorized data/software.
5\. Sensitive parts of the boot-up process shall be executed with the help of
the secure environment.
6\. Confidentiality of software transfer towards the eNB shall be ensured.
7\. Integrity protection of software transfer towards the eNB shall be
ensured.
### 5.3.3 Requirements for key management inside eNB
TheEPC provides subscriber specific session keying material for the eNBs,
which also hold long term keys used for authentication and security
association setup purposes. Protecting all these keys is important.
1\. Keys stored inside eNBs shall never leave a secure environment within the
eNB except when done in accordance with this or other 3GPP specifications.
### 5.3.4 Requirements for handling User plane data for the eNB
It is eNB\'s task to cipher and decipher user plane packets between the Uu
reference point and the S1/X2 reference points and to handle integrity
protection for user plane packets for the S1/X2 reference points.
1\. User plane data ciphering/deciphering and integrity handling shall take
place inside the secure environment where the related keys are stored.
2\. The transport of user data over S1-U and X2-U shall be integrity,
confidentially and replay-protected from unauthorized parties. If this is to
be accomplished by cryptographic means, clause 12 shall be applied except for
the Un interface between RN and DeNB.
NOTE: The use of cryptographic protection on S1-U and X2-U is an operator\'s
decision. In case the eNB has been placed in a physically secured environment
then the \'secure environment\' may include other nodes and links beside the
eNB.
### 5.3.4a Requirements for handling Control plane data for the eNB
It is eNB\'s task to provide confidentiality and integrity protection for
control plane packets on the S1/X2 reference points.
1\. Control plane data ciphering/deciphering and integrity handling shall take
place inside the secure environment where the related keys are stored.
2\. The transport of control plane data over S1-MME and X2-C shall be
integrity-, confidentiality- and replay-protected from unauthorized parties.
If this is to be accomplished by cryptographic means, clause 11 shall be
applied except for the Un interface between RN and DeNB.
NOTE: The use of cryptographic protection on S1-MME and X2-C is an operator\'s
decision. In case the eNB has been placed in a physically secured environment
then the \'secure environment\' may include other nodes and links beside the
eNB.
### 5.3.5 Requirements for secure environment of the eNB
The secure environment is logically defined within the eNB and is a
composition of functions for the support of sensitive operations.
1\. The secure environment shall support secure storage of sensitive data,
e.g. long term cryptographic secrets and vital configuration data.
2\. The secure environment shall support the execution of sensitive functions,
e.g. en-/decryption of user data and the basic steps within protocols which
use long term secrets (e.g. in authentication protocols).
3\. Sensitive data used within the secure environment shall not be exposed to
external entities.
4\. The secure environment shall support the execution of sensitive parts of
the boot process.
5\. The secure environment\'s integrity shall be assured.
6\. Only authorised access shall be granted to the secure environment, i.e. to
data stored and used within, and to functions executed within.

# 6 Security Procedures between UE and EPC Network Elements
## 6.0 General
The statements relating to eNBs in clause 6 apply also to RNs regarding the
security between a UE and a relay node.
The statements relating to UEs and MEs in clause 6 apply also to RNs regarding
the security between a relay node and a Donor eNB and between a relay node and
its MME unless stated otherwise.
## 6.1 Authentication and key agreement
### 6.1.1 AKA procedure
NOTE 1: Authentication data in this subclause stands for EPS Authentication
vector(s).
EPS AKA is the authentication and key agreement procedure that shall be used
over E-UTRAN.
A Rel-99 or later USIM application on a UICC shall be sufficient for accessing
E-UTRAN, provided the USIM application does not make use of the separation bit
of the AMF in a way described in TS 33.102 [4] Annex F. Access to E-UTRAN with
a 2G SIM or a SIM application on a UICC shall not be granted.
An ME that has E-UTRAN radio capability shall support the USIM-ME interface as
specified in TS 31.102 [13]
EPS AKA shall produce keying material forming a basis for user plane (UP),
RRC, and NAS ciphering keys as well as RRC and NAS integrity protection keys.
NOTE 2: Key derivation requirements of AS and NAS keys can be found in
subclause 7.2.1.
The MME sends to the USIM via ME the random challenge RAND and an
authentication token AUTN for network authentication from the selected
authentication vector. It also includes a KSI~ASME~ for the ME which will be
used to identify the K~ASME~ (and further keys derived from the K~ASME~) that
results from the EPS AKA procedure.
At receipt of this message, the USIM shall verify the freshness of the
authentication vector by checking whether AUTN can be accepted as described in
TS 33.102[4]. If so, the USIM computes a response RES. USIM shall compute CK
and IK which are sent to the ME. If the USIM computes a Kc (i.e. GPRS Kc) from
CK and IK using conversion function c3 as described in TS 33.102 [4], and
sends it to the ME, then the ME shall ignore such GPRS Kc and not store the
GPRS Kc on USIM or in ME. If the verification fails, the USIM indicates to the
ME the reason for failure and in the case of a synchronisation failure passes
the AUTS parameter (see TS 33.102 [4]).
An ME accessing E-UTRAN shall check during authentication that the
\"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 1. The \"separation
bit\" is bit 0 of the AMF field of AUTN.
NOTE 3: This separation bit in the AMF can not be used anymore for operator
specific purposes as described by TS 33.102 [4], Annex F.
NOTE 4: If the keys CK, IK resulting from an EPS AKA run were stored in the
fields already available on the USIM for storing keys CK and IK this could
lead to overwriting keys resulting from an earlier run of UMTS AKA. This would
lead to problems when EPS security context and UMTS security context were held
simultaneously (as is the case when security context is stored e.g. for the
purposes of Idle Mode Signaling Reduction). Therefore, \"plastic roaming\"
where a UICC is inserted into another ME will necessitate an EPS AKA
authentication run if the USIM does not support EMM parameters storage.
UE shall respond with User authentication response message including RES in
case of successful AUTN verification and successful AMF verification as
described above. In this case the ME shall compute K~ASME~ from CK, IK, and
serving network\'s identity (SN id) using the KDF as specified in clause A.2.
SN id binding implicitly authenticates the serving network\'s identity when
the derived keys from K~ASME~ are successfully used.
NOTE 5: This does not preclude a USIM (see TS 31.102 [13]) in later releases
having the capability of deriving K~ASME~.
Otherwise UE shall send an authentication failure message with a CAUSE value
indicating the reason for failure. In case of a synchronisation failure of
AUTN (as described in TS 33.102 [4]), the UE also includes AUTS that was
provided by the USIM. Upon receipt of an authentication failure message, the
MME may initiate further identity requests and authentications towards the UE.
(see TS 24.301 [9]).
The MME checks that the RES equals XRES. If so the authentication is
successful. If not, depending on type of identity used by the UE in the
initial NAS message, the MME may initiate further identity requests or send an
authentication reject message towards the UE (see TS 24.301 [9]).
Figure 6.1.1-1 describes EPS AKA procedure, which is based on UMTS AKA (see TS
33.102[4]). The following keys are shared between UE and HSS:
  * **K** is the permanent key stored on the USIM on a UICC and in the Authentication Centre AuC.
  * **CK, IK** is the pair of keys derived in the AuC and on the USIM during an AKA run. CK, IK shall be handled differently depending on whether they are used in an EPS security context or a legacy security context, as described in subclause 6.1.2.
As a result of the authentication and key agreement, an intermediate key
**K~ASME~** shall be shared between UE and MME i.e. the ASME for EPS.
Figure 6.1.1-1: Successful EPS AKA authentication
### 6.1.2 Distribution of authentication data from HSS to serving network
NOTE 1: Authentication data in this subclause stands for EPS Authentication
vector(s).
The purpose of this procedure is to provide the MME with one or more EPS
authentication vectors (RAND, AUTN, XRES, K~ASME~) from the user\'s HE (HSS)
to perform user authentication. Each EPS authentication vector can be used to
authenticate the UE.
_NOTE 2: It is recommended that the MME fetch only one_ EPS authentication
vector at a time as the need to perform AKA runs has been reduced in EPS
through the use of a more elaborate key hierarchy. In particular, service
requests can be authenticated using a stored K~ASME~ without the need to
perform AKA. Furthermore, the sequence number management schemes in TS 33.102,
Annex C [4], designed to avoid re-synchronisation problems caused by
interleaving use of batches of authentication vectors, are only optional. Re-
synchronisation problems in EPS can be avoided, independently of the sequence
number management scheme, by immediately using an authentication vector
retrieved from the HSS in an authentication procedure between UE and MME.
Figure 6.1.2-1: Distribution of authentication data from HE to MME
An EPS authentication vector is derived from the authentication vector defined
in TS 33.102 [4] clause 6.3.2. To derive the key K~ASME~ in the HE, the KDF as
specified in clause A.2 is used which shall contain following mandatory input
parameters: CK, IK and SN identity.
If the Network Type equals E-UTRAN then the \"separation bit\" in the AMF
field of AUTN shall be set to 1 to indicate to the UE that the authentication
vector is only usable for AKA in an EPS context, if the \"separation bit\" is
set to 0, the vector is usable in a non-EPS context only (e.g. GSM, UMTS). For
authentication vectors with the \"separation bit\" set to 1, the secret keys
CK and IK generated during AKA shall never leave the HSS.
The MME invokes the procedures by requesting authentication vectors from the
HE (Home environment).
The _authentication data request_ shall include the IMSI, the Serving Network
identity i.e. MCC + MNC, and the Network Type (i.e. E-UTRAN). In the case of a
synchronisation failure, the MME shall also include RAND and AUTS. In this
case the HE checks the AUTS parameter before sending new authentication
vectors to the MME (see TS 33.102 [4]).
Upon the receipt of the _authentication data request_ from the MME, the HE may
have pre-computed the required number of EPS authentication vectors and
retrieve them from the HSS database or may compute them on demand.
NOTE 3: For K~ASME~ the possibilities for pre-computation are restricted due
to the PLMN-binding.
NOTE 4: The HSS needs to ensure that the MME requesting the authentication
data is entitled to use the SN id used to calculate K~ASME~. The exact details
of how to achieve this are not covered in this specification.
The HE sends an authentication response back to the MME that contains the
requested information. If multiple EPS authentication vectors had been
requested then they are ordered based on their sequence numbers. The MME shall
be aware of the order of the EPS authentication vectors and shall use that the
EPS authentication vectors in order.
### 6.1.3 User identification by a permanent identity
The user identification mechanism should be invoked by the serving network
whenever the user cannot be identified by means of a temporary identity
(GUTI). In particular, it should be used when the serving network cannot
retrieve the IMSI based on the GUTI by which the user identifies itself on the
radio path.
The mechanism described in figure 6.1.3-1 allows the identification of a user
on the radio path by means of the permanent subscriber identity (IMSI).
Figure 6.1.3-1: User identity query
The mechanism is initiated by the MME that requests the user to send its
permanent identity. The user\'s response contains the IMSI in cleartext. This
represents a breach in the provision of user identity confidentiality.
### 6.1.4 Distribution of IMSI and authentication data within one serving
network domain
NOTE 1: Authentication data in this subclause stands for EPS security contexts
and EPS authentication vector(s).
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a newly visited MME with
authentication data from a previously visited MME within the same serving
network domain.
NOTE 2: The following procedure in this clause is based on TAU procedure and
it can also be applied for Attach procedure where all the corresponding texts
for \"TAU\" in the following procedure should be replaced with \"Attach\".
The procedure is shown in Figure 6.1.4-1
Figure 6.1.4-1: Distribution of IMSI and authentication data within one
serving domain
The procedure shall be invoked by the newly visited MMEn after the receipt of
a Tracking Area update request from the user wherein the user is identified by
means of a temporary user identity GUTIo and the Tracking area identity TAIo
under the jurisdiction of a previously visited MMEo that belongs to the same
serving network domain as the newly visited MMEn.
The protocol steps are as follows:
a) The MMEn sends a message to the MMEo, this message contains GUTIo and the
received TAU message.
b) The MMEo searches the user data in the database and checks the integrity
protection on the TAU message.
If the user is found and the integrity check succeeds, the MMEo shall send a
response back that:
i) shall include the IMSI,
ii) may include a number of unused EPS-authentication vectors ordered on a
first-in / first-out basis, and
iii) may include any EPS security contexts it holds
The MMEo subsequently deletes the EPS-authentication vectors and any EPS
security contexts which have been sent.
If the user cannot be identified or the integrity check fails, then the MMEo
shall send a response indicating that the user identity cannot be retrieved.
c) If the MMEn receives a response with an IMSI, it creates an entry and
stores any EPS‑authentication vectors and any EPS security context that may be
included.
If the MMEn receives a response indicating that the user could not be
identified, it shall initiate the user identification procedure described in
clause 6.1.3 [ ]{.underline} during the Initial E-UTRAN Attach procedure, or
it shall reject the TAU Request message initiated by UE during the TAU
procedure (see clause 4.4.4.3 in TS24.301[9]).
The same procedure does not apply to distribution of EPS authentication data
between MME and SGSN in the same serving network domain, i.e. EPS
authentication data shall not be forwarded from an MME towards an SGSN.
NOTE 3: This is due to the fact that EPS authentication data does not contain
CK and IK and, hence, is not useful for the SGSN.
### 6.1.5 Distribution of IMSI and authentication data between different
serving network domains
NOTE 1: Authentication data in this subclause stands for EPS security contexts
and EPS authentication vector(s).
In general, the distribution of IMSI and authentication data between MMEs
belonging to different serving network domains of shall be performed as
described for the distribution of IMSI and authentication data within the same
service network domain in subclause 6.1.4. In particular, the current EPS
security context data may be transferred between MMEs belonging to different
serving network domains. However, there is the following restriction:
\- Unused EPS authentication vectors, or non-current EPS security contexts,
shall not be distributed between MMEs belonging to different serving domains
(PLMNs).
The same procedure does not apply to distribution of EPS authentication data
between MME and SGSN in different serving network domains, i.e. EPS
authentication data shall not be forwarded from an MME towards an SGSN.
NOTE 2: This is due to the fact that EPS authentication data does not contain
CK and IK and, hence, is not useful for the SGSN.
### 6.1.6 Distribution of IMSI and UMTS authentication vectors between MMEs or
between MME and SGSN
This subclause applies to both distribution of UMTS authentication vectors
within one serving network domain and distribution of UMTS authentication
vectors between different serving network domains. The following rules apply
to the distribution of UMTS authentication vectors between two MMEs, and
between an SGSN and an MME:
a) MME to MME
> UMTS authentication vectors that were previously received from an SGSN shall
> not be forwarded between MME\'s.
b) SGSN to MME
> An SGSN may forward unused UMTS authentication vectors to an MME. only if
> MME and SGSN are in the same serving network domain.
c) MME to SGSN
> UMTS AVs which were previously stored in the MME may be forwarded back
> towards the same SGSN.
>
> UMTS AVs which were previously stored in the MME shall not be forwarded
> towards other SGSNs.
## 6.2 EPS key hierarchy
Requirements on EPC and E-UTRAN related to keys:
a) The EPC and E-UTRAN shall allow for use of encryption and integrity
protection algorithms for AS and NAS protection having keys of length 128 bits
and for future use the network interfaces shall be prepared to support 256 bit
keys.
b) The keys used for UP, NAS and AS protection shall be dependent on the
algorithm with which they are used.
Figure 6.2-1: Key hierarchy in E-UTRAN
The key hierarchy (see Figure 6.2-1) includes following keys: **K~eNB,~
K~NASint,~ K~NASenc,~ K~UPenc,~ K~RRCint~** , **K~RRCenc~** and **K~UPint~**
**\- K~eNB~** is a key derived by ME and MME from K~ASME~ or by ME and target
eNB.
Keys for NAS traffic:
**\- K~NASint~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS
traffic with a particular integrity algorithm This key is derived by ME and
MME from K~ASME,~ as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm using
the KDF as specified in clause A.7.
**\- K~NASenc~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS
traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. This key is derived by ME and
MME from K~ASME,~ as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm using
the KDF as specified in clause A.7.
Keys for UP traffic:
**\- K~UPenc~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of UP
traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. This key is derived by ME and
eNB from K~eNB~, as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm using
the KDF as specified in clause A.7.
**\- K~UPint~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of UP
traffic between RN and DeNB with a particular integrity algorithm. This key is
derived by RN and DeNB from K~eNB~, as well as an identifier for the integrity
algorithm using the KDF as specified in clause A.7.
Keys for RRC traffic:
**\- K~RRCint\ ~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of
RRC traffic with a particular integrity algorithm. K~RRCint~ is derived by ME
and eNB from K~eNB~, as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm
using the KDF as specified in clause A.7.
**\- K~RRCenc\ ~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of
RRC traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. K~RRCenc~ is derived by ME
and eNB from K~eNB~ as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm
using the KDF as specified in clause A.7.
Intermediate keys:
**\- NH** is a key derived by ME and MME to provide forward security as
described in clause 7.2.8.
**\- K~eNB~*** is a key derived by ME and eNB when performing an horizontal or
vertical key derivation as specified in clause 7.2.8 using a KDF as specified
in clause A5.
Figure 6.2-2 shows the dependencies between the different keys, and how they
are derived from the network nodes point of view. Figure 6.2-3 shows the
corresponding relations and derivations as performed in the ME. Two dashed
inputs to a KDF means one of the inputs is used depending on the circumstances
of the key derivation.
NOTE: Figures 6.2-2 and 6.2-3 do not cover the derivations at IRAT mobility
(see clauses 9 and 10).
Figure 6.2-2: Key distribution and key derivation scheme for EPS (in
particular E-UTRAN) for network nodes.
Figure 6.2-3: Key derivation scheme for EPS (in particular E-UTRAN) for the
ME.
As the figures 6.2-2 and 6.2-3 show, the length of K~ASME~, K~eNB~ and NH is
256 bits, 256-bit NAS, UP and RRC keys are always derived from K~ASME~ and
K~eNB~ respectively. In case the encryption or integrity algorithm used to
protect NAS, UP or RRC requires a 128-bit key as input, the key is truncated
and the 128 least significant bits are used. Figures 6.2-2 and 6.2-3
illustrate the truncation to 128 bits keys.
The function Trunc takes as input a 256-bit string, and returns a truncated
output as defined in Annex A.7.
## 6.3 EPS key identification
The key K~ASME~ shall be identified by the key set identifier eKSI. eKSI may
be either of type KSI~ASME~ or of type KSI~SGSN~. An eKSI shall be stored in
the UE and the MME together with K~ASME~ and the temporary identifier GUTI, if
available.
NOTE 1: The GUTI points to the MME where the K~ASME~ is stored.
The key set identifier KSI~ASME~ is a parameter which is associated with the
K~ASME~ derived during EPS AKA authentication. The key set identifier
KSI~ASME~ is allocated by the MME and sent with the authentication request
message to the mobile station where it is stored together with the K~ASME~.
The purpose of the KSI~ASME~ is to make it possible for the UE and the MME to
identify a native K~ASME~ without invoking the authentication procedure. This
is used to allow re-use of the K~ASME~ during subsequent connection set-ups.
The key set identifier KSI~SGSN~ is a parameter which is associated with the
mapped K~ASME~ derived from UMTS keys during inter-RAT mobility, cf. clauses 9
and 10 of the present specification. The key set identifier KSI~SGSN~ is
generated in both the UE and the MME respectively when deriving the mapped
K~ASME~ during idle procedures in E-UTRAN and during handover from GERAN/UTRAN
to E-UTRAN. The KSI~SGSN~ is stored together with the mapped K~ASME~.
The purpose of the KSI~SGSN~ is to make it possible for the UE and the MME to
indicate the use of the mapped K~ASME~ in inter-RAT mobility procedures (for
details cf. clauses 9 and 10).
The format of eKSI shall allow a recipient of such a parameter to distinguish
whether the parameter is of type \'KSI~ASME~\' or of type \'KSI~SGSN~\'. The
format shall further contain a value field. KSI~ASME~ and KSI~SGSN~ have the
same format. The value fields of KSI~ASME~ and KSI~SGSN~ are three bits each.
Seven values are used to identify the key set. A value of \'111\' is used by
the UE to indicate that a valid K~ASME~ is not available for use. Format of
eKSI is described in [9].
The value \'111\' in the other direction from network to mobile station is
reserved.
NOTE 2: In addition to EPS security contexts, the UE may also cache UMTS
security contexts. These UMTS security contexts are identified by the KSI, as
defined in TS 33.102 [4].
## 6.4 Handling of EPS security contexts
Any EPS security context shall be deleted from the ME if:
a) the UICC is removed from the ME when the ME is in power on state;
b) the ME is powered up and the ME discovers that a UICC different from the
one which was used to create the EPS security context has been inserted to the
ME;
c) the ME is powered up and the ME discovers that no UICC has been inserted to
the ME.
K~ASME~ shall never be transferred from the EPC to an entity outside the EPC ,
with the exception of the following scenario(s):
\- interworking from EPS to 5G as described in clause 8.2 and 8.4 of TS 33.501
[43].
Both the ME and MME shall be capable of storing one non-current EPS security
context and one current EPS security context in volatile memory. In addition,
while connected to E-UTRAN the ME and MME shall be capable of storing in
volatile memory the NCC, NH and the related K~ASME~ used to compute keying
material for the current EPS AS security context.
Any successful run of an EPS AKA creates, by the definition in clause 3, a
partial native EPS security context. This context shall overwrite any existing
non-current EPS security context.
UE shall use its current EPS security context to protect the TAU Request or
Attach Request. However, there may be cases in which this EPS security context
is not the current one in the MME. In such cases, if the MME receives a TAU
Request or Attach Request protected with a non-current full EPS security
context, then this context becomes the current EPS security context and the
MME shall delete any existing current EPS security context.
After a successful run of a NAS SMC relating to the eKSI associated with an
EPS security context, this context becomes the current EPS security context
and shall overwrite any existing current EPS security context.
NOTE 1: The ME ensures that, whenever the native EPS NAS security context
stored on the USIM (if supported by USIM) or in non-volatile memory of the ME
is marked as valid during the process of changing state to EMM-DEREGISTERED,
it is consistent with the security context stored in the volatile memory of
the ME. This is described in clause 7.2.5.
The rules for handling security contexts after a handover to E-UTRAN are given
in clause 9.2.2.1.
The full native EPS NAS security context (except for K~NASenc~ and K~NASint~)
shall be stored on the USIM (if the USIM supports EMM parameters storage) or
in the non-volatile memory of the ME (if the USIM does not support EMM
parameters storage) only during the process of transitioning to EMM-
DEREGISTERED state or when an attempt to transition away from EMM-DEREGISTERED
state fails, as described in clause 7.2.5. The ME shall under no other
circumstances store the EPS NAS security context parameters on the USIM or
non-volatile ME memory.
NOTE 2: Only native EPS NAS security context is stored in the EMM parameters
file on the USIM or in non-volatile ME memory. A mapped EPS NAS security
context is never stored in these two places.
## 6.5 Handling of NAS COUNTs
Each separate K~ASME~ has a distinct pair of NAS COUNTs, one NAS COUNT for
uplink and one NAS COUNT for downlink, associated with it.
It is essential that the NAS COUNTs for a particular K~ASME~ are not reset to
the start values (that is the NAS COUNTs only have their start value when a
new K~ASME~ is created). This prevents the security issue of using the same
NAS COUNTs with the same NAS keys, e.g. key stream re-use, in the case a UE
moves back and forth between two MMEs and the same NAS keys are re-derived.
The NAS COUNTs shall only be set to the start value in the following cases:
\- for a partial native EPS NAS security context created by a successful AKA
run,
> NOTE: The NAS COUNTs are not actually needed at the UE for a native context
> until it has successfully received the first NAS Security Mode Command for
> that security context. The NAS COUNTs are not needed at the MME until it
> sends the first NAS Security Mode Command for that security context. Before
> the MME sends the first NAS Security Mode Command for a given partial native
> security context, the MME sets the NAS COUNTs for the security context to 0.
> After the NAS SMC message is sent for that partial native security context
> the NAS COUNTs for that partial native context are increased for each
> following sent NAS message as specified in TS 24.301.
\- or for an EPS NAS security context created through a context mapping during
a handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN,
\- or for an EPS NAS security context created through a context mapping during
idle mode mobility from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN.
The NAS COUNTs shall not be reset during idle mode mobility or handover for an
already existing native EPS NAS security context.
The start value of NAS COUNT shall be zero (0).
# 7 Security procedures between UE and EPS access network elements
## 7.0 General
The statements relating to eNBs in clause 7 apply also to RNs regarding the
security between a UE and a relay node.
The statements relating to UEs in clause 7 apply also to RNs regarding the
security between a relay node and a Donor eNB and between a relay node and its
MME unless stated otherwise.
## 7.1 Mechanism for user identity confidentiality
The MME shall allocate a GUTI to a UE in order to support the subscriber
identity confidentiality. The GUTI is defined in TS 23.003 [3].
S-TMSI, the shortened form of the GUTI, is used to support the subscriber
identity confidentiality with more efficient radio signalling procedures (e.g.
paging and Service Request). A new GUTI shall be sent to the UE only after a
successful activation of NAS security.
## 7.2 Handling of user-related keys in E-UTRAN
### 7.2.1 E-UTRAN key setting during AKA
Authentication and key setting are triggered by the authentication procedure.
Authentication and key setting may be initiated by the network as often as the
network operator wishes. Key setting can occur as soon as the identity of the
mobile subscriber (i.e. GUTI or IMSI) is known by the MME. A successful run of
AKA results in a new K~ASME~ that is stored in the UE and MME.
NAS keys, K~eNB~ and the RRC and UP keys are derived from K~ASME~ using the
KDFs specified in Annex A.
The NAS keys derived from the new K~ASME~ are taken in use in the MME and the
UE by means of the NAS security mode set-up procedure (see subclause 7.2.4.4).
The AS keys are taken into use with the AS security mode set-up procedure (see
subclause 7.2.4.5) or with the key change on the fly procedure (see subclause
7.2.9.2).
### 7.2.2 E-UTRAN key identification
Clause 6.3 of this specification states how the key K~ASME~ is identified,
namely by the key set identifier eKSI. Keys K~NASenc~ and K~NASint~ in the
E-UTRAN key hierarchy specified in clause 6.2, which are derived from K~ASME~,
can be uniquely identified by eKSI together with those parameters from the set
{algorithm distinguisher, algorithm identifier}, which are used to derive
these keys from K~ASME~ according to Annex A.
The initial K~eNB~ can be uniquely determined by the key set identifier, i.e.
eKSI, together with the uplink NAS COUNT are used to derive it. The
intermediate key NH as defined in clause 7 can be uniquely determined by the
key set identifier, i.e. eKSI, together with the initial K~eNB~ derived from
the current NAS security context for use during the ongoing CONNECTED state
and a counter counting how many NH-derivations have already been performed
from this initial K~eNB~.according to Annex A.4. The next hop chaining count,
NCC, represents the 3 least significant bits of this counter.
Intermediate key K~eNB~*, defined in clause 7, as well as keys non-initial
K~eNB~, K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~, K~UPint~, and K~UPenc~ in the E-UTRAN key
hierarchy specified in clause 6.2 can be uniquely identified by eKSI together
with those parameters from the set {Initial K~eNB~ or NH, algorithm
distinguisher, algorithm identifier, and sequence of PCIs and EARFCN-DLs used
in horizontal key derivations from the initial K~eNB~ or NH}, which are used
to derive these keys from K~ASME~ according to clause 7 and clause A.7.
It is specified in the remainder of clause 7, as well as in clause 9 and 10,
which of the above parameters need to be included in a security-relevant
message to allow the entity receiving the message to uniquely identify a
certain key.
### 7.2.3 E-UTRAN key lifetimes
All E-UTRAN keys are derived based on a K~ASME~. The key hierarchy which is
described in clause 6.2 does not allow direct update to RRC and UP keys, but
fresh RRC and UP keys are derived based on a fresh K~eNB,~ which is bound to
certain dynamic parameters (like PCI) or fresh key derivation parameter(s) in
state transitions (like NAS uplink COUNT). This results as fresh RRC and UP
keys in the eNB between inter-eNB handovers and state transitions (see
subclauses 7.2.6 to 7.2.8). The handling (creation, modification and update)
of the E-UTRAN keys in the various state transitions is described in clauses
7.2.5, 7.2.6, 7.2.7 and 7.2.8.
K~ASME~ shall be created only by running a successful AKA or by the inter-RAT
procedures towards E-UTRAN (cf clauses 9 and 10). In case the UE does not have
a valid K~ASME~, a KSI~ASME~ with value \"111\" shall be sent by the UE to the
network, which can initiate (re‑)authentication procedure to get a new K~ASME~
based on a successful AKA authentication.
### 7.2.4 Security mode command procedure and algorithm negotiation
#### 7.2.4.1 Requirements for algorithm selection
a) An active UE and a serving network shall agree upon algorithms for
\- RRC ciphering and RRC integrity protection (to be used between UE and eNB)
\- UP ciphering (to be used between UE and eNB)
\- NAS ciphering and NAS integrity protection (to be used between UE and MME)
An active RN and a network serving the RN shall additionally agree upon
algorithms for UP integrity.
b) The serving network shall select the algorithms to use dependent on
\- the UE security capabilities of the UE,
\- the configured allowed list of security capabilities of the currently
serving network entity
c) The same set of ciphering and integrity algorithms shall be supported by
the UE both for AS and NAS level.
d) Each selected algorithm shall be acknowledged to the UE in an integrity
protected way such that the UE is ensured that the algorithm selection was not
manipulated, i.e. that the UE security capabilities were not bidden down.
e) The UE security capabilities the ME sent to the network shall be repeated
in an integrity protected NAS level message to the ME such that \"bidding down
attacks\" against the UE\'s security capabilities can be detected by the ME.
The UE security capabilities apply to both AS and NAS level security.
f) Separate AS and NAS level security mode command procedures are required. AS
level security mode command procedure shall configure AS security (RRC and UP)
and NAS level security mode command procedure shall configure NAS security.
a) Both integrity protection and ciphering for RRC shall be activated within
the same AS SMC procedure, but not necessarily within the same message.
b) User plane ciphering shall be activated at the same time as RRC ciphering.
c) User plane integrity shall be activated at the same time as RRC ciphering.
User plane integrity shall be applied to a data radio bearer if integrity
protection is configured for that data radio bearer at the time of data radio
bearer set-up.
g) It shall be possible that the selected AS and NAS algorithms are different
at a given point of time.
#### 7.2.4.2 Procedures for AS algorithm selection
##### 7.2.4.2.1 Initial AS security context establishment
Each eNB shall be configured via network management with lists of algorithms
which are allowed for usage. There shall be one list for integrity algorithms,
and one for ciphering algorithms. These lists shall be ordered according to a
priority decided by the operator. When AS security context is established in
the eNB, the MME shall send the UE EPS security capabilities to the eNB. The
eNB shall choose the ciphering algorithm which has the highest priority from
its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security capabilities.
The eNB shall choose the integrity algorithm which has the highest priority
from its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security
capabilities. The chosen algorithms shall be indicated to the UE in the AS
SMC. The ciphering algorithm is used for ciphering of the user plane and RRC
traffic. The integrity algorithm is used for integrity protection of the RRC
traffic, and, if applicable, for the integrity protection of user plane
traffic between RN and DeNB.
##### 7.2.4.2.2 X2-handover
At handover from a source eNB over X2 to a target eNB, the source eNB shall
include the UE EPS security capabilities and ciphering and integrity
algorithms used in the source cell in the handover request message. The target
eNB shall select the algorithm with highest priority from the UE EPS security
capabilities according to the prioritized locally configured list of
algorithms (this applies for both integrity and ciphering algorithms). The
chosen algorithms shall be indicated to the UE in the handover command if the
target eNB selects different algorithms compared to the source eNB. If the UE
does not receive any selection of integrity and ciphering algorithms it
continues to use the same algorithms as before the handover (see TS 36.331
[21]). In the path-switch message, the target eNB shall send the UE EPS
security capabilities received from the source eNB to the MME. The MME shall
verify that the UE EPS security capabilities received from the eNB are the
same as the UE EPS security capabilities that the MME has stored. If there is
a mismatch, the MME may log the event and may take additional measures, such
as raising an alarm.
NOTE: Transferring the ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the source
cell to the target eNB in the handover request message is for the target eNB
to decipher and integrity verify the RRCReestablishmentComplete message on
SRB1 in the potential RRCConnectionRe-establishment procedure. The information
is also used by the target eNB to decide if it is necessary to include a new
selection of security algorithms in the handover command.
##### 7.2.4.2.3 S1-handover
At handover from a source eNB to a target eNB over S1 (possibly including an
MME change and hence a transfer of the UE security capabilities from source
MME to target MME), the target MME shall send the UE EPS security capabilities
to the target eNB in the S1 AP HANDOVER REQUEST message. The target eNB shall
select the algorithm with highest priority from the UE EPS security
capabilities according to the prioritized locally configured list of
algorithms (this applies for both integrity and ciphering algorithms). The
chosen algorithms shall be indicated to the UE in the handover command if the
target eNB selects different algorithms compared to the source eNB. If the UE
does not receive any selection of integrity and ciphering algorithms it
continues to use the same algorithms as before the handover (see TS 36.331
[21]).
##### 7.2.4.2.4 Intra-eNB handover
It is not required to change the AS security algorithm during intra-eNB
handover. If the UE does not receive any selection of new AS security
algorithms during an intra-eNB handover, the UE continues to use the same
algorithms as before the handover (see TS 36.331 [21]).
#### 7.2.4.3 Procedures for NAS algorithm selection
##### 7.2.4.3.1 Initial NAS security context establishment
Each MME shall be configured via network management with lists of algorithms
which are allowed for usage. There shall be one list for NAS integrity
algorithms, and one for NAS ciphering algorithms. These lists shall be ordered
according to a priority decided by the operator.
To establish the NAS security context, the MME shall choose one NAS ciphering
algorithm and one NAS integrity protection algorithm. The MME shall then
initiate a NAS security mode command procedure, and include the chosen
algorithms and UE security capabilities (to detect modification of the UE
security capabilities by an attacker) in the message to the UE (see clause
7.2.4.4). The MME shall select the NAS algorithms which have the highest
priority according to the ordered lists.
##### 7.2.4.3.2 MME change
In case there is change of MMEs and algorithms to be used for NAS, the target
MME shall initiate a NAS security mode command procedure and include the
chosen algorithms and the UE security capabilities (to detect modification of
the UE security capabilities by an attacker) in the message to the UE (see
clause 7.2.4.4). The MME shall select the NAS algorithms which have the
highest priority according to the ordered lists (see 7.2.4.3.1).
NOTE: After an S1-handover with MME change a TAU procedure is executed. The
same is true for an inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN and for both inter- and
intra-RAT idle mode mobility resulting in a change of MMEs.
#### 7.2.4.4 NAS security mode command procedure
The NAS SMC procedure consists of a roundtrip of messages between MME and UE.
The MME sends the NAS Security Mode Command to the UE and the UE replies with
the NAS Security Mode Complete message. The primary purpose of the NAS SMC
procedure is to securely establish a NAS security context between the UE and
MME.
NOTE 1: The NAS SMC procedure is designed such that it protects the
establishment of the NAS security against a man-in-the-middle attack where the
attacker modifies the IEs containing the UE security capabilities provided by
the UE in the Attach or TAU Request. It works as follows: if the method
completes successfully, the UE is attached to the network knowing that no
bidding down attack has happened. In case a bidding down attack was attempted,
the verification of the NAS SMC will fail and the UE replies with a reject
message.
The NAS Security Mode Command message from MME to UE shall contain the
replayed UE security capabilities, the selected NAS algorithms, the eKSI for
identifying K~ASME~, and both NONCE~UE~ and NONCE~MME~ in the case of creating
a mapped context in idle mobility (see clause 9.1.2). The replayed UE security
capabilities shall include the UE NR security capabilities if the MME
understands the UE NR security capabilities and received them from the UE In
the case of sending a NAS Security Mode Command during an Attach or TAU
procedure (i.e. after receiving the Attach/TAU Request but before sending a
response to that message) where the relevant Request message either did not
have an integrity protection or did not successfully pass its integrity
protection, the MME shall calculate a HASH~MME~ of the entire plain Request
message and include the HASH~MME~ in the NAS security mode command message.
The MME shall calculate HASH~MME~ as decribed in Annex I.2. This message shall
be integrity protected (but not ciphered) with NAS integrity key based on
K~ASME~ indicated by the eKSI in the message (see figure 7.2.4.4-1).
The UE shall verify the integrity of the NAS Security Mode Command message.
This includes ensuring that the UE security capabilities sent by the MME match
the ones stored in the UE to ensure that these were not modified by an
attacker. If the UE NR security capabilities are not included, the UE shall
not consider this a mismatch of security capabilities. The verification also
includes checking the integrity protection using the indicated NAS integrity
algorithm and the NAS integrity key based on K~ASME~ indicated by the eKSI. In
addition, when creating a mapped context for the case described in clause
9.1.2, the UE shall ensure the received NONCE~UE~ is the same as the NONCE~UE~
sent in the TAU Request and also calculate K\'~ASME~ from CK, IK and the two
nonces (see Annex A.11).
In addition if the NAS Security Mode Command message includes a HASH~MME~, the
UE shall compare HASH~UE~ with HASH~MME~. The UE shall calculate HASH~UE~ as
described in Annex I.2 from the entire plain Attach Request or TAU Request
that it sends.
NOTE 2: The UE could calculate the HASH~UE~ after it sends the Attach Request
or TAU Request and before it receives the NAS Security Mode Command message.
Alternatively, the UE could calculate the HASH~UE~ after successfully
verifying a NAS security mode command message that includes a HASH~MME~.
If the MME receives no response to a NAS Security Mode Command that included
nonces to create a mapped context and it wishes to try again to create the
mapped context, the MME shall use the same values of NONCE~UE~ and NONCE~MME~.
If the UE receives a re-transmitted NAS Security Mode Command, i.e one
containing the nonces, after it has successfully received a previous one (and
hence created a mapped EPS NAS security context), the UE shall process the
message as above, except that it is not required to re-generate the K\'~ASME~
or check the NONCE ~UE~ if it does not re-generate the K\'~ASME~.
If the checks of the NAS Security Mode Command pass the UE shall respond with
a NAS Security Mode Complete.
The UE shall delete NONCE~_UE~ once the TAU procedure is complete.
If successfully verified, the UE shall start NAS integrity protection and
ciphering/deciphering with this security context and sends the NAS security
mode complete message to MME ciphered and integrity protected The NAS Security
Mode Complete message shall include IMEISV in case MME requested it in the NAS
Security Mode Command message. In addition if HASH~UE~ and HASH~MME~ are
different, the UE shall include the complete Attach/TAU Request message (that
the UE previously sent) in the NAS SecurityMode Complete message.
NOTE3 : A failed Hash comparison does not affect the security establishment as
the UE has still checked the UE security capabilities that the MME sent in the
NAS Security Mode Command message.
The MME shall de-cipher and check the integrity protection on the NAS Security
Mode Complete using the keys and algorithms indicated in the NAS Security Mode
Command. NAS downlink ciphering at the MME with this security context shall
start after receiving the NAS Security Mode Complete message. NAS uplink
deciphering at the MME with this context starts after sending the NAS Security
Mode Command message. If the NAS Security Mode Complete message contains an
Attach/TAU Request message, the MME shall complete the on-going Attach/TAU
procedure by considering the contained Attach/TAU Request message as the
message that triggered the procedure.
If any verification of the NAS Security Mode Command is not successful in the
ME, the ME shall reply with a NAS Security Mode Reject message (see TS 24.301
[9]). The NAS Security Mode Reject message and all following NAS messages
shall be protected with the EPS NAS security context, i.e., the EPS NAS
security context used prior to the NAS Security Mode Command that failed
(until a new EPS NAS security context is established, e.g., via a new NAS
security mode command procedure). If no EPS NAS security context existed prior
to the NAS Security Mode Command, the NAS Security Mode Reject message cannot
be protected.
NOTE 4: If the uplink NAS COUNT will wrap around by sending the Security Mode
Reject message, the UE releases the NAS connection as specified in TS 24.301
[9] instead of sending the Security Mode Reject message.
Figure 7.2.4.4-1: NAS Security Mode Command procedure
#### 7.2.4.5 AS security mode command procedure
The AS SMC procedure consists of a roundtrip of messages between eNB and UE.
The eNB sends the AS security mode command to the UE and the UE replies with
the AS security mode complete message. See figure 7.2.4.5-1.
The AS security mode command message from eNB to UE shall contain the selected
AS algorithms. This message shall be integrity protected with RRC integrity
key based on the current K~ASME~.
The AS security mode complete message from UE to eNB shall be integrity
protected with the selected RRC algorithm indicated in the AS security mode
command message and RRC integrity key based on the current K~ASME~.
RRC and UP downlink ciphering (encryption) at the eNB shall start after
sending the AS security mode command message. RRC and UP uplink deciphering
(decryption) at the eNB shall start after receiving and successful
verification of the AS security mode complete message.
RRC and UP uplink ciphering (encryption) at the UE shall start after sending
the AS security mode complete message. RRC and UP downlink deciphering
(decryption) at the UE shall start after receiving and successful verification
of the AS security mode command message
If any control of the AS security mode command is not successful in the ME,
the ME shall reply with an unprotected security mode failure message (see TS
36.331[21]).
AS security mode command always changes the AS keys.
Figure 7.2.4.5-1: AS security setup
### 7.2.4a Algorithm negotiation for unauthenticated UEs in LSM
UEs that are in limited service mode (LSM) and that cannot be authenticated by
the MME (for whatever reason) may still be allowed to establish emergency
calls by sending the emergency attach request message. It shall be possible to
configure whether the MME allows unauthenticated UEs in LSM to establish
bearers for emergency calls or not. If an MME allows unauthenticated UEs in
LSM to establish bearers for an emergency call, the MME shall for the NAS
protocol use EIA0 and EEA0 as the integrity and ciphering algorithm
respectively.
If the MME allows an unauthenticated UE in LSM to establish bearers for
emergency calls after it has received the emergency attach request message
from the UE, the MME shall:
\- Select EIA0 and EEA0, regardless of the supported algorithms announced
previously by the UE as the NAS algorithms and signal this to the UE via the
NAS security mode command procedure when activating the EPS NAS security
context.
\- Set the UE EPS security capabilities to only contain EIA0 and EEA0 when
sending these to the eNB in the following messages:
\- S1 UE INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP
\- S1 UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST
\- S1 HANDOVER REQUEST
NOTE 1: As a result of that the MME only sends a UE EPS security capability
containing EIA0 and EEA0 to the eNB when selecting EIA0 for NAS integrity
protection is that the eNB is only capable of selecting EIA0 for AS integrity
protection and EEA0 for AS confidentiality protection. That is, if EIA0 is
used for NAS integrity protection, then EIA0 will always be used for AS
integrity protection.
The rules for when the MME shall select EIA0 for NAS integrity protection, and
when the UE shall accept a NAS security mode command selecting EIA0 for NAS
integrity protection depends on whether the UE and MME can be certain that no
EPS NAS security context can be established. The rules for determining this is
defined in clause 15 of this specification. If the MME has selected EIA0 as
the NAS integrity protection algorithm, the UE shall accept selection of EIA0
as the AS integrity protection algorithm. Selection of AS integrity protection
algorithm happens via the AS security mode command procedure or via a handover
command. The UE shall under no other circumstances accept selection of EIA0 as
the AS integrity protection algorithm.
NOTE 2: A Rel-8 eNB that is the target eNB of a handover, where EIA0 is the
only integrity protection algorithm in the UE\'s EPS security capabilities,
rejects the handover since the eNB does not support EIA0.
### 7.2.5 Key handling at state transitions to and away from EMM-DEREGISTERED
#### 7.2.5.1 Transition to EMM-DEREGISTERED
There are different reasons for transition to the EMM-DEREGISTERED state. If a
NAS messages leads to state transition to EMM-DEREGISTERED, it shall be
security protected by the current EPS NAS security context (mapped or native),
if such exists in the UE or MME.
NOTE: The present specification only considers the states EMM-DEREGISTERED and
EMM‑REGISTERED and transitions between these two states. Other specifications
define additional EMM states (see, e.g., TS 24.301 [9]).
On transitioning to EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE and MME shall do the following:
  1. If they have a full non-current native EPS NAS security context and a current mapped EPS NAS security context, then they shall make the non-current native EPS NAS security context the current one.
  2. They shall delete any mapped or partial EPS NAS security contexts they hold.
Handling of the remaining authentication data for each of these cases are
given below:
1\. Attach reject: All authentication data shall be removed from the UE and
MME
2\. Detach:
a. UE-initiated
i. If the reason is switch off then all the remaining authentication data
shall be removed from the UE and MME with the exception of:
\- the current native EPS NAS security context (as in clause 6.1.1), which
should remain stored in the MME and UE, and
\- any unused authentication vectors, which may remain stored in the MME.
ii. If the reason is not switch off then MME and UE shall keep all the
remaining authentication data.
b. MME-initiated
i. Explicit: all the remaining authentication data shall be kept in the UE and
MME if the detach type is re-attach.
ii. Implicit: all the remaining authentication data shall be kept in the UE
and MME.
c. HSS-initiated: If the message is \"subscription withdrawn\" then all the
remaining authentication data shall be removed from the UE and MME.
3\. TAU reject: There are various reasons for TAU reject. The action to be
taken shall be as given in TS 24.301.
Storage of the full native EPS NAS security context, excluding the UE security
capabilities and the keys K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~, in the UE when the UE
transitions to EMM-DEREGISTERED state is done as follows:
a) If the ME does not have a full native EPS NAS security context in volatile
memory, any existing native EPS NAS security context stored on the UICC or in
non-volatile memory of the ME shall be marked as invalid.
b) If the USIM supports EMM parameters storage, then the ME shall store the
full native EPS NAS security context parameters on the USIM (except for
K~NASenc~ and K~NASint~), mark the native EPS NAS security context on the USIM
as valid, and not keep any native EPS NAS security context in non-volatile ME
memory.
c) If the USIM does not support EMM parameters storage, then the ME shall
store the full native EPS NAS security context (except for K~NASenc~ and
K~NASint~) in a non-volatile part of its memory, and mark the native EPS NAS
security context in its non-volatile memory as valid.
For the case that the MME or the UE enter EMM-DEREGISTERED state without using
any of the above procedures, the handling of the remaining authentication data
shall be as specified in TS 24.301 [9].
#### 7.2.5.2 Transition away from EMM-DEREGISTERED
##### 7.2.5.2.1 General
When starting the transition away from EMM‑DEREGISTERED state with the intent
to eventually transitioning to EMM-REGISTERED state, if no current EPS NAS
security context is available in the ME, the ME shall retrieve native EPS NAS
security context stored on the USIM if the USIM supports EMM parameters
storage and if the stored native EPS NAS security context on the USIM is
marked as valid. If the USIM does not support EMM parameters storage the ME
shall retrieve stored native EPS NAS security context from its non-volatile
memory if the native EPS NAS security context is marked as valid. The ME shall
derive the K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~ after retrieving the stored EPS NAS
security context; see clause A.7 on NAS key derivation. The retrieved native
EPS NAS security context with the derived K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~ shall then
become the current EPS NAS security context.
When the ME is transitioning away from EMM‑DEREGISTERED state with the intent
to eventually transitioning to EMM-REGISTERED state, if the USIM supports EMM
parameters storage, the ME shall mark the stored EPS NAS security context on
the USIM as invalid. If the USIM does not support EMM parameters storage, the
ME shall mark the stored EPS NAS security context in its non-volatile memory
as invalid.
If the ME uses an EPS NAS security context to protect NAS messages, the NAS
COUNT values are updated in the volatile memory of the ME. If the attempt to
transition away from EMM‑DEREGISTERED state with the intent to eventually
transitioning to EMM-REGISTERED state fails, the ME shall store the (possibly
updated) EPS NAS security context on the USIM or non-volatile ME memory and
mark it as valid.
NOTE: The present specification only considers the states EMM-DEREGISTERED and
EMM‑REGISTERED and transitions between these two states. Other specifications
define additional EMM states (see, e.g., TS 24.301 [9]).
When the UE transits from EMM-DEREGISTERED to EMM-REGISTERED/ECM-CONNECTED,
there are two cases to consider, either a full native EPS NAS security context
exists, or it does not.
##### 7.2.5.2.2 With existing native EPS NAS security context
The UE shall transmit a NAS Attach Request message. This message is integrity
protected and for the case that the EPS NAS security context used by the UE is
non-current in the MME, the rules in clause 6.4 apply. Furthermore provided
there is no NAS SMC procedure before the AS SMC the NAS COUNT of the Attach
Request message shall be used to derive the K~eNB~ with the KDF as specified
in clause A.3. As a result of the NAS Attach Request, the eNB shall send an AS
SMC to the UE to activate AS security. The K~eNB~ used, is derived in the
current EPS NAS security context.
When the UE receives the AS SMC without having received a NAS Security Mode
Command after the Attach Request, it shall use the NAS COUNT of the Attach
Request message (i.e. the uplink NAS COUNT) that triggered the AS SMC to be
sent as freshness parameter in the derivation of the K~eNB~. From this K~eNB~
the RRC protection keys and the UP protection keys shall be derived as
described in subclause 7.2.1.
The same procedure for refreshing K~eNB~ can be used regardless of the fact if
the UE is connecting to the same MME to which it was connected previously or
to a different MME. In case UE connects to a different MME and this MME
selects different NAS algorithms, the NAS keys have to be re-derived in the
MME with the new algorithm IDs as input using the KDF as specified in clause
A.7.
In addition, there is a need for the MME to send a NAS SMC to the UE to
indicate the change of NAS algorithms and to take the re-derived NAS keys into
use. The UE shall assure that the NAS keys used to verify the integrity of the
NAS SMC are derived using the algorithm ID specified in the NAS SMC. The NAS
SMC Command and NAS SMC Complete messages are protected with the new NAS keys.
If there is a NAS Security Mode Command after the Attach Request but before
the AS SMC, the UE and MME use the NAS COUNT of the most recent NAS Security
Mode Complete (i.e. the uplink NAS COUNT) and the related K~ASME~ as the
parameter in the derivation of the K~eNB~. From this K~eNB~ the RRC protection
keys and the UP protection keys are derived as described in subclause 7.2.1.
##### 7.2.5.2.3 With run of EPS AKA
If in the process described in clause 7.2.5.2.2, there is no full native EPS
NAS security context available in the MME (i.e. either the UE has sent an
unprotected Attach Request message or the UE has protected the Attach Request
message with a current native EPS security context which no longer is stored
in the MME) an EPS AKA run is required. If there is a full native EPS NAS
security context available in the MME, then the MME may (according to MME
policy) decide to run a new EPS AKA and a NAS SMC procedure (which activates
the new EPS NAS security context based on the K~ASME~ derived during the EPS
AKA run) after the Attach Request but before the corresponding AS SMC. The NAS
(uplink and downlink) COUNTs are set to start values, and the start value of
the uplink NAS COUNT shall be used as freshness parameter in the K~eNB~
derivation from the fresh K~ASME~ (after AKA) when UE receives AS SMC the
K~eNB~ is derived from the current EPS NAS security context, i.e., the fresh
K~ASME~ is used to derive the K~eNB~ The KDF as specified in clause A.3 shall
be used to derive the K~eNB~.
NOTE: Using the start value for the uplink NAS COUNT in this case cannot lead
to the same combination of K~ASME~ and NAS COUNT being used twice. This is
guaranteed by the fact that the first integrity protected NAS message the UE
sends to the MME after AKA is the NAS SMC complete message.
The NAS SMC complete message shall include the start value of the uplink NAS
COUNT that is used as freshness parameter in the K~eNB~ derivation and the
K~ASME~ is fresh. After an AKA, a NAS SMC needs to be sent from the MME to the
UE in order to take the new NAS keys into use. Both NAS SMC and NAS SMC
Complete messages are protected with the new NAS keys.
### 7.2.6 Key handling in ECM-IDLE to ECM-CONNECTED and ECM‑CONNECTED to ECM-
IDLE transitions
#### 7.2.6.1 ECM-IDLE to ECM-CONNECTED transition
The UE sends an initial NAS message to initiate transition from ECM-IDLE to
ECM-CONNECTED state [9]. On transitions to ECM-CONNECTED, the MME should be
able to check whether a new authentication is required, e.g. because of prior
inter-provider handover.
When cryptographic protection for radio bearers is established RRC protection
keys and UP protection keys shall be generated as described in subclause 7.2.1
while K~ASME~ is assumed to be already available in the MME.
The initial NAS message shall be integrity protected by the current EPS NAS
security context if such exists. If no current EPS NAS security context exists
the ME shall signal \"no key available\" in the initial NAS message.
K~ASME~ may have been established in the MME as a result of an AKA run, or as
a result of a security context transfer from another MME during handover or
idle mode mobility. When the eNB releases the RRC connection the UE and the
eNB shall delete the keys they store such that state in the network for ECM-
IDLE state UEs will only be maintained in the MME.
#### 7.2.6.2 Establishment of keys for cryptographically protected radio
bearers
The procedure the UE uses to establish cryptographic protection for radio
bearers is initiated by an (extended) NAS Service Request message or TAU
Request message with the active flag set from the UE to the MME. The MME may
initiate the procedure to establish cryptographic protection for radio bearers
when the \"active flag\" is not set in the TAU request and there is pending
downlink UP data or pending downlink signalling.
Upon receipt of the NAS message, if the MME does not require a NAS SMC
procedure before initiating the S1-AP procedure INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP, the MME
shall derive key K~eNB~ as specified in subclause A.3 using the NAS COUNT [9]
corresponding to the NAS message and the K~ASME~ of the current EPS NAS
security context. The MME shall further initialize the value of the Next hop
Chaining Counter (NCC) to zero. The MME shall further derive a next hop
parameter NH as specified in subclause A.4 using the newly derived K~eNB~ and
the K~ASME~ as basis for the derivation. The MME shall further set the the
value of the Next hop Chaining Counter (NCC) to one. This fresh {NH, NCC=1}
pair shall be stored in the MME and shall be used for the next forward
security key derivation. The MME shall communicate the K~eNB~ to the serving
eNB in the S1-AP procedure INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP. The UE shall derive the
K~eNB~ from the K~ASME~ of the current EPS NAS security context.
As a result of the (extended) NAS Service Request or TAU procedure, radio
bearers are established, and the eNB sends an AS SMC to the UE. When the UE
receives the AS SMC without having received a NAS Security Mode Command, it
shall use the NAS uplink COUNT of the NAS message that triggered the AS SMC as
freshness parameter in the derivation of the K~eNB~. The KDF as specified in
Annex A.3 shall be used for the K~eNB~ derivation using the K~ASME~ of the
current EPS NAS security context. The UE shall further derive the NH parameter
from the newly derived K~eNB~ and the K~ASME~ in the same way as the MME. From
the K~eNB~ the RRC protection keys and the UP protection keys are derived by
the UE and the eNB as described in subclause 6.2.
NOTE: At the UE, the NH derivation associated with NCC=1 could be delayed
until the **first handover performing vertical key derivation**.
If the NAS procedure establishing radio bearers contains an EPS AKA run (which
is optional), the NAS uplink and downlink COUNT for the new K~ASME~ shall be
set to the start values (i.e. zero). If the NAS procedure establishing radio
bearers contains a NAS SMC (which is optional), the value of the uplink NAS
COUNT from the most recent NAS Security Mode Complete shall be used as
freshness parameter in the K~eNB~ derivation from fresh K~ASME~ of the current
EPS NAS security context when executing an AS SMC. The KDF as specified in
Annex A.3 shall be used for the K~eNB~ derivation also in this case.
The case that the UE is using Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation to send data
over NAS and S1-U bearers are established (due to either a request from the UE
or decided by the MME - see 5.3.4B.3 of TS 23.401 [2]) works as follows. The
UE and MME shall always use the value of the uplink NAS COUNT from the Control
Plane Service Request that was sent to transition the UE from idle to active
as freshness parameter in the derivation of the K~eNB~ unless there has been a
subsequent NAS Security Mode Complete. If there was a subsequent NAS Security
Mode Complete, then the UE and MME use the value of the uplink NAS COUNT from
the latest NAS Security Mode Complete message as freshness parameter in the
derivation of the K~eNB~.
#### 7.2.6.3 ECM-CONNECTED to ECM-IDLE transition
On ECM-CONNECTED to ECM-IDLE transitions the eNB does no longer need to store
state information about the corresponding UE.
In particular, on ECM-CONNECTED to ECM-IDLE transitions:
\- The eNB and the UE shall release all radio bearers and delete the AS
security context.
\- MME and the UE shall keep the EPS NAS security context stored with the
following exception: if there is a new and an old K~ASME~ according to rules
3, 4, 8 or 9 in clause 7.2.10 of this specification then the MME and the UE
shall delete the old K~ASME~ and the corresponding eKSI. The MME shall delete
NH and NCC.
### 7.2.7 Key handling for the TAU procedure when registered in E-UTRAN
Before the UE can initiate the TAU procedure, the UE needs to transition to
ECM-CONNECTED state. The UE shall use the current EPS security context to
protect the TAU Request and include the corresponding GUTI and eKSI value. The
TAU Request shall be integrity-protected, but not confidentiality-protected.
UE shall use the current EPS security context algorithms to protect the TAU
Request message. For the case that this security context is non-current in the
MME, the rules in clause 6.4 apply.
If the \"active flag\" is set in the TAU request message or the MME chooses to
establish radio bearers when there is pending downlink UP data or pending
downlink signalling, radio bearers will be established as part of the TAU
procedure and a K~eNB~ derivation is necessary.If there was no subsequent NAS
SMC, the uplink NAS COUNTof the TAU request message sent from the UE to the
MME is used as freshness parameter in the K~eNB~ derivation using the KDF as
specified in clause A.3. The TAU request shall be integrity protected.
In the case an AKA is run successfully, the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
shall be set to the start values (i.e. zero).
In the case source and target MME use different NAS algorithms, the target MME
re-derives the NAS keys from K~ASME~ with the new algorithm identities as
input and provides the new algorithm identifiers within a NAS SMC. The UE
shall assure that the NAS keys used to verify the integrity of the NAS SMC are
derived using the algorithm identity specified in the NAS SMC.
If there is a NAS Security Mode Command after the TAU Request but before the
AS SMC, the UE and MME use the NAS COUNT of the most recent NAS Security Mode
Complete (i.e. the uplink NAS COUNT) and the related K~ASME~ as the parameter
in the derivation of the K~eNB~. From this K~eNB~ the RRC protection keys and
the UP protection keys are derived as described in subclause 7.2.1.
### 7.2.8 Key handling in handover
#### 7.2.8.1 General
##### 7.2.8.1.1 Access stratum
The general principle of key handling at handovers is depicted in Figure
7.2.8.1-1.
Figure 7.2.8.1-1 Model for the handover key chaining
The following is an outline of the key handling model to clarify the intended
structure of the key derivations. The detailed specification is provided in
subclauses 7.2.8.3 and 7.2.8.4.
Whenever an initial AS security context needs to be established between UE and
eNB, MME and the UE shall derive a K~eNB~ and a Next Hop parameter (NH). The
K~eNB~ and the NH are derived from the K~ASME~. A NH Chaining Counter (NCC) is
associated with each K~eNB~ and NH parameter. Every K~eNB~ is associated with
the NCC corresponding to the NH value from which it was derived. At initial
setup, the K~eNB~ is derived directly from K~ASME~, and is then considered to
be associated with a virtual NH parameter with NCC value equal to zero. At
initial setup, the derived NH value is associated with the NCC value one.
NOTE 1: At the UE, the NH derivation associated with NCC=1 could be delayed
until the **first handover performing vertical key derivation**.
Whether the MME sends the K~eNB~ key or the {NH, NCC} pair to the serving eNB
is described in detail in subclauses 7.2.8.3 and 7.2.8.4. The MME shall not
send the NH value to eNB at the initial connection setup. The eNB shall
initialize the NCC value to zero after receiving S1-AP Initial Context Setup
Request message.
NOTE 2: Since the MME does not send the NH value to eNB at the initial
connection setup, the NH value associated with the NCC value one can not be
used in the next X2 handover or the next intra-eNB handover, for the next X2
handover or the next intra-eNB handover the horizontal key derivation (see
Figure 7.2.8.1-1) will apply.
NOTE 3: One of the rules specified for the MME in subclause 7.2.8.4 of this
specification states that the MME always computes a fresh {NH, NCC} pair that
is given to the target eNB. An implication of this is that the first {NH, NCC}
pair will never be used to derive a K~eNB~. It only serves as an initial value
for the NH chain.
The UE and the eNB use the K~eNB~ to secure the communication between each
other. On handovers, the basis for the K~eNB~ that will be used between the UE
and the target eNB, called K~eNB~*, is derived from either the currently
active K~eNB~ or from the NH parameter. If K~eNB~* is derived from the
currently active K~eNB~ this is referred to as a horizontal key derivation
(see Figure 7.2.8.1-1) and if the K~eNB~* is derived from the NH parameter the
derivation is referred to as a vertical key derivation (see Figure 7.2.8.1-1).
On handovers with vertical key derivation the NH is further bound to the
target PCI and its frequency EARFCN-DL before it is taken into use as the
K~eNB~ in the target eNB. On handovers with horizontal key derivation the
currently active K~eNB~ is further bound to the target PCI and its frequency
EARFCN-DL before it is taken into use as the K~eNB~ in the target eNB.
As NH parameters are only computable by the UE and the MME, it is arranged so
that NH parameters are provided to eNBs from the MME in such a way that
forward security can be achieved.
##### 7.2.8.1.2 Non access stratum
A NAS aspect that needs to be considered is possible NAS algorithm change at
MME change that could occur at a handover. At an eNB handover with MME
relocation, there is the possibility that the source MME and the target MME do
not support the same set of NAS algorithms or have different priorities
regarding the use of NAS algorithms. In this case, the target MME re-derives
the NAS keys from K~ASME~ using the NAS algorithm identities as input to the
NAS key derivation functions (see clause A.7) and sends NAS SMC. All inputs,
in particular the K~ASME~, will be the same in the re-derivation except for
the NAS algorithm identity.
In case the target MME decides to use NAS algorithms different from the ones
used by the source MME, a NAS SMC including eKSI (new or current value
depending on whether AKA was run or not) shall be sent from the MME to the UE.
This NAS Key and algorithm handling also applies to other MME changes e.g. TAU
with MME changes.
NOTE: It is per operator\'s policy how to configure selection of handover
types. Depending on an operator\'s security requirements, the operator can
decide whether to have X2 or S1 handovers for a particular eNB according to
the security characteristics of a particular eNB.
#### 7.2.8.2 Void
#### 7.2.8.3 Key derivations for context modification procedure
As outlined in subclause 7.2.8.1, whenever a fresh K~eNB~ is calculated from
the K~ASME~ (as described in Annex A.3), the MME shall transfer the K~eNB~ to
the serving eNB in a message modifying the security context in the eNB. The
MME and the UE shall also compute the NH parameter from the K~ASME~ and the
fresh K~eNB~ as described in Annex A.4 according to the rules in clause
7.2.9.2. An NCC value 1 is associated with the NH parameter derived from the
fresh K~eNB~ and NCC value 0 with the K~eNB~. The UE shall compute K~eNB~ and
NH in the same way as the MME. From the newly computed K~eNB~, the eNB and the
UE shall compute the temporary K~eNB~* and then the final K~eNB~ from that
K~eNB~* as described in clause 7.2.9.2.
NOTE 1: Since MME does not send the NH value to eNB in S1 UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION REQUEST, the NH value associated with the NCC value one can not
be used in the next X2 handover or the next intra-eNB handover. So for the
next X2 handover or the next intra-eNB handover the horizontal key derivation
(see Figure 7.2.8.1-1) will apply.
NOTE 2: One of the rules specified for the MME in subclause 7.2.8.4 of this
specification states that the MME always computes a fresh {NH, NCC} pair that
is given to the target eNB. An implication of this is that the first {NH, NCC}
pair, i.e., the one with NCC equal to 1 will never be used to derive a K~eNB~.
It only serves as an initial value for the NH chain.
> NOTE 3: At the UE, the NH derivation associated with NCC=1 could be delayed
> until the **first handover performing vertical key derivation**.
#### 7.2.8.4 Key derivations during handovers
##### 7.2.8.4.1 Intra-eNB Handover
When the eNB decides to perform an intra-eNB handover it shall derive K~eNB~*
as in Annex A.5 using target PCI, its frequency EARFCN-DL, and either NH or
the current K~eNB~ depending on the following criteria: the eNB shall use the
NH for deriving K~eNB~* if an unused {NH, NCC} pair is available in the eNB
(this is referred to as a vertical key derivation), otherwise if no unused
{NH, NCC} pair is available in the eNB, the eNB shall derive K~eNB~* from the
current K~eNB~ (this is referred to as a horizontal key derivation).
**The eNB shall use the K~eNB~* as the K~eNB~ after handover. The eNB shall
send the NCC used for** K~eNB~* derivation **to UE in HO Command message.**
##### 7.2.8.4.2 X2-handover
As in intra-eNB handovers, for X2 handovers the source eNB shall perform a
vertical key derivation in case it has an unused {NH, NCC} pair. The source
eNB shall first compute K~eNB~* from target PCI, its frequency EARFCN-DL, and
either from currently active K~eNB~ in case of horizontal key derivation or
from the NH in case of vertical key derivation as described in Annex A.5.
Next the source eNB shall forward the {K~eNB~*, NCC} pair to the target eNB.
The target eNB shall use the received K~eNB~* directly as K~eNB~ to be used
with the UE. The target eNB shall associate the NCC value received from source
eNB with the K~eNB~. The target eNB shall include the received NCC into the
prepared HO Command message, which is sent back to the source eNB in a
transparent container and forwarded to the UE by source eNB.
When the target eNB has completed the handover signaling with the UE, it shall
send a S1 PATH SWITCH REQUEST to the MME. Upon reception of the S1 PATH SWITCH
REQUEST, the MME shall increase its locally kept NCC value by one and compute
a new fresh NH by using the K~ASME~ and its locally kept NH value as input to
the function defined in Annex A.4. The MME shall then send the newly computed
{NH, NCC} pair to the target eNB in the S1 PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message. The target eNB shall store the received {NH, NCC} pair for further
handovers and remove other existing unused stored {NH, NCC} pairs if any.
NOTE: Because the path switch message is transmitted after the radio link
handover, it can only be used to provide keying material for the next handover
procedure and target eNB. Thus, for X2-handovers key separation happens only
after two hops because the source eNB knows the target eNB keys. The target
eNB can immediately initiate an intra-cell handover to take the new NH into
use once the new NH has arrived in the S1 PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE.
##### 7.2.8.4.3 S1-Handover
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the source MME shall increase
its locally kept NCC value by one and compute a fresh NH from its stored data
using the function defined in Annex A.4. The source MME shall store that fresh
pair and send it to the target MME in the S10 FORWARD RELOCATION REQUEST
message. The S10 FORWARD RELOCATION REQUEST message shall in addition contain
the K~ASME~ that is currently used to compute {NH, NCC} pairs and its
corresponding eKSI.
The target MME shall store locally the {NH, NCC} pair received from the source
MME.
The target MME shall then send the received {NH, NCC} pair to the target eNB
within the S1 HANDOVER REQUEST.
Upon receipt of the S1 HANDOVER REQUEST from the target MME, the target eNB
shall compute the K~eNB~ to be used with the UE by performing the key
derivation defined in Annex A.5 with the fresh{NH, NCC} pair in the S1
HANDOVER REQUEST and the target PCI and its frequency EARFCN-DL. The target
eNB shall associate the NCC value received from MME with the K~eNB~. The
target eNB shall include the NCC value from the received {NH, NCC} pair into
the HO Command to the UE and remove any existing unused stored {NH, NCC}
pairs.
NOTE: The source MME may be the same as the target MME in the description in
this subclause. If so the single MME performs the roles of both the source and
target MME, i.e. the MME calculates and stores the fresh {NH, NCC} pair and
sends this to the target eNB.
For S1-handover, the source eNB shall include AS algorithms used in the source
cell (ciphering and integrity algorithms) in the source to target transparent
container that shall be sent to the target eNB. The AS algorithms used by in
the source cell are provided to the target eNB so that it can decipher and
integrity verify the RRCReestablishmentComplete message on SRB1 in the
potential RRCConnectionRe-establishment procedure.
##### 7.2.8.4.4 UE handling
The UE behaviour is the same regardless if the handover is S1, X2 or intra-
eNB.
If the NCC value the UE received in the HO Command message from target eNB via
source eNB is equal to the NCC value associated with the currently active
K~eNB~, the UE shall derive the K~eNB~* from the currently active K~eNB~ and
the target PCI and its frequency EARFCN-DL using the function defined in Annex
A.5.
If the UE received an NCC value that was different from the NCC associated
with the currently active K~eNB~, the UE shall first synchronize the locally
kept NH parameter by computing the function defined in Annex A.4 iteratively
(and increasing the NCC value until it matches the NCC value received from the
source eNB via the HO command message. When the NCC values match, the UE shall
compute the K~eNB~* from the synchronized NH parameter and the target PCI and
its frequency EARFCN-DL using the function defined in Annex A.5.
The UE shall use the K~eNB~* as the K~eNB~ when communicating with the target
eNB.
### 7.2.9 Key-change-on-the fly
#### 7.2.9.1 General
Key-change-on-the fly consists of re-keying or key-refresh.
Key refresh shall be possible for K~eNB~, K~RRC-enc~, K~RRC-int~, K~UP-int~,
and K~UP-enc~ and shall be initiated by the eNB when a PDCP COUNTs is about to
be re-used with the same Radio Bearer identity and with the same K~eNB~. The
procedure is described in clause 7.2.9.3.
Re-keying shall be possible for the K~eNB~, K~RRC-enc~, K~RRC-int~, K~UP-int~,
and K~UP-enc~. This re-keying shall be initiated by the MME when an EPS AS
security context different from the currently active one shall be activated.
The procedures for doing this are described in clause 7.2.9.2.
Re-keying shall be possible for K~NAS-enc~ and K~NAS-int~. Re-keying of K~NAS-
enc~ and K~NAS-int~ shall be initiated by the MME when a EPS NAS security
context different from the currently active one shall be activated. The
procedures for doing this are described in clause 7.2.9.4.
Re-keying of the entire EPS key hierarchy including K~ASME~ shall be achieved
by first re-keying K~ASME~, then K~NAS-enc~ and K~NAS-int~, followed by re-
keying of the K~eNB~ and derived keys. For NAS key change-on-on-the fly,
activation of NAS keys is accomplished by a NAS SMC procedure.
AS Key change on-the-fly is accomplished using a procedure based on intra-cell
handover. The following AS key changes on-the-fly shall be possible: local
K~eNB~ refresh (performed when PDCP COUNTs are about to wrap around), K~eNB~
re-keying performed after an AKA run, activation of a native context after
handover from UTRAN or GERAN.
#### 7.2.9.2 K~eNB~ re-keying
The K~eNB~ re-keying procedure is initiated by the MME. It may be used under
the following conditions:
\- after a successful AKA run with the UE as part of activating a partial
native EPS security context, or
\- as part of re-activating a non-current full native EPS security context
after handover from GERAN or UTRAN according to subclauses 9.2.2.1 and 10.3.2,
or
\- to create a new K~eNB~ from the current K~ASME~
NOTE 1: To perform a key change on-the-fly of the entire key hierarchy, the
MME has to change the EPS NAS security context before changing the AS security
context..
In order to be able to re-key the K~eNB~, the MME requires a fresh uplink NAS
COUNT from a successful NAS SMC procedure with the UE. In the case of creating
a new K~eNB~ from the current K~ASME~ a NAS SMC procedure shall be run first
to provide this fresh uplink NAS COUNT. This NAS SMC procedure does not have
to change other parameters in the current EPS NAS security context. T he MME
derives the new K~eNB~ using the key derivation function as specified in Annex
A.3 using the K~ASME~ and the uplink NAS COUNT used in the most recent NAS
Security Mode Complete message. The K~eNB~ is sent to the eNB in an S1 AP UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message triggering the eNB to perform the re-
keying. The eNB runs the key-change-on-the-fly procedure with the UE. During
this procedure the eNB shall indicate to the UE that a key change on-the-fly
is taking place. The procedure used is based on an intra-cell handover, and
hence the same K~eNB~ derivation steps shall be taken as in a normal handover
procedure.
When the UE receives an indication that the procedure is a key change on-the-
fly procedure, the UE shall derive a temporary K~eNB~ by applying the key
derivation function as specified in Annex A.3 using the K~ASME~ from the
current EPS NAS security context and the uplink NAS COUNT in the most recent
NAS Security Mode Complete message.
From this temporary K~eNB~ the UE shall derive the K~eNB~* as normal (see
clause A.5). The eNB shall take the K~eNB~ it received from the MME, which is
equal to the temporary K~eNB,~ as basis for its K~eNB~* derivations. From this
step onwards, the key derivations continue as in a normal handover.
If the AS level re-keying fails, then the MME shall complete another NAS
security mode procedure before initiating a new AS level re-keying. This
ensures that a fresh K~eNB~ is used.
The NH parameter shall be handled according to the following rules:
\- UE and MME shall use NH derived from old K~ASME~ before the context
modification is complete, i.e. for the UE when it sends the RRC Connection
Reconfiguration Complete, and for the MME when it receives the UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION RESPONSE. In particular, the MME shall send an NH derived from
old K~ASME~ in the S1AP **HANDOVER RESOURCE ALLOCATION, S10 FORWARD
RELOCATION, and** S1AP PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages before the
context modification is complete.
\- The eNB shall delete any old NH upon completion of the context
modification.
\- The UE and MME shall delete any old NH upon completion of the context
modification. After the completion of the context modification, the UE and the
MME shall derive any new NH parameters from the K~eNB~ calculated from the
uplink NAS COUNT and the K~ASME~ used to calculate that K~eNB~ according to
Annex A.4.
#### 7.2.9.3 KeNB refresh
This procedure is based on an intra-cell handover. The K~eNB~ chaining that is
performed during a handover ensures that the K~eNB~ is re-freshed w.r.t. the
RRC and UP COUNT after the procedure.
#### 7.2.9.4 NAS key re-keying
After an AKA has taken place, new NAS keys from a new K~ASME~ shall be
derived, according to Annex A.7.
To re-activate a non-current full native EPS security context after handover
from GERAN or UTRAN, cf. clause 9.2.2 B step 7, the UE and the MME take the
NAS keys into use by running a NAS SMC procedure according to clause 7.2.4.5.
MME shall activate fresh NAS keys from an EPS AKA run or activate native
security context with sufficiently low NAS COUNT values before the NAS uplink
or downlink COUNT wraps around with the current security context.
### 7.2.10 Rules on Concurrent Running of Security Procedures
Concurrent runs of security procedures may, in certain situations, lead to
mismatches between security contexts in the network and the UE. In order to
avoid such mismatches, the following rules shall be adhered to:
1\. MME shall not initiate any of the S1 procedures Initial Context Setup or
UE Context Modification including a new K~eNB~ towards a UE if a NAS Security
Mode Command procedure is ongoing with the UE.
2\. The MME shall not initiate a NAS Security Mode Command towards a UE if one
of the S1 procedures Initial Context Setup or UE Context Modification
including a new K~eNB~ is ongoing with the UE.
3\. When the UE has cryptographically protected radio bearers established and
the MME has initiated a NAS SMC procedure in order to take a new K~ASME~ into
use, the MME shall continue to include AS security context parameters based on
the old K~ASME~ in the HANDOVER REQUEST or PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message, until the MME takes a K~eNB~ derived from the new K~ASME~ into use by
means of a UE Context Modification procedure.
4\. When the UE has cryptographically protected radio bearers established and
has received a NAS SMC message in order to take a new K~ASME~ into use, the UE
shall continue to use AS security context parameters based on the old K~ASME~
in handover until the network indicates in an RRCConnectionReconfiguration
procedure to take a K~eNB~ derived from the new K~ASME~ into use.
5\. The source eNB shall reject an S1 UE Context Modification Request when the
eNB has initiated, but not yet completed, an inter-eNB handover. When a
RRCConnectionReconfiguration procedure triggered by a UE Context Modification
is ongoing the source eNB shall wait for the completion of this procedure
before initiating any further handover procedure.
6\. When the MME has initiated a NAS SMC procedure in order to take a new
K~ASME~ into use and receives a request for an inter-MME handover or an inter-
RAT handover from the serving eNB, the MME shall wait for the completion of
the NAS SMC procedure before sending an **S10 FORWARD RELOCATION** message or
initiating an inter-RAT handover.
7\. When the MME has initiated a UE Context Modification procedure in order to
take a new K~eNB~ into use and receives a request for an inter-MME handover
from the serving eNB, the MME shall wait for the (successful or unsuccessful)
completion of the UE Context Modification procedure before sending an **S10
FORWARD RELOCATION** message.
8\. When the MME has successfully performed a NAS SMC procedure taking a new
K~ASME~ into use, but has not yet successfully performed a UE Context
Modification procedure, which takes a K~eNB~ derived from the new K~ASME~ into
use, the MME shall include both the old K~ASME~ with the corresponding eKSI,
NH, and NCC, and a full EPS NAS security context based on the new K~ASME~ in
the **S10 FORWARD RELOCATION** message.
9\. When an MME receives a **S10 FORWARD RELOCATION** message including both
the old K~ASME~ with the corresponding eKSI, NH, and NCC, and a full EPS NAS
security context based on the new K~ASME~ the MME shall use the new K~ASME~ in
NAS procedures, but shall continue to include AS security context parameters
based on the old K~ASME~ in the HANDOVER REQUEST or PATH SWITCH REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message until the completion of a UE Context Modification
procedure, which takes a K~eNB~ derived from the new K~ASME~ into use.
10\. Once the source MME has sent an S10 FORWARD RELOCATION message to the
target MME at an inter-MME handover, the source MME shall not send any
downlink NAS messages to the UE until it is aware that the handover has either
failed or has been cancelled.
### 7.2.11 Suspend and resume of RRC connection
#### 7.2.11.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to allow the eNB to suspend an RRC connection
to be resumed by the UE at a later time. The UE may resume the RRC connection
in the same or different eNB than where the suspend took place. The UE and eNB
store the AS security context at suspend and reactivate the AS security
context at resume.
The UE and the eNB may also use EDT (Early Data Transmission) feature in this
procedure, as defined in TS 36.331 [21].
#### 7.2.11.2 RRC connection suspend
When the eNB initiates the RRC Connection Suspend procedure it sends S1-AP UE
Context Suspend Request message to the MME. Upon reception of the S1-AP UE
Context Suspend Request message the MME shall check its local policy. If the
local policy indicates that a new NH derivation is needed, the MME shall
increase its locally kept NCC value by one and compute a fresh NH from its
stored data using the function defined in Annex A.4. The MME shall store that
fresh {NH, NCC} pair and send it to the eNB in the S1-AP UE Context Suspend
Response message.
Upon receipt of the S1-AP UE Context Suspend Response message from the MME and
if the message includes a {NH, NCC} pair, the eNB shall store the fresh {NH,
NCC} pair in the S1-AP UE Context Suspend Response message and remove any
existing unused stored {NH, NCC} pairs.
The eNB shall include a Resume ID, to be used for context identification and
re-establishment, in the RRC Connection Suspend message sent from the eNB to
the UE. The RRC Connection Suspend message is protected in PDCP layer using
the current AS security context. The eNB shall store the Resume ID together
with the UE context including the AS security context. The UE ID part of the
Resume ID assigned by the eNB shall be different in consecutive suspends of
the same UE. This is to avoid tracking of UEs based on the Resume ID.
If **the eNB has a fresh {NH, NCC} pair,** the eNB shall keep K~RRCint~ and
delete other keys of the AS security context, i.e. keys K~eNB~, K~RRCenc~,
K~UPenc~ shall be deleted after sending the RRC Connection Suspend message to
the UE. Otherwise, if **a fresh {NH, NCC} pair** was not received from the MME
the eNB shall keep the AS keys.
When the UE receives the RRC Connection Suspend message from the eNB, then the
UE shall store the Resume ID together with the current UE context including
the AS security context until the UE decides to resume the RRC connection.
**When the EDT feature is used, the subsequent handling shall apply to the RRC
Connection Suspend procedure. If the eNB has a fresh and unused pair of {NH,
NCC}, then the eNB shall include the fresh NCC in the** RRC Connection Suspend
message. The eNB shall keep the current K~RRCint~, but delete other current AS
keys K~eNB~, K~RRCenc~, and K~UPenc~. Otherwise, if the eNB does not **have a
fresh and unused pair of {NH, NCC}, then the eNB** shall include the same NCC
value associated with the current K~eNB~ in the RRC Connection Suspend
message. In this case, the eNB shall keep the current K~RRCint~ and the
current K~eNB~, but delete other current AS keys K~RRCenc~, and K~UPenc~.
**When the UE receives the** RRC Connection Suspend message including an NCC
value, then the UE shall take the received NCC value for use in the next
resume. NCC received in RRC Connection Suspend message shall only be used for
initiating EDT resume.
#### 7.2.11.3 RRC connection resume to a new eNB
When the UE decides to resume the RRC connection, the UE sends the RRC
Connection Resume Request message on SRB0 and hence it is not integrity
protected. The UE shall include information to be used for context
identification and re-establishment in the RRC Connection Resume Request
message: the Resume ID and a ShortResumeMAC-I. The ShortResumeMAC-I is a
message authentication token, which shall be calculated with the following
inputs: source C-RNTI, source PCI, resume constant and target Cell-ID as
defined by _VarShortResumeMAC-Input_ in TS 36.331 [21] and using the stored
K~RRCint~ used with the source eNB where the UE was suspended.
The Resume ID was assigned to the UE in the cell where the UE was suspended
(the source cell). The source PCI and source C-RNTI are associated with the
cell where the UE was suspended. The target Cell-ID is the identity of the
target cell where the UE sends the RRC Connection Resume Request message. The
resume constant allows differentiation of _VarShortResumeMAC_ from
_VarShortMAC._ The integrity algorithm shall be the negotiated EIA-algorithm
from the stored AS security context from the source eNB.
\- KEY shall be set to K~RRCint~ of the source cell;
\- all BEARER bits shall be set to 1;
\- DIRECTION bit shall be set to 1;
\- all COUNT bits shall be set to 1.
The ShortResumeMAC-I shall be the 16 least significant bits of the output of
the used integrity algorithm.
The target eNB extracts the Resume ID and ShortResumeMAC-I from the RRC
Connection Resume Request. The target eNB contacts the source eNB based on the
information in the Resume ID by sending a Retrieve UE Context Request message
on X2 interface including the Resume ID, the ShortResumeMAC-I and Cell-ID of
target cell, in order to retrieve the UE context including the AS security
context.
The source eNB retrieves the stored UE context including the AS security
context from its database identified by the Resume ID and the source eNB
calculates and verifies the ShortResumeMAC-I (calculating it in the same way
as described above). If the check of the ShortResumeMAC-I is successful, then
the source eNB shall derive a new K~eNB~* as described in Annex A.5 based on
the target PCI and target EARFCN-DL. The source eNB can obtain the target PCI
and target EARFCN-DL from a cell configuration database by means of the target
Cell-ID. If the source eNB has a fresh {NH, NCC} pair from the MME then that
pair shall be used and the fresh NH shall be used as in the new K~eNB~*
derivation. The source eNB responds with a Retrieve UE Context Response
message to the target eNB on X2 interface including the UE context including
the AS security context. The AS security context sent to the target eNB shall
include the new derived K~eNB~*, the NCC associated to the K~eNB~*, the UE EPS
security capabilities including the security algorithms supported by the UE
and ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the source cell. The target eNB
shall check if it supports the ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the
source cell. If this is not the case, the target eNB shall send an appropriate
error message to the UE. If the check is successful the target eNB derives new
AS keys (RRC integrity key, RRC encryption key and UP keys) corresponding to
the algorithms from the received K~eNB~*, reset all PDCP COUNTs to 0 and
activates the new keys in PDCP layer. The target eNB responds with a RRC
Connection Resume message including the NCC received from source eNB to the UE
on SRB1, integrity protected in PDCP layer using the new AS keys. The RRC
Connection Resume message may include RRC connection reconfiguration
parameters as defined in TS 36.300 [30].
When the UE receives the RRC Connection Resume message, then the UE shall
check if the received NCC value is different from the current NCC value stored
in the UE itself. If the NCC values differ then the UE needs to synchronize
its locally kept NH as defined in Annex A.4. The UE then calculates a new
K~eNB~* from either the new NH (if a new NCC value was received) or the
current K~eNB~*, using the target cell's PCI and its frequency EARFCN-DL in
the target cell. The UE performs then further derivation of the AS keys (RRC
integrity key, RRC encryption key and UP keys) from the new derived K~eNB~*.
The UE checks the integrity of the RRC Connection Resume message by verifying
the MAC-I. If the verification of the MAC-I is successful, then the UE resets
all PDCP COUNTs to 0 and activates the new AS keys in PDCP layer and then
sends the RRC Connection Resume Complete message both integrity protected and
ciphered to the target eNB on SRB1.
Security is fully resumed on UE side after reception and processing of RRC
connection resume message. The UE can receive data on DRB(s) after having
received and processed RRC connection resume message. UL data on DRB(s) can be
sent after RRC Connection Resume Complete message.
**After a successful resume the target eNB shall perform Path Switch procedure
as is done in case of X2-handover.**
**When EDT feature is used, the following handling shall apply to the RRC
Connection Resume procedure.** For protection of the UL EDT data in the RRC
Connection Resume Request message and all other RRC messages following the RRC
Connection Resume Request message except RRC Connection Reject, the UE and the
source eNB shall derive a new K~eNB~*. This new K~eNB~* shall be derived using
the target PCI, target EARFCN-DL and the K~eNB~/NH based on either a
horizontal key derivation or a vertical key derivation (as defined in Clause
7.2.8.1.1 and Annex A.5) according to the NCC value sent to the UE in the RRC
Connection Suspend message. The UE and the target eNB shall further derive new
AS keys K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~, and K~UPenc~ from the newly derived K~eNB~*. The
UE and the target eNB shall use the newly derived K~UPenc~ for
ciphering/deciphering of the UL EDT data in PDCP layer in the RRC Connection
Resume Request message, and user DL data (if included) in PDCP layer in the
RRC Connection Suspend or RRC Connection Resume message. **The calculation and
verification of the** ShortResumeMAC-I shall use the (old) K~RRCint~ used in
the source cell**.**
> NOTE 1: Void.
>
> NOTE 2: Void.
Further, in case of EDT, the **RRC Connection Resume message sent by the
target eNB to the UE shall be both integrity protected and ciphered in PDCP
layer using the new AS keys (** K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~**) derived from the new
K~eNB~*. In this case, the UE shall ignore the NCC value in RRC Connection
Resume message and shall not change its K~eNB~. The UE may receive an RRC
Connection Reject message with suspend indication, instead of RRC Connection
Resume message. In that case, for the next resume to any target eNB, the UE
shall start with the same AS security context as it had when it was suspended
originally, i.e., same** K~eNB~/NH shall act as base key for derivation of new
K~eNB~*.
#### 7.2.11.4 RRC connection resume to the same eNB
The target eNB may be the same as the source eNB in the description in the
previous subclause. If so the single eNB performs the roles of both the source
and target eNB. In particular, a new K~eNB~* shall be derived even if the UE
is resuming to the same cell from where it was suspended. However, there is
the following difference.
**After a successful resume the eNB shall** send **S1-AP UE Context Resume
Request message** to the MME. **Upon reception of the S1-AP UE Context Resume
Request message the MME shall check its local policy. If the local policy in
the MME indicates that a new NH derivation is needed, the MME shall increase
its locally kept NCC value by one and compute a fresh NH from its stored data
using the function defined in Annex A.4. The MME shall store that fresh pair
and send it to the eNB in the S1-AP UE Context Resume Response message.**
**Upon receipt of the S1-AP UE Context Resume Response message from the MME
and if the message includes a {NH, NCC} pair, the eNB shall store the
fresh{NH, NCC} pair in the S1-AP UE Context Resume Response message and remove
any existing unused stored {NH, NCC} pairs. The {NH, NCC} pair may be used in
the next suspend/resume or X2-handover procedures.**
**When EDT feature is used, the single eNB performs the roles of both the
source and target eNB as described in Clause 7.2.11.3.**
## 7.3 UP security mechanisms
### 7.3.1 UP confidentiality mechanisms
The user plane data is ciphered by the PDCP protocol between the UE and the
eNB as specified in TS 36.323 [12]..
The use and mode of operation of the 128-EEA algorithms are specified in Annex
B.
The input parameters to the 128-bit EEA algorithms as described in Annex B are
an 128-bit cipher key K~UPenc~ as KEY, a 5-bit bearer identity BEARER which
value is assigned as specified by TS 36.323 [12], the 1-bit direction of
transmission DIRECTION, the length of the keystream required LENGTH and a
bearer specific, time and direction dependent 32-bit input COUNT which
corresponds to the 32-bit PDCP COUNT.
### 7.3.2 UP integrity mechanisms
This subclause applies only to the user plane on the Un interface between RN
and DeNB:
The user plane data is integrity-protected by the PDCP protocol between the RN
and the DeNB as specified in TS 36.323 [12]. Replay protection shall be
activated when integrity protection is activated. Replay protection shall
ensure that the receiver only accepts each particular incoming PDCP COUNT
value once using the same AS security context.
The use and mode of operation of the 128-EIA algorithms are specified in Annex
B.
The input parameters to the 128-bit EIA algorithms as described in Annex B are
a 128-bit integrity key K~UPint~ as KEY, a 5-bit bearer identity BEARER which
value is assigned as specified by TS 36.323 [12], the 1-bit direction of
transmission DIRECTION, and a bearer specific, time and direction dependent
32-bit input COUNT which corresponds to the 32-bit PDCP COUNT.
The supervision of failed UP integrity checks shall be performed both in the
RN and the DeNB. In case of failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or missing
MAC-I) is detected after the start of integrity protection, the concerned
message shall be discarded. This can happen on the DeNB side or on the RN
side.
NOTE: The handling of UP integrity check failures by an RN is an
implementation issue. TS 36.323 [12] intentionally does not mandate any action
for a failed integrity check (not even sending an indication of failure to
higher layers). Consequently, depending on the implementation, the message
failing integrity check is, or is not, silently discarded. This is in contrast
to the handling of a failed RRC integrity check by a UE, cf. the NOTE in
clause 7.4.1 of the present document.
## 7.4 RRC security mechanisms
### 7.4.1 RRC integrity mechanisms
RRC integrity protection shall be provided by the PDCP layer between UE and
eNB and no layers below PDCP shall be integrity protected. Replay protection
shall be activated when integrity protection is activated (except for when the
selected integrity protection algorithm is EIA0, see Annex B). Replay
protection shall ensure that the receiver only accepts each particular
incoming PDCP COUNT value once using the same AS security context.
The use and mode of operation of the 128-EIA algorithms are specified in Annex
B.
The input parameters to the 128-bit EIA algorithms as described in Annex B are
an 128-bit integrity key K~RRCint~ as KEY,~,~ a 5-bit bearer identity BEARER
which value is assigned as specified by TS 36.323 [12], the 1-bit direction of
transmission DIRECTION and a bearer specific, time and direction dependent
32-bit input COUNT which corresponds to the 32-bit PDCP COUNT.
The supervision of failed RRC integrity checks shall be performed both in the
ME and the eNB. In case of failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or missing
MAC-I) is detected after the start of integrity protection, the concerned
message shall be discarded. This can happen on the eNB side or on the ME side.
NOTE: This text does not imply that the concerned message is silently
discarded. In fact, TS 36.331 [21] specifies that the UE shall trigger a
recovery procedure upon detection of a failed RRC integrity check. When the
cause for integrity protection failure is not a context mismatch, such as a
key or HFN mismatch, the run of a recovery procedure unnecessarily adds load
to the system. However, in the absence of a means for the UE to reliably
detect the cause of an integrity protection failure and the fact that the only
identified consequence of an active attack is limited to non-persistent DoS
effects, priority was given to a procedure allowing recovery from the deadlock
caused by a context mismatch.
### 7.4.2 RRC confidentiality mechanisms
RRC confidentiality protection is provided by the PDCP layer between UE and
eNB.
The use and mode of operation of the 128-EEA algorithms are specified in Annex
B.
The input parameters to the 128-bit EEA algorithms as described in Annex B are
an 128-bit cipher Key K~RRCenc~ as KEY, a 5-bit bearer identity BEARER which
corresponds to the radio bearer identity, the 1-bit direction of transmission
DIRECTION, the length of the keystream required LENGTH and a bearer specific,
time and direction dependent 32-bit input COUNT which corresponds to the
32-bit PDCP COUNT.
### 7.4.3 K~eNB~* and Token Preparation for the RRCConnectionRe-establishment
Procedure
The K~eNB~* and token calculation at handover preparation are cell specific
instead of eNB specific. At potential RRC Connection re-establishment (e.g, in
handover failure case), the UE may select a cell different from the target
cell to initiate the re-establishment procedure. To ensure that the UE
RRCConnectionRe-establishment attempt is successful when the UE selects
another cell under the control of the target eNB at handover preparation, the
serving eNB could prepare multiple K~eNB~*s and tokens for multiple cells
which are under the control of the target eNB. The serving eNB may prepare
cells belonging to the serving eNB itself.
The preparation of these cells includes sending security context containing
K~eNB~*s and tokens for each cell to be prepared, as well as the corresponding
NCC, the UE EPS security capabilities, and the security algorithms used in the
source cell for computing the token, to the target eNB. The source eNB shall
derive the K~eNB~*s **as described in Annex A.5** based on the corresponding
target cell's physical cell ID and frequency EARFCN-DL.
In order to calculate the token, the source eNB shall use the negotiated EIA-
algorithm from the AS Security context from the source eNB with the following
inputs: source C-RNTI, source PCI and target Cell-ID as defined by V
_arShortMAC-Input_ in TS 36.331 [21], where source PCI and source C-RNTI are
associated with the cell the UE last had an active RRC connection with and
target Cell-ID is the identity of the target cell where the
RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest is sent to.
\- KEY shall be set to K~RRCint~ of the source cell;
\- all BEARER bits shall be set to 1;
\- DIRECTION bit shall be set to 1;
\- all COUNT bits shall be set to 1.
The token shall be the 16 least significant bits of the output of the used
integrity algorithm.
To avoid that the UE cannot perform the RRC re-establishment procedure if
there is a failure during a handover or a connection re-establishment, the UE
shall keep the K~eNB~ used in the source cell until the handover or a
connection re-establishment has completed successfully or until the UE has
deleted the K~eNB~ due to other rules in this specification (e.g., due to
transitioning to ECM-IDLE).
For X2 handover, the target eNB shall use these received multiple K~eNB~*s.
But for S1 handover, the target eNB discards the multiple K~eNB~*s received
from the source eNB, and derives the K~eNB~*s **as described in Annex A.5**
based on the received fresh {NH, NCC} pair from MME for forward security
purpose.
When an RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest is initiated by the UE, the
RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest shall contain the token corresponding to
the cell the UE tries to reconnect to. This message is transmitted over SRB0
and hence not integrity protected.
The target eNB receiving the RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest shall respond
with an RRCConnectionReestablishment message containing the NCC received
during the preparation phase if the token is valid, otherwise the target eNB
shall reply with an RRCConnectionReestablishmentReject message. The
RRCConnectionReestablishment and RRCConnectionReestablishmentReject messages
are also sent on SRB0 and hence not integrity protected. Next the target eNB
and UE shall do the following:~.~The UE shall **firstly synchronize the
locally kept NH parameter as defined in Annex A.4 if the received NCC value is
different from the current NCC value in the UE itself. Then the UE shall**
derive K~eNB~* **as described in Annex A.5** based on the selected cell's
physical cell ID and its frequency EARFCN-DL. The UE shall use this K~eNB~* as
K~eNB~. The eNB uses the K~eNB~* corresponding to the selected cell as K~eNB~.
Then, UE and eNB shall derive and activate keys for integrity protection and
verification from this K~eNB~ and the AS algorithms (ciphering and integrity
algorithms) obtained during handover preparation procedures which were used in
source eNB. Even if the AS algorithms used by the source eNB do not match with
the target eNB local algorithm priority list the source eNB selected AS
algorithms shall take precedence when running the RRCConnectionRe-
establishment procedure. The target eNB and UE should refresh the selected AS
algorithms and the AS keys based on local prioritized algorithms after the
RRCConnectionRe-establishment procedure.
NOTE: When the AS algorithms transferred by source eNB are not supported by
the target eNB, the target eNB will fail to decipher or integrity verify the
RRCReestablishmentComplete message on SRB1. As a result, the RRCConnectionRe-
establishment procedure will fail.
The UE shall respond with an RRCReestablishmentComplete on SRB1, integrity
protected and ciphered using these new keys. The RRCConnectionReconfiguration
procedure used to re-establish the remaining radio bearers shall only include
integrity protected and ciphered messages.
### 7.4.4 RRCConnectionRe-establishment Procedure for Control Plane CIoT EPS
optimisation
If the UE experience a RLF when using Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation
only, the AS layer of the UE may trigger an RRCConnectionReestablishment
procedure. As there is no AS security available, this procedure can not be
protected as described in subclause 7.4.3.
In order to protect the the re-establishment procedure, the AS part of the UE
triggers the NAS part of the UE to provide the UL_NAS_MAC and XDL_NAS_MAC.
These parameter are used to show that the UE is requesting the re-
establishment and that the UE is talking to a genuine network repsectively.
The UE calculates a UL_NAS_MAC and XDL_NAS_MAC by using the curently used NAS
integrity algorithm with the following inputs, K~NASint~ as the key, the
uplink NAS COUNT that would be used for the next uplink NAS message, the
DIRECTION bit set to 0 and the target Cell-ID as the message to be protected
to calculate NAS-MAC (see Annex B.2.1).
The uplink NAS COUNT is increased by the UE in exactly the same way as if it
had sent a NAS message. The first 16 bits of NAS-MAC form UL_NAS_MAC and the
last 16 bits form XDL_NAS_MAC, which is stored by the UE.
The UE shall send the RRCConntectionRestablishmentRequest message to the
target eNB and shall include S-TMSI, the 5 least significant bits (LSB) of the
NAS COUNT that was used to calculate NAS-MAC and UL_NAS_MAC in the message.
The target eNB recognises the RRCConntectionRestablishmentRequest message sent
by a UE relates to the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation based on the
presence of the S-TMSI in the message. The target eNB shall send the S-TMSI,
LSB of NAS COUNT, UL_NAS_MAC and target Cell-ID in the eNB CP Relocation
Indication message to the MME that is serving the UE (this can be deteremined
by the S-TMSI).
The MME uses LSB of NAS COUNT to estimate the full uplink NAS COUNT and
calculates XNAS-MAC (see Annex B.2.1) using the same inputs (i.e. estimated
uplink NAS COUNT, DIRECTION bit set to 0 and the target Cell-ID as the
message) as the UE used for calculating NAS-MAC. The MME then compares the
received UL_NAS_MAC with the first 16 bits of XNAS-MAC and if these are equal
the network is sure that the geniune UE sent the
RRCConntectionRestablishmentRequest message. The stored uplink NAS COUNT in
the MME is set as though the MME received a sucessfully protected NAS message
using that NAS COUNT.
The MME shall set DL_NAS_MAC to the last 16 bits of already calculated XNAS-
MAC and send DL_NAS_MAC to the target eNB in the Connection Establishment
Indication message. The target eNB shall send the DL_NAS_MAC to the UE in the
RRCConnectionReestablisment message. The UE shall check that the received
DL_NAS_MAC equal to the stored XDL_NAS_MAC. If so, the UE shall complete the
re-establishment procedure.
### 7.4.5 RRC UE capability transfer procedure
The network should activate AS security (i.e., perform a successful AS SMC
procedure) before running the RRC UE capability transfer procedure.With the
exception of unauthenticated emergency calls and the UEs using Control plane
CIoT optimization, if the network had acquired UE capabilities using RRC UE
capability transfer procedure before AS security activation, then the network
shall not store them locally for later use and shall not send them to other
network entities. In that case, the network shall re-run the RRC UE capability
transfer procedure after a successful AS SMC procedure.
## 7.5 Signalling procedure for periodic local authentication
The following procedure is used optionally by the eNB to periodically perform
a local authentication. At the same time, the amount of data sent during the
AS connection is periodically checked by the eNB and the UE for both up and
down streams. If UE receives the Counter Check request, it shall respond with
Counter Check Response message.
The eNB is monitoring the PDCP COUNT values associated to each radio bearer.
The procedure is triggered whenever any of these values reaches a critical
checking value. The granularity of these checking values and the values
themselves are defined by the visited network. All messages in the procedure
are integrity protected.
Figure 7.5-1: eNB periodic local authentication procedure
1\. When a checking value is reached (e.g. the value in some fixed bit
position in the hyperframe number is changed), a Counter Check message is sent
by the eNB. The Counter Check message contains the most significant parts of
the PDCP COUNT values (which reflect amount of data sent and received) from
each active radio bearer.
2\. The UE compares the PDCP COUNT values received in the Counter Check
message with the values of its radio bearers. Different UE PDCP COUNT values
are included within the Counter Check Response message.
3\. If the eNB receives a counter check response message that does not contain
any PDCP COUNT values, the procedure ends. If the eNB receives a counter check
response that contains one or several PDCP COUNT values, the eNB may release
the connection or report the difference of the PDCP COUNT values for the
serving MME or O&M server for further traffic analysis for e.g. detecting the
attacker.
# 8 Security mechanisms for non-access stratum signalling and data via MME
## 8.0 General
The statements relating to UEs in clause 8 apply also to RNs regarding the
security between a relay node and its MME.
Clause 8 also applies to the security procedures for data sent via the MME.
## 8.1 NAS integrity mechanisms
Integrity protection for NAS signalling messages shall be provided as part of
the NAS protocol.
### 8.1.1 NAS input parameters and mechanism
Input parameters to the NAS 128-bit integrity algorithms as described in Annex
B are an 128-bit integrity key K~NASint~ as KEY~,~ an 5-bit bearer identity
BEARER which shall equal the constant value 0x00, the direction of
transmission DIRECTION, and a bearer specific, time and direction dependent
32-bit input COUNT which is constructed as follows:
COUNT := 0x00 \|\| NAS OVERFLOW \|\| NAS SQN
Where
\- the leftmost 8 bits are padding bits including all zeros.
\- NAS OVERFLOW is a 16-bit value which is incremented each time the NAS SQN
is incremented from the maximum value.
\- NAS SQN is the 8-bit sequence number carried within each NAS message.
NOTE: The BEARER identity is not necessary since there is only one NAS
signalling connection per pair of MME and UE, but is included as a constant
value so that the input parameters for AS and NAS will be the same, which
simplifies specification and implementation work.
The use and mode of operation of the 128-bit integrity algorithms are
specified in Annex B.
The supervision of failed NAS integrity checks shall be performed both in the
ME and the MME. In case of failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or missing NAS-
MAC) is detected after the start of NAS integrity protection, the concerned
message shall be discarded except for some NAS messages specified in TS 24.301
[9]. For those exceptions the MME shall take the actions specified in TS
24.301 [9] when receiving a NAS message with faulty or missing NAS-MAC.
Discarding NAS messages can happen on the MME side or on the ME side.
### 8.1.2 NAS integrity activation
NAS integrity shall be activated using the NAS SMC procedure or after a
handover to E-UTRAN from UTRAN/GERAN. Replay protection shall be activated
when integrity protection is activated (except for when the selected integrity
protection algorithm is EIA0, see Annex B). Replay protection shall ensure
that the receiver only accepts each particular incoming NAS COUNT value once
using the same NAS security context. Once NAS integrity has been activated,
NAS messages without integrity protection shall not be accepted by the UE or
MME. Before NAS integrity has been activated, NAS messages without integrity
protection shall only be accepted by the UE or MME in certain cases where it
is not possible to apply integrity protection as specified in TS 24.301 [9].
While some NAS messages such as reject messages need to be accepted by the UE
without integrity protection, the MME shall only send a reject message that
causes the CSG list on the UE to be modified after the start of NAS security.
The UE shall discard any message modifying the CSG list if it is not integrity
protected.
NAS integrity stays activated until the EPS security context is deleted in
either the UE or MME. In particular the NAS service request shall always be
integrity protected and the NAS attach request message shall be integrity
protected if the EPS security context is not deleted while UE is in EMM-
DEREGISTERED. The length of the NAS-MAC is 32 bit. The full NAS-MAC shall be
appended to all integrity protected messages except for the NAS service
request. Only the 16 least significant bits of the 32 bit NAS-MAC shall be
appended to the NAS service request message.
The use and mode of operation of the 128-EIA algorithms are specified in Annex
B.
## 8.2 NAS confidentiality mechanisms
The input parameters for the NAS 128-bit ciphering algorithms shall be the
same as the ones used for NAS integrity protection as described in clause 8.1,
with the exception that a different key, K~NASenc~ , is used as KEY, and there
is an additional input parameter, namely the length of the key stream to be
generated by the encryption algorithms.
If UE in EMM-IDLE mode uses Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation for data
transport, an initial plain NAS message including user data needs to be
partially ciphered (see subclause 4.4.5 of TS 24.301 [9]) with the same
encryption algorithm that was agreed during the NAS SMC exchange. In this case
the length of the key stream is set to the length of the part of the initial
plain NAS message that is to be ciphered.
The use and mode of operation of the 128-bit ciphering algorithms are
specified in Annex B.
NOTE: In the context of the present subclause, a message is considered
ciphered also when the NULL encryption algorithm EEA0 is applied.
# 9 Security interworking between E-UTRAN and UTRAN
## 9.1 RAU and TAU procedures
### 9.1.1 RAU procedures in UTRAN
This subclause covers both the cases of idle mode mobility from E-UTRAN to
UTRAN and of Idle Mode Signaling Reduction (ISR), as defined in TS 23.401 [2].
NOTE 1: TS 23.401 states conditions under which a valid P-TMSI or a P-TMSI
that is mapped from a valid GUTI (\"mapped GUTI\") is inserted in the
Information Element \"old P-TMSI\" in the Routing Area Update Request. It
depends on the old P-TMSI which security context can be taken into use after
completion of the Routing Area Update procedure.
**Use of an existing UMTS security context**
If the UE sends the RAU Request with the \"old P-TMSI\" Information Element
including a valid P-TMSI it shall also include the KSI relating to this
P-TMSI. This KSI is associated with the UMTS security context stored on the
UE, and it indicates this fact to the SGSN. In this case the UE shall include
P-TMSI signature into the RAU Request if a P-TMSI signature was assigned by
the old SGSN. If the network does not have a valid security context for this
KSI it shall run AKA. In case of an SGSN change keys from the old SGSN shall
overwrite keys in the new SGSN if any.
NOTE 2: if the UE has a valid UMTS security context then this context is
stored on the USIM according to TS 33.102 [4].
**Mapping of EPS security context to UMTS security context**
If the UE sends the RAU Request with the \"old P-TMSI\" Information Element
including mapped GUTI it shall also include the KSI equal to the value of the
eKSI associated with the current EPS security context (cf. clause 3). The UE
shall include a truncated NAS-token, as defined in this clause further below,
into the P-TMSI signature IE. The MME shall transfer UE\'s UTRAN and GERAN
security capabilities and CK\' \|\| IK\' with KSI equal to the value of the
eKSI associated with the current EPS security context to SGSN with Context
Response/SGSN Context Response message. The MME and UE shall derive CK\' and
IK\' from the K~ASME~ and the NAS uplink COUNT value corresponding to the
truncated NAS-token received by the MME from SGSN as specified in clause A.13.
Keys CK\' and IK\' and KSI sent from the MME shall replace all the UTRAN PS
key parameters CK, IK, s KSI in the target SGSN if any. Keys CK\' and IK\' and
the KSI shall replace all the currently stored UTRAN PS key parameters CK, IK,
KSI values on both USIM and ME. The handling of START~PS~ shall comply with
the rules in 3GPP TS 25.331 [24]. The UE may set the START~PS~ value to 0 if
it is done before establishment of the RRC connection.
The ME shall use CK\' and IK\' to derive the GPRS Kc using the c3 function
specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [4]. The ME shall assign the eKSI value
(associated with CK' and IK') to the GPRS CKSN. The ME shall update the USIM
and ME with the new GPRS Kc and GPRS CKSN.
NOTE 3: The new derived security context (including CK' and IK') replacing the
old stored values in the USIM is for allowing to reuse the derived security
context without invoking the authentication procedure in the subsequent
connection set-ups , and also for avoiding that one KSI indicates to two
different key sets and consequently leads to security context
desynchronization.
NOTE 4: An operator concerned about the security of keys received from another
operator may want to enforce a policy in SGSN to run a UMTS AKA as soon as
possible after the run of an idle mode mobility procedure. An example of
ensuring this is the deletion of the mapped UMTS security context in the SGSN
after the completion of the idle mode mobility procedure.
NOTE 5: Due to replacing all the UTRAN PS key parameters CK, IK, KSI with CK',
IK' and eKSI on USIM and in ME, a new GPRS Kc needs to be derived from the new
UTRAN PS key parameters CK and IK (i.e. CK' and IK'), which is part of the new
UMTS security context as well, as any old GPRS Kc stored on USIM and in ME
belongs to an old UMTS security context and can no longer be taken into use.
SGSN shall include the allowed security algorithm and transfer them to RNC. An
SMC shall be sent to the UE containing the selected algorithms.
The 16 least significant bits available in the P-TMSI signature field shall be
filled with the truncated NAS-token according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [3].The
truncated NAS-token is defined as the 16 least significant bits of the NAS-
token.
The NAS-token is derived as specified in Annex A.9. The UE shall use the
uplink NAS COUNT value that it would use in the next NAS message to calculate
the NAS-token and increase the stored uplink NAS COUNT value by 1.
SGSN shall forward the P-TMSI signature including the truncated NAS token to
the old MME, which compares the received bits of the truncated NAS-token with
the corresponding bits of a NAS-token generated in the MME, for the UE
identified within the context request. If they match, the context request
message is authenticated and authorized and MME shall provide the needed
information for the SGSN. Old MME shall respond with an appropriate error
cause if it does not match the value stored in the old MME. This should
initiate the security functions in the new SGSN.
To avoid possible race condition problems, the MME shall compare the received
truncated NAS-token with the 16 least significant bits of NAS-tokens generated
from the current NAS uplink COUNT value up to current NAS uplink COUNT value
+L, i.e. the interval [current NAS uplink COUNT, current NAS uplink COUNT+L].
A suitable value for the parameter L can be configured by the network
operator. MME shall not accept the same NAS-token for the same UE twice except
in retransmission cases happening for the same mobility event. If the MME
finds a match, it shall set the stored uplink NAS COUNT value as though it had
successfully received an integrity protected NAS message with the uplink NAS
COUNT value that created the match.
### 9.1.2 TAU procedures in E-UTRAN
This subclause covers both the cases of idle mode mobility from UTRAN to
E-UTRAN and of Idle Mode Signaling Reduction, as defined in TS 23.401 [2].
The TAU Request and ATTACH Request message shall include the UE security
capabilities. The MME shall store these UE security capabilities for future
use. The MME shall not make use of any UE security capabilities received from
the SGSN.
In this procedure, the START values shall be kept in the volatile memory of
the ME, cf. also clause 6.8.11 of TS 33.102 [4].
NOTE 1: TS 23.401 states conditions under which a valid GUTI or a GUTI that is
mapped from a valid P-TMSI is inserted in the Information Element \"old GUTI\"
in the Tracking Area Update Request. The value in the \"old\" GUTI IE informs
the MME, which SGSN/MME to fetch the UE context from.
**Case 1: P-TMSI not included in \"old GUTI\" IE in TAU Request**
This case is identical to that described in clause 7.2.7.
**Case 2: Mapped P-TMSI included in \"old GUTI\" IE in TAU Request**
The UE shall include in the TAU Request:
\- the KSI with corresponding P-TMSI and old RAI to point to the right source
SGSN and key set there. This allows the UE and MME to generate the mapped EPS
NAS security context, as described below, if current EPS NAS security context
is not available in the UE and network. The KSI shall correspond to the set of
keys most recently generated (either by a successful UMTS AKA run in UTRAN
(which may or may not yet have been taken into use by the UE and SGSN) or a
UMTS security context mapped from an EPS NAS security context during a
previous visit in UTRAN).
\- a P-TMSI signature, if the UE was previously connected to UTRAN where the
SGSN assigned a P-TMSI signature to the UE
\- a 32bit NONCE~UE~ (see clause A.11 for requirements on the randomness of
NONCE~UE~).
If the UE has a current EPS NAS security context, then it shall include the
corresponding eKSI value and if it exists, the corresponding GUTI, in the TAU
Request. If the UE includes the eKSI, but not the corresponding GUTI, the MME
may treat the TAU request as if the EPS NAS security context did not exist.
The TAU Request shall be integrity-protected, but not confidentiality-
protected. The UE shall use the current EPS NAS security context algorithms to
protect the TAU Request message.
NOTE 2: The current EPS NAS security context may be of type \"mapped\", and
hence the value of the eKSI be of type \"KSI~SGSN~\". This value of KSI~SGSN~
may be different from the KSI pointing to the set of keys most recently
generated in UTRAN as an UMTS AKA run may have happened in UTRAN after the
current mapped EPS NAS security context indicated by the eKSI with the value
KSI~SGSN~ was generated
NOTE 3: The UE has a current EPS NAS security context in the following
scenario: a UE established a current EPS NAS security context during a
previous visit to EPS, then moves to UTRAN/GERAN from E-UTRAN and storing the
current EPS NAS security context. When the UE moves back to E-UTRAN there is a
current EPS NAS security context.
If a current EPS NAS security context is not available in the UE, the UE shall
send the TAU request unprotected.
If the MME received a P-TMSI signature from the UE, the MME shall include that
P-TMSI signature in the Context Request message sent to the SGSN. The SGSN
shall transfer CK \|\| IK to MME in the Context Response/SGSN Context Response
message. In case the MM context in the Context Response/SGSN Context Response
indicates GSM security mode, the MME shall abort the procedure.
In case the TAU Request was protected and the MME has the indicated EPS NAS
security context it shall verify the TAU Request message. If it is successful,
the UE and the MME share a current EPS NAS security context. In case the TAU
Request had the active flag set or the MME chooses to establish radio bearers
when there is pending downlink UP data or pending downlink signalling, K~eNB~
is calculated as described in clause 7.2.7.
If the MME wants to change the algorithms, the MME shall use a NAS security
mode procedure (see clause 7.2.4.4).
If the MME does not have the EPS NAS security context indicated by the eKSI by
the UE in the TAU request, or the TAU request was received unprotected, the
MME shall create a new mapped EPS NAS security context (that shall become the
current EPS NAS security context). In this case, the MME shall generate a
32bit NONCE~MME~ (see clause A.10 for requirements on the randomness of
NONCE~MME~)~.~ and use the received NONCE~UE~ with the NONCE~MME~ to generate
a fresh mapped K\'~ASME~ from CK and IK, where CK, IK were identified by the
KSI and P-TMSI in the TAU Request. See Annex A.11 for more information on how
to derive the fresh K\'~ASME~. The MME initiates a NAS Security mode command
procedure with the UE as described in clause 7.2.4.4 including the KSI~SGSN~,
NONCE~UE~, and NONCE~MME~ in the NAS Security mode command. The uplink and
downlink NAS COUNT for mapped EPS NAS security context shall be set to start
value (i.e., 0) when new mapped EPS NAS security context is created in UE and
MME.
If the TAU Request had the active flag set or the MME chooses to establish
radio bearers when there is pending downlink UP data or pending downlink
signalling, the uplink NAS Count which is set to zero shall be used to derive
the K~eNB~ in MME and UE as specified in clause A.3. MME shall deliver the
K~eNB~ to the target eNB on the S1 interface.
The TAU Accept shall be protected using the current EPS NAS security context.
## 9.2 Handover
### 9.2.1 From E-UTRAN to UTRAN
NAS and AS security shall always be activated before handover from E-UTRAN to
UTRAN can take place. Consequently the source system in the handover shall
always send a key set to the target system during handover. The security
policy of the target PLMN determines the selected algorithms to be used within
the UTRAN HO command.
NOTE : The security activation in target system is not the same as handover
within E-UTRAN. Only the ciphering algorithm is indicated within the UTRAN HO
command. The confidentiality protection begins immediately upon UE reception
of the UTRAN HO command while the integrity protection in UTRAN is activated
by SMC procedure following the handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN. Further details
are in 3GPP TS 25.331 [24].
The MME shall select the current NAS downlink COUNT value to use in the
handover and then increase the stored NAS downlink COUNT value by 1.
NOTE 0: Increasing the NAS downlink COUNT by 1 is to ensure that a fresh NAS
downlink COUNT is used for any future purposes.
UE and MME shall derive a confidentiality key CK\', and an integrity key IK\'
from the K~ASME~ and the selected NAS downlink COUNT value of the current EPS
key security context with the help of a one-way key derivation function KDF as
specified in clause A.8.
Whether UTRAN PS key ciphering is considered active in the target UTRAN after
handover from E-UTRAN shall be determined according to the principles for
handover to UTRAN in TS 25.331 [24].
UE and MME shall assign the value of eKSI to KSI. MME shall transfer CK\' \|\|
IK\' with KSI to SGSN. The target SGSN shall replace all stored parameters CK,
IK, KSI, if any, with CK\' , IK\', KSI received from the MME. The UE shall
replace all stored parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any, with CK\' , IK\', KSI in
both ME and USIM. START~PS~ shall comply with the rules in 3GPP TS 25.331
[24]. The ME shall use CK' and IK' to derive the GPRS Kc using the c3 function
specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [4]. The ME shall assign the eKSI value
(associated with CK' and IK') to the GPRS CKSN. The ME shall update the USIM
and ME with the GPRS Kc and GPRS CKSN.
NOTE 1: The new mapped UMTS security context (including CK', and IK' )
replacing the stored values in the USIM and ME, is for allowing to reuse the
mapped UMTS security context without invoking the authentication procedure in
subsequent connection set-ups, and also for avoiding that one KSI value gets
associated with two different key sets and consequently leads to UMTS security
context desynchronization.
NOTE 2: An operator concerned about the security of keys received from an
E-UTRAN of another operator may want to enforce a policy in SGSN to run a UMTS
AKA as soon as possible after the handover. One example of ensuring this is
the deletion of the mapped UMTS security context in the SGSN after the UE has
left active state in UMTS.
NOTE 3: Due to replacing all the UTRAN PS key parameters CK, IK, KSI with CK',
IK' and eKSI on USIM and in ME, a new GPRS Kc needs to be derived from the new
UTRAN PS key parameters CK and IK (i.e. CK' and IK'), which is part of the new
UMTS security context as well, as any old GPRS Kc stored on USIM and in ME,
belongs to an old UMTS security context and can no longer be taken into use.
After HO from E-UTRAN to UTRAN the current EPS NAS security context shall (if
it is kept ) be considered as the current one in E-UTRAN in the UE and the
MME.
MME shall also provide at least the 4 LSB of the selected NAS downlink COUNT
value to the source eNB, which then shall include the bits in the
MobilityFromE-UTRANCommand to the UE. The UE shall use the received 4 LSB and
its stored NAS downlink COUNT to estimate the NAS downlink COUNT selected by
the MME.
NOTE 4: It is left to the implementation how to estimate the NAS downlink
COUNT.
The UE shall ensure that the estimated NAS downlink COUNT has not been used to
calculate a CK\' and IK\' in a previous successful or unsuccessful PS or SRVCC
handover. If the estimated NAS downlink COUNT is greater than all the
estimated NAS downlink COUNTs either used by the UE for key derivation in a
handover or received in a NAS message that passed its integrity check, the UE
shall update its stored NAS downlink COUNT as though it has successfully
integrity checked a NAS message with that estimated NAS downlink COUNT. In
particular, the stored NAS downlink COUNT shall never be decreased.
MME shall transfer the UE security capabilities to the SGSN. The selection of
the algorithms in the target system proceeds as described in TS 33.102 [4] for
UTRAN.
If the handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped UMTS security
context can not be used in the future. The SGSN shall delete the new mapped
UMTS security context and the stored UMTS security context which has the same
KSI as the new mapped UMTS security context.
### 9.2.2 From UTRAN to E-UTRAN
#### 9.2.2.1 Procedure
The procedure for handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN, as far as relevant for
security, proceeds in the following two consecutive steps:
A) Handover signalling using the mapped EPS security context (cf. also Figure
9.2.2.1-1);
B) Subsequent NAS signalling to determine whether a native EPS security
context can be taken in use (not shown in Figure 9.2.2.1-1).
In this procedure, the START values shall be kept in the volatile memory of
the ME, cf. also clause 6.8.11 of TS 33.102 [4].
The activation of NAS and AS security in E-UTRAN, and selection of the key set
from the source system for the handover shall be according to following
principles:
i) As described for inter-SGSN PS handover cases in TS 33.102 [4], the source
SGSN shall select the key set most recently generated (either by a successful
UMTS AKA run in UTRAN (which may or may not yet have been taken into use by
the UE and SGSN) or a UMTS security context mapped from an EPS security
context during a previous visit to UTRAN) and transfer this key set to the MME
in the Forward Relocation Request.
NOTE 0: The MME is considered as a target SGSN in case of Gn/Gp interface.
ii) Activation of AS security (for details cf. TS 36.331 [21]):
The E-UTRAN HO command received at the UE shall activate AS security.
The HO Complete received at the eNB shall activate AS security.
iii) Activation of NAS security (for details cf. TS 24.301 [9]):
The E-UTRAN HO command received at the UE shall activate NAS security.
The HO Notify received at the MME shall activate NAS security. In case the MME
does not have the UE security capabilities stored from a previous visit, then
no NAS message shall be sent or accepted by the MME other than a TAU request
before a successful check of the UE security capabilities in the TAU request
was performed by the MME.
iv) Both AS and NAS ciphering and integrity protection algorithms shall be
selected according to the policy of the target PLMN.
The above four principles consequentially always activate ciphering
(potentially NULL ciphering) in E-UTRAN even if it was not active in the
source system.
Figure 9.2.2.1-1: Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN
**A) Handover signalling in case of successful handover**
Before attempting a handover for a UE, the source RNC may check if the UE is
authenticated using UMTS AKA. If the UE is not authenticated using UMTS AKA
and the UE does not have an ongoing emergency call, then the source RNC may
decide not to perform a handover to E-UTRAN (to avoid triggering unnecessary
handover attempts to E-UTRAN which will be rejected by the target MME). The
check can be performed by analysing the active CK and IK as follows:
\- If the 64 most significant bits of the CK are not identical to the 64 least
significant bits of the CK, the RNC can deduce that the UE was authenticated
via UMTS AKA. (The bits are identical if the CK is derived from a Kc via the
c4 key conversion function [4], and it is very unlikely that they are equal
for a CK derived from UMTS AKA.)
\- If the 64 most significant bits of the CK are identical to the 64 list
significant bits of the CK, the RNC can further check if the IK fulfils the
equation given by the c5 key conversion function [4]. If the IK does not
fulfil this equation, the RNC can deduce that the UE was authenticated with
UMTS AKA, and if the IK does, then the RNC can deduce that the UE was
authenticated using GSM AKA.
If the source RNC does not conclude that the UE is authenticated using UMTS
AKA, the source RNC may select an appropriate network for the UE at the
handover decision stage and may send a Relocation Required message to the
SGSN. This message does not contain any security-relevant parameters.
  1. The SGSN shall transfer MM context (including CK and IK (or the Kc), KSI and the UE security capabilities) to MME in the Forward relocation request message. In case the MM context in the Forward relocation request message indicates GSM security mode(i.e., it contains a Kc), the MME shall abort the non-emergency call procedure. The UE security capabilities, including the UE EPS security capabilities, were sent by the UE to the SGSN via the UE Network Capability IE, in Attach Request and RAU Request. It is possible that an SGSN does not forward the UE EPS security capabilities to the MME. When the MME does not receive UE EPS security capabilities from the SGSN, the MME shall assume that the following default set of EPS security algorithms is supported by the UE (and shall set the UE EPS security capabilities in the mapped EPS NAS security context according to this default set):
a. EEA0, 128-EEA1 and 128-EEA2 for NAS signalling ciphering, RRC signalling
ciphering and UP ciphering;
b. 128-EIA1 and 128-EIA2 for NAS signalling integrity protection and RRC
signalling integrity protection.
NOTE 1: When an EPS algorithm is specified which is not part of the default
set, the MME cannot assume that a UE handing over from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN
will support that algorithm in the case that the SGSN does not support
transfer of the UE's EPS security capabilities to the MME. In this case the
MME will select one of the algorithms from the default set instead at
handover, and can then switch to the algorithm that is not part of the default
set after the MME has received the UE EPS security capabilities from the UE in
the Tracking Area Update request.If the operator requires that an algorithm
that is not part of the default set has to be taken into use immediately after
handover from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN, then the operator has to upgrade the
SGSNs to support transfer of the UE EPS security capabilities to the MME.
NOTE 1a: If the UE has an unauthenticated IMS Emergency Service **without
integrity protection** ongoing before the IRAT handover to LTE, the SGSN must
be Rel-9 + and thus be able to forward the UE EPS security capabilities
including EIA0 to the MME. In this case the MME would select EIA0 algorithm.
  1. The MME shall create a NONCE~MME~ to be used in the K\'~ASME~ derivation (see clause A.10 for requirements on the randomness of NONCE~MME~)~..~ MME shall derive K\'~ASME~ from CK and IK with the help of a one-way key derivation function as defined in clause A.10 and associate it with a Key Set Identifier KSI~SGSN~. The value field of the KSI~SGSN~ shall be derived by assigning the KSI corresponding to the set of keys most recently generated (either by a successful UMTS AKA run in UTRAN (which may or may not yet have been taken into use by the UE and the SGSN) or a UMTS security context mapped from an EPS security context during a previous visit in UTRAN). MME shall derive K~eNB~ from K\'~ASME~ using the key derivation function defined in clause A.3. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context shall be set to start value (i.e. 0) in the MME.
  2. MME shall select the NAS security algorithms (including ciphering and integrity protection) which have the highest priority from its configured list and are also present in the UE EPS security capabilities, MME shall derive the NAS keys from K\'~ASME~ using the algorithm types and algorithm IDs as input to the NAS key derivation functions(see Annex A.7), MME shall include KSI~SGSN~, NONCE~MME~ , the selected NAS security algorithms in the NAS Security Transparent Container IE of S1 HO Request message to the target eNB. MME further shall include K~eNB~ and the UE EPS security capabilities, either the capabilities received from the SGSN or, in the absence of these, the default set of EPS security algorithms, in the S1 HO Request message to the target eNB.
  3. The target eNB shall select the AS algorithms (including ciphering for both RRC and UP, and integrity protection for RRC ) which have the highest priority from its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security capabilities. The target eNB shall create a transparent container (RRCConnectionReconfiguration) including the selected RRC, UP algorithms and the NAS Security Transparent Container IE, and send it in the S1 HO Request Ack message towards the MME. The eNB shall derive the RRC and UP from K~eNB~ using the key derivation function defined in clause A.7.
NOTE 2: This transparent container is not protected by the target eNB.
  1. MME shall include the transparent container received from the target eNB in the FW Relocation Response message sent to SGSN.
  2. SGSN shall include the transparent container in the relocation command sent to the RNC.
  3. The RNC shall include the transparent container in the UTRAN HO command sent to the UE.
NOTE 3: The UTRAN HO command is integrity protected and optionally ciphered as
specified by TS 33.102 [4].
  1. The UE shall derive K\'~ASME~, associate it with KSI~SGSN~ and derive K~eNB~ in the same way the MME did in step 2 The UE shall also derive the NAS key as the MME did in step 3 and the RRC and UP keys as the eNB did in step 4. The UE shall send a RRCConnectionReconfiguration Complete messages to the eNB. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context shall be set to start value (i.e. 0) in the UE.
  2. The mapped EPS security context shall become the current (cf. subclause 3.1) EPS security context at AS and NAS level and overwrite any existing current mapped EPS security context. If the current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non-current EPS security context. The HO Complete messages and all following AS messages in E-UTRAN shall be ciphered and integrity protected according to the policy of the target PLMN.
If the handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped EPS security
context can not be used in the future. The MME shall delete the new mapped EPS
security context.
**B) Subsequent NAS signalling**
In order to prevent that successful bidding down on the UE security
capabilities in a previous RAT have an effect on the selection of EPS security
algorithm for NAS and AS, the UE security capabilities shall be included in
the TAU request after IRAT-HO and be verified by the MME.
NOTE 4: Any TAU request following the handover will be integrity protected.
Details are described in subclause 9.2.2.1
In any case UE security capability information received from the UE overwrites
any capabilities received with the context transfer as specified in TS 23.401
[2].
It can happen that the MME receives different UE EPS security capabilities in
the TAU Request from the already stored UE EPS security capabilities in MME
(received from the source SGSN or the default UE EPS security capabilities
when MME uses the default set of EPS security algorithms for the UE according
to A) step 1 above). If it happens, the MME shall perform as follows:
\- In case the TAU Request contains a higher priority NAS algorithm (according
to the priority list stored in the MME), the MME run a NAS security mode
command procedure to change the NAS algorithms according to subclause 7.2.4.4.
\- MME shall send an S1 CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to inform the eNB
about the correct UE EPS security capabilities.
The eNB shall trigger a change of AS algorithms if the received UE EPS
security capabilities from the S1 CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message would
contain higher priority AS algorithm (according to the priority list stored in
the eNB).
1 If the MME has native security context for the UE and does not receive a TAU
request within a certain period after the HO it shall assume that UE and MME
share a native security context.
NOTE 5: A TAU procedure following handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN is mandatory
if the Tracking Area has changed, but optional otherwise, cf. TS 23.401[2].
2 When the UE sends a TAU request it shall protect the request using the
mapped EPS security context identified by KSI~SGSN~. The UE shall also include
KSI~ASME~ in the TAU request if and only if it has native EPS security
context. The KSI~ASME~ shall be accompanied by a GUTI. When the MME receives a
TAU request with a KSI~ASME~ and GUTI corresponding to the non-current native
EPS security context stored on that MME it knows that UE and MME share a non-
current native EPS security context.
3 Void.
4 When the MME receives a TAU request without a KSI~ASME~ it shall delete any
non-current native EPS security context for any GUTI it may have for the user
who sent the TAU request.
5 If the MME shares the non-current native EPS security context indexed by the
KSI~ASME~ and GUTI from the TAU Request with the UE, the MME may run a NAS
security mode command procedure with the UE to activate the non-current native
EPS NAS security context according to clause 7.2.9.4. The MME may in addition
change the K~eNB~ on the fly according to clause 7.2.9.2. In case the GUTI
received in the TAU Request message pointed to a different MME, the allocation
of a new GUTI, replacing the received GUTI, and the association of this new
GUTI with KSI~ASME~ is required.
6 Void.
NOTE 6: The TAU Request is integrity protected with the mapped EPS security
context even if the UE and the MME share a non-current native EPSsecurity
context since the UE cannot know for sure if the MME still has the non-current
native EPS security context at the time of sending the TAU Request.
7 When the MME knows, after having completed the TAU procedure in the
preceding steps, that it shares a non-current native EPS security context with
the UE, the MME may (depending on configured policy and if the MME did not do
it already in step 5) activate this non-current native EPS security context.
This activation may occur in three ways:
a When the UE has cryptographically protected radio bearers established: the
MME shall initiate a key change on the fly procedure according to subclause
7.2.9 for the entire EPS key hierarchy.
b After the next transition to ECM-IDLE state following the handover from
UTRAN: Upon receiving the first message from the UE after the UE has gone to
ECM-IDLE state the MME shall use the procedures defined in subclauses 7.2.4.4
and 7.2.4.5 to activate the non-current native EPS security context if such
exists.
c At the next transition to EMM-DEREGISTERED (see clause 7.2.5.1).
8 If a non-current native EPS security context has been established, then the
UE and the MME shall delete the mapped EPS security context and set the non-
current native EPS security context to the current EPS security context.
> 9 If the SN id changed during the IRAT handover, the MME shall delay
> authenticating the UE until after the network has concluded that the UE has
> received the TAU Accept message which contains the current SN id. Doing this
> ensures that the UE and the MME use the same SN id in the KASME derivation.
NOTE 7: The run of a NAS SMC procedure ensures that the uplink NAS COUNT has
increased since the last time a K~eNB~ was derived from the K~ASME~.
NOTE 8: For the handling of native and mapped EPS NAS security contexts after
a state transition to EMM-DEREGISTERED cf. subclause 7.2.5.1.
#### 9.2.2.2 Derivation of NAS keys and K~enb~ during Handover from UTRAN to
E-UTRAN
MME and UE shall derive the NAS keys from the mapped key K\'~ASME~ as
specified in clause A.7.
The MME and UE shall derive K~eNB~ by applying the KDF defined in Annex A.3
using the mapped key K\'~ASME~ and 2^32^-1 as the value of the uplink NAS
COUNT parameter.
NOTE: The MME and UE only uses the 2^32^-1 as the value of the uplink NAS
COUNT for the purpose of deriving K~eNB~ and do not actually set the uplink
NAS COUNT to 2^32^-1. The reason for choosing such a value not in the normal
NAS COUNT range, i.e., [0, 2^24^-1] is to avoid any possibility that the value
may be used to derive the same K~eNB~ again.
## 9.3 Recommendations on AKA at IRAT-mobility to E-UTRAN
After a handover from GERAN or UTRAN into E-UTRAN, it is strongly recommended
to run an AKA and perform a key change on-the-fly of the entire key hierarchy
as soon as possible after the handover if there is no native security context
in E-UTRAN.
When a UE moves in IDLE mode from GERAN or UTRAN into E-UTRAN, it is strongly
recommended to run an AKA if there is no native security context in E-UTRAN,
either after the TAU procedure that establishes an EPS security context in the
MME and UE, or when the UE establishes cryptographically protected radio
bearers.
## 9.4 Attach procedures
### 9.4.1 Attach in UTRAN
This subclause covers the case that the UE includes a mapped GUTI into the
\"old P-TMSI\" Information Element of the Attach Request.
NOTE 1: TS 23.060 states conditions under which a valid P-TMSI or a P-TMSI
that is mapped from a valid GUTI (\"mapped GUTI\") is inserted in the
Information Element \"old P-TMSI\" in the Attach Request.
If the UE has a current EPS NAS security context, it shall include a truncated
NAS-token, as defined in subclause 9.1.1, into the P-TMSI signature IE of the
Attach Request. It shall also include the KSI equal to the value of the eKSI
associated with the current EPS security context.
If the UE does not have a current EPS NAS security context, the UE shall set
the truncated NAS-token to all zero and the KSI to '111' to indicate the UE
has no keys available.
The SGSN shall forward the P-TMSI signature including the truncated NAS-token
to the old MME. The MME may check a non-zero NAS-token as described in
subclause 9.1.1. If successful, the MME responds with an Identification
Response to the SGSN. If unsuccessful the MME responds with an appropriate
error cause which should initiate the security functions in the SGSN.
If P-TMSI Signature includes an all zero NAS-token or the MME chooses not to
check the NAS-token, the MME may respond with an Identification Response that
does not include keys.
If needed, the MME and UE shall derive CK\' and IK\' from the K~ASME~ as in
subclause 9.1.1. Keys CK\' and IK\' and KSI sent from the MME shall replace
all the UTRAN PS key parameters CK, IK and KSI in the target SGSN if any. Keys
CK\' and IK\' and the KSI shall replace all the currently stored UTRAN PS key
parameters CK, IK, KSI values on both the USIM and ME. The handling of
START~PS~ shall comply with the rules in 3GPP TS 25.331 [24]. The UE may set
the START~PS~ value to 0 if it is done before establishment of the RRC
connection.
The ME shall use CK' and IK' to derive the GPRS Kc using the c3 function
specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [4]. The ME shall assign the eKSI value
(associated with CK' and IK') to the GPRS CKSN. The ME shall update the USIM
and ME with the GPRS Kc and GPRS CKSN.
NOTE 2: Due to replacing all the UTRAN PS key parameters CK, IK, KSI with CK',
IK' and eKSI on USIM and in ME, a new GPRS Kc needs to be derived from the new
UTRAN PS key parameters CK and IK (i.e. CK' and IK'), which is part of the new
UMTS security context as well, as any old GPRS Kc stored on USIM and in ME
belongs to an old UMTS security context and can no longer be taken into use.
# 10 Security interworking between E-UTRAN and GERAN
## 10.1 General
An SGSN supporting interworking between E-UTRAN and GERAN is capable of
handling UMTS security contexts and supports the key conversion function c3
specified in TS 33.102 [4]. Such a SGSN is, according to TS 33.102, required
to ensure that the UE is authenticated using UMTS AKA, if the UE supports UMTS
AKA. Furthermore, the UE must have a USIM to be able to access EPS, except for
unauthenticated emergency calls if allowed by regulations. Hence, UMTS AKA is
used when the UE is authenticated to the SGSN supporting interworking between
E-UTRAN and GERAN even when attached to GERAN, and UMTS security contexts are
available. The security procedures for interworking between E-UTRAN and GERAN
are therefore quite similar to those between E-UTRAN and UTRAN.
## 10.2 RAU and TAU procedures
### 10.2.1 RAU procedures in GERAN
This subclause covers both the cases of idle mode mobility from E-UTRAN to
GERAN and of Idle Mode Signaling Reduction, as defined in TS 23.401 [2].
As the target SGSN and UE are capable of handling UMTS security contexts
clause 9.1.1 applies here with the following changes
\- the target SGSN shall derive GPRS cipher key Kc from CK' and IK' with the
help of the key conversion function c3 defined by TS 33.102 [4] , and the
target SGSN and UE shall derive GPRS Kc~128~ as defined by TS 33.102 [4] from
CK\' and IK\' when the new encryption algorithm selected by the target SGSN
requires Kc~128~; the target SGSN and UE shall assign the eKSI value
(associated with the CK' and IK') to the GPRS CKSN associated with the GPRS
Kc~128~ .
\- the target SGSN shall select the encryption algorithm to use in GERAN.
### 10.2.2 TAU procedures in E-UTRAN
This subclause covers both the cases of idle mode mobility from GERAN to
E-UTRAN and of Idle Mode Signaling Reduction, as defined in TS 23.401 [2].
As the SGSN shares a UMTS security context with the UE clause 9.1.2 applies
here without changes.
## 10.3 Handover
### 10.3.1 From E-UTRAN to GERAN
As the target SGSN and the UE are capable of handling UMTS security contexts
clause 9. 2.1 applies here with the following changes:
\- the target SGSN shall derive GPRS cipher key Kc from CK\' and IK\' with the
help of the key conversion function c3 as defined by TS 33.102 [4], and target
SGSN and UE shall derive GPRS Kc~128~ as defined by TS 33.102 [4] from CK\'
and IK\' when the new encryption algorithm selected by the target SGSN
requires Kc~128~. The target SGSN and UE shall assign the eKSI value
(associated with the CK' and IK') to the GPRS CKSN associated with the GPRS
Kc~128~ .
\- the target SGSN shall select the encryption algorithm to use in GERAN after
handover.
\- Whether ciphering is considered active in the target GERAN after handover
from E-UTRAN shall be determined according to the principles for handover to
GERAN in TS 44.060 [25].
### 10.3.2 From GERAN to E-UTRAN
#### 10.3.2.1 Procedures
As the SGSN shares a UMTS security context with the UE clause 9.2.2 applies
here without changes.
## 10.4 Recommendations on AKA at IRAT-mobility to E-UTRAN
See recommendation provided by subclause 9.3.
## 10.5 Attach procedures
### 10.5.1 Attach in GERAN
As the SGSN is capable of handling UMTS security contexts clause 9.1.1 applies
here with the following changes
\- the SGSN and UE shall derive GSM cipher key Kc as defined by TS 33.102 [4]
from CK\' and IK\' , and the SGSN and UE shall derive Kc~128~ as defined by TS
33.102 [4] from CK\' and IK\' when the new encryption algorithm selected by
the target SGSN requires Kc~128~;
\- SGSN shall select the encryption algorithm to use in GERAN.
# 11 Network Domain Control Plane protection
The protection of IP based control plane signalling for EPS and E-UTRAN shall
be done according to NDS/IP as specified in TS 33.210 [5]. S3, S6a and S10
interfaces carry subscriber specific sensitive data, e.g. cryptographic keys.
Thus in addition to the mandatory integrity protection according to NDS/IP,
traffic on these interfaces shall be confidentiality-protected according to
NDS/IP.
In order to protect the S1 and X2 control plane as required by clause 5.3.4a,
it is required to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as specified
by TS 33.210 [5]. For both S1-MME and X2-C, IKEv2 certificates based
authentication according to TS 33.310 [6] shall be implemented. For S1-MME and
X2-C, tunnel mode IPsec is mandatory to implement on the eNB. On the core
network side a SEG may be used to terminate the IPsec tunnel.
NOTE 1: In case control plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically
protected), there is no need to use protection according to TS 33.210 [5] and
TS 33.310 [6].
Transport mode IPsec is optional for implementation on the X2-C and S1-MME.
NOTE 2: Transport mode can be used for reducing the protocol overhead added by
IPsec.
If the sender of IPsec traffic uses DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) to
distinguish different QoS classes, either by copying DSCP from the inner IP
header or directly setting the encapsulating IP header's DSCP, the resulting
traffic may be reordered to the point where the receiving node's anti-replay
check discards the packet. If different DSCPs are used on the encapsulating IP
header, then to avoid packet discard under one IKE SA and with the same set of
traffic selectors, distinct Child-SAs should be established for each of the
traffic classes (using the DSCPs as classifiers) as is specified in RFC 4301
[34].
Other 3GPP specifications may specify other IKEv2 and certificate profiles and
IPsec implementation details for specific types of eNBs. The provisions in
such other 3GPP specifications shall take precedence over the provisions in
the present clause for those specific eNB types only if explicitly listed
here. In particular, the provisions for HeNBs specified in TS 33.320 [27]
shall take precedence over the provisions in this clause.
# 12 Backhaul link user plane protection
The protection of user plane data between the eNB and the UE by user specific
security associations is covered by clause 5.1.3 and 5.1.4.
In order to protect the S1 and X2 user plane as required by clause 5.3.4, it
is required to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as profiled by TS
33.210 [5], with confidentiality, integrity and replay protection.
On the X2-U and S1-U, transport mode IPsec is optional for implementation.
NOTE 1: Transport mode can be used for reducing the protocol overhead added by
IPsec.
Tunnel mode IPsec is mandatory to implement on the eNB for X2-U and S1-U. On
the core network side a SEG may be used to terminate the IPsec tunnel..
If the sender of IPsec traffic uses DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) to
distinguish different QoS classes, either by copying DSCP from the inner IP
header or directly setting the encapsulating IP header's DSCP, the resulting
traffic may be reordered to the point where the receiving node's anti-replay
check discards the packet. If different DSCPs are used on the encapsulating IP
header, then to avoid packet discard under one IKE SA and with the same set of
traffic selectors, distinct Child-SAs should be established for each of the
traffic classes (using the DSCPs as classifiers) as is specified in RFC 4301
[34].
For both S1 and X2 user plane, IKEv2 with certificates based authentication
shall be implemented. The certificates shall be implemented according to the
profile described by TS 33.310 [6]. IKEv2 shall be implemented conforming to
the IKEv2 profile described in TS 33.310 [6]. Other 3GPP specifications may
specify other IKEv2 and certificate profiles and IPsec implementation details
for specific types of eNBs. The provisions in such other 3GPP specifications
shall take precedence over the provisions in the present clause for those
specific eNB types only if explicitly listed here. In particular, the
provisions for HeNBs specified in TS 33.320 [27] shall take precedence over
the provisions in this clause.
NOTE 2: In case S1 and X2 user plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically
protected), the use of IPsec/IKEv2 based protection is not needed.
# 13 Management plane protection over the S1 interface
For the management plane protection of relay nodes the provisions in clause
D.2.5 apply instead of the provisions given in this clause.
For management plane protection the requirements in clause 5.3.2 apply.
In order to achieve such protection, IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as
profiled by TS 33.210 [5] shall be implemented for all O&M related traffic,
i.e. the management plane, with confidentiality, integrity and replay
protection.
Tunnel mode IPsec shall be implemented on the eNB for supporting the
management plane. On the core network side a SEG may be used to terminate the
IPsec tunnel. If no SEG is used, the IPsec tunnel may be terminated in the
element manager.
If the sender of IPsec traffic uses DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) to
distinguish different QoS classes, either by copying DSCP from the inner IP
header or directly setting the encapsulating IP header's DSCP, the resulting
traffic may be reordered to the point where the receiving node's anti-replay
check discards the packet. If different DSCPs are used on the encapsulating
header, then to avoid packet discard under one IKE SA and with the same set of
traffic selectors, distinct Child-SAs should be established for each of the
traffic classes (using the DSCPs as classifiers) as is specified in RFC 4301
[34].
For the management plane, IKEv2 with certificates based authentication shall
be implemented on the eNB. The certificates shall be implemented according to
the profile described by TS 33.310 [6]. IKEv2 shall be implemented conforming
to the IKEv2 profile described in TS 33.310 [6]. Other 3GPP specifications may
specify other IKEv2 and certificate profiles and IPsec implementation details
for specific types of eNBs.
Other 3GPP specifications may specify other security mechanisms and
certificate profiles for specific types of eNBs for the case when the
management traffic is not carried over the same backhaul link as S1 traffic.
If other security mechanisms are specified, they shall provide mutual
authentication based on certificates, as well as confidentiality, integrity
and replay protection. These functions shall have at least equal strength as
that provided by the use of IKEv2/IPsec.
The provisions in such other 3GPP specifications shall take precedence over
the provisions in the present clause for those specific eNB types only if
explicitly listed here. In particular, the provisions for HeNBs specified in
TS 33.320 [27] shall take precedence over the provisions in this clause.
NOTE 1: X2 does not carry management plane traffic.
NOTE 2: In case the S1 management plane interfaces are trusted (e.g.
physically protected), the use of protection based on IPsec/IKEv2 or
equivalent mechanisms is not needed
# 14 SRVCC between E-UTRAN and Circuit Switched UTRAN/GERAN
## 14.1 From E-UTRAN to Circuit Switched UTRAN/GERAN
Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) is specified in 3GPP TS 23.216
[22].
The MME shall select the current NAS downlink COUNT value to use in the
handover and then increase the stored NAS downlink COUNT value by 1.
NOTE 0: Increasing the NAS downlink COUNT by 1 is to ensure that a fresh NAS
downlink COUNT is used for any future purposes.
The MME and the UE shall derive a confidentiality key CK~SRVCC~, and an
integrity key IK~SRVCC~ from K~ASME~ of the current EPS security context and
the selected NAS downlink COUNT with the help of a one-way key derivation
function KDF as specified in clause A.12.
The KDF returns a 256-bit output, where the 128 most significant bits are
identified with CK~SRVCC~ and the 128 least significant bits are identified
with IK~SRVCC~.
The MME shall also provide the 4 LSB of the selected NAS downlink COUNT value
to the source eNB, which then includes the bits to the HO Command to the UE.
The UE shall use the received 4 LSB and its stored NAS downlink COUNT to
estimate the NAS downlink COUNT selected by the MME.
NOTE 1: It is left to the implementation how to estimate the NAS downlink
COUNT.
The UE shall ensure that the estimated NAS downlink COUNT has not been used to
calculate a CK\' and IK\' in a previous successful or unsuccessful PS or SRVCC
handover. If the estimated NAS downlink COUNT is greater than all the
estimated NAS downlink COUNTs either used by the UE for key derivation in a
handover or received in a NAS message that passed its integrity check, the UE
shall update its stored NAS downlink COUNT as though it has successfully
integrity checked a NAS message with that estimated NAS downlink COUNT. In
particular, the stored NAS downlink COUNT shall never be decreased.
UE and MME shall assign the value of eKSI to KSI. MME shall transfer
CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~ with KSI and the UE security capability to the MSC server
enhanced for SRVCC. The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall replace all the
stored UTRAN CS key parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any, with CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~,
KSI received from the MME when the SRVCC handover is successful. The UE shall
replace all the stored UTRAN CS key parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any, with
CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~, KSI in both ME and USIM. START~CS~ shall comply with the
rules in 3GPP TS 25.331 [24].
The ME shall use CK~SRVCC~ and IK~SRVCC~ to derive the GSM CS Kc using the c3
function specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [4]. The ME shall assign the eKSI value
(associated with CK~SRVCC~ and IK~SRVCC~) to the GSM CS CKSN (associated with
the GSM CS Kc). The ME shall update the USIM and ME with the GSM CS Kc and GSM
CS CKSN.
NOTE 2: The new derived security context (including CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~, and
KSI) replacing the stored values in the USIM is for allowing to reuse the
derived security context without invoking the authentication procedure in
subsequent connection set-ups, and also for avoiding that one KSI value
indicates to two different key sets and consequently leads to security context
desynchronization.
NOTE 3: An operator concerned about the security of keys received from an
E-UTRAN of another operator may want to enforce a policy in the MSC server
enhanced for SRVCC to run a UMTS AKA as soon as possible after the handover.
One example of ensuring this is the deletion of the mapped UMTS security
context in the enhanced MSC server after the UE has left active state.
NOTE 4: Due to replacing all the UTRAN CS key parameters CK, IK, KSI with
CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~ and KSI on USIM and in ME, a new GSM CS Kc needs to be
derived from the new UTRAN CS key parameters CK and IK (i.e. CK~SRVCC~ and
IK~SRVCC~), which is part of the new UMTS security context as well, as any old
GSM CS Kc stored on USIM and in ME, belongs to an old UMTS security context
and can no longer be taken into use.
If the SRVCC is from E-UTRAN to GERAN, the above description in this section
applies as well for the MME, the enhanced MSC server and the UE. The enhanced
MSC server shall in addition derive GSM CS cipher key Kc from CK~SRVCC~ and
IK~SRVCC~ with the help of the key conversion function c3 as specified in TS
33.102 [4], and assign the value of eKSI to GSM CS CKSN associated with the
GSM CS Kc, and the target MSC server and UE shall compute the 128-bit GSM CS
cipher key Kc~128~ as specified in TS 33.102 [4] when the new encryption
algorithm selected by the target BSS requires Kc~128~. The UE and the enhanced
MSC Server shall assign the value of eKSI to GSM CS CKSN associated with the
GSM CS Kc~128~.
Non-voice bearers may be handed over during the SRVCC handover operation. For
this case, k ey derivation for non-voice bearers is specified in clause 9.2.1
and 10.3.1 of the present specification. If non-voice bearers are not handed
over during the SRVCC handover operation and if the UE subsequently resumes PS
services in UTRAN/GERAN, key derivation for the PS domain is specified in
clause 9.1.1 and 10.2.1 of the present specification.
If the SRVCC handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped CK~SRVCC~,
IK~SRVCC~ and KSI~SRVCC~ can not be used in the future. The MSC server
enhanced for SRVCC shall delete the new mapped CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~ and
KSI~SRVCC~ and the stored parameters CK~CS~ and IK~CS~ which has the same KSI
as the new mapped CK~SRVCC~, IK~SRVCC~ (if such exist).
## 14.2 Emergency call in SRVCC from E-UTRAN to circuit switched UTRAN/GERAN
If the SRVCC is for an emergency call and the session in EUTRAN complies with
clause 15.2.1, the security procedure in clause 14.1 shall be applied.
If the SRVCC is for an emergency call and the session in EUTRAN complies with
clause 15.2.2, the security procedure in clause 14.1 shall not be applied,
i.e., no key derivation is needed.
## 14.3 SRVCC from circuit switched UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN
### 14.3.1 Procedure
The procedure for SRVCC handover from UTRAN/GERAN CS to E-UTRAN, as far as
relevant for security, proceeds as described below.
The activation of NAS and AS security in E-UTRAN, and selection of the key set
from the source system for the handover shall be according to following
principles:
i) The source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall select the key set most
recently generated. This key set may have been generated by either a
successful UMTS AKA run in UTRAN or from a UMTS security context mapped from
an EPS security context during a previous visit to UTRAN. The UE and source
MSC server enhanced for SRVCC may or may not have taken the key set into use.
The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall transfer this key set to the MME in
the CS to PS HO request.
ii) Activation of AS security in the UE (for details cf. TS 36.331 [21]):
The CS to PS HO command received at the UE shall activate AS security in the
UE.
The CS to PS HO Confirmation received at the eNB shall activate AS security in
the eNB.
iii) Activation of NAS security (for details cf. TS 24.301 [9]):
The CS to PS HO request received at the UE shall activate NAS security in the
UE.
The Handover Notify received at the MME shall activate NAS security in the
MME. In case the MME does not have the UE security capabilities stored from a
previous visit, then the MME shall only accept TAU requests from this UE, and
shall not send any messages to this UE, until the MME has successfully checked
the UE security capabilities received in a TAU request from this UE.
iv) Both AS and NAS ciphering and integrity protection algorithms shall be
selected according to the policy of the target PLMN.
The above four principles consequentially always activate ciphering
(potentially NULL ciphering) in E-UTRAN even if it was not active in the
source system.
Figure 14.3.1-1: SRVCC handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN. Key derivations
in the figure are only shown for UMTS subscribers.
**Handover signalling in case of successful handover**
Before attempting a handover for a UE, the source RNC/BSC may check if the UE
is authenticated using UMTS AKA as described in clause 9.2.2.1 of the present
document, and may avoid doing a SRVCC handover to E-UTRAN in case the UE is
not authenticated using UMTS AKA and does not have an ongoing emergency call.
NOTE 1: The numbering in the followingrefers to the signalling numbering in
Figure 14.3.1-1.
1\. The source BSC/RNC sends HO required to the source MSC server enhanced for
SRVCC.
2\. For UMTS and GSM subscribers, the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC
shall generate a NONCE~MSC~.
> For UMTS subscribers, the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall derive
> CK\'~PS~ and IK\'~PS~ from the NONCE~MSC~ and the latest CK~CS~ and IK~CS~
> using the key derivation function as specified in annex B.6 of TS 33.102
> [2]. The source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall further set the
> KSI\'~PS~ equal to the KSI~CS~ associated with the latest key set as
> specified for SRVCC from UTRAN/GERAN to HSPA in TS 33.102 [2].
>
> For GSM subscribers, the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall derive
> GPRS Kc\' from the NONCE~MSC~ and the latest GSM Kc using the key derivation
> function as specified in annex B.7 of TS 33.102 [2] . The source MSC server
> enhanced for SRVCC shall further set the CKSN\'~PS~ equal to the CKSN~CS~
> associated with the latest key set as specified for SRVCC from UTRAN/GERAN

>
> For UMTS subscribers, the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall transfer the
> CK\'~PS~/IK\'~PS~ and the KSI\'~PS~, to the target MME in the CS to PS
> handover request.
>
> For GSM subscribers, the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall transfer the
> GPRS Kc\' and the CKSN\'~PS~, to the target MME in the CS to PS handover
> request.
NOTE 2: The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC does not include any authentication
vectors in the CS to PS HO request, since this could result in that
authentication vectors intended for use only in the CS domain would end up
being used in a PS domain by accident.
NOTE 3: The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC does not include any UE security
capability information in the CS to PS HO request, since the target MME either
has this information available, or will retrieve the information from the old
SGSN. Further, the MSC may not have access to the complete UE security
capabilities.
If the MME receives a GPRS Kc\' from the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC
in the CS to PS HO request, the MME shall reject the request.
3 and 4. The MME shall discard any CK, IK, Kc, CKSN and KSI retrieved from the
old SGSN in a context request procedure
> The MME shall create a mapped EPS security context by setting the K\'~ASME~
> of the mapped EPS security context equal to the concatenation CK\'~PS~ \|\|
> IK\'~PS,~ where the CK\'~PS~ and IK\'~PS~ were received in the CS to PS
> handover request. The MME shall further associate the K\'~ASME~ with a
> KSI~SGSN~. The value of the KSI~SGSN~ shall be the same as the value of the
> KSI\'~PS~ received in the CS to PS handover request.
NOTE 4: The naming of the KSI~SGSN~ hints at that this identifier is somehow
related to an SGSN. However, in this case it is related to the MSC server
enhanced for SRVCC. Even though KSI~MSC~ could have been a more appropriate
name here, the name KSI~SGSN~ is kept to avoid introducing a new name for the
same entity.
> The MME shall derive K~eNB~ by applying the KDF as defined in Annex A. 3
> using the mapped key K\'~ASME~ and 2^32^-1 as the value of the uplink NAS
> COUNT parameter. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS
> security context shall be set to start value (i.e. 0) in the MME.
>
> If the MME does not have access to the UE EPS security capabilities the MME
> shall assume that the default set of EPS security algorithms defined in
> clause 9.2.2.1 of the present document is supported by the UE (and the MME
> shall set the UE EPS security capabilities in the mapped EPS security
> context according to this default set). The same considerations regarding
> security algorithm selection using the default set as noted in clause
> 9.2.2.1 of the present document applies here. If the security context
> information received from the old SGSN contains EPS security capabilities or
> the MME already have access to EPS security capabilities for the UE, the MME
> shall populate the mapped EPS security context with these EPS security
> capabilities instead of falling back to the default set of security
> algorithms.
>
> If the MME received any authentication vectors from the old SGSN, the MME
> shall process these authentication vectors according to clause 6.1.6 of the
> present document.
5\. MME shall select the NAS security algorithms (including ciphering and
integrity protection) which have the highest priority from its configured list
and are also present in the UE EPS security capabilities. MME shall derive the
NAS keys from K\'~ASME~ using the algorithm types and algorithm IDs as input
to the NAS key derivation functions (see Annex A.7). MME generates NONCE~MME~.
MME shall include KSI~SGSN~, NONCE~MME~and the selected NAS security
algorithms in the NAS Security Transparent Container IE of Allocate resources
message to the target eNB. MME shall further include K~eNB~ and the UE EPS
security capabilities from the mapped EPS security contextin the Allocate
resources message to the target eNB.
6\. The target eNB shall select the AS algorithms (including ciphering for
both RRC and UP, and integrity protection for RRC) which have the highest
priority from its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security
capabilities. The target eNB creates a target to source transparent container
that contains a handover command (the target to source transparent container
is denoted \"E-UTRAN RRC container\" in Figure 14.3.1-1). The handover command
incluesd the selected RRC, UP algorithms and the NAS Security Transparent
Container IE, and the eNB sends the target to source transparent container in
the Allocate resources Ack message towards the MME. The eNB shall derive the
keys for RRC and UP protection from the received K~eNB~ using the key
derivation function defined in clause A.7.
NOTE 5: The handover command in the target to source transparent container is
not security protected by the target eNB.
7\. MME shall include the target to source transparent container received from
the target eNB in the CS to PS HO Response message sent to source MSC server
enhanced for SRVCC.
8\. Source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall include the NONCE~MSC~ and the
target to source transparent container in the relocation command sent to the
BSC/RNC in the CS to PS HO command.
9\. The RNC/BSC shall include the NONCE~MSC~ and the transparent container in
the CS to PS HO command sent to the UE.
NOTE 6: The CS to PS HO command is integrity protected and optionally ciphered
in UTRAN. It is optionally ciphered in GERAN as specified by TS 33.102 [4].
10\. For UMTS subscribers the ME shall silently discard the NONCE~MME~
received in received in the NAS Security Transparent Container. The ME shall
further derive K\'~ASME~, associate it with KSI~SGSN~ recived in the NAS
Security Transparent Container IE and derive NAS keys and K~eNB~ following the
same key derivations as the MSC and MME performed in steps 2, 3 and 4. The ME
shall also derive the RRC and UP keys as the eNB did in (see description for
message 6 above). The UE sends a CS to PS HO Confirmation message to the
target eNB. The ME shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the
mapped EPS security context to start value (i.e. 0)
NOTE 7: Since the MME denies access to E-UTRAN for GSM subscribers, the UE
never has to perform any key derivations for GSM subscribers..
The mapped EPS security context established as above shall become the current
(cf. subclause 3.1) EPS security context at AS and NAS level. The MME and ME
shalloverwrite any existing current mapped EPS security context with the newly
created one. If the current EPS security context is of type native, then it
shall become the non-current native EPS security context. The MME and ME shall
in this case also overwrite any existing non-current EPS security context with
this current native EPS security context. The CS to PS HO Confirmation
messages and all following AS messages in E-UTRAN shall be ciphered and
integrity protected according to the policy of the target PLMN.
If the SRVCC handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped EPS
security context cannot be used in the future. The MME and the ME shall in
this case delete the new mapped EPS security context.
The text regarding subsequent NAS signalling in bullet B) in clause 9.2.2.1 of
the present specification applies also after an SRVCC handover from
GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN.
In SRVCC handover from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN, the START~PS~ and START~CS~
values used in UTRAN shall be kept in the volatile memory of the ME, cf. also
clause 6.8.11 of TS 33.102 [4].
# 15 Security Aspects of IMS Emergency Session Handling
## 15.1 General
Support for IMS Emergency Sessions is defined in the TS 23.401 [2]. Limited
service state of a UE is defined in TS 23.122 [26]. IMS Emergency Sessions can
be made by normally attached UEs or UEs attached for EPS emergency bearer
services. IMS Emergency Services can be authenticated or unauthenticated as
defined in clauses below. It depends on the serving network policy if
unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions are allowed. Any behaviour not
explicitly specified as being special to IMS Emergency Sessions is handled in
accordance to normal procedures.
The E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure, with Attach Type \"Emergency\", is used
by UEs that need to receive EPS emergency bearer services but cannot receive
normal services from the network.
For an Initial Attach with Attach Type \"Emergency\" the UE includes the IMSI
in the Attach request if the UE does not have a valid GUTI. The UE shall
include the IMEI when the UE has no IMSI, no valid GUTI according to [2].
When involved in an Attach for EPS emergency bearer services the MME applies
the parameters from MME Emergency Configuration Data for the EPS emergency
bearer establishment. Any potentially stored IMSI related subscription data is
ignored by the MME according to [2].
When involved in an Attach for EPS emergency bearer services the MME does not
send any Notify Request to an HSS.
A UE attached for EPS emergency bearer services using NULL algorithms shall
keep the NULL algorithms and corresponding NAS COUNTs when in EMM-IDLE mode so
that it is reachable for subsequent IMS Emergency Sessions without the need to
attach for EPS emergency bearer services again. The NULL algorithms shall be
de-selected and corresponding NAS COUNTs shall be removed when the UE goes to
EMM-DEREGISTERED state or when another EPS NAS security context is activated.
The MME or UE shall always release any established non-emergency bearers, when
the authentication fails in the UE or in the MME.
## 15.2 Security procedures and their applicability
### 15.2.1 Authenticated IMS Emergency Sessions
#### 15.2.1.1 General
UEs that are not in limited service state, shall initiate normal initial
attach when not already attached to receive EPS emergency bearer services.
The security mode control procedure shall be applied as part of EPS emergency
bearer establishment as defined in TS 23.401 [2]. Thus, integrity protection
(and optionally ciphering) shall be applied as for normal EPS bearers. If
authentication fails for any reason, the handling of the EPS emergency bearer
services shall be handled as specified in clauses 15.2.1 and 15.2.2 below.
Once the IMS Emergency Session is in progress with NAS and AS integrity
protection (and optionally ciphering) applied, failure of integrity checking
or ciphering (for both NAS and AS) is an unusual circumstance and shall be
treated as in the case of a normal EPS bearer.
#### 15.2.1.2 UE and MME share a current security context
If the UE already has a current EPS security context and attempts to set up an
IMS Emergency Session, the UE shall use this EPS security context to protect
NAS, RRC and UP traffic. If the MME successfully validates a request for EPS
emergency bearer services using the current EPS security context, the MME
should accept this request. A request for EPS emergency bearer services is
defined to be, for the purposes of this document, an Attach request message
for EPS emergency bearer services or a PDN Connectivity request message for
EPS emergency bearer services.
NOTE 1: It is defined in TS 23.401 [2] and TS 24.301 [9] how Attach requests
and/or PDN Connectivity requests are used to set up EPS emergency bearer
services.
If the authentication fails during a normal Attach procedure, or a Service
request procedure, while the UE is in normal service mode, and the UE intends
to set up an IMS Emergency Session, the UE shall retry by sending an Attach
request for EPS emergency bearer services.
If the MME attempts to authenticate the UE after receiving a request for EPS
emergency bearer services which was integrity protected by the current EPS NAS
security context and the authentication failed and if the serving network
policy does not allow unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, the UE and MME
shall proceed as for set up of normal EPS bearers as described in clause
6.1.1.
If the MME attempts to authenticate the UE after receiving a request for EPS
emergency bearer services which was integrity protected by the current EPS NAS
security context and the authentication failed and the serving network policy
allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, then the UE and the MME
behaviours are described in the paragraph below.
If the authentication failure is detected in the UE or in the MME during an
attach procedure for EPS emergency bearer services or a PDN connectivity
request procedure for EPS emergency bearer services, and the related
signalling messages were correctly integrity-protected by the current EPS
security context, the set up of the EPS emergency bearers shall then proceed
in one of two ways:
a) The set-up proceeds according to clause 15.2.2. In this case, there is no
need for the UE to re-attach, and the MME requests the use of the NULL
ciphering and integrity algorithms in the same way as described in clause
15.2.2.2 for the case that UE and MME share no EPS security context.
NOTE 2: If the authentication failure is detected in the MME then the UE is
not aware of the failure in the MME, but still needs to be prepared, according
to the conditions specified in TS 24.301, to accept a NAS SMC from the MME
requesting the use of the NULL ciphering and integrity algorithms.
b) Or else, if the serving network policy allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency
Sessions and MME continues using the current security context, the use of the
EPS emergency bearers may proceed as described below for the case of an AKA
run while a PDN connection for emergency bearer services exists.
NOTE 3: Regardless of if the authentication failed in the UE or in the MME,
the MME can assume that the UE will accept that NULL integrity and ciphering
algorithms are selected in the security mode control procedure.
If AKA is run while a PDN connection for emergency bearer services exists, the
MME and UE shall behave as follows:
UE behavior:
\- Upon successful authentication verification in the UE, the UE shall send
RES to the MME.
NOTE 4: If the authentication failure is detected in the MME, the UE is not
aware of the failure in the MME if the MME continues to use the current
security context with the UE. The UE consider itself to be in normal service,
if it was normal attached before the PDN connectivity request procedure for
EPS emergency bearer services was initiated, until the MME releases the non-
emergency bearers established with the UE.
\- Alternatively, upon authentication verification failure in the UE, the UE
shall send an Authentication Failure message to the MME. The UE shall continue
using the current EPS security context. If the UE receives a NAS security mode
command selecting NULL integrity and ciphering algorithms, the UE shall accept
this as long as the IMS Emergency session progresses.
MME behavior:
\- If the serving network policy requires IMS Emergency Sessions to be
authenticated, the MME shall, after the unsuccessful comparison of RES to
XRES, i.e. AKA failure, proceed as if the request for EPS emergency bearers
was a request for normal EPS bearer services. The MME should not send an
Authentication Reject message if authentication failed in the MME and the
serving network policy allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions. If the
MME does not send an Authentication Reject message it shall continue using the
current security context with the UE.
\- After receiving both, the EC Indication and the Authentication Failure
message, the MME shall continue using the current security context with the UE
for establishing an EPS emergency bearer.
NOTE : In the case that NAS COUNT values are about to wrap around, and AKA
fails, or if the MME is unable to fetch new authentication vectors, the
handling of the EPS emergency beares are as described by TS 24.301 [9].
### 15.2.2 Unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions
#### 15.2.2.1 General
Authentication may fail for a UE attached for EPS emergency bearer services
just as for a UE attached for normal EPS bearer services when the UE tries to
establish an IMS Emergency Session.
As defined in TS 23.401 [2] and as a serving network option, IMS Emergency
Sessions may be established in limited service state without the network
having to authenticate the UE or apply ciphering or integrity protection for
either AS or NAS.
The following are the only identified cases where the \"security procedure not
applied\" option may be used:
a) Authentication is impossible because the USIM is absent;
b) Authentication is impossible because the serving network cannot obtain
authentication vectors due to a network failure;
c) Authentication is impossible because the USIM is in limited service mode in
the serving network (e.g. there is no roaming agreement or the IMSI is barred,
etc.);
> d) Authentication is possible but the serving network cannot successfully
> authenticate the USIM.
If the ME receives a NAS SMC selecting EIA0 (NULL integrity) for integrity
protection, and EEA0 (NULL ciphering) for encryption protection, then:
> \- the ME shall mark any stored native EPS NAS security context on the USIM
> /non-volatile ME memory as invalid; and
>
> \- the ME shall not update the USIM/non-volatile ME memory with the current
> EPS NAS security context.
>
> These two rules override all other rules regarding updating the EPS NAS
> security context on the USIM/non-volatile ME memory, in this specification.
If EIA0 is used, and the NAS COUNT values wrap around, and a new K~ASME~ has
not been established before the NAS COUNT wrap around, the NAS connection
shall be kept.
NOTE: For unauthenticated emergency calls, EIA0, i.e., null integrity
algorithm, is used for integrity protection. Additionally, as the NAS COUNT
values are allowed to wrap around, the initialization of the NAS COUNT values
are not crucial. Uplink and downlink NAS COUNT are incremented for NAS message
that use EIA0, as for any other NAS messages.
Since a UE with a 2G SIM cannot be in authenticated via EPS AKA, it shall be
considered by the MME to be unauthenticated in E-UTRAN. A UE with a 2G SIM
shall at an IRAT handover to E-UTRAN when an IMS Emergency Service is active,
be considered by the MME to be unauthenticated. In such a scenario, EIA0 shall
be used in E-UTRAN after handover if the target network policy allows
unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions.
A handover from E-UTRAN to another RAT, of an unauthenticated IMS Emergency
Session, shall result in an unauthenticated IMS Emergency Session or a circuit
switched emergency call (depending on if it is a PS handover or SRVCC) in the
other RAT.
#### 15.2.2.2 UE and MME share no security context
If the MME attempts to authenticate the UE after receiving the EPS emergency
bearer setup request and the authentication failed and if the serving network
policy does not allow unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, the UE and MME
shall proceed as for normal EPS bearer setup requests as described in clause
6.1.1.
If the UE is not yet authenticated and while the UE is trying to setup an IMS
Emergency Session, the authentication failed in the UE, the UE shall wait for
a NAS SMC command to set up an unauthenticated emergency bearer. If the
serving network policy supports unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, only
then the MME shall support unauthenticated EPS emergency bearer setup. In this
case, the behaviours of the UE and the MME are as described below.
The confluence of EPS emergency bearer setup and authentication failure means
that the UE is considered by the MME and UE itself to be in LSM even though
the UE could have been in normal service mode before the EPS emergency bearer
setup.
UE behavior:
> After sending EC Indication to the serving network the UE shall know of its
> own intent to establish an IMS Emergency Session.
\- The UE will proceed as specified for the non-emergency case in clauses 6
and 7 of this specification except that the UE shall accept a NAS SMC
selecting EEA0 and EIA0 algorithms from the MME.
NOTE: In case of authentication success the MME will send a NAS SMC selecting
algorithms as defined in clause 7 of this specification, i.e. with a non-NULL
integrity algorithm, and the UE will accept it.
MME behavior:
> After receiving EC Indication from the UE, the MME knows of that UE's intent
> to establish an IMS Emergency Session.
\- If the MME cannot identify the subscriber, or cannot obtain authentication
vectors, the MME shall send NAS SMC with NULL algorithms to the UE regardless
of the supported algorithms announced previously by the UE.
NOTE: The case where the MME cannot obtain authentication vectors includes
also all the cases where IMSI is required by the MME (see TS 23.401[2], clause
4.3.12.1).
\- After the unsuccessful comparison of RES to XRES, i.e. AKA failure, the MME
shall send NAS SMC with NULL algorithms to the UE regardless of the supported
algorithms announced previously by the UE.
\- After the receiving of both, the EC Indication and the Authentication
Failure messages, the MME shall send NAS SMC with NULL algorithms to the UE
regardless of the supported algorithms announced previously by the UE.
If the serving network policy does not allow unauthenticated IMS Emergency
Sessions, the MME shall reject the unauthenticated EPS emergency bearer setup
request from the UE.
### 15.2.3 Void
### 15.2.4 Key generation procedures for unauthenticated IMS Emergency
Sessions
#### 15.2.4.1 General
An unauthenticated UE does not share a complete EPS NAS security context with
the network. Since there has been no successful EPS AKA run, the UE and the
MME does not share a K~ASME~. When the UE and the MME does not share a K~ASME~
the only possibility for an MME that allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency
Sessions is to run with the NULL integrity algorithm EIA0 and the NULL
ciphering algorithm EEA0. These algorithms are not affected by the choice of
key. Therefore the UE and the MME independently generate a K~ASME~ in an
implementation defined way and populate the EPS NAS security context with this
K~ASME~ to be used when activating an EPS NAS security context for which no
successful EPS AKA run has been made. After this EPS NAS security context is
activated all key derivations proceed as if they were based on a K~ASME~
generated from an EPS AKA run.
Even if no confidentiality or integrity protection is provided by EIA0 and
EEA0, the UE and network treat the EPS security context with the independently
generated K~ASME~ as if it contained a normally generated K~ASME~ and hence
share an EPS security context (see TS 24.301[9]).
#### 15.2.4.2 Handover
When UE attempts to make X2/S1 handover, UE and eNB derive and transfer the
keys as normal to re-use the normal handover mechanism. Since the derived keys
have no ability to affect the output of the NULL algorithms it is irrelevant
that the network and the UE derive different keys. Furthermore, section 7.2.4a
describes how the algorithm selection is handled for unauthenticated emergency
call. This implies that source eNB will forward UE EPS security capability
which contains EIA0 and EEA0 only to target eNB. So the target eNB can only
select EIA0 for integrity protection and EEA0 for confidential protection. If
the UE does not receive any selection of new AS security algorithms during a
intra-eNB handover, the UE continues to use the same algorithms as before the
handover (see TS 36.331 [21]).
NOTE: If the target eNB is a Rel-8 eNB, it can't support EIA0 and EEA0. The
handover will be rejected because of the failure of algorithm negotiation.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Key derivation functions
# A.1 KDF interface and input parameter construction
## A.1.1 General
All key derivations (including input parameter encoding) for EPS shall be
performed using the key derivation function (KDF) specified in TS 33.220 [8].
This clause specifies how to construct the input string, S, to the KDF (which
is input together with the relevant key). For each of the distinct usages of
the KDF, the input parameters S are specified below.
## A.1.2 FC value allocations
The FC number space used is controlled by TS 33.220 [8], FC values allocated
for this specification are in range of 0x10 -- 0x1F.
# A.2 K~ASME~ derivation function
When deriving a K~ASME~ from CK, IK and SN id when producing authentication
vectors, and when the UE computes K~ASME~ during AKA, the following parameters
shall be used to form the input S to the KDF.
\- FC = 0x10,
\- P0 = SN id,
\- L0 = length of SN id (i.e. 0x00 0x03),
\- P1 = SQN ⊕ AK
\- L1 = length of SQN ⊕ AK (i.e. 0x00 0x06)
_The exclusive or of the Sequence Number (SQN) and the Anonymity Key (AK) is
sent to the UE as a part of the Authentication Token (AUTN), see TS 33.102. If
AK is not used, AK shall be treated in accordance with TS 33.102, i.e. as
000...0._
The SN id consists of MCC and MNC, and shall be encoded as an octet string
according to Figure A.2-1.

MCC digit 2 MCC digit 1 octet 1  
MNC digit 3 MCC digit 3 octet 2  
MNC digit 2 MNC digit 1 octet 3
* * *
Figure A.2-1 Encoding of SN id as an octet string
The coding of the digits of MCC and MNC shall be done according to TS 24.301
[9].
The input key Key shall be equal to the concatenation CK \|\| IK of CK and IK.
# A.3 K~eNB~ derivation function
When deriving a K~eNB~ from K~ASME~ and the uplink NAS COUNT in the UE and the
MME the following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the KDF.
\- FC = 0x11,
\- P0 = Uplink NAS COUNT,
\- L0 = length of uplink NAS COUNT (i.e. 0x00 0x04)
The input key shall be the 256-bit K~ASME~.
This function is applied when cryptographically protected E-UTRAN radio
bearers are established and when a key change on-the-fly is performed.
# A.4 NH derivation function
When deriving a NH from K~ASME~ the following parameters shall be used to form
the input S to the KDF.
\- FC = 0x12
\- P0 = SYNC-input
\- L0 = length of SYNC-input (i.e. 0x00 0x20)
The SYNC-input parameter shall be the newly derived K~eNB~ for the initial NH
derivation, and the previous NH for all subsequent derivations. This results
in a NH chain, where the next NH is always fresh and derived from the previous
NH.
The input key shall be the 256-bit K~ASME~.
# A.5 K~eNB~* derivation function
When deriving a K~eNB~* from current K~eNB~ or from fresh NH and the target
physical cell ID in the UE and eNB as specified in clause 7.2.8 for handover
purposes the following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the
KDF.
\- FC = 0x13
\- P0 = PCI (target physical cell id)
\- L0 = length of PCI (i.e. 0x00 0x02)
\- P1 = EARFCN-DL (target physical cell downlink frequency)
\- L1 length of EARFCN-DL (i.e. L1 = 0x00 0x02 if EARFCN-DL is between 0 and
65535, and L1 = 0x00 0x03 if EARFCN-DL is between 65536 and 262143)
NOTE: The length of EARFCN-DL cannot be generally set to 3 bytes for backward
compatibility reasons: A Rel-8 entity (UE or eNB) would always assume an input
parameter length of 2 bytes for the EARFCN-DL. This would lead to different
derived keys if another entity assumed an input parameter length of 3 bytes
for the EARFCN-DL.
The input key shall be the 256-bit NH when the index in the handover
increases, otherwise the current 256-bit K~eNB~.
# A.6 Void

K~ASME~ and algorithm types and algorithm IDs, and keys for RRC integrity, UP
integrity in the case of relay nodes, and RRC/UP encryption algorithms from
K~eNB~, in the UE, MME and eNB the following parameters shall be used to form
the string S.
\- FC = 0x15
\- P0 = algorithm type distinguisher

The algorithm identity (as specified in clause 5) shall be put in the four
least significant bits of the octet. The two least significant bits of the
four most significant bits are reserved for future use, and the two most
significant bits of the most significant nibble are reserved for private use.
The entire four most significant bits shall be set to all zeros.
For NAS algorithm key derivations, the input key shall be the 256-bit K~ASME~,
and for UP and RRC algorithm key derivations, the input key shall be the

The input key shall be K~eNB~ of the eNB.
# A.17 Derivation of K_n for IOPS subscriber key separation
This key derivation is for use with the IOPS subscriber key separation
mechanism described in Annex F of the present specification.
The input key \'Key\' is equal to MK. The following parameters are used to
form the input S to the KDF:
\- FC = 0x1D
\- P0 = f(n)
\- L0 = length of f(n)
\- P1 = IMSI
\- L1 = length of IMSI
Here f(n) is proprietary, cf. Annex F of the present specification.
# A.18 Derivation of S-K~WT~ for LWA
This input string is used when the eNB and UE derive S-K~WT~ from K~eNB~
during LTE WLAN Aggregation. The following input parameters shall be used:
\- FC = 0x1F
\- P0 = Value of the WT Counter as a non-negative integer
\- L0 = length of the WT Counter value (i.e. 0x00 0x02)
The input key shall be K~eNB~ of the eNB.
# A.19 Key derivation function for key used in algorithms between UE and SgNB
When deriving ciphering and integrity keys from S-K~gNB~ in the SgNB and UE,
the UE and SgNB shall use the KDF given in Annex A.8 of TS 33.501 [43] with
S-KgNB as the input key.f
###### ## Annex B (normative): Algorithms for ciphering and integrity
protection
# B.0 Null ciphering and integrity protection algorithms
The EEA0 algorithm shall be implemented such that it has the same effect as if
it generates a KEYSTREAM of all zeroes (see subclause B.1.1). The length of
the KEYSTREAM generated shall be equal to the LENGTH input parameter. The
generated KEYSTREAM requires no other input parameters but the LENGTH. Apart
from this, all processing performed in association with ciphering shall be
exactly the same as with any of the ciphering algorithms specified in this
Annex.
The EIA0 algorithm shall be implemented in such way that it shall generate a
32 bit MAC-I/NAS-MAC and XMAC-I/XNAS-MAC of all zeroes (see subclause B.2.1).
Replay protection shall not be activated when EIA0 is activated. All
processing performed in association with integrity (except for replay
protection) shall be exactly the same as with any of the integrity algorithms
specified in this annex except that the receiver does not check the received
MAC.
NOTE 1: The reason for mentioning the replay protection here is that replay
protection is associated with integrity.
EIA0 shall be used only for emergency calling for unauthenticated UEs in LSM.
NOTE 2: a UE with a 2G SIM is considered to be in LSM in E-UTRAN.
NOTE 3: EEA0 and EIA0 provide no security.
# B.1 128-bit ciphering algorithm
## B.1.1 Inputs and outputs
The input parameters to the ciphering algorithm are a 128-bit cipher key named
KEY, a 32-bit COUNT, a 5-bit bearer identity BEARER, the 1-bit direction of
the transmission i.e. DIRECTION, and the length of the keystream required i.e.
LENGTH. The DIRECTION bit shall be 0 for uplink and 1 for downlink.
Figure B.1-1 illustrates the use of the ciphering algorithm EEA to encrypt
plaintext by applying a keystream using a bit per bit binary addition of the
plaintext and the keystream. The plaintext may be recovered by generating the
same keystream using the same input parameters and applying a bit per bit
binary addition with the ciphertext.
Figure B.1-1: Ciphering of data
Based on the input parameters the algorithm generates the output keystream
block KEYSTREAM which is used to encrypt the input plaintext block PLAINTEXT
to produce the output ciphertext block CIPHERTEXT.
The input parameter LENGTH shall affect only the length of the KEYSTREAM
BLOCK, not the actual bits in it.
## B.1.2 128-EEA1
128-EEA1 is based on SNOW 3G and is identical to UEA2 as specified in [14].
The used IV is constructed the same way as in subclause 3.4 of that TS.
## B.1.3 128-EEA2
128-EEA2 is based on 128-bit AES [15] in CTR mode [16]
The sequence of 128-bit counter blocks needed for CTR mode T~1~, T~2~, ...,
T~i~, ... shall be constructed as follows:
The most significant 64 bits of T~1~ consist of COUNT[0] .. COUNT[31] │
BEARER[0] .. BEARER[4] │ DIRECTION │ 0^26^ (i.e. 26 zero bits). These are
written from most significant on the left to least significant on the right,
so for example COUNT[0] is the most significant bit of T~1~.
The least significant 64 bits of T~1~ are all 0.
Subsequent counter blocks are then obtained by applying the standard integer
incrementing function (according to Appendix B1 in [16]) mod 2^64^ to the
least significant 64 bits of the previous counter block.
## B.1.4 128-EEA3
128-EEA3 is based on ZUC and specified in [33].
# B.2 128-Bit integrity algorithm
## B.2.1 Inputs and outputs
The input parameters to the integrity algorithm are a 128-bit integrity key
named KEY, a 32-bit COUNT, a 5-bit bearer identity called BEARER, the 1-bit
direction of the transmission i.e. DIRECTION, and the message itself i.e
MESSAGE. The DIRECTION bit shall be 0 for uplink and 1 for downlink. The bit
length of the MESSAGE is LENGTH.
Figure B.2-1 illustrates the use of the integrity algorithm EIA to
authenticate the integrity of messages.
Figure B.2-1: Derivation of MAC-I/NAS-MAC (or XMAC-I/XNAS-MAC)
Based on these input parameters the sender computes a 32-bit message
authentication code (MAC-I/NAS-MAC) using the integrity algorithm EIA. The
message authentication code is then appended to the message when sent. For
integrity protection algorithms other than EIA0 the receiver computes the
expected message authentication code (XMAC-I/XNAS-MAC) on the message received
in the same way as the sender computed its message authentication code on the
message sent and verifies the data integrity of the message by comparing it to
the received message authentication code, i.e. MAC-I/NAS-MAC.
## B.2.2 128-EIA1
128-EIA1 is based on SNOW 3G and is implemented in the same way as UIA2 as
specified in [14]. The used IV is constructed the same way as in subclause 4.4
of that TS, with the only difference being that FRESH [0], ... FRESH [31]
shall be replaced by BEARER[0] ... BEARER[4] │ 0^27^ (i.e. 27 zero bits)
## B.2.3 128-EIA2
128-EIA2 is based on 128-bit AES [15] in CMAC mode [17].
The bit length of MESSAGE is BLENGTH.
The input to CMAC mode is a bit string M of length Mlen (see [17, section
5.5]). M is constructed as follows:
M~0~ .. M~31~ = COUNT[0] .. COUNT[31]
M~32~ .. M~36~ = BEARER[0] .. BEARER[4]
M~37~ = DIRECTION
M~38~ .. M~63~ = 0^26^ (i.e. 26 zero bits)
M~64~ .. M~BLENGTH+63~ = MESSAGE[0] .. MESSAGE[BLENGTH-1]
and so Mlen = BLENGTH + 64.
AES in CMAC mode is used with these inputs to produce a Message Authentication
Code T (MACT) of length Tlen = 32. T is used directly as the 128-EIA2 output
MACT[0] .. MACT[31], with MACT[0] being the most significant bit of T.
## B.2.4 128-EIA3
128-EIA3 is based on ZUC and specified in [33].
###### ## Annex C (informative): Algorithm test data
# C.1 128-EEA2
This section includes six test data sets; all are presented in hex, while the
first is also presented in binary. Some intermediate computational values are
included to assist implementers in tracing bugs. Some notation is taken from
the specification of CTR mode [16].
Bit ordering should be largely self explanatory, but in particular:
\- The 5-bit BEARER is written in hex in a \"right aligned\" form, i.e. as a
two-hex-digit value in the range 00 to 1F inclusive, with BEARER [0] as the
msb of the first digit.
\- Similarly the single DIRECTION bit is written in hex in \"right aligned\"
form, i.e. the DIRECTION bit is the lsb of the hex digit.
\- Where the length of plaintext and ciphertext is not a multiple of 32 bits,
they are written in hex in a \"left aligned\" form, i.e. the least significant
few bits of the last word will be zero.

# C.2 128-EIA2
This section includes eight test data sets; all are presented in hex, while
the first is also presented in binary. Many intermediate computational values
are included to assist implementers in tracing bugs. Some notation is taken
from the specification of CMAC mode [17].
Bit ordering should be largely self explanatory, but in particular:
\- The 5-bit BEARER is written in hex in a \"right aligned\" form, i.e. as a
two-hex-digit value in the range 00 to 1F inclusive, with BEARER [0] as the
msb of the first digit.
\- Similarly the single DIRECTION bit is written in hex in \"right aligned\"
form, i.e. the DIRECTION bit is the lsb of the hex digit.
\- Where the length of the message, or of a message sub-block, is not a
multiple of 32 bits, it is written in hex in a \"left aligned\" form, i.e. the
least significant few bits of the last word will be zero.
NOTE: This section provides both byte aligned and non byte aligned test data
sets. For EPS implementation verification, byte alignment test data sets (2, 5
and 8) can be used, as EPS RRC and EPS NAS messages are byte aligned. The non
byte aligned test data sets may be used to verify implementations that support
non byte aligned messages.

# C.3 128-EEA1
No new test data are provided for 128-EEA1, because the test data for UEA2 can
be reused directly -- there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between UEA2
inputs and 128-EEA1 inputs.
# C.4 128-EIA1
This section includes seven test data sets; all are presented in hex, while
the first is also presented in binary
Bit ordering should be largely self explanatory, but in particular:
  * The 5-bit BEARER is written in hex in a \"right aligned\" form, i.e. as a two-hex-digit value in the range 00 to 1F inclusive, with BEARER [0] as the msb of the first digit.
  * Similarly the single DIRECTION bit is written in hex in \"right aligned\" form, i.e. the DIRECTION bit is the lsb of the hex digit.
  * Where the length of the message, or of a message sub-block, is not a multiple of 32 bits, it is written in hex in a \"left aligned\" form, i.e. the least significant few bits of the last word will be zero.
NOTE: This section provides both byte aligned and non byte aligned test data
sets. For EPS implementation verification, byte alignment test data sets (1, 4
and 7) can be used, as EPS RRC and EPS NAS messages are byte aligned. The non
byte aligned test data sets may be used to verify implementations that support
non byte aligned messages.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Security for Relay Node Architectures
# D.1 Introduction
This Annex provides the security procedures applied to relay nodes. Security
requirements and security features applied to relay nodes can be found in the
main body of the present specification.
The overall stage 2 description for relay nodes can be found in 3GPP TS 23.401
[2] and 3GPP TS 36.300 [30].
# D.2 Solution
## D.2.1 General
The basic idea of the solution for relay node security presented in this Annex
is realizing a one-to-one binding of an RN and a USIM called USIM-RN. Such a
one-to-one binding is realized in this solution either by using symmetric pre-
shared keys (psk) or by certificates. In the psk case, the binding needs to be
pre-established in the UICC and in the RN prior to deployment; in the
certificate case, the binding needs to be pre-established only in the UICC
prior to deployment. The use of certificates has the advantage that there is a
standardized procedure for enrolling the private key corresponding to the
certificate in the secure environment of the RN while the use of a psk
requires manual operation for establishing the psk. A further advantage is
that the name (identity) in the certificate can be given at time of enrolment,
and does not have to be pre-established. On the other hand, the use of a psk
has the advantage that no PKI is required and the procedure after pre-
establishment of the psk is simpler. When using certificates for this one-to-
one binding, a part of the usual certificate handling is replaced by
subscription handling, as explained in Annex D.2.6.
The certificate-based procedures are mandatory to support.
The pre-shared-key-based procedures are mandatory to support.
NOTE 1: The provisioning of pre-shared keys is out of the scope of this
document.
When using certificates the UICC inserted in the RN shall contain two USIMs: a
USIM-RN which shall perform any communication only via a secure channel, and a
USIM-INI communicating with the RN without secure channel and used for initial
IP connectivity purposes prior to RN attachment. The UICC shall establish a
secure channel only with a particular relay node, as detailed in the
procedures described in D.2.2. The UICC verifies this relay node by means of
data pre-established in the UICC.
When using psk only the USIM-RN is required. This USIM-RN shall perform any
communication only via a secure channel.
NOTE 2: USIM-INI and USIM-RN are described in TS 31.102 [3].
## D.2.2 Security Procedures
The start-up of an RN shall proceed in the following steps, which are arranged
in three phases. The Preparation Phase and Phase II procedures are the same
for the certificate-based and the PSK-based case. Phase I procedures differ
between the certificate-based case and the pre-shared key based case. If one
of the steps fails in any of the involved entities the procedure shall be
aborted by that entity, and the steps that follow the failed step shall not be
executed (but the sending of failure messages is possible).
**Preparation Phase:**
The RN platform secure environment shall perform an integrity check of the RN
platform. This shall include checking the integrity of the sensitive parts of
the boot process and proceeding with the boot process only if the integrity
checks of all these parts are successful.
**Phase I: Procedures prior to the RN attach procedure (certificate-based
case)**
For the certificate-based case, the RN may skip Phase I attachment if the RN
has an operator certificate available and a valid CRL list (if needed).
NOTE0: There may be reasons to perform Phase I attachment even if operator
certificate and valid CRL are available.
Ec1. Void.
Ec2. The RN shall attach as a UE using USIM-INI if step Ec3 needs to be
performed.
Ec3. The RN shall obtain an operator certificate through the enrolment
procedure defined in TS 33.310 [6] unless an operator certificate is already
available. Details can be found in clause D.2.4. The RN may optionally
establish a secure connection to an OAM server. Details can be found in clause
D.2.5. The RN shall retrieve a CRL from a suitable server if no valid CRL is
available locally in the RN and the RN supports and is configured to perform
CRL checks. For revocation checking of UICC certificates see clause D.2.6. For
the handling of CRLs for UICC certificates see also clause D.3.3.4.
Ec4. After completing step Ec3, the RN shall detach from the network and de-
activate the USIM-INI if it attached in step Ec2. **If the UICC needs to be
configured over the air (OTA) this may also be done in this step.**
Ec5. The RN platform secure environment and the UICC shall establish a Secure
Channel between RN and USIM-RN according to ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7
\"Secured APDU\" with TLS handshake. This TLS handshake shall be initiated by
the RN and use certificates on both sides. The RN shall either use a pre-
established certificate or the certificate enrolled in step Ec3. The UICC
shall verify that this certificate belongs to the relay node the USIM-RN is
bound to. The UICC shall be pre-provisioned with an operator root certificate
to verify the RN certificate. The UICC certificate shall be pre-installed in
the UICC by the operator. The RN shall be provisioned with a root certificate
to verify the UICC certificate.
Ec6. A certificate validation client on the UICC shall verify the signatures
in the RN certificate chain up to the root certificate. The check of
revocation status and expiry time shall be omitted. A certificate validation
client on the RN shall check the verification of the signatures in the UICC
certificate chain up to the root certificate as well as the expiry time. The
revocation status of the UICC certificate should be checked by means of CRLs.
Furthermore, the requirements in clause D.2.3 on 'USIM Binding Aspects' shall
apply.
NOTE 1: The root certificate, and potentially other data required, that need
to be stored in the UICC could be provisioned in the UICC during its
personalization. The operator provides to smart card manufacturer a list of
data (e.g. IMSI, key K, etc) to be provisioned in the UICC during its
personalization phase, before issuance of the UICC. The root certificate, and
potentially other data, could be provided by the operator as part of the data
to be personalized in the UICC by the smart card manufacturer. In the field,
the root certificate, and potentially other data, could also be updated by OTA
means, if needed.
The private key corresponding to the RN certificate and the root certificate
used to verify the UICC certificate shall be stored in the secure environment
of the RN platform validated in the Preparation Phase, and the TLS connection
as well as the secure channel with the UICC shall terminate there. From the
completion of this step onwards, all communication between the USIM-RN and the
RN shall be protected by the Secure Channel.
The USIM-RN shall not engage in any communication with any entity prior to the
the completion of establishment of the Secure Channel according to steps Ec5
and Ec6 other than messages for establishing the Secure Channel according to
ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7 \"Secured APDU\".
NOTE 2: Certificate use restriction may be made possible e.g. through a
suitable name structure, or a particular intermediate CA in the verification
path, or policy information terms, e.g. by a suitable object identifier (OID)
in the certificate policies extension.
NOTE 3: ETSI TS 102 484 [29] states in clause 6.2.2: \"The UICC may present a
self-signed certificate. The terminal or terminal application should
temporarily accept such a certificate during the TLS handshake protocol, if it
is able to establish by other means (e.g. successful network authentication)
that the handshake protocol is conducted with an authentic UICC.\" Similar
considerations apply when the method in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] in clause 7
\"Secured APDU\" with TLS handshake is used as is the case in the present
document. And in the present solution for relay node security, the RN indeed
verifies the authenticity of the USIM-RN by means of a successful RN attach
procedure. However, the use of a self-signed UICC certificate, or no UICC
certificate at all, is not allowed here as this would weaken the protection
against certain attacks, cf. clause D.2.6.
NOTE 4: It is proposed here that the RN assumes the role of TLS client in line
with ETSI TS 102 484 [29], clause 7, on \"Secured APDU\" with TLS handshake.
NOTE 5: One may want to limit the lifetime of a secure channel between USIM-RN
and RN for security reasons. Suitable counters providing such a limit include
a transaction counter, cf. clause 5 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29]. Details can be
found in stage 3 specifications.
NOTE 6: Having two USIMs on one UICC is a standard feature available today
(but only one USIM can be active at a time in current 3GPP specifications).
NOTE 7: The RN could distinguish a USIM-RN from a USIM-INI e.g. by the use of
so-called \"Application Identifiers (AID)\" for UICC applications.
**Phase I: Procedures prior to the RN attach procedure (pre-shared key based
case)**
For the psk-based case, there may be some cases when skipping of Phase I
attachment is possible. Such cases are outside the scope of the present
document.
Ep1. Void.
Ep2. The RN platform secure environment and the UICC shall establish a Secure
Channel between RN and USIM-RN according to ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7
\"Secured APDU\" using a pre-shared key. Furthermore, the requirements in
clause D.2.3 on 'USIM Binding Aspects' shall apply.
> The pre-shared key shall be stored in the secure environment of the RN
> platform validated in the Preparation Phase, and the secure channel with the
> UICC shall terminate there. From the completion of this step onwards, all
> communication between the USIM-RN and the RN shall be protected by the
> Secure Channel.
>
> The USIM-RN shall not engage in any communication with any entity prior to
> the completion of the establishment of the Secure Channel according to step
> Ep2 other than messages for establishing the Secure Channel according to
> ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7 \"Secured APDU\".
Ep3. The RN may optionally establish a secure connection to an OAM server.
Details can be found in clause D.2.5.
Ep4. The RN shall detach from to the network if it attached for performing
step Ep3.
NOTE 8: The use of the pre-shared key variant requires that the RN is
configured with this pre-shared key e.g. in the factory, or at the operator's
premises or in the field during RN installation. The corresponding procedures
are out of scope of the present document. For the UICC, the regular
personalization procedures are expected to apply.
NOTE 9: One may want to limit the lifetime of a secure channel between USIM-RN
and RN for security reasons. Suitable counters providing such a limit include
a record counter, cf. clause 6.4 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29], or a transaction
counter, cf. clause 5 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29]. Details can be found in stage 3
specifications.
**Phase II: RN attach procedure (pre-shared key case and certificate-based
case)**
It is required that a secure channel between RN and USIM-RN exists throughout
the execution of phase II.
The RN shall perform the RN attach procedure for EPS as defined in TS 36.300
[30], using the USIM-RN. In addition, the following security-related steps
shall be performed:
A1. If the USIM-RN is not already active the RN shall activate it and shall
establish a new secure channel according to Ec5, Ec6 in the certificate-based
case and Ep2 in the pre-shared key based case respectively. The RN shall use
the IMSI (or a related GUTI) pertaining to the USIM-RN in the RN attach
procedure.
NOTE 10: In the certificate-based case this IMSI differs from the one
pertaining to the USIM-INI, therefore the network can distinguish the handling
of the two USIMs.
A2. The S1 Initial UE message shall indicate that the attachment is for an RN.
Upon receipt of this message the MME-RN shall run EPS AKA with the RN and the
USIM-RN. The RN shall accept only authentication responses and keys in an RN
attach procedure that were received from the USIM-RN over the Secure Channel.
A3. The MME-RN shall check from the RN-specific subscription data received
from the HSS that the USIM-RN is permitted for use in RN attach procedures.
When this is not the case, but the S1 Initial UE message indicated that the
attachment is for an RN, the MME-RN shall reject the Attach request and
indicate to the DeNB that the set-up has failed.
A4. The MME-RN and RN shall establish NAS security. Upon receipt of the S1
INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP message the DeNB and the RN shall set up AS security
over Un as specified in the present document.
A5. The RN may establish a secure connection to an OAM server in this phase to
complete the configuration. Details can be found in clause D.2.5.
The RN start-up is now complete from a security point of view, and UEs can
start attaching to the RN.
## D.2.3 USIM Binding Aspects
There shall be a one-to-one association between the USIM-RN and the RN.
In the pre-shared key case, this one-to-one association is ensured by the fact
that the key that is pre-shared between the USIM-RN and the RN shall not be
available in any other entity.
In the certificate-based case, this one-to-one association is ensured by the
following requirements:
\- The UICC shall verify the RN identity, represented by the RN identity in
the certificate, through the TLS handshake as part of the secure channel set-
up, and shall check whether it coincides with the locally stored identity of
the RN authorized to set up a secure channel with the USIM-RN;
\- the identity in an RN certificate shall be unique;
\- a particular RN identity shall be available in only one UICC.
The procedures for managing the binding between USIM-RN and the RN are out of
scope of the present document.
The UICC may know the identity of the RN authorized to set up a secure channel
with the USIM-RN by configuration. The standard secure OTA mechanisms (TS
31.116 [31]) can be used to update the configuration of UICC and renew the
stored identities if required.
NOTE: The RN identity is contained in the subject name of the RN certificate.
It is described in detail in clause D.3.3 of the present document and in TS
31.102 [13].
## D.2.4 Enrolment procedures for RNs
This subclause applies only to the certificate-based case.
The RN may enroll a device certificate as with macro eNBs according to TS
33.310 [6] prior to the RN attach procedure with the DeNB. This certificate
may then be used for establishing the secure channel between RN and USIM-RN.
The certificate enrolment procedure does not rely on the security at the AS
level, but is secured at the application layer. It can be therefore executed
before security on the Un interface has been established. However, the RN
requires IP connectivity for the enrolment procedure to be able to reach the
Registration Authority RA.
The IP connectivity required for enrolment may be established in the following
ways:
(1) The RN may use offline means for enrolment purposes. No USIM is required.
(2) The RN may attach to an eNB like a normal UE using a USIM, called USIM-
INI, different from the one used in the RN attach procedure to the DeNB,
called USIM-RN. No secure channel between RN and USIM-INI is required.
In both cases, the network shall ensure that the destinations the RN can reach
are restricted to only the PDN(s) where the RA (Registration Authority for the
certificate enrolment) and other servers to be contacted during phase I, e.g.
the OAM server are located. In case (2) this shall be ensured by restricting
IP traffic originating from the RN and sent only to certain destinations
(APNs). The restrictions are assumed to be part of the profile relating to the
subscription associated with the USIM-INI.
## D.2.5 Secure management procedures for RNs
The requirements on communication between the OAM systems and the eNB from
clause 5.3.2 shall apply for relay nodes in both phases I and II. The
mechanisms used to fulfil these requirements shall include applying security
association(s) that extend between the RN and an entity in the Evolved Packet
Core (EPC) or in an OAM domain trusted by the operator.
NOTE 1: No mechanisms used to fulfil these requirements are mandated in the
present document. But example mechanisms are given in NOTE 3 below. NOTE 3 is
followed by normative text, which applies if the example mechanisms are used.
NOTE 2: In case of offline configuration of the RN, the security measures used
to fulfil the requirements from clause 5.3.2 are out of scope of the present
document.
NOTE 3: Examples for mechanisms to secure OAM communication to and from RNs
are:\ _\- end-to-end security_ terminated within or just in front of the OAM
server;\ _\- hop-by-hop security via SEG in EPC_ which is particularly suited
for multiple management connections to separate OAM servers located within one
\"management domain\".
If IKEv2/IPsec or TLS with authentication based on certificates is used for
the security association(s), the protocol profiles for IPsec in TS 33.210 [5]
and for IKEv2 and TLS in TS 33.310 [6] and the certificate profiles given in
TS 33.310 [6] should be followed.
NOTE 4: As the USIM-INI can be accessed by any UE, an attacker can use the
USIM-INI to connect to the APN used for OAM in phase I. In case of end-to-end
security the OAM server itself has to be secured accordingly. In the hop-by-
hop case the SEG can defend against attacks (e.g. DoS attacks) carried out via
this channel.
The RN requires IP connectivity for the management procedure to be able to
reach the OAM server.
For the pre-shared key case in Phase I, IP connectivity can be established
after step Ep2 with the RN attaching to an eNB like a normal UE using the
USIM-RN.
For the certificate-based case in Phase I, IP connectivity established for
enrolment purposes according to clause D.2.4 may be re-used, or, if not
available, it may be established in the same ways as described in clause
D.2.4.
Restrictions on the destinations the RN can reach shall apply if the
communication with the OAM server prior to the RN attach procedure is based on
USIM-INI. They shall be realized in the same way as described in clause D.2.4.
## D.2.6 Certificate and subscription handling
Whenever the operator intends to prevent the RN from attaching to the network
the operator shall bar the subscription relating to the USIM-RN in the HSS.
In the certificate-based case the barring of the subscription relating to the
USIM-RN shall be performed also whenever the RN certificate has to be revoked,
or whenever the UICC certificate has to be revoked and the RN is not
configured to always check the UICC certificate against a CRL, cf. below.
In the pre-shared key case, the barring of the subscription relating to the
USIM-RN may be performed also whenever the operator sees a risk that the pre-
shared key between the USIM-RN and RN has been compromised.
NOTE 0: In the certificate-based case, checking the UICC certificate against a
CRL and barring the subscription relating to the USIM-RN are not equivalent.
The former could prevent the following attack while the latter could not: an
attacker in possession of a compromised private key relating to the UICC
certificate could get stolen RNs to work in his own network as then the
attacker could use a fake UICC, with subscription data generated by himself,
towards the RN to set up a secure channel. Subscription barring would not be
effective in the attacker's network while the CRL check by the RN would ensure
that the RN cannot attach as an RN to a network other than the one of the
operator who provisioned the root certificate in the RN. If the operator deems
the risk of such an attack low he may configure his RNs to not use CRL checks
against UICC certificates.
NOTE 0a: In the pre-shared key case, the proprietary measures may need to
consider the attack described in the preceding NOTE 0.
The remainder of this subclause applies only to the certificate-based case.
As described in clause D.2.2, step Ec6, the certificate validation client on
the UICC verifies the signatures in the RN certificate chain up to the root
certificate, but omits the check of revocation status and expiry time. To
achieve the same effect as checking RN certificate's revocation status and
expiry time, the associated USIM-RN subscription shall be barred in the HSS.
This process is called 'invalidation' in this document and is explained
further below.
A certificate validation client on the RN shall check the verification of the
signatures in the UICC certificate chain up to the root certificate as well as
the expiry time. The revocation status of the UICC certificate should be
checked by means of the CRL obtained by the RN in clause D.2.2, step Ec3. The
CRL check is optional to support by the RN.
_Further considerations on RN certificate and USIM-RN subscription handling:_
By using the one-to-one binding of RN and USIM-RN, a part of the usual
certificate handling is replaced by subscription handling, as explained below:
_Binding in network:_ The one-to-one binding of RN and USIM-RN shall be
expressed by a one-to-one mapping of the RN identity in any certificate issued
to the RN and the IMSI in the USIM-RN. The operator shall maintain a table
with this mapping (the \"mapping table\").
_Binding in UICC_ : cf. clause D.2.3.
_Lifetime:_ The subscription shall have a limit on its lifetime. When the
lifetime of the subscription is exceeded the subscription shall be barred in
the HSS. The lifetime shall not be greater than the lifetime of the RN
certificate. The latter is not checked in the UICC, cf. clause D.2.2.
_RN Certificate revocation and invalidation_ : Whenever the operator decides
that the RN certificate shall no longer be used for setting up a secure
channel with the USIM-RN the operator does not use CRLs or OCSP, but shall
retrieve the IMSI associated with the subject name in the RN certificate and
bar the subscription corresponding to the IMSI in the HSS. The certificate
shall also be revoked, but the operator does not need to use CRLs or OCSP in
this context. This implies that no new certificate shall be issued for the
same RN identity from that point onwards. In case the RN certificate is also
used for other purposes, e.g. for protecting an OAM connection, then,
additionally, the usual PKI revocation procedures apply.
_RN compromise_ : If the operator has reason to believe that an RN has been
compromised the RN certificate shall be invalidated and revoked as described
above.
_RN Certificate renewal_ : This process may be used as normal as long as the
RN identity in the RN certificate remains the same.
NOTE 1: Certificate renewal with private key change may be useful even if the
UICC does not check the expiry time of the certificate as, in this way, the
use of the private key can be limited if desired.
_RN Certificate expiry:_
NOTE 2 _:_ As the UICC has no clock it cannot check the expiry time and,
hence, the RN could also use an expired certificate in the secure channel set-
up. As the certificate is only checked by the UICC for RN platform
authentication in the secure channel set-up this is not a problem as long as
the corresponding private key has not left the secure environment of the RN.
More generally, if there is a risk that it has been compromised the operator
will bar the corresponding subscription in the HSS. The use of the certificate
is limited by the lifetime of the subscription bound to the RN. However, a
UICC can be re-used with a different RN after having been re-configured with a
different RN identity.
# D.3 Secure channel profiles
## D.3.1 General
The clause D.3 profiles the algorithms to be used on the APDU secure channel,
cf. ETSI TS 102 484 [29]. In addition it specifies the profiles for the
different key agreement methods.
For the case when certificates are used for key agreement, the profiles are
given for the TLS handshake used to provide key material for the Master SA of
the secure channel between USIM-RN and RN, and for the certificates used in
UICC and RN for mutual authentication during TLS handshake. For the psk case
requirements on the key agreement with pre-shared keys are given.
## D.3.2 APDU secure channel profile
For communication between the USIM-RN and the RN a secure channel according to
the APDU secure channel as specified in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] shall be used.
Further detailing of the secure channel is given in TS 31.102 [13].
For encryption, AES-CBC as specified in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] shall be
mandatory to support. Other encryption algorithms specified in ETSI TS 102 484
[29] may be supported. The algorithm \"3DES - outer CBC using 2 keys\" shall
not be used.
NOTE 1: The algorithm \"3DES - outer CBC using 2 keys\" is outdated.
For integrity protection, AES-CMAC as specified in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] shall
be mandatory to support. Other integrity protection algorithms specified in
ETSI TS 102 484 [29] shall not be used.
NOTE 2: The algorithm CRC32 is for redundancy check only, and not a
cryptographic checksum. The algorithm \"ANSI Retail MAC\" is not fit for long-
term usage in the scope of the present document.
## D.3.3 Key agreement based on certificate exchange
### D.3.3.1 TLS profile
The key agreement for the certificate exchange case shall follow the mechanism
\"Certificate exchange\" as specified in ETSI TS 102 484 [29].
During key agreement based on certificate exchange a TLS handshake is used to
provide key material for the Master SA of the APDU secure channel between
USIM-RN and RN.
The TLS profile shall follow the profile given in Annex E of TS 33.310 [6]
with the following restrictions and extensions:
\- the support of the ciphersuite mandatory for TLS 1.1 as described in TS
33.310 [6] is not required;
\- the support of fallback to TLS 1.0 as described in TS 33.310 [6] is not
required;
\- neither UICC nor RN shall use TLS session resumption.
### D.3.3.2 Common profile for RN and UICC certificate
The certificate profile for both RN and UICC certificates shall follow the TLS
entity certificate profile given in clause 6.1.3a of TS 33.310 [6] with the
following restrictions and extensions:
\- the support of the SHA-1 algorithm for use before signing the certificate
as described in TS 33.310 [6] is not required;
\- the support of public key length of 1024-bit is not required;
\- only the subject name format with \"(C=\), O=\,
CN=\\" is mandatory to support.
### D.3.3.3 RN certificate profile
The RN certificate is used as client certificate in the TLS handshake between
RN and UICC.
The certificate profile for the RN certificate shall follow clause D.3.3.2 of
the present document with the following restrictions and extensions:
\- the subject name shall be unique within all subject names issued by CAs
under the same root CA;
\- the subject name may additionally contain the attribute
\"serialNumber=\\";
\- the support of the countryName (C) and serialNumber attributes in the
subject name is mandatory;
NOTE 1: The usage of the countryName (C) and serialNumber attributes can
support the operator in generating a unique identity for an RN.
\- the CRL distribution point is not used if the RN certificate is only used
in the setup of the secure channel with the UICC. Therefore the CRL
distribution point is optional in this case.
NOTE 2: It may be desired to deploy the same RN certificate also for RN
platform authentication to other network elements of the operator, e.g. if TLS
with mutual authentication is used for an OAM connection. The profile given
above is intended to allow such usage. Regarding the implementation of
certificate handling in the UICC it should be noted that for this additional
usage of the RN certificate the existence of additional fields in the
certificate is possible, e.g. of the subjectAltName and/or the CRL
distribution point, which are not relevant for the secure channel between RN
and UICC.
### D.3.3.4 UICC certificate profile
The UICC certificate is used as server certificate in the TLS handshake
between RN and UICC.
The certificate profile for the UICC certificate shall follow clause D.3.3.2
of the present document with the following additional provisions:
\- the CRL distribution point in the UICC certificate is optional.
NOTE 1: The CRL distribution point and the support for CRL infrastructure for
the UICC certificate is only needed if the revocation check of the UICC
certificate is performed during setup of the secure channel (cf. clause
D.2.6).
NOTE 2: In common TLS usage, the RN learns the UICC certificate only during
TLS handshake, when the IP connectivity to the core network using USIM-INI may
no longer be available. Thus the CRL distribution point for CRLs having UICC
certificates in scope would be known too late to allow the RN to retrieve an
up-to-date CRL from the network. By reading the UICC certificate from the UICC
before the establishment of the secure channel starts, the RN may learn the
CRL distribution point while it still has IP connectivity based on USIM-INI,
cf. step Ec3 in clause D.2.2. For access to the UICC certificate see the
definition of the EF for UICC certificate in TS 31.102 [13].
## D.3.4 Key agreement for pre-shared key (psk) case
The key agreement for the psk case shall follow the mechanism \"Strong Pre-
shared Keys - Proprietary Pre-agreed keys\" as specified in ETSI TS 102 484
[29]. The pre-shared key shall be used directly to derive a Master secret for
the Master SA.
NOTE: The above requirement includes that the pre-shared key fulfills the
requirements for WeakKey=0 as specified in clause 7.2 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29].
## D.3.5 Identities used in key agreement
The key agreement mechanisms specified in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] produce a value
Ks_Local_Ref, which is a reference to Ks_local. It is transferred from the RN
to the UICC during the Master SA setup and is used as input to the derivation
of the 256 bit Master secret (MS) of the Master SA in the certificate exchange
case.
Ks_Local_Ref is specified in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] as the concatenation of
identities as follows:
Ks_Local_Ref = Terminal_ID \|\| Terminal_appli_ID \|\| UICC_ID \|\|
UICC_appli_ID.
The identities used in the scope of the present document for Ks_Local_Ref are
specified as follows:
\- UICC_ID: This unique identifier for the UICC shall be the ICCID for the
UICC as specified in ETSI TS 102 221 [32].
NOTE: The UICC_ID may be read by the RN from the UICC before establishment of
the secure channel.
\- UICC_appli_ID: This unique identifier for the UICC application that hosts
the UICC endpoint shall be the USIM-RN AID as specified in TS 31.102 [13].
\- Terminal_ID: This unique identifier for the RN shall be the subject name of
the RN certificate as specified in clause D.3.3.3. In the psk case, where no
certificate is used, the same definition as for the certificate exchange case
shall apply.
\- Terminal_appli_ID: This unique identifier for the application that hosts
the RN side endpoint shall be set to the UTF-8 encoded string
\"Relay_Node_appli\".
###### ## Annex E (normative): Dual connectivity
# E.1 Introduction
## E.1.1 General
This clause describes the security functions necessary to support a UE that is
simultaneously connected to more than one eNB for the architectures for dual
connectivity as described in TS 36.300 [30]. The security functions are
described in the context of the functions controlling the dual connectivity.
## E.1.2 Dual Connectivity architecture with an SeNB
For dual connectivity architecture, which hosts PDCP in MeNB the security
functions described for the single connectivity mode in this specification are
sufficient. The reason for that they are sufficient, is that the end-point for
the encryption remains in the MeNB. That is, from a security point of view,
the PDCP packets are still processed in the same locations in the
architecture; they have only travelled a different path via the SeNB.
The remainder of the present subclause deals with dual connectivity between an
MeNB and an SeNB with the architecture as shown in Figure E.1. 2-1.
Figure E.1.2-1: Dual Connectivity architecture with an SeNB
When the MeNB establishes security between an SeNB and the UE for the first
time for a given AS security context shared between the MeNB and the UE, the
MeNB generates the S-K~eNB~ for the SeNB and sends it to the SeNB over the
X2-C. To generate the S-K~eNB~, the MeNB associates a counter, called an SCG
Counter, with the current AS security context. The SCG Counter is used as
freshness input into S-K~eNB~ derivations as described in the clause E.2.4,
and guarantees, together with the other provisions in the present clause E,
that the K~UPenc~ derived from the same S-K~eNB~ is not re-used with the same
input parameters as defined in Annex B of the present specification. The
latter would result in key-stream re-use. The MeNB sends the value of the SCG
Counter to the UE over the RRC signalling path when it is required to generate
a new S-K~eNB~.
The communication established between the SeNB and the UE is protected at the
PDCP layer using the AS Secondary Cell security context, or AS SC security
context for short. The AS SC security context includes parameters as the AS
security context described in clause 7 of the present specification, the
S-K~eNB~ replaces the K~eNB~. The UE and the SeNB derives the K~UPenc~ from
the S-K~eNB~ as described in clause A.7, cf. also E.2.4.2.
## E.1.3 Dual Connecivity architecture with an SgNB
Annex E.3 describes the security functions necessary to support a UE that is
simultaneously connected to eNB as master and gNB as secondary for EN-DC dual
connectivity. The description in Annex E.3 is focused on the difference from
dual connectivity in E-UTRAN described in Annex E.2. The major differences are
a) with dual connectivity between an MeNB and an SgNB compared to between an
MeNB and an SeNB is that in the former case a RRC signalling connection is
allowed between the UE and the SgNB. Such a RRC signalling connection shall be
integrity protected in addition to the ciphered with the chosen ciphering
algorithm;
b) EPS bearers from the core network to the SgNB may be Split across the radio
resources of both MeNB and SgNB (as well as being Non-Split and only using
radio resources of the SgNB); and
c) for bearers whose PDCP terminates in the MeNB, the security functions
described for the single connectivity mode in this specification shall be
used, while for bearers whose PDCP terminates in the SgNB, the security
algorithm given in subclause E.3.10.1 with key derived as given in clause A.19
shall be used.
Figure E.1.3-1 Offload architecture for EN-DC
When the MeNB establishes security between a SgNB and the UE for the first
time for a given AS security context shared between the MeNB and the UE, the
MeNB generates the S-K~gNB~ (exactly as it would generate an S-K~eNB~) for the
SgNB and sends it to the SgNB over the X2-C. The SCG Counter is also used as
freshness input into S-K~gNB~ derivations as described in the clause E.2.4,
and guarantees, together with the other provisions in the present clause E,
that the integrity and ciphering keys used at the SgNB derived from the same
S-K~gNB~ are not re-used with the same input parameters to avoid in key-stream
re-use and provide replay protection. The MeNB sends the value of the SCG
Counter to the UE over the LTE RRC signalling path when it is required to
generate a new S-K~gNB~.
The communication established between the SgNB and the UE is protected at the
PDCP layer using the SgNB Secondary Cell security context, or SgNB SC security
context for short. The SgNB SC security context includes S-K~gNB~, the key
used as input to the UP confidentiality algorithm, K~SgNB-UP-enc~, the key
used as the input to the RRC confidentiality algorithm, K~SgNB-RRC-enc~, the
key used as the input for the RRC integrity algorithm, K~SgNB-RRC-int~, the
identifiers of the selected cryptographic algorithms and counters used for
replay protection. Although the SgNB may support the UP integrity protection
algorithmsand the capability of activating the UP integrity protection using
the RRC protocol between the UE and the SgNB, the UP integrity protection is
not activated. The UE and the SgNB derives the integrity and ciphering keys
from the S-K~gNB~ as described in clause A.19, cf. also E.3.4.2.
# E.2 Dual connectivity offload architecture between eNBs
## E.2.1 Protection of the X2 reference point
The control plane signalling between MeNB and SeNB, that includes the transfer
of the S-K~eNB~ from the MeNB to the SeNB, over the X2 reference point shall
be confidentiality and integrity protected using X2-C security protection as
described in clause 5.3.4a and clause 11 of the present specification. Any
user plane data between MeNB and SeNB over X2 reference point shall be
confidentiality and integrity protected using X2-U security protection as
described in clause 5.3.4 and clause 12 of the present specification.
## E.2.2 Addition and modification of DRB in SeNB
When executing the SeNB Addition procedure (i.e. the initial offload of one or
more radio bearers to the SeNB), or the SeNB Modification procedure requiring
an update of S-K~eNB~, the MeNB shall derive an S- K~eNB~ as defined in clause
E.2.4, which results in a fresh S-K~eNB~. The MeNB shall forward the generated
S-K~eNB~ to the SeNB during the SeNB Addition procedure or SeNB Modification
procedure requiring key update.
Note: Refer to TS 36.300 [30] for definition of the SeNB Addition and SeNB
Modification procedures.
The SeNB shall derive a key K~UPenc~ from the received S-K~eNB~ as defined in
clause E.2.4 of the present specification and use it for all radio bearers
that were being added.
At any point of time, the same K~UPenc~ is used for encrypting all radio
bearers between the SeNB and the UE. Once the K~UPenc~ has been derived from
the S-K~eNB~, the SeNB and UE may delete the S-K~eNB~.
The MeNB shall provide the value of the SCG Counter used in the derivation of
the S-K~eNB~ to the UE in the SeNB Addition procedure adding the radio
bearer(s) in the UE. The UE shall derive the S-K~eNB~ and K~UPenc~ as
described in clause E.2.4.
When executing the procedure for adding subsequent radio bearer(s) to the same
SeNB, the MeNB shall, for each new radio bearer, assign a radio bearer
identity that has not previously been used since the last S-K~eNB~ change.
If the MeNB cannot allocate an unused radio bearer identity for a new radio
bearer in the SeNB, due to radio bearer identity space exhaustion, the MeNB
shall increment the SCG Counter and compute a fresh S-K~eNB~, and then shall
perform a SeNB Modification procedure to update the S-K~eNB~. The MeNB may
choose to update the S-K~eNB~ instead of assigning a new radio bearer identity
even when the latter would have been possible.
If the SeNB receives a new S-K~eNB~ from the MeNB during the SeNB Modification
procedure, the SeNB shall use the K~UPenc~ derived from the new S-K~eNB~ as
encryption key for all the radio bearer (s).
If the UE receives a new SCG Counter in SeNB Addition/Modification procedure,
then the UE shall use the K~UPenc~ derived from the new S-K~eNB~, as the
encryption key for all the radio bearer(s) established with the SeNB.
When the last radio bearer on the SeNB is released, the SeNB Release procedure
is performed; the SeNB and the UE shall delete the K~UPenc~. The SeNB and UE
shall also delete the S‑K~eNB~, if it was not deleted earlier.
## E.2.3 Activation of encryption/decryption
The DRB offload procedure with activation of encryption/decryption follows the
steps outlined on the Figure E.2.3-1.
Figure E.2.3-1. SeNB encryption/decryption activation
1\. The UE and the MeNB establish the RRC connection.
2\. The MeNB decides to offload the DRB(s) to the SeNB. The MeNB sends SeNB
Addition Request to the SeNB over the X2-C to negotiate the available
resources, configuration, and algorithms at the SeNB. The MeNB computes and
delivers the S-K~eNB~ to the SeNB as necessary. UE EPS security capability
should also be sent to SeNB.
3\. The SeNB allocates the necessary resources and chooses the ciphering
algorithm which has the highest priority from its configured list and is also
present in the UE EPS security capability.
4\. The SeNB sends SeNB Addition Request Acknowledge to the MeNB indicating
availability of requested resources and the identifiers for the selected
algorithm to serve the requested DRB for the UE.
5\. The MeNB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Request to the UE
instructing it to configure a new DRB for the SeNB. The MeNB shall include the
SCG Counter parameter to indicate that the UE shall compute the S-K~eNB~ for
the SeNB and the K~UPenc~ associated with the assigned bearer. The MeNB
forwards the UE configuration parameters (which contains the algorithm
identifier received from the SeNB in step 4) to the UE (see section E.2.4.3
for further details).
NOTE: Since the message is sent over the RRC connection between the MeNB and
the UE, it is integrity protected using the K~RRCint~ of the MeNB. Hence the
SCG Counter cannot be tampered with, and the UE can assume that it is fresh.
6\. The UE accepts the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Command and shall
compute the S-K~eNB~ for the SeNB. The UE shall also compute the K~UPenc~ for
the associated assigned DRB on the SeNB. The UE sends the RRC Reconfiguration
Complete to the MeNB. The UE activates encryption/decryption once S-K~eNB~ and
K~UPenc~ are derived.
7\. MeNB sends SeNB Reconfiguration Complete to the SeNB over the X2-C to
inform SeNB configuration result. On receipt of this message, SeNB may
activate encryption/decryption with UE. If SeNB does not activate
encryption/decryption with the UE at this stage, SeNB shall activate
encryption/decryption upon receiving the Random Access request from the UE.
## E.2.4 Derivation of keys for the DRBs in the SeNB
### E.2.4.1 SCG Counter maintenance
The MeNB shall associate a 16-bit counter, SCG Counter, with the EPS AS
security context.
The SCG Counter is used when computing the S-K~eNB~. The UE and the MeNB shall
treat the SCG Counter as a fresh input to S-K~eNB~ derivation. That is, the UE
assumes that the MeNB provides a fresh SCG Counter each time and does not need
to verify the freshness of the SCG Counter.
NOTE: An attacker cannot, over the air modify the SCG Counter and force re-use
of the same SCG Counter. The reason for this is that the SCG Counter is
delivered over the RRC connection between the MeNB and the UE, and this
connection is both integrity protected and protected from replay.
The MeNB maintains the value of the counter SCG Counter for a duration of the
current AS security context between UE and MeNB. The UE does not need to
maintain the SCG Counter after it has computed the S-K~eNB~ since the MeNB
provides the UE with the current SCG Counter value when the UE needs to
compute a new S-K~eNB~.
The MeNB that supports the DRB offload shall set the SCG Counter to '0' when
the K~eNB~ in the associated AS security context is established. The MeNB
shall set the SCG Counter to '1' after the first calculated S- K~eNB~, and
monotonically increment it for each additional calculated S- K~eNB~. The SCG
Counter value \'0\' is hence used to calculate the first S-K~eNB~.
If the MeNB decides to turn off the offload connection and later decides to
re-start the offloading to the same SeNB, the SCG Counter value shall keep
increasing, thus keeping the computed S-K~eNB~ fresh.
The MeNB shall refresh the K~eNB~ of the AS security context associated with
the SCG Counter before the SCG Counter wraps around. Re‑freshing the K~eNB~ is
done using intra cell handover as described in clause 7.2.9.3 of the present
specification. When this K~eNB~ is refreshed, the SCG Counter is reset to
\'0\' as defined above.
### E.2.4.2 Security key derivation
The UE and MeNB shall derive the security key S-K~eNB~ of the target SeNB as
defined in Annex A.15 of the present specification.
The addition to the LTE key hierarchy with derivation of the S-K~eNB~ is shown
on Figure E.2.4.2-1.
Figure E.2.4.2-1 Addition to the Key Hierarchy for the SeNB
The SeNB and the UE shall further derive the ciphering key K~UPenc~ for
ciphering of the User Plane over the DRB. This derivation is performed
according to Annex A.7 using the S-K~eNB~ as the input key and the input
string S formed using the IDs of the SeNB selected algorithm to the KDF.
NOTE: In the present specification, only a user plane encryption key is
required between UE and SeNB. But the key derivation procedure permits
deriving further keys according to Annex A.7 if this should be desired in the
future.
### E.2.4.3 Negotiation of security algorithms
When establishing one or more DRBs for a UE at the SeNB, as shown on Figure
E.2.3-1, the MeNB shall forward the UE EPS security capabilities associated
with the UE in the SeNB Addition/Modification procedure.
Upon receipt of this message, the SeNB shall identify the AS encryption
algorithm with highest priority in the locally configured priority list of AS
encryption algorithms that is also present in the received UE EPS security
capabilities and include an indicator for the locally identified AS encryption
algorithm in SeNB Addition/Modification Request Acknowledge.
The MeNB shall forward the indication to the UE during the
RRCConnectionReconfiguration procedure that establishes the SCG DRBs in the
UE. The UE shall use the indicated encryption algorithm for the SCG DRBs.
NOTE: The UE uses one encryption algorithm for encryption of SRB and any
potential DRB(s) established with MeNB, and a same or different encryption
algorithm for encryption of DRB(s) established with SeNB.
## E.2.5 S-K~eNB~ update
### E.2.5.1 S-K~eNB~ update triggers
The system supports update of the S-K~eNB~. The MeNB may update the S-K~eNB~
for any reason by using the S-K~eNB~ update procedure defined in clause E.2.
5.2 of the current specification. The SeNB shall request the MeNB to update
the S-K~eNB~ over the X2-C, when uplink or downlink PDCP COUNTs are about to
wrap around for any of the DRBs.
If the MeNB re-keys its currently active K~eNB~ in an AS security context the
MeNB shall update any S-K~eNB~ associated with that AS security context. This
retains the two-hop security property for X2-handovers.
### E.2.5.2 S-K~eNB~ update procedure
If the MeNB receives a request for S-K~eNB~ update from the SeNB or decides on
its own to perform S-K~eNB~ update (see clause E.2.5.1), the MeNB shall
compute a fresh S-K~eNB~ and increment the SCG Counter~,~ as defined in clause
E.2.4. Then the MeNB shall perform a SeNB Modification procedure to deliver
the fresh S-K~eNB~ to the SeNB. The MeNB shall provide the value of the SCG
Counter used in the derivation of the S-K~eNB~ to the UE in an integrity
protected RRC procedure. The UE shall derive the S-K~eNB~ and K~UPenc~ as
described in clause E.2.4.
Whenever the UE or SeNB start using a fresh S-K~eNB~, they shall re-calculate
the K~UPenc~ from the fresh S-K~eNB~.
## E.2.6 Handover procedures
During S1 and X2 handover, the offloaded DRB connection between the UE and the
SeNB is released, and the AS SC security context at SeNB and UE can be deleted
since it shall not be used again.
## E.2.7 Periodic local authentication procedure
SeNB may request the MeNB to execute a counter check procedure specified in
clause 7.5 of this specification to verify the value of the PDCP COUNT(s)
associated with DRB(s) offloaded to the SeNB. To accomplish this, the SeNB
shall communicate this request, including the expected values of PDCP COUNT(s)
and associated radio bearer identities (which are identified by E-RAB Id(s) in
X2AP), to the MeNB over the X2-C.
If the MeNB receives a RRC counter check response from the UE that contains
one or several PDCP COUNT values (possibly associated with both MeNB and
SeNB), the MeNB may release the connection or report the difference of the
PDCP COUNT values to the serving MME or O&M server for further traffic
analysis for e.g. detecting the attacker.
## E.2.8 Radio link failure recovery
Since the MeNB holds the control plane functions even in dual connectivity,
the UE runs the RRC re-establishment procedure with the MeNB as specified in
clause 7.4.3 of the present specification.
NOTE: During the RRC re-establishment procedure, the DRB(s) offloaded between
the UE and the SeNB is (are) released. If MeNB still want to offload DRB(s) to
SeNB, SeNB addition is performed as specified in E.2.2.
## E.2.9 Avoiding key stream reuse caused by DRB type change
When a MCG DRB changes to SCG DRB and then changes back to MCG DRB, the key
stream reuse is possible. MeNB shall implement a mechanism to prevent key
stream reuse.
# E.3 Dual connectivity architecture between a MeNB and a SgNB
## E.3.1 Protection of the X2 reference point
The protection of X2 interface shall use the X2-C security and X2-U security
as described in subclause E.2.1 of the present document.
## E.3.2 Addition and modification of DRBs and/or SRB in SgNB
The S-K~eNB~ that is used for dual connectivity between eNBs (see subclause
E.2.3) is also used as the root for the security context at the SgNB. When
used in the contexts of dual connectivity with an SgNB, the key shall be
called an S-K~gNB~, i.e. the MeNB generates and forwards an S-K~gNB~ to the
SgNB during the SgNB Addition procedure or SgNB Modification procedure
requiring key update.
NOTE 1: Refer to TS 36.300 [30] for definition of the SgNB Addition and SgNB
Modification procedures.
Similarly, the MeNB handles the SCG Counter due to interactions with a SgNB as
described in subclause E.2.2 for interactions with SeNBs, i.e. this is a
single shared SCG Counter for SeNBs and SgNBs and provides the same value of
SCG Counter used to the UE and ensure that fresh radio bearer identities are
used or the S-K~gNB~ is refreshed.
When the SgNB receives an S-K~gNB~ in a SgNB Addition/Modification procedure,
the SgNB shall derive and store K~SgNB-UP-enc~ as well as K~SgNB-RRC-int~ and
K~SgNB-RRC-enc~ if an SRB is to be added as described in subclause E.3.4.2
from the received S-K~gNB~. These freshly derived keys are then used to
protect all the radio bearer(s) that use the PDCP of the SgNB. Any previous
such keys shall be deleted. If all the keys were derived, then the S-K~gNB~
may be deleted.
NOTE 2: The UP integrity protection is not activated in SgNB when connected to
EPC.
If the UE receives a new SCG Counter in SgNB Addition/Modification procedure,
then the UE shall derive a new S-K~gNB~ from this SCG Counter and use K~SgNB-
UP-enc~, K~SgNB-RRC-int~ and K~SgNB-RRC-enc~ derived from the new S-K~gNB~, as
the keys to protect all the radio bearer(s) using the PDCP of the SgNB. If all
the keys were derived, then the S-K~gNB~ may be deleted in the UE.
When the SgNB Release procedure releases the last radio bearer on the SgNB ,
the SgNB and the UE shall delete the K~SgNB-UPenc,~ K~SgNB-RRC-int~ and
K~SgNB-RRC-enc~. The SgNB and UE shall also delete the S‑K~gNB~, if it was not
deleted earlier.
## E.3.3 Activation of encryption/decryption of DRBs and
encryption/decryption/integrity protection of SRB
The dual connectivity procedure with activation of encryption/decryption of
Split and/or Non-Split SgNB terminated DRB(s) (i.e. a DRB for which PDCP is
located in the SgNB) and/or activation of encryption/decryption and integrity
protection of an SgNB terminated SRB (i.e. a SRB for which PDCP is located in
the SgNB) follows the steps outlined on the Figure E.3.3-1.
Figure E.3.3-1. SgNB encryption/decryption and integrity protection activation
1\. The UE and the MeNB establish the RRC connection.
2\. Before the MeNB decides to use dual connectivity for some DRB(s) and/or an
SRB with the SgNB, the MeNB shall check whether the UE has NR capability and
is authorized to access NR. The MeNB sends SgNB Addition Request to the SgNB
over the X2-C to negotiate the available resources, configuration, and
algorithms at the SgNB. When connected to EPC, the MeNB shall indicate to the
SgNB that UP integrity protection shall not be activated. The MeNB computes
and delivers the S-K~gNB~ to the SgNB if a new key is needed. The UE NR
security capability shall also be sent to SgNB.
NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: The UP integrity protection is not activated in SgNB when connected to
EPC.
3\. The SgNB allocates the necessary resources and chooses the ciphering
algorithm for the DRB(s) and SRB and integrity algorithm if an SRB is to be
established which has the highest priority from its configured list and is
also present in the UE NR security capability. If a new S-KgNB was delivered
to the SgNB, then the SgNB calculates K~SgNB-UP-enc~ as well as K~SgNB-RRC-
int~ and K~SgNB-RRC-enc~ if an SRB is to be established.
4\. The SgNB sends SgNB Addition Request Acknowledge to the MeNB indicating
availability of requested resources and the identifiers for the selected
algorithm(s) to serve the requested DRBs and/or SRB for the UE.
5\. The MeNB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Request to the UE
instructing it to configure the new DRBs and/or SRB for the SgNB. The MeNB
shall include the SCG Counter parameter to indicate that the UE shall compute
the S-K~gNB~ for the SgNB if a new key is needed. The MeNB forwards the UE
configuration parameters (which contains the algorithm identifier(s) received
from the SgNB in step 4) to the UE (see section E.3.4.3 for further details).
NOTE 3: Since the message is sent over the RRC connection between the MeNB and
the UE, it is integrity protected using the K~RRCint~ of the MeNB. Hence the
SCG Counter cannot be tampered with, and the UE can assume that it is fresh.
6\. The UE accepts the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Command. The UE shall
compute the S-K~gNB~ for the SgNB if an SCG Counter parameter was included.
The UE shall also compute K~SgNB-UP-enc~ as well as K~SgNB-RRC-int~ and
K~SgNB-RRC-enc~ for the associated assigned DRBs and/or SRB. The UE sends the
RRC Reconfiguration Complete to the MeNB. The UE activates the chosen
encryption/decryption and integrity protection at this point.
7\. MeNB sends SgNB Reconfiguration Complete to the SgNB over the X2-C to
inform the SgNB of the configuration result. On receipt of this message, SgNB
may activate the chosen encryption/decryption and integrity protection with
UE. If SgNB does not activate encryption/decryption and integrity protection
with the UE at this stage, SgNB shall activate encryption/decryption and
integrity protection upon receiving the Random Access request from the UE.
## E.3.4 Derivation of keys for RBs with PDCP in the SgNB
### E.3.4.1 SCG Counter maintenance
The same SCG Counter is used for both SeNB and SgNB and the handling for SgNBs
follow the procedures for SeNB given in E.2.4.1.
### E.3.4.2 Security key derivation
The UE and MeNB shall derive the security key S-K~gNB~ of the target SgNB as
defined in Annex A.15 of the present specification. K~SgNB-UP-enc~, K~SgNB-
RRC-int~ and K~SgNB-RRC-enc~ are derived from the S-K~gNB~ both at the SgNB
side and the UE side as shown on Figure E.3.4.2-1 using the function given in
Annex A.19.
Figure E.3.4.2-1 Addition to the Key Hierarchy for the SgNB
### E.3.4.3 Negotiation of security algorithms
The UE NR security capabilities shall be indicated to the network using a new
IE so that the support of EPS and NR algorithms can evolve independently. The
UE shall send the UE NR security capabilities to the MME in Attach Request and
(when possibly changing MME) TAU Request. To enable the usage of NR EN-DC with
an MME that does not understand the UE NR security capabilities in the new IE,
such an MME will drop the UE NR security capabilities and never save them in
its UE context. An eNB that does not receive the UE NR security capabilities
shall use the E-UTRAN security capabilities algorithms to create the supported
UE NR security capabilities (see Annex E.10.3.2 for more details).
An MME that has the UE NR security capabilities shall send the UE NR security
capabilities to the eNB in the S1-Initial Context Set-up message.
At S1-handover if the target MME receives the UE NR security capabilities from
the source MME, the target MME shall send the UE NR security capabilities to
the target eNB in the S1-AP Handover Request
At X2 handover, if the source eNB has the UE NR security capabilities, the
source eNB shall send the UE NR security capabilities to the target eNB. These
UE NR security capabilities should be the same as received from the MME on the
S1 interface.
After a handover, it is possible that an eNB may have not received the UE NR
security capabilities as the UE may have just been handed over from an eNB or
MME that does not support the UE NR security capabilities. To overcome such a
possible problem, the eNB shall create the UE NR security capabilities from
the supported E-UTRAN security algorithms. To do this, the eNB shall use the
mapping between the E-UTRAN security algorithms and NR security algorithms as
per Annex E.3.10.2. When adding SgNB while establishing an EN-DC connection,
the MeNB shall send these created UE NR security capabilities to the SgNB.
Other than for adding an SgNB, the created UE NR security capabilities shall
not be sent from the MeNB.
A target eNB that has received the UE NR security capabilities during handover
shall include the UE NR security capabilities in the S1-PATH SWITCH-REQUEST
message.
If an MME does not receive the UE NR security capabilities in the S1-PATH-
SWITCH-REQUEST message from the target eNB to which the UE is connected to, or
if an MME becomes aware that the eNB doesn't know the UE NR security
capabilities after an S1-handover, the MME should send the UE NR security
capabilities to the target eNB via the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
as specified in TS 36.413 [42], and the the target eNB shall store the UE NR
security capabilities in the UE context.
When establishing one or more DRBs and/or a SRB for a UE at the SgNB, as shown
on Figure E.3.3-1, the MeNB shall send the UE NR security capabilities
associated with the UE in the SgNB Addition/Modification procedure. Upon
receipt of this message, the SgNB shall identify the needed algorithm(s) with
highest priority in the locally configured priority list of algorithms that is
also present in the received UE NR security capabilities and include an
indicator for the locally identified algorithm(s) in SgNB
Addition/Modification Request Acknowledge.
The MeNB shall forward the indication to the UE during the
RRCConnectionReconfiguration procedure that establishes the SgNB terminated
DRBs and/or SgNB terminated SRB in the UE. The UE shall use the indicated
encryption algorithms for the SgNB terminated DRBs and/or SgNB terminated SRB
and the indicated integrity algorithm for the SgNB terminated SRB.
> NOTE: The UP integrity protection is not activated in SgNB when connected to
> EPC.
## E.3.5 S-K~gNB~ update
### E.3.5.1 S-K~gNB~ update triggers
The system supports update of the S-K~gNB~. The MeNB may update the S-K~gNB~
for any reason by using the S-K~gNB~ update procedure defined in clause
E.3.5.2 of the current specification. The SgNB shall request the MeNB to
update the S-K~gNB~ over the X2-C, when uplink or downlink PDCP COUNTs are
about to wrap around for any of the SgNB terminated DRBs or SgNB terminated
SRB.
If the MeNB re-keys its currently active K~eNB~ in an AS security context the
MeNB shall update any S-K~gNB~ associated with that AS security context. This
retains the two-hop security property for X2-handovers.
### E.3.5.2 S-K~gNB~ update procedure
If the MeNB receives a request for S-K~gNB~ update from the SgNB or decides on
its own to perform S-K~gNB~ update (see clause E.3.5.1), the MeNB shall
compute a fresh S-K~gNB~ and increment the SCG Counter~,~ as defined in clause
E.2.4. Then the MeNB shall perform a SgNB Modification procedure to deliver
the fresh S-K~gNB~ to the SgNB. The MeNB shall provide the value of the SCG
Counter used in the derivation of the S-K~gNB~ to the UE in an integrity
protected RRC procedure. The UE shall derive the S-K~gNB~ as described in
clause E.2.4.
Whenever the UE or SgNB start using a fresh S-K~gNB~, they shall re-calculate
K~SgNB-UP-enc~, K~SgNB-RRC-int~ and K~SgNB-RRC-enc~ from the fresh S-K~gNB~.
## E.3.6 Handover procedures
During S1 and X2 handover, the DRB connection between the UE and the SgNB
shall be released, and the AS SC security context at SgNB and UE shall be
deleted since it shall not be used again.
## E.3.7 Periodic local authentication procedure
SgNB may request the MeNB to execute a counter check procedure specified in
clause 7.5 of this specification to verify the value of the PDCP COUNT(s)
associated with DRB(s) offloaded to the SgNB. To accomplish this, the SgNB
shall communicate this request, including the expected values of PDCP COUNT(s)
and associated radio bearer identities (which are identified by E-RAB Id(s) in
X2AP), to the MeNB over the X2-C.
If the MeNB receives a RRC counter check response from the UE that contains
one or several PDCP COUNT values (possibly associated with both MeNB and
SgNB), the MeNB may release the connection or report the difference of the
PDCP COUNT values to the serving MME or O&M server for further traffic
analysis for e.g. detecting the attacker.
## E.3.8 Radio link failure recovery
Since the MeNB holds the control plane functions even in dual connectivity,
the UE runs the RRC re-establishment procedure with the MeNB as specified in
clause 7.4.3 of the present specification.
NOTE: During the RRC re-establishment procedure, the DRB(s) offloaded between
the UE and the SgNB is (are) released. If MeNB still want to offload DRB(s) to
SgNB, SgNB addition is performed as specified in E.3.2.
## E.3.9 Avoiding key stream reuse caused by DRB type change
When a DRB changes from a MeNB terminated DRB (i.e. a DRB for which PDCP is
located in the MeNB) to a SgNB terminated DRB and then changes back to a MeNB
terminated DRB, then key stream reuse is possible. MeNB shall implement a
mechanism to prevent key stream reuse.
## E.3.10 Protection of the traffic between the UE and SgNB
### E.3.10.1 General
The ciphering protection shall be applied between the UE and gNB at the PDCP
layer. The integrity protection shall be applied to the SRB between the UE and
gNB at the PDCP layer.
The inputs to the integrity and ciphering algorithms are the same as the input
for the algorithms in LTE. Both the UE and SgNB shall support the following
algorithms described in Annex D of TS 33.501 [43].
NEA0 (which is the same as EEA0) for both RRC and UP confidentiality.
128- NEA1 (which is the same as 128-EEA1) for both RRC and UP confidentiality.
128-NEA2 (which is the same as 128-EEA2) for both RRC and UP confidentiality.
128-NIA1 (which is the same as 128-EIA1) for RRC integrity protection.
128-NIA2 (which is the same as 128-EIA2) for RRC integrity protection.
Both the UE and SgNB may support the following algorithms described in Annex D
of TS 33.501 [43].
128-NEA3 (which is the same as 128-EEA3) for both RRC and UP confidentiality.
128-NIA3 (which is the same as 128-EIA3) for RRC integrity protection .
> The UE and SgNB shall not use NIA0 (which is the same as EIA0) between the
> UE and SgNB.
NOTE 1: UP integrity algorithms are supported by 5G-CN capable UEs but are not
used when the UEs are accessing EPC.
NOTE 2: The UP integrity protection is not activated in SgNB when connected to
EPC. The UE that can only access the EPC, and the SgNB that is only connected
to EPC does not need to support UP integrity algorithms.
### E.3.10.2 Creating the mapped UE NR security capabilities
The MeNB that does not have the UE NR security capabilities shall create them
as follow:
\- Set the support of NEA0, 128-NEA1, 128-NEA2, 128-NEA3, 128-NIA1, 128-NIA2,
128-NIA3 to the same as EEA0, 128-EEA1, 128-EEA2, 128-EEA3, 128-EIA1,
128-EIA2, 128-EIA3 respectively; and
\- Set the rest of the bits to 0.
This mapping of E-UTRAN security algorithms support to NR security algorithms
support means that for the purposes of dual connectivity to SgNB, the UE shall
have the same support for 128-NEA1 as 128-EEA1, 128-NEA2 as 128-EEA2, 128-NEA3
as 128-EEA3, 128-NIA1 as 128-EIA1, 128-NIA2 as 128-EIA2 and 128-NIA3 as
128-EIA3.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Isolated E-UTRAN Operation for Public Safety
# F.1 General Description
Isolated E-UTRAN Operation for Public Safety (IOPS) provides the ability to
maintain a level of communications for Public Safety users, via an IOPS-
capable eNB (or set of connected IOPS-capable eNBs), following the loss of
backhaul communications.
The Isolated E-UTRAN mode of operation is also applicable to the formation of
a Nomadic EPS deployment, i.e. a deployment of one or more standalone IOPS-
capable eNBs, creating a serving radio access network without backhaul
communications and also providing local IP connectivity and services to Public
Safety users in the absence of normal EPS infrastructure availability.
3GPP TS 22.346 [35] lists the general requirements for LTE networks in
Isolated E-UTRAN Operation for Public Safety (IOPS). A description of the
architectural concept of IOPS is given in informative Annex K of 3GPP TS
23.401 [2].
This annex provides security guidelines for the operation of Public Safety
networks in the no backhaul (to Macro EPC) scenario using the Local EPC
approach [2].
The Local EPC approach assumes that an IOPS network can comprise either:
\- A Local EPC and a single isolated IOPS-capable eNB (or a deployable IOPS-
capable eNB), which may be co-located or have connectivity to the Local EPC;
or
\- A Local EPC and two or more IOPS-capable eNBs (or deployable IOPS-capable
eNBs), which have connectity to a single Local EPC.
A Local EPC includes at least MME, SGW/PGW and HSS functionality.
The Public Safety network operator dedicates a PLMN identity to IOPS mode of
operation which is broadcast in System Information by the eNB when IOPS mode
is in operation. Only authorized IOPS-enabled UEs can access a PLMN indicated
as an IOPS PLMN.
# F.2 IOPS security solution
The security features and procedures described in this specification can be
used to provide a security solution for an IOPS network based upon the Local
EPC approach.
In order to ensure that support for IOPS does not compromise the security of
normal operation, when operating in IOPS mode the AKA procedure (subclause 6.1
of this specification) is performed between a USIM application dedicated
exclusively for IOPS operation on a UICC, present in IOPS-enabled UEs, and the
Local HSS (contained in the Local EPC). The same applies in the event of a
loss of backhaul communications and a transition of the IOPS-capable eNB to
support Isolated E-UTRAN operation for a population of IOPS-enabled UEs.
The USIM application dedicated exclusively for IOPS operation uses a distinct
set of security credentials separate from those used for 'normal' operation.
These credentials are configured in the Local HSS and in the UICC prior to the
commencement of IOPS operation.
The USIM application dedicated exclusively for IOPS operation, in an IOPS-
enabled UE, has a distinct set of security credentials which contains at
least:
\- A permanent key K (uniquely assigned for IOPS operation).
\- The PLMN identity assigned for IOPS network operation.
\- An IMSI (uniquely assigned for IOPS operation).
\- Access Class status of 11 or 15 (subject to regional/national regulatory
requirements and operator policy).
These credentials are provisioned in all Local HSSs within the Local EPCs
supporting IOPS operation where the Public Safety authority requires that the
UE be provided service in the event of a loss of backhaul communication.
Storage of the IOPS network security credential set in the Local HSS is only
performed for UEs authorised for operation in the IOPS network. Administrative
provisioning is used to keep up to date security credentials for all
authorised UEs at the Local HSSs within the Local EPCs. Updates are provided
within a security context that already exists between the EPC and eNBs in the
'normal' network.
This solution provides integrity and confidentiality for IOPS networks and
maintains commonality with the procedures defined in this specification.
Furthermore, the approach is aligned with the implementation and deployment
guidelines for IOPS as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
# F.3 Security Considerations
## F.3.1 Malicious switching of USIM applications
The use of a distinct set of security credentials counteracts the possibility
that malicious switching of USIM applications would permit unauthorised access
to an IOPS network or to a normal PLMN. eNBs operating in IOPS mode and Local
EPCs support Network Domain Control Plane protection (clause 11) and backhaul
link user plane protection (clause 12) as appropriate.
## F.3.2 Compromise of local HSSs
Subscriber credentials are provisioned in all Local HSSs within the Local EPCs
supporting IOPS operation where the Public Safety authority requires that the
UE be provided service in the event of a loss of backhaul communication. If
one of these local HSSs was compromised by an attacker, either in the form
that the attacker could obtain the subscriber credentials or that the attacker
could control the interface to the local HSS, and if, for any given
subscriber, the credentials in the local HSSs were the same, this would imply
that, for all subscribers whose credentials were stored in the compromised
local HSS, the USIMs out in the field would have to be swapped and the
subscriber credentials would have to be re-provisioned in all local HSS.
The following subclause F.4 describes a mechanism, termed \'subscriber key
separation\' that would mitigate the effects of a compromise of a local HSS,
as described in the preceding paragraph
NOTE 0:Void.
NOTE 1: Void
NOTE 2: Void.
# F.4 Mitigation of compromise of a local HSS
## F.4.0 Introduction
The text in the present subclause is informative as the described mechanism is
completely transparent to MEs, eNBs, MMEs, and, for local HSSs, requires only
configuration changes in the local Authentication Centres. The corresponding
configuration capability is already available in AuCs today. The mechanism
does require functional changes to UICCs, but not to the UICC-ME interface. As
both UICC and local Authentication Centre are under the control of one
operator, the configuration in the local Authentication Centre and the
functional changes to UICCs can be implemented without any normative changes
to existing 3GPP specifications. However, normative changes to UICC
specifications are not precluded by the present text.
## F.4.1 \'Subscriber key separation\' mechanism
**Subscriber key handling:**
For each subscriber, there is a subscriber master key MK for IOPS purposes.
This master key MK is stored in the UICC, but not in any local HSS. Assume
that there are N local HSSs, HSS_1, ..., HSS_N. As part of the provisioning
process for local HSS_n (1\.mnc\.mcc\. 3gppnetwork.org;
WTID = E-UTRAN Cell Identity (ECI) of eNB;
MNC = MNC of Serving Network PLMN Identity;
MCC = MCC of Serving Network PLMN Identity.
11) WLAN AP uses the realm and routes the EAP-Identity response to WT as AAA
message.
12) WT uses LWA-ID to locate the S-K~WT~. If LWA-ID is not found, the WT sends
EAP-Failure message, terminating the WLAN associtation.
13) WT initiates EAP-LWA, by sending AAA EAP-Request/LWA-Challenge message, by
including a 128-bit random nonce, ASNonce.
14) AP forwards the EAP-Request/LWA-Challenge message to the UE.
15) UE selects a 128-bit random nonce, STANonce, and derives AUTHRES and MSK
as follows:
AUTHRES = SHA256 (S-K~WT~, ASNonce, STANonce, "LWA AUTHRES");
MSK = SHA256 (S-K~WT~, ASNonce, STANonce, "LWA MSK Key Derivation").
16) UE sends EAP-Response/LWA-Challenge message with STANonce and AUTHRES.
17) WLAN AP forwards the EAP-Response/LWA-Challenge AAA message to WT.
18) WT derives AUTHRES and MSK as specified in step 15) and compares it with
the received AUTHRES. If they are same, EAP-LWA authentication is successful,
and proceeds to step 19). Otherwise EAP-Failure message is sent, terminating
WLAN association procedure.
19) WT sends EAP-Success with MSK as AAA message to WLAN AP.
20) WLAN AP sends EAP-Success.
21) Upon receiving EAP-Success, the UE and WLAN AP perform 4-way handshake and
complete WLAN association.
22) WT sends WT Association Confirm message to the eNB, confirming successful
WLAN association of the UE. Note that WT may send this message anytime after
step 19).
###### ## Annex H (normative): LTE-WLAN RAN level integration using IPsec
tunnelling
# H.1 General
This clause describes the security functions necessary to support LTE-WLAN
integration using IPsec tunnelling as described in TS 36.300 [30].
The LTE-WLAN integration architecture is shown in Figure H.1-1 and the
protocol stack in Figure H.1-2.
Figure H.1-1 LTE-WLAN integration architecture using IPsec tunnelling
Figure H.1-2 LTE-WLAN integration using IPsec tunnelling protocol stack
For LTE-WLAN integration using IPsec tunnelling the integration happens using
PDCP SDUs above the PDCP layer. The eNB controls activation of the integration
based on the UE connectivity with a specific WLAN. Once the integration is
activated, the eNB segregates incoming DL packets towards the UE for
offloading via the WLAN at a layer above PDCP. The UL packets from the UE are
aggregated by the eNB at the same logical point.
Since PDCP security is bypassed for the data routed through the WLAN and
security of the legacy WLAN is not assumed, security for the PDCP SDUs and
protection of the operator network shall be achieved in the following way:
\- A LWIP-SeGW shall be placed between the eNB and the WLAN network for
security of packets that traverse WLAN and to protect the Operator's network.
\- The interface between the eNB and the LWIP-SeGW shall be confidentiality
and integrity protected by NDS/IP TS 33.210 [36].
\- An UE-specific IPsec security association tunnel shall be established
between the UE and the public IP port of the LWIP-SeGW in tunnel mode.
\- In addition to terminating IPsec from the UE, the LWIP-SeGW shall perform
rate limitation for DoS protection on the eNB and its backhaul links.
\- UEs, including authenticated and authorized UEs using LWIP, shall not have
IP connectivity to the eNB.
\- IP headers created by the UE in LTE WLAN integration using IPsec tunnelling
shall not be parsed by the eNB.
NOTE 1: Void.
\- The UE and the LWIP-SeGW function shall perform mutual authentication in
the phase 2 of the IKEv2 handshake during the IPsec tunnel establishment,
using the authentication key derived from the current AS security association.
\- The LWIP-SeGW shall enforce binding of an authenticated UE to its IP
address, and apply anti-spoofing measures on received packets for the UE\'s
outer and inner IP source address(es).
\- The LWIP-SeGW shall ensure that uplink traffic sent by a UE is only sent
towards the correct eNB by conveying the traffic to a GTP-U tunnel over Xw.
NOTE 2: Void.
In addition, before the IPsec tunnel is established between the UE and the
LWIP-SeGW, and before the offload can be performed, the UE needs to obtain IP
connectivity across the WLAN network, which may require an access
authentication independent of the EPC authentication, and is outside the scope
of this specification.
# H.2 Security of LTE-WLAN integration using IPsec Tunnelling
## H.2.1 eNB to UE interaction for setting up the LWIP offload
When the eNB initially establishes LWIP with the UE, the eNB and the UE shall
generate the LWIP security key, LWIP-PSK, as specified in clause H.4, to be
used as the PSK for the IPsec tunnel set up between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW,
as described in clause H.2.2.
The eNB shall provide to the UE, over the secure RRC signalling, the following
parameters:
\- IP address of the LWIP-SeGW for the IKEv2 handshake,
\- The Initiator Identity value, IDi, that the UE shall use in the IKEv2
handshake.
\- LWIP counter that the UE shall use in LWIP-PSK derivation.
## H.2.2 UE to LWIP-SeGW interaction for setting up the LWIP offload
LTE-WLAN integration (LWIP) over legacy WLAN is secured using an IPSec in a
tunnel mode established between the UE, via the WLAN, and the LWIP-SeGW
function. The IPsec in tunnel mode is established using the IKEv2 handshake
based on the pre-shared key, PSK as specified in IETF RFC 7296 [38]. The UE
and LWIP-SeGW shall use the LWIP-PSK as the PSK for authentication in the
second phase of IKEv2.
In the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW, the inner IP addresses
shall be identical to the outer IP addresses. I.e., in UL the source IP
address shall be the IP address of the UE in the WLAN network and the
destination IP address shall be the public IP address of the SeGW, and in DL
the source IP address shall be the public IP address of the SeGW and the
destination IP address shall be the IP address of the UE in the WLAN network.
NOTE1: Void.
If the UE is located behind a NAT, the following will hold for the IPsec
tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW:
\- In UL between the UE and the NAT, the source IP address will be the local
address of the UE in the WLAN.
\- In DL between the LWIP-SeGW and the NAT, the destination IP address will be
the public IP address under which the UE located behind the NAT is reachable.
\- The NAT will then overwrite the address of the UE in the outer IP header
during transport.
When conducting the IKEv2 handshake, the UE shall use the value of IDi and the
IP address of the LWIP-SeGW received from the eNB.
The LWIP-SeGW shall use the received value of IDi to locate the corresponding
LWIP-PSK.
NOTE2: To improve the DoS protection of the public IP port of the LWIP-SeGW,
the LWIP-SeGW function can expect initiation of the IKEv2 handshake from the
UE for a limited time window, based on a configuration. After expiration of
this window, the LWIP-SeGW function can delete the LWIP-PSK and associated
IDi, and rejects any IKEv2 handshake initiations.
After successful completion of the IKEv2 handshake, the LWIP-SeGW and the UE
shall store the LWIP-PSK. When the IKEv2 SA is deleted, the LWIP-SeGW and the
UE shall delete the LWIP-PSK.
For LWIP offloaded traffic, the eNB shall only be reachable through the LWIP-
SeGW.
The LWIP-SeGW shall allow communication of the UE only to the eNB that
initiated the LWIP offload, and only to the interface on this eNB allowed for
the LWIP offload.
The profiles for IKEv2 and IPsec ESP as defined in TS 33.210 [36] shall be
used.
## H.2.3 eNB to LWIP-SeGW interaction for setting the LWIP offload
The PDCP SDUs between the eNB and LWIP SeGW shall be encapsulated in a
tunnelling protocol as specified in TS 36.300 [30] in order to avoid that the
eNB needs to interpret IP packets coming from the UE.
The eNB shall inform the LWIP-SeGW function of the expected initiation of
IKEv2 handshake by a UE, for subsequent establishment of the IPsec, and
provide the following parameters:
\- the Initiator ID value, (IDi) that the UE will use in the IKEv2 handshake,
\- the LWIP-PSK.
The standardized Xw interface between the eNB and the LWIP-SeGW is specified
in TS 36.300 [30] and it shall be confidentiality and integrity protected by
NDS/IP TS 33.210 [36].
# H.3 Addition and modification of DRB in LTE-WLAN integration
All DRBs associated with the same UE and routed through WLAN shall use the
same IPSec tunnel established between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW function. The
eNB manages the DRB addition and deletion as specified in TS 36.300 [30]. When
the last DRB between the eNB and UE is deleted, the eNB shall instruct the
LWIP-SeGW and the UE to release the IPsec tunnel.
# H.4 Security Key for IKEv2 handshake
## H.4.0 LWIP counter maintenance
The eNB shall associate a 16-bit counter, LWIP counter, with the EPS AS
security context.
The LWIP counter is used when computing the LWIP-PSK for the IPSec tunnel set
up. The UE and the eNB shall treat the LWIP counter as a fresh input to LWIP-
PSK derivation. That is, the UE assumes that the eNB provides a fresh LWIP
counter for each LWIP-PSK derivation and does not need to verify the freshness
of the LWIP counter.
The eNB maintains the value of the LWIP counter for a duration of the current
AS security context between UE and eNB. The UE does not need to maintain the
LWIP counter after it has computed the LWIP-PSK since the eNB provides the UE
with the current LWIP counter value when the UE needs to compute a new LWIP-
PSK.
The eNB that supports the LWIP shall initialize the LWIP counter to '0' when
the K~eNB~ in the associated AS security context is established or refreshed.
The eNB shall monotonically increment the LWIP counter for each subsequent
calculation of the LWIP-PSK.
If the eNB decides to turn off the LWIP and instruct the termination of the
IPSec tunnel and later decides to re-start the LWIP using IPSec tunnel without
updating the K~eNB~, the LWIP counter value shall keep increasing, thus
keeping the computed LWIP-PSK fresh.
The eNB shall refresh the K~eNB~ of the AS security context associated with
the LWIP counter before the LWIP counter wraps around. Re‑freshing the K~eNB~
is done using intra cell handover procedure as described in clause 7.2.9.3 of
the present specification.
## H.4.1 Security Key (LWIP-PSK) Derivation
The UE and eNB shall derive the security key LWIP-PSK for the IPsec tunnel set
up as shown on the Fig.H.4.1-1 and defined in Annex A.16 of the present
document.
Fig.H.4.1-1: LWIP-PSK Derivation.
## H.4.2 Security key (LWIP-PSK) update
The eNB may update the LWIP-PSK for any reason by releasing the IPSec tunnel
and restarting it in the following way . The eNB shall instruct the LWIP-SeGW
function to release the current IPSec tunnel, and provide a new LWIP-PSK to
support establishment of the new IPsec tunnel. The eNB shall instruct the UE
over the RRC signaling to re-initiate the IKEv2 using the new LWIP-PSK to
establish a new IPsec tunnel.
## H.5 Handover procedures
During S1 and X2 handover, the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW
shall be released. The eNB shall instruct the LWIP-SeGW and the UE to release
the IPsec. Both the LWIP-SeGW and the UE shall delete the LWIP-PSK.
# H.6 LWIP radio link failure
When a LTE radio link failure is detected, the IPsec tunnel between the UE and
the LWIP SeGW shall be released, either by the eNB informing the LWIP-SeGW of
this event, or at the UE. Both the LWIP-SeGW and the UE shall delete the LWIP-
PSK.
If the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW is released due to WLAN
connectivity issues, a fresh LWIP IPsec tunnel set up may be performed when
WLAN wireless connectivity is restored.
###### ## Annex I (normative): Hash functions
# I.1 General
This Annex describes how to form the inputs of non-keyed hash calculations
using the KDF described in TS 33.220 [8].
# I.2 HASH~MME~ and HASH~UE~
When the MME and UE shall derive HASH~MME~ and HASH~UE~ respectively using the
following parameters as input to the KDF given in TS 33.220 [8].
\- S = Unprotected ATTACH Request or TAU Request message,
NOTE: The order of packing the input, S, to hash algorithm is the same as the
order of packing the UL NAS message to the MME.
\- Key = 256-bit string of all 0s
HASH~MME~ or HASH~UE~ are the 64 least significant bits of the 256 bits of the
KDF output.
# I.3 Void
#
