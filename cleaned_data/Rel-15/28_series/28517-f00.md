For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and in 3GPP TS 28.500 [6] and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] or in 3GPP TS 28.500 [6].

# 4 General descriptions
For VNF Fault Management stage 2 solution over Itf-N, the Alarm IRP IS is
applicable. The overall architectural feature of Alarm IRP is specified in TS
32.111-2 [2]. The Alarm IRP IS defines the semantics of alarms and the
interactions visible across the reference point in a protocol neutral way. It
defines the semantics of the operations and notifications visible in the Alarm
IRP. It does not define the syntax or encoding of the operations,
notifications and their parameters. For the purpose of notification,
Notification IRP [3] is needed.
# 5 Information model definition
## 5.1 Itf-N
For Itf-N VNF alarm management, the IOCs defined by AlarmIRP which is
specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS 32.111-2 [2] shall be used.
## 5.2 Os-Ma-nfvo
None.
## 5.3 Ve-Vnfm-em
For Ve-Vnfm-em alarm management, the information elements and notifications
which are specified in subclause 9.3 of IFA 008 [5] for VNF alarm management
shall be used.
## 5.4 Ve-Vnfm-vnf
None.
## 5.5 Mapping rule for alarm information elements
### 5.5.1 For construction of notifyNewAlarm
The following table shows the rule on how to construct the various attributes
of notifyNewAlarm (see clause 6.8.1 of TS 32.111-2 [2]).
The first column shows the notifyNewAlarm notification attributes.
The second column shows the \"**Attributes of the Alarm information element\"
(see clause 9.3.4.2 of [5]) used by AlarmNotification (see clause 9.3.2 of
[5]) produced by VNFM.**
