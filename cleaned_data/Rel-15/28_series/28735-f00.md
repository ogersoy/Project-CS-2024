# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**28.734: Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements**
**28.735: Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)**
28.736: Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface NRM IRP\", through which an
\"IRPAgent\" (typically an Element Manager or Network Element) can communicate
Configuration Management information to one or several \"IRPManagers\"
(typically Network Managers) concerning Signalling Transport resources. This
IRP comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol
neutral Network Resource Model (NRM) and corresponding Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral STN interface NRM IRP. It
reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in TS 28.622 [6], either by direct
reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines Signalling Transport
specific Managed Object Classes.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an IRP IS is needed,
such as the Basic CM IRP: IS (TS 32.602 [7]) or the Bulk CM IRP: IS (TS 32.612
[8]). However, which IS is applicable is outside the scope of this document.
Finally, regarding the support of the State Management IRP: IS (TS 28.625
[3]), all NRMs of one release shall support the same State Management IRP
version.
