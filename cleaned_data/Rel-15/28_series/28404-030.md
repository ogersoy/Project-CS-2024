# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
**TS 28.404: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Concepts,
use cases and requirements\";**
TS 28.405: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control and
configuration\";
TS 28.406: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Information
definition and transport\";
One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience why the evaluation of the same at UE side is vital to network
operators, especially when the operators provide some real-time services which
require for example high date rate and low latency like streaming services
(typically video services). Many of these streaming services are a significant
part of the commercial performance growth rate, therefore the end users'
experience should be in focus.
Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at call level on one or more specific UE(s).
The capability to log information, and in particular the QoE of an end user
service, within an UE initiated by an operator, provides the operator with QoE
information. The collected information (specified in Ref. 3GPP TS 26.247 [2])
cannot be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.
The QoE information is information collected by the end user application in
the UE.
The collected QoE information is collected by the management system (e.g. an
Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology) for analysis and/or KPI
calculations.
# 1 Scope
The present document addresses concepts, business level use cases and
requirements for the function Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection in UMTS and LTE.
The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area or an individual UE for a specified end user service/end user
service type.

QoE Quality of Experience
# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 _Concepts_
A network request session is a session in the mobile network when the network
checks for UEs that have the capability to provide requested information.
An UE request session is a session in the network when the network has found
an UE that has the capability to provide the requested information and the
request is forwarded to the UE.
A recording session is a session in the UE when it initiates recording of the
requested end user service/end user service type and record the requested
information.
## 4.2 Background
The collection of QoE information for a specified end user service/end user
service type either from UEs in a specified area or a specific UE. The
collected _information_ is transported to a collection centre, where it can be
analysed and/or KPIs can be calculated.
_A collection can be requested by an operator technician via the management
system to the traffic network. As the network do not have any knowledge which
UEs have the capability to record the requested data, therefore the UEs will
report whether they have this capability or not when a session set up. UEs
that has this capability that match the request from the management system
will be requested to start recording the requested information when the
request constraints are met. The UE will make the recorded data available for
management system._
# 5 Business Level Requirements
## 5.1 Requirements
### 5.1.1 Collecting QoE information from end user services
**REQ-EUSPC-CON-1:** The operator shall have a capability to request
collection of QoE information per end user service/end user service type for a
specified area. The request may include an address of a collection centre to
which the collected information shall be delivered.
**REQ-EUSPC-CON-2:** The application providing the end user service
performance information should have the capability to provide this information
to a collection centre.
**REQ-EUSPC-CON-3:** It should be possible to restrict the QoE information
collection to a subset of the sessions in a UE using an end user service/end
user service type.
**REQ-EUSPC-CON-4:** The management system shall have a capability to request
collection of end user service performance information for one specified UE.
The request may include an address of a collection centre to which the
collected information shall be delivered.
**REQ-EUSPC-CON-5:** The management system shall have a capability to request
collection of end user service performance information for a specific service
type provided by specific streaming sources. The request may include
information of streaming sources for which the information shall be collected.
**REQ-EUSPC-CON-6:** The 3GPP network shall have a capability to forward an
indication to the management system that a recording session has been started.
Editor's note: This is functionality which depends on the UEs capability to
send an indication to the RAN that needs to be agreed by RAN2.
NOTE: The QoE _information_ to be collected are specified in ref. 3GPP TS
26.247 [2].
