# 4 Background and concepts
## 4.1 Configuration management in the context of NFV
3GPP Configuration Management (CM) has system modification functions and
system monitoring functions (as described in [3]).
The decoupling of software and hardware in NFV gives rise to the need to model
the VNF application specific parameters (i.e. 3GPP service related) by 3GPP
whilst modelling the VNF non-application specific parameters (i.e. non-3GPP
service related) in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 008 [5].
For Configuration Management, NM and EM manage NEs and NRs and the related
configuration parameters (e.g. identification, port, neighbour relation) which
are modelled as the MO(s) and MO attributes. The MO attributes, which are
defined by 3GPP, typically are VNF application specific parameters.

### 6.4.1 MOI creation related use cases
#### 6.4.1.1 Introduction
The MO instance and VNF instance can exist independently. The 3GPP management
system maintains the unidirectional relationships (MOI points to VNF instance)
between MO instances and the corresponding VNF instances.
There are following potential scenarios to maintain the relationship between
MO instances and VNF instances.
> Scenario 1: The NM initiated MO instance creation operation (a new version
> of create MO operation) over Itf-N provides the available VNF instance
> identifier as an input parameter. The created MO instance representing vNE
> has the relationship with the selected VNF instance.
>
> Scenario 2: The NM initiated MO instance creation operation (a new version
> of create MO operation) over Itf-N has a parameter indicating whether a new
> VNF needs to be instantiated by EM. The presence of the indicator triggers
> the VNF instantiation request from EM to VNFM. The created MO instance
> representing vNE has the relationship with the new created VNF instance.
>
> Scenario 3: NM initiates MO instance creation operation using existing
> create MO operation over Itf-N. NM initiates the VNF instantiation operation
> via Os-Ma-nfvo. NM sets the relationship between MO instance representing
> vNE and VNF instance by SetMOAttribute operation (in Bulk or Basic CM IRP).
>
> Scenario 4: NM initiates the VNF instantiation operation via Os-Ma-nfvo.
> After the VNF instantiation is complete, the vNE starts execution and
> informs its presence to EM.
>
> EM would then create the MOI(s) representing the vNE. EM populates this
> newly created MOI with VNF identifier received from vNE. EM then notifies NM
> that the MOI(s) representing the newly installed vNE is created. NM can now
> exercise CM related operations on the said MOI from now on.
>
> Scenario 5: NM requests (conveyed via the Bulk CM IRP file) EM to create a
> set of MOI(s) representing a set of vNE.
>
> EM would initiate necessary VNF instantiation operations towards VNFM. After
> a VNF instantiation is complete, the vNE starts execution and informs its
> presence to EM.
>
> EM would then create the MOI(s) representing the vNE. EM populates this
> newly created MOI with VNF identifier received from vNE. EM then notifies NM
> that the MOI(s) representing the newly installed vNE is created. NM can now
> exercise CM related operations on the said MOI from now on.
Editor\'s note: given that there can be multiple number of NMs, VNFMs, EMs,
NFVOs in an operator network and that there are five scenarios (UCs)
documented to relate MOI(s) creation and VNF instance instantiation, there is
a need to analyse if NM (or EM) can correctly determine which scenario will be
selected.
