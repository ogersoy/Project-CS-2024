# Introduction
Network slicing is a key feature for the next generation network. It is about
transforming the network/system from a static \"one size fits all\" paradigm,
to a new paradigm where logical networks/partitions are created, with
appropriate isolation, resources and optimized topology to serve a particular
purpose or service category (e.g. use case/traffic category, or for internal
reasons) or even individual customers (logical system created \"on demand\").
It can be enriched by use of NFV and SDN.
The network slicing concept consists of 3 layers:
1) Service Instance Layer,
2) Network Slice Instance Layer, and
3) Resource layer where each layer requires management functions, see
reference 3GPP TR 23.799 [2]. This document specifies use cases for management
of network slicing, potential requirements, potential solutions and
recommendations.
# 1 Scope
**The present document investigates and makes recommendations on management
and orchestration for network slicing on the** Network Slice Instance Layer
[2] and for non-virtualised NE\'s also the Resource layer**:**
1) Use cases and requirements for management and orchestration of network
slicing
2) Management and orchestration terminology and concepts for slices. The
relationship between network slice management and orchestration concepts
developed in the present document and the management and orchestration
concepts defined by ETSI NFV.
3) Management of network function sharing in the context of network slicing
(e.g. network function sharing support, and lifecycle management functions of
the mobile network resources for network slices).
4) Impacts to management when a slice instance is shared between multiple
parties (e.g. multiple partners and multiple domains etc.) based on the slice
sharing, see reference 3GPP TR 23.799 [2].
5) Isolation of management data between different parties within a slice
instance if needed.
6) Impacts derived from Management of 3GPP Network Slices on the ETSI MANO
architecture and procedures.
7) Automation of management and orchestration of network slice instances and
the related policy configurations.
8) Management and orchestration mechanisms to support the isolation/separation
of mobile network resources used by different network slice instances and the
corresponding configuration of isolation/separation.
9) Solution for management and orchestration of network slicing and how it
affects the specifications (e.g. Interface IRPs, Network Resource models and
trace specifications).
Furthermore, the 3GPP role for Service Instance Layer has been investigated.
The Resource layer for VNFs is excluded from the present document.

# 4 Concepts and Background
## 4.1 Network Slice Instance (NSI) lifecycle
A Network Slice Instance (NSI) is a managed entity in the operator\'s network
with a lifecycle independent of the lifecycle of the service instance(s). In
particular, service instances are not necessarily active through the whole
duration of the run-time phase of the supporting NSI. The NSI lifecycle
typically includes an instantiation, configuration and activation phase, a
run-time phase and a decommissioning phase. During the NSI lifecycle the
operator manages the NSI.
The following phases describe the network slice lifecycle:
\- Preparation phase
\- Instantiation, Configuration and Activation phase
\- Run-time phase
\- Decommissioning phase
Figure 4.1.1: Lifecycle phases of an NSI
Each phase defines high level tasks and should include appropriate
verification of the output of each task in the phase.
Preparation phase
In the preparation phase the NSI does not exist. The preparation phase
includes the creation and verification of network slice template(s) [5], the
on boarding of these, preparing the necessary network environment which are
used to support the lifecycle of NSIs and any other preparations that are
needed in the network.
Instantiation, Configuration and Activation phase
During instantiation/configuration all resources shared/dedicated to the NSI
have been created and are configured, i.e. to a state where the NSI is ready
for operation. The activation step includes any actions that makes the NSI
active, e.g. diverting traffic to it, provisioning databases (if dedicated to
the network slice, otherwise this takes place in the preparation phase) etc.
Network slice instantiation, configuration and activation can include
instantiation, configuration and activation of other shared and/or non-shared
network function(s).
NOTE: The term common NF used in TR 23.799 [2] means the same as shared NF in
the present document and the term slice specific NF used in TR 23.799 [2]
means the same as non-shared NF in the present document.
Run-time phase
In the run-time phase the NSI is capable of traffic handling to support
communication services of certain type(s). The run-time phase includes
supervision/reporting (e.g. for KPI monitoring), as well as activities related
to modification. Modification could map to several workflows related to
runtime tasks, e.g. upgrade, reconfiguration, NSI scaling, changes of NSI
capacity, changes of NSI topology, association and disassociation of network
functions with NSI.
Decommissioning phase
The decommissioning phase includes deactivation (taking the NSI out of active
duty) as well as the reclamation of dedicated resources (e.g. termination or
re-use of network functions) and configuration of shared/dependent resources.
After decommissioning the NSI does not exist anymore.
## 4.2 Network slice concepts
### 4.2.1 General
Network slice concept includes the following aspects.
**1) Completeness of an NSI**
A network slice instance (NSI) is complete in the sense that it includes all
functionalities and resources necessary to support certain set of
communication services thus serving certain business purpose.
**2) Components of an NSI**
The NSI contains NFs (e.g. belonging to AN and CN).
If the NFs are interconnected, the 3GPP management system contains the
information relevant to connections between these NFs such as topology of
connections, individual link requirements (e.g. QOS attributes), etc.
For the part of the TN supporting connectivity between the NFs, the 3GPP
management system provides link requirements (e.g. topology, QoS attributes)
to the management system that handles the part of the TN supporting
connectivity between the NFs.
**3) Resources used by the NSI**
The NSI is realized via the required physical and logical resources.
**4) Network Slice Template**
The Network Slice is described by a Network Slice Template (NST). The Network
Slice Instance is created using the NST and instance-specific information.
**5) NSI policies and configurations**
Instance-specific policies and configurations are required when creating an
NSI.
Network characteristics examples are ultra-low-latency, ultra-reliability,
etc.
NSI contains Core Network part and Access Network part.
**6) Isolation of NSIs**
An NSI may be fully or partly, logically and/or physically, isolated from
another NSI.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc492544926 .anchor}4.2.2 Information model attached to
network slices
Assumption No. 1: An NSI may support zero or more communication services
Assumption No. 2: A communication service (refer to clause 4.8) may be served
by one or more (e.g. in case of communication service bundle fulfilled through
more than one PDU connectivity service) NSIs, possibly with different
characteristics.
Assumption No. 3: An NSI may be composed of network slice subnets of Physical
Network Functions and/or Virtualized Network Functions.
Assumption No. 4: Physical Network Functions and Virtualized Network Functions
may belong to one or more network slice subnet(s).
Assumption No. 5: Virtualized Network Functions are deployed on top of
virtualized resources.

NOTE: Figure 4.2.2.1 is not a Network Resource Model IRP IS class diagram.
## 4.3 Network slice subnet concepts
The management concept of Network slice subnet instance (NSSI) is introduced
for the purpose of NSI management. For example, for instantiation of a NSI
that contains RAN and CN components, these components can be defined and
instantiated as two NSSIs: NSSI1 (RAT1) in RAN and NSSI3 in CN. Then the
targeted NSI will be instantiated by combining the NSSI1 and NSSI3. Combining
NSSI3 with another RAN NSSI, denoted NSSI2 (RAT2), another NSI can be
instantiated.
Some of the concepts of a network slice subnet are:
\- A network slice subnet instance (NSSI) constituent may include NF(s) and
other NSSI(s).
\- A NSSI may be shared by two or more NSIs, this is called a shared
constituent of NSI.
\- A NF may be shared by two or more NSSI(s), in which case it is called a
shared constituent of NSSI.
\- A NSSI may be shared by two or more NSSI(s), this is also called a shared
constituent of NSSI.
\- An NSSI that is dedicated to one NSI and is not shared as a constituent by
two or more NSSI(s) is called a non-shared NSSI.
\- An NSSI may contain CN functions only or AN functions only or both CN
functions and AN functions.
\- The resources comprise physical and logical resources. In case of
virtualization, virtualization resources may be used.
## 4.4 Lifecycle management aspects
A communication service can, depending on the communication service
requirements use an existing NSI or be the trigger for the creation of a new
NSI. The new NSI may be created just for this communication service or it may
be created to support multiple communication services with similar network
slice requirements. The lifecycle of a communication service is related but
not dependent on that of a NSI. The NSI may exist before the communication
service uses the NSI and may exist after the communication service stopped
using the NSI.
An NSI can, depending on the NSI requirements, be created using one or more
existing NSSI(s) or initiate the creation of one or more new NSSI(s). The new
NSSI(s) may be created just for this NSI or it may be created to support
multiple NSIs. The lifecycle of an NSI is related but not dependent on that of
an NSSI. The NSSI may exist before the NSI is created and may exist after the
NSI is not needed anymore.
## 4.5 SON concepts in network slicing
**To improve the operational sustainability in 5G, SON concepts, as key
enablers introduced in 4G, may be reused for 5G. Evolution to 5G may bring
increased network scale and complexity, especially considering variety of
services/devices/tenants in 5G networks. In this context, operators may want
to use concepts of SON as key feature to leverage 5G network slicing
management.**
The lifecycle phases of NSI typically include preparation phase,
instantiation, configuration and activation phase, run-time phase and
decommissioning phase. During the lifecycle phases of NSI, application of
certain SON concepts would be helpful for automation of management and
orchestration of NSIs.
The main aspects of SON concepts that can potentially be used to leverage
network slicing management include but are not limited to:
\- NSI Automated Configuration. Automated configuration of an NSI can happen
during the Instantiation, Configuration, and Activation phase, a newly created
NSI can be automatically configured with appropriate parameters before it is
activated.
\- NSI Automated reconfiguration. Automated reconfiguration happens during
Run-time phase, an activated NSI can be reconfigured automatically because of
change of service requirements.
\- NSI Automated Optimization. The NSIs can be modified automatically to avoid
degradation of services in case of network function overload, dynamic topology
change, etc. The status of the target NSIs is monitored, including the status
of network functions and services. Examples of parameters to be monitored on
the network functions and for the services are throughput, latency, the number
of connections, etc. Based on pre-configured targets and/or policies, the
management system may automatically configure some slice-specific parameters
for the NSIs to improve the performance of the services provided via the NSIs.
For example, based on SON outputs, which are driven by network / services
performance data, the management system may re-configure some network
functions and/or the links between the network functions and/or modify the
topology of the NSI for improvement in resource utilization and/or in the QoE
of services supported by the NSI.
\- NSI Automated Healing. For the running NSIs, SON algorithms could identify
the failures of NSIs and apply some corrective actions. The network functions
which compose the NSI support fast failure recovery and healing mechanisms,
thus enabling automatic convergence of the affected network functions to a
stable desired state. The results of the Self-Healing needs to be notified to
the operator.
## 4.6 Key issues for network slicing management
The potential key issues for network slicing management to be addressed in the
present document are as following:
**Issue 1. Align slice instance related terms**
**Issue 2. Creation of the network slice to support services provided by the
operator**
How the services are requested via the 3GPP management system and how they are
facilitated using an NSI.
**Issue 3. NSI FCAPS management**
How to use FCAPS management for network slicing management.
**Issue 4. SON evolution for network slice management**
How to apply SON concept for network slicing management.
**Issue 5. Orchestration of network slice**
What are the components of a network slice and how it is orchestrated?
**Issue 6. Shared slice instance management**
Management of a network slice that supports multiple services.
**Issue 7. Orchestration of Slice across multiple administrative domains**
## 4.7 High-level functional model of business roles
In the context of next generation networks, responsibilities regarding
operations have to be clearly defined and assigned to roles. High-level
business roles include:
  * Communication Service Customer (CSC): Uses communication services.
  * Communication Service Provider (CSP): Provides communication > services (see clause 4.8). Designs, builds and operates its > communication services.
  * Network Operator (NOP): Provides network services. Designs, builds > and operates its networks to offer such services.
  * Virtualization Infrastructure Service Provider (VISP): Provides > virtualized infrastructure services. Designs, builds and operates > its virtualization infrastructure(s). Virtualization > Infrastructure Service Providers may also offer their virtualized > infrastructure services to other types of customers including to > Communication Service Providers directly, i.e. without going > through the Network Operator.
  * Data Centre Service Provider (DCSP): Provides data centre services. > Designs, builds and operates its data centres.
  * Network Equipment Provider (NEP): Supplies network equipment. For > sake of simplicity, VNF Supplier is considered here as a type of > Network Equipment Provider.
  * NFVI Supplier: Supplies network function virtualization > infrastructure to its customers.
  * Hardware Supplier: Supplies hardware.
Depending on actual deployments, the roles defined above can be played by one
single organization or by several ones. Hence, an organization can play one or
several roles defined above.
NOTE 1: the list of roles above is not exhaustive.
{width="6.531944444444444in" height="3.8229166666666665in"}
Figure 4.7.1: High-level model of roles
NOTE 2: The above diagram does not carry the notion of hierarchy or layering,
in particular the diagram does not preclude relations between non-neighbouring
role nodes.
NOTE 3: In case the Network Operator offers network services partly or wholly
based on Physical Network Functions, the responsibility for designing,
building and operating such parts of the network services is under the
responsibility of the Network Operator. It does not involve the Virtualization
Infrastructure Service Provider.
NOTE 4: In the rest of this document, the role \"Communication Service
Provider\" is also referred to as \"Service Provider\", and the role \"Network
Operator\" is also referred to as \"Operator\". Unless they are explicitly
differentiated, these two roles are used in an inter-changeable way.
## 4.8 Types of communication services
Communication services offered by Communication Service Providers to
Communication Service Customers are of various categories, among which:
\- B2C services, e.g. mobile web browsing, VoLTE, Rich Communication Services,
etc.
\- B2B services, e.g. Internet access, LAN interconnection, etc.
\- B2B2X services: e.g. services offered to other Communication Service
Providers (e.g. international roaming, RAN sharing, etc.) or to Verticals
(e.g. eMBB, etc.) offering themselves communication services to their own
customers. B2B2X service type includes B2B2 applied recursively, i.e. B2B2B,
B2B2B2B, etc.
A communication service offered by Communication Service Providers can include
a bundle of specific B2C, B2B or B2B2X type of services. Taking as an example
the B2C type of services, a bundle could include: data (for mobile web
browsing), voice (through VoLTE), and messaging (via Rich Communication
Services). In this case, each one of the individual B2C may be fulfilled by
different PDU connectivity services provided via corresponding PDU sessions.
According to 3GPP TR 23.501 [7], a specific PDU session makes use of a single
network slice, and different PDU sessions may belong to different network
slices.
## 4.9 Services using the Network Slice concept
### 4.9.1 Network Slices as NOP internals
Types of services listed in clause 4.7 are offered by CSPs to their customers,
relying on Network Operator(s) network services. Depending on CSP requirements
and/or Network Operator own policies, the Network Operator can decide to
provide required network services using network slices. In such a case, only
the Network Operator has knowledge of the existence of network slices; the CSP
and its customers have not.
### 4.9.2 Network Slice as a Service
Network slice as a Service can be offered by CSPs to their customers, leaving
the latter ones the possibility to offer their own services on top on network
slice services (B2B2X). Such network slice services could be characterized by
e.g.
  * radio access technology,
  * bandwidth,
  * end-to-end latency,
  * guaranteed / non-guaranteed QoS,
  * security level, etc.
Depending on service offering, CSP imposes limits on the network slice
characteristics that will be exposed to the CSC, and CSP imposes limits on the
network slice management capabilities that will be exposed to the CSC.
A CSP offering Network Slices as a Service relies on network services offered
by one or more network Operators.
### 4.9.3 Services using network slice instances
As an example, services using NSI(s) are illustrated in the figure 4.9.3.1.
Figure 4.9.3.1: End to End services provided by NSI(s)
Different NSIs (NSI A, NSI B and NSI C) contains NFs (e.g. belonging to AN
NSSI and CN NSSI) as well as all information relevant to the interconnections
between these NFs. Different communication services are provided by service
provider through using different NSIs. For example, Service 1 and Service 2
use NSI A which contains dedicated NSSIs (CN NSSI 1 and AN NSSI 1), Service 3
uses NSI C which contains a dedicated NSSI (CN NSSI 3) and a shared NSSI (AN
NSSI 2) with NSI B.
NOTE: The dashed lines in figure 4.9.3.1 mean connectivity supported by TN.
## 4.10 Network slice related management functions
The following management functions are needed to manage the NSIs to support
communication services:
\- Communication Service Management Function (CSMF):
\- Responsible for translating the communication service related requirement
to network slice related requirements.
\- Communicate with Network Slice Management Function (NSMF).
\- Network Slice Management Function (NSMF):
\- Responsible for management and orchestration of NSI.
\- Derive network slice subnet related requirements from network slice related
requirements.
\- Communicate with the Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF) and
Communication Service Management Function.
\- Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF):
\- Responsible for management and orchestration of NSSI.
\- Communicate with the NSMF.

# 5 Use Cases
## 5.1 Use cases related to Network Slice management
### 5.1.1 Network Slice Instance(s) lifecycle management
#### 5.1.1.1 Create a Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.1.1.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants an NSI which includes CN (Core Network) part and RAN part.
NOTE: The use case does not make any assumption on any potential RAN internal
slicing.
##### 5.1.1.1.2 Description
In some case, a network slice which includes CN part and RAN part is needed.
Both CN part and RAN part of network slice can be shared by different NSIs.
Operator wants an NSI to support a communication service.
The main aspects of management to support network slice creation includes:
\- The NSMF determines to reuse an existing NSI or create a new NSI. If an
existing NSI can be reused, the operator may reconfigure the existing NSI. If
no existing NSI is available, the NSMF will determine to create a new NSI and
the following steps are included.
NOTE: Two scenarios for reusing an existing NSI:
\- An existing NSI which is used to support existing communication services
may be shared for the requested communication service.
\- An existing NSI which is not used to support any communication service
(e.g. retained previously) may be used for the requested communication
service.
\- The NSMF determines the CN part-related requirements and RAN part-related
requirements based on customer requirements.
\- For the CN part-related requirements, the NSMF determines to utilize the
new or existing CN NFs.
\- For the RAN part-related requirements, the NSMF determines to utilize
existing RAN NEs or new RAN NEs.
\- The management system can translate network slice requirements into the
real deployment location of network functions. For example, determine the
location of serving NFs to satisfy low latency requirement.
##### 5.1.1.1.3 Post-conditions
An NSI which includes CN part and RAN part is created.
#### 5.1.1.2 Create a Network Slice Instance with shared and non-shared CN
network functions
##### 5.1.1.2.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to have multiple NSIs. The NSIs may contain some functions
that are shared between multiple NSIs and some that are not shared.
##### 5.1.1.2.2 Description
In some cases, (e.g. described as \"group B\" and \"group C\" in annex D of
3GPP TR 23.799 [2]) shared CN network functions can be shared among multiple
NSIs. The shared CN network functions can be virtualized or non-virtualized.
The operator selects some shared CN network functions and non-shared network
functions to compose an NSI. The operator specifies the associated parameters
to create an NSI (e.g. loading and geographic constraints).
When creating a new NSI, the operator determines if there are existing shared
CN network functions that can be used for creation of a new NSI. The network
functions that are already part of an existing NSI being added to a new NSI
become shared network functions:
\- In the case that where some shared (those that are shared or become shared)
CN network functions are available, only additional (non-shared CN) network
functions may need to be created. The existing shared CN network functions may
need to be reconfigured, and the resources supporting the shared CN network
functions may need to be added in order to ensure that the shared CN network
functions can serve both the existing NSI(s) and the NSI being created.
\- In the case where no existing CN network functions are available for the
new NSI, the shared CN network functions need to be created and the non-
shared CN network functions may need to be created respectively. The new
shared CN network functions that are created only belong to the new single NSI
at this point until being shared by other NSIs (where they become \"shared\").
##### 5.1.1.2.3 Post-conditions
An NSI is created where some of the CN network functions may be shared between
multiple NSIs and some are not shared.
#### 5.1.1.3 Create Network Slice Instance with shared Network Slice Subnet
Instances
##### 5.1.1.3.1 Pre-conditions
None.
##### 5.1.1.3.2 Description
Network slice can be created using NSSIs according to different requests from
the customer. One possible method of NSI creation is described below for
example.
NSSI A, NSSI B and NSSI C are composed by NFs, as exhibited in Figure
5.1.1.3.2.1 for example:
a) NSSI A is described by NFs (i.e. NF1-NF4);
b) NSSI B is described by NFs (i.e.NF7-NF9);
c) NSSI C is described by NFs (i.e. NF5 and NF6).
NSSI A is connected to NSSI B and NSSI C, composing two NSIs, where NSSI B and
NSSI C are independent. NSI X is composed of NSSI A and NSSI C, NSI Y is
composed of NSSI A and NSSI B.
Figure 5.1.1.3.2.1: NSI X and Y composed by NSSI A, B and C
##### 5.1.1.3.3 Post-conditions
NSI is created with shared NSSIs.
#### 5.1.1.4 Activate a Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.1.4.1 Pre-conditions
An NSI is configured.
The NSI is not providing telecommunication service.
##### 5.1.1.4.2 Description
The NSMF activates the NSI for providing the intended telecommunication
service through activating all necessary CN network functions of the NSI, RAN
NEs of the NSI, and possibly other part of the NSI. Activation is performed by
using management interfaces to request managed entities to move to a state
which relates to activation of the telecommunication service supported by the
NSI. The activation of the CN network functions, RAN NEs and other parts of an
NSI may follow a sequential order.
The NSMF changes the NSI status to activated.
##### 5.1.1.4.3 Post-conditions
The NSI is providing telecommunication service.
#### 5.1.1.5 De-activate a Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.1.5.1 Pre-conditions
An NSI is activated.
##### 5.1.1.5.2 Description
The NSMF deactivates the NSI to stop providing telecommunication service on
current NSI through deactivating all CN network functions of the NSI, RAN NEs
of the NSI, and possibly other part of the NSI. The ongoing telecommunication
service supported by the NSI is terminated if it is not supported by any other
NSI. Deactivation is performed by using management interfaces to request
managed entities to move to a state which relates to deactivation of the
telecommunication service supported by the NSI. The deactivation of the CN
network functions, RAN NEs and other parts of an NSI may follow a sequential
order.
The NSMF changes the NSI status to deactivated.
##### 5.1.1.5.3 Post-conditions
The NSI is not providing telecommunication service.
#### 5.1.1.6 Modify a Network Slice Instance with shared and non-shared CN
network functions and a shared AN
##### 5.1.1.6.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to modify an existing NSI that is composed of network
functions that are shared between multiple NSIs and not shared.
The shared AN supporting multiple slices is available.
##### 5.1.1.6.2 Description
The operator determines whether the shared CN network functions or non-shared
CN network functions of the NSI are modified:
\- The operator may decide that for modification of the NSI it is enough to
modify the identified non-shared CN network functions. Otherwise the operator
may decide to create new non-shared CN network functions to satisfy the
network slice modification needs and then delete the obsolete non-shared CN
network functions which are replaced by the newly created non-shared CN
network functions.
\- If the operator wants to modify the shared CN network functions, the
operator checks whether the modification of shared CN network functions may
impact other NSIs and takes appropriate actions as below:
\- If there is no impact, then the operator updates the shared CN network
function where needed. If the modification of the shared CN network functions
is not applicable, then the operator may decide to create new shared CN
network functions to satisfy the modification needs.
\- If there is impact, the operator may not perform the modification of shared
CN network functions or may decide to create new CN network functions only for
the NSI being modified to satisfy the modification needs and avoid the impact
on other NSIs. The newly created CN network functions only belong to the NSI
being modified until being shared with other NSIs by configuration.
##### 5.1.1.6.3 Post-conditions
An NSI that is composed of shared CN network functions and non-shared CN
network functions is modified by the operator without negatively impacting the

of an identified network function. The identified network function can be
shared between multiple NSIs or not shared.
##### 5.1.1.8.2 Description
The operator determines whether the NSI capacity needs to be increased or
decreased:
\- If the operator wants to increase the capacity of the NSI, the operator may
decide that it is enough to increase the capacity of identified network
functions. If it is not possible, then the operator may decide to create new
identified network functions to the NSI.
\- If the operator wants to decrease the capacity of the NSI, the operator
determines whether the capacity of shared or non-shared network functions of
the NSI needs changing.
a) The operator may decide that to decrease the capacity of the NSI, it is
enough to change the capacity of identified non-shared network functions. If
it is not applicable, then the operator may decide to remove some of the
identical non-shared network functions from the NSI.
b) If the network functions identified by the operator for the change of
capacity are shared network functions between multiple NSIs, the operator
checks if the desired capacity change may negatively impact other NSIs and
takes appropriate actions as outlined below:
\- If there is no anticipated negative impact, then the operator changes the
capacity of identified shared network functions. Alternatively, the operator
may decide to remove some of the shared network functions.
\- If there is anticipated negative impact on other NSI, the operator may not
change the capacity of the shared network functions.
\- In all cases as part of the capacity modification the operator may need to
perform appropriate reconfiguration of the existing network functions.
##### 5.1.1.8.3 Post-conditions
The capacity of NSI is changed by the operator.
NOTE: The modification of an NSI can include changing the capacity of an NSI.
Effectively change capacity can be considered a sub-use case of modify.

needed NSSIs:
\- Configures and triggers the components of NFV-MANO [6] to instantiate
and/or configure all needed VNFs and NSs and/or scale them as needed, for the
operations of the NSSI. Such configuration takes into account sharing of the
VNFs and NSs with other NSSIs where relevant.
\- Triggers necessary components of the network management system to affect
the application level configuration of the NFs to be used by the NSSI. Such
configuration takes into account sharing of the NFs with other NSSIs where
relevant.
The NSMF activates the NSI.

##### 5.1.3.1.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to understand the performance of the network slice to
ensure SLA compliance. The network slice is instantiated and configured by the
NSMF so that the appropriate performance data is generated.
The NSMF knows which NSSIs are associated with each NSI. A NSSI can be
associated with multiple NSIs.
##### 5.1.3.1.2 Description
Network slice performance management is carried out at both NSI level and NSSI
level. An example is shown in the following figure 5.1.3.1.2.1 NSI 1 is
composed by network slice subnet instance 1 and network slice subnet instance
2. Firstly, performance data of network slice subnet instances is collected.
Then performance data of an NSI can be generated based on all the performance
data related to network slice subnet instances.
Figure 5.1.3.1.2.1: Example of network slice performance management
\- Performance data generation at NSI level
In order to understand the performance of an NSI, some performance data at NSI
level need to be obtained. For example, performance data at the NSI level may
include traffic load data of the whole NSI, service performance data provided
by the NSI. Traffic load data of an NSI indicates the level of both the total
user traffic and the signalling traffic within an NSI. The service performance
data includes the total user traffic, the signalling traffic and QoS data
corresponding to a particular service instance. QoS data of services can
indicate whether the NSI delivers services at expected QoS level.
In order to obtain NSI level performance data, the NSMF firstly collects
performance data related to NSSIs associated with the NSI. The NSMF then
generates NSI level performance data based on performance data related to
NSSIs.
\- Performance data collection at NSSI level
The NSMF decides to create measurement jobs on network functions in NSSIs.
Measurement jobs includes measurement parameters, scheduling information and
an indication for pointing out the NSI for which performance data needs to be
collected. The data is collected and provided to the NSMF by the NSSIs.
An NSSI can be dedicated to an NSI or can be shared by multiple NSIs:
a) In case of a dedicated NSSI all performance data from the network slice
subnet is identified per NSI that is using that NSSI. The data may be
collected for different QoS levels or for different service instances included
in the NSI as per the request from the network management function.
b) In case of a shared NSSI the performance data is segregated per NSI that is
using that shared NSSI. The data may be collected for different QoS levels,
for different service instances or for different slice instance level as per
the request from the network management function.
##### 5.1.3.1.3 Post-conditions
The NSMF has the performance data of all NSSIs that are associated with the

Operator wants to monitor performance parameters in an NSI by setting
thresholds and receiving alarms notifications.
##### 5.1.3.2.2 Description
In order to monitor performance of an NSI, the NSMF determines thresholds for
performance parameters that need to be monitored by several NFs of the NSI.
The NSMF can set thresholds on both shared and non-shared NFs for monitoring
performance parameters of the NSI. The performance parameters of the NSI are
monitored by NFs. Once the thresholds are met, NFs will generate threshold
crossing/reaching alarm notifications specific to the NSI.
##### 5.1.3.2.3 Post-conditions
Thresholds for performance parameters of an NSI have been created on NFs.
The NSMF is ready to receive performance alarm notifications related to an
NSI.

##### 5.1.6.1.1 Pre-conditions
**Operator wants to create and manage NSIs based on customers\' needs.**
##### 5.1.6.1.2 Description
Network slicing is a key enabler for new business models. By exploiting the
network non-shared customization, the mobile network customers and industry
customers could share the same network infrastructure, where each customer
could have the corresponding NSI to fulfil each own different requirement such
as policy control, security, mobility, charging, latency, reliability, etc.
The main aspects of management support to the network slicing include:
\- The operator creates NSIs either to satisfy the needs of different
customers or based on different service requirements from the same customer.
In one example, the operator may create two NSIs for two different
requirements: one NSI with medium throughput and low latency (e.g. for V2X
communication) and the other NSI with high throughput and high latency
toleration (e.g. for HD video streaming). In another example, the operator may
create two NSIs for two different customers even if their service requirements
are similar. In some cases, operator may choose to use the same NSI to support
multiple services from the same customer.
\- The operator monitors the status of the NSIs, such as network functions,
services, throughput, latency, the number of connections, etc., and may
configure some slice-specific parameters.
\- When a particular service is no longer needed, the operator may delete the
corresponding NSI if that NSI does not support any other services.
##### 5.1.6.1.3 Post-conditions
**Different NSIs fulfil different requirements of customers using the same
network infrastructure**.
#### 5.1.6.2 Management support to provide a customer\'s service request using
a Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.6.2.1 Pre-conditions
The network operator has a catalogue of the types of business services it can
offer to the customers with their own end user/device population distributed
in a geographical area.
NOTE: Customer can be a 3rd party service provider or network operator\'s own
service department.
The customer has obtained the type of business services that can be provided
by the network operator.
##### 5.1.6.2.2 Description
The customer requests the network operator to support a specific business
service. This request includes the service requirements such as isolation,
security and performance requirements (e.g. traffic demand requirements for
the coverage areas, QoS for services, etc.).
The management system determines whether the service can be provided checking
the available network resources and remaining network capacity in the
specified geographical areas for the specified durations.
If service can be provided, the management system will negotiate for an
appropriate agreement with the customer.
The NSMF creates an NSI to provide the agreed service requirements including
the required isolation and security.
The NSMF monitors the fault and performance of the NSI and ensure meeting the
agreed service requirements including providing necessary monitoring
information to the customer.
##### 5.1.6.2.3 Post-conditions
An NSI is created to provide the service to the satisfaction of the SLA and
network KPIs required by the customer.
#### 5.1.6.3 Provide network slice as a service with guaranteed quality of
service
##### 5.1.6.3.1 Pre-conditions
**The customer has different type of business services which can be served by
the network operator with customized network slice instance.**
**The operator has the capability to provide network slice as a service to the
customer.**
##### 5.1.6.3.2 Description
The customer inputs a set of service requirements (e.g. business scenario,
isolation, throughput, latency, coverage, etc.) to the operator.
Network operator provides a customized end-to-end network slice instance as a
service which can serve customer\'s requirements and sign an SLA with the
customer.
After activating the network slice instance, the network slice management
system will expose part of the service-related performance data to the
customer. If current performance cannot meet the SLA, some actions (e.g. scale
in/out, modification, etc.) are executed to guarantee end-to-end performance
of the network slice instance.
##### 5.1.6.3.3 Post-conditions
**A performance-guaranteed network slice instance is operated by the network
operator to serve customer\'s specific service requirement.**
### 5.1.7 Management data isolation
#### 5.1.7.1 Management data isolation when multiple customers share the same
Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.7.1.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to use one slice instance to serve multiple customers (i.e.
other network operator or enterprises etc.) simultaneously and customers want
to get the management data of the slice instance, such as performance
measurements. It is assumed that the NSMF is capable of generating the
management data separate per customer for different customers.
##### 5.1.7.1.2 Description
When the service requirements of multiple customers can be fulfilled by the
same NSI, the operator may decide to create a single NSI. The created NSI is
shared to serve multiple customers.
In case of there is a fault or performance degradation in the slice instance,
the quality of service provided may be influenced. The customer may want to
know the fault information or the performance information of the slice
instance which cause the service problem.
The management data (e.g. fault management data, performance data, etc.) for
different customers may be separated.
It is up to the operator to decide whether a communication service is to be
served by the same NSI or by different NSIs.
If the service requirements of one of the customers sharing the slice instance
changes, the operator may decide to modify the slice instance without
negatively impacting the service to other parties, if possible. For example,
the operator may check if the modification or reconfiguration is against the
resource usage policies of other services provided by the same NSI. If there
is no conflict, the operator then modifies or reconfigures the NSI.
##### 5.1.7.1.3 Post-conditions
Multiple customers are served by the same NSI with access to their network
management data.
#### 5.1.7.2 Management data isolation with shared AN or shared CN network
functions

AN or shared CN network functions.**
##### 5.1.7.2.2 Description
Configurations of shared AN or shared CN network functions (e.g. network slice
selection related information) are coordinated to make sure the normal
operation of the services running onto these two network slice instances. In
the case of performance management, the monitoring data is collected and
generated separately.
If the shared part in one slice instance has changed, the related management
on the shared AN or shared CN network functions will not impact current
operating status of the other slice.
##### 5.1.7.2.3 Post-conditions
**Management data in different network slice instances with shared AN or
shared CN network functions is isolated.**

Instances in different administrative domains
##### 5.1.8.1.1 Pre-conditions
The UE may move across multiple administrative domains.
Multiple operators have roaming agreements.
##### 5.1.8.1.2 Description
The operator knows the information of other NSIs which belongs to other
operators. An example of the information is the network slice selection
assistant information (NSSAI).
The operators configure the network to support the UEs roaming from the
coverage area of one NSI to the coverage area of another NSI. For example,
when NSSAI is not standardized, operator A may configure some network
functions (e.g. network slice selection function) of the NSI to be aware of
the NSSAI of NSIs from operator B to facilitate the mapping between NSSAIs
since the UE may provide the NSSAI of the NSI from operator B when it moves
from the administrative domain of operator B to the administrative domain of
operator A.
##### 5.1.8.1.3 Post-conditions
NSIs from different administrative domains can provide desired service to the
customer.
#### 5.1.8.2 Create an end-to-end Network Slice Instance across multiple
operators
##### 5.1.8.2.1 Pre-conditions
An operator wants to create an end-to-end NSI across multiple operators. Non-
management pre-requisites, such as trust relationships between operators,
legal and business related, to create such a slice are assumed to exist. The
operators in this use case have agreed upon to the limits of exposure of the
management interface.
NOTE: The use case does not make any assumption on any potential operator
internal slicing.
##### 5.1.8.2.2 Description
An operator A wants to create an end-to-end NSI to support a telecommunication
service across multiple operators, Operator A and Operator B. The end-to-end
NSMF for this network slice resides with Operator A. This end-to-end NSI
across multiple operators will be composed of NSSIs from operator A and NSSIs
from Operator B.
Operator A\'s management system performs the following actions for the
creation of an end-to-end NSI across multiple operators:
\- Operator A determines to use its own and Operator B\'s network to create
the end-to-end NSI, decomposes the service request of the end-to-end network
slice for Operator A\'s and Operator B\'s network, and requests the creation
of NSSIs to each operator\'s management system.
\- Both operators\' management system may either create a new NSSIs or use an
existing one as a part of the end-to-end NSI.
\- When requested, Operator B\'s management system provides management data
(e.g. performance data) to Operator A\'s management system for the NSSI hosted
by operator B and belonging to operator A\'s end-to-end NSI
NOTE: Operator A may determine to use more than two operators to support the
end-to-end NSI. Operator A remains responsible for the management of the end-
to-end NSI.
##### 5.1.8.2.3 Post-conditions
An NSI extending multiple operators is created.
### 5.1.9 Management exposure
#### 5.1.9.1 Limited level of management exposure for multiple Network Slice
Instances
##### 5.1.9.1.1 Pre-conditions
Customers want specific NSIs created by the operator.
##### 5.1.9.1.2 Description
Multiple network slices required by different customers may have the same type
of service but with different KPI and/or QoS/QoE.
According to NSI creation described in clause 5.1.1.2, the operator may create
multiple network slices served by the same NFs and management system to
provide the agreed service requirements including the required management
exposure.
Currently, operators provide service management exposures to the customers,
that the network management (i.e. NMs and EMs) and the infrastructure
management not typically expose to customers. Operators will need to extend
the current service management offers into limited level of management
exposures in network and infrastructure, which the management exposure is
agreed by both operator and the customer. These limited level of exposure
should be part of the operator extended offer to NSI customer. Typical example
for this use case is from the Enterprise communication market where each
company is represented as a tenant.
##### 5.1.9.1.3 Post-conditions
The limited level of management exposure agreed by customer and operator of
the created specific NSIs are provided to the customers.
### 5.1.10 Automation of the network slice management
#### 5.1.10.1 Automated reconfiguration of a Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.10.1.1 Pre-conditions
**The NSI already exists.**
##### 5.1.10.1.2 Description
When the service requirements are changed by the Customer, it is desirable
that the NSI can be reconfigured automatically to support the updated service
requirements.
CSMF updates the network slice requirements based on the change of service
requirements received from Customer, and sends the updated requirements to
NSMF.NSMF, which may be pre-configured with a policy for automated
reconfiguration of NSI, upon receipt of the updated network slice
requirements, triggers the automated reconfiguration of the NSI. The NSMF may
decide to modify the existing NSSIs and/or add new NSSIs for the automated
reconfiguration of the NSI, and sends the corresponding Network Slice Subnet
related requirements to NSSMF.
NSSMF, upon receipt of the updated and/or new network slice subnet
requirements, modifies the NSSI and/or adds the new NSSI accordingly.
Human intervention should be allowed during the steps described above.

#### 5.1.10.2 Automated optimization of a Network Slice Instance
##### 5.1.10.2.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants an NSI to be optimized automatically to adapt to the
changing status of network and communication services.
The optimization targets defined by the operator have a
correspondence/relationship with NSI characteristics; for example, the targets
may be set in terms of:
\- NSI resources utilization (KPIs)
\- E2E service performance (KQIs), such as QoE of Video streaming
The NSI is activated.
##### 5.1.10.2.2 Description
The NSMF has pre-configured NSI automated optimization policies that may
include trigger condition of automated optimization actions, slice-specific
optimization targets, value range for the slice-specific parameters, KPIs
and/or KQIs, and rules for preventing or solving the automated optimization
conflicts.
Following the NSI optimization policies, the NSMF performs NSI automated
optimization actions to reach the network slice instance optimization goals
derived from the optimization targets defined by the operator. The NSMF
monitors the performance of the NSI. When trigger condition is satisfied, the
NSMF performs automated optimization actions for the NSI according to the pre-
configured policies. For the purpose of automated optimization, the NSMF may
decide to modify the existing NSSIs and/or add new NSSIs. To do that, the NSMF
may send the corresponding Network Slice Subnet related requirements to the
NSSMF. The NSSMF performs accordingly based on the received Network Slice
Subnet related requirements. The optimization action may include also
application level re-configuration of the Network Functions, performed by the
management system.
The NSMF evaluates the results of the NSI automated optimization by
examination of the targeted KPIs and/or KQIs after the optimization action.
There may be conflicts between the optimization actions for different goals.
The NSMF prevents or resolves the conflicts according to automated
optimization policies.

An NSI is activated.
##### 5.1.10.3.2 Description
The NSMF monitors the alarms for the NSI. If the fault is detected and cannot
be fixed on the constituent NSSI or NF level, the NSMF triggers the automated
healing for the NSI based on the pre-configured automated healing policies.
The NSMF may decide to add a new NSSI to take over the faulty one, or modify
the existing NSSIs to compensate the fault part for instance by requesting
NSSMF to add new NF to take over the faulty one or configure the existing NFs
to compensate the faulty one. The NSMF sends the corresponding Network Slice
Subnet related requirements to NSSMF. The NSSMF performs accordingly based on
the received Network Slice Subnet related requirements.
After implementing automated healing operations for an NSI, the NSMF evaluates
the results of the automated healing actions for an NSI, and reports the
results of the automated healing actions.
##### 5.1.10.3.3 Post-conditions
An NSI is automatically healed.

# 7 Potential solutions
## 7.1 Network slicing management functions
### 7.1.1 Introduction
{width="2.0625in" height="3.4375in"}
Figure 7.1.1.1: Network slicing management functions
The CSMF receives the Communication Service (see note) related requirements
from the Communication Service Customer, and manages the Communication
Services (see note) provided by the Network Operator.
NOTE: The Communication Service can be the 3GPP service running on the NSI.
The CSMF converts the Communication Service related requirements to the
network slice related requirements (such as network type, network capacity,
QoS requirements, etc.). The CSMF delegates management of the network slice by
providing the network slice requirements to the NSMF
The NSMF manages the NSIs based on the network slice related requirements
received from the CSMF.
The NSMF converts the network slice related requirements to the network slice
subnet related requirements. The NSMF delegates management of the network
slice subnet by providing the network slice subnet related requirements to the
NSSMF.
The NSSMF manages the NSSIs based on the network slice subnet related
requirements received from the NSMF.
### 7.1.2 Example of how roles relate to network slicing management functions
Management functions (Communication Service Management Function, Network Slice
Management Function, Network Slice Subnet Management Function) are used by
various business roles (Communication Service Customer, Communication Service
Provider, Network Operator) to manage entities (Communication Service, Network
Slice, Network Slice Subnet).
These relationships become more complex when the actors in use cases are
considered. Each actor may play one or more business roles. To explain the
relationships between actors, business roles, management functions, and
managed entities, Figure 7.2.1 shows an example of a general solution.
{width="6.6875in" height="4.535416666666666in"}
Figure 7.1.2.1: General example of network slicing management functions
Figure 7.1.2.1 shows a very general example, where each actor plays only one
role. To allow interactions between actors, mutual trust relationships are to
be created, which are normally based on business agreements.
Table 7.1.2.1 describes the management actors for this general example in more
detail.
Table 7.1.2.1: Description of management personas for general example
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Actor | Role | Description | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Customer | Communication | Consumes a | | | Service Customer | Communication | | | | Service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Service Provider | Communication | Provides a | | | Service Provider | Communication | | | | Service | | | | | | | | Consumes Network | | | | Slice(s) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Network Slice | Network Operator | Provides a Network | | Provider | | Slice | | | | | | | | Consumes Network | | | | Slice Subnet(s) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Network Slice Subnet | Network Operator | Provides a Network | | Provider | | Slice Subnet | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
In a real use case, it is common for an actor to play multiple roles, thereby
reducing the number of needed mutual trust relationships. For example, a use
case may have an actor \"Tenant\" who simultaneously plays both roles of CSP
and CSC. As another example, an actor \"Network Provider\" could
simultaneously provide the Communication Service, Network Slice, and Network
Slice Subnet.
Table 7.1.2.2 describes some typical management actors which may be found in
use cases.

## 7.2 Multiple operator coordination management
### 7.2.1 Solution options for Network Slice Instance creation across multiple
operators
#### 7.2.1.1 General
The potential options for creating an NSI extending multiple operators are
summarized in the following sub-clauses.
#### 7.2.1.2 Option 1: A communication service across multiple operators\'
Network Slice Instance
In this option the customer contacts multiple operators to create NSIs for
supporting a communication service hosted across multiple operators. Figure
7.2.1.2.1 shows the Customer who, in this option, owns the communication
service management functionality which has an interface to each operator for
the life cycle management of NSI.
The customer\'s communication service management function (CSMF) requests the
creation of an NSI to the multiple operator management systems (OMS). Each OMS
internally requests the creation of the NSI to its NSMF. The NSMF creates the
NSI and returns a success to the OMS which returns the success response to the
customer\'s CSMF together with an agreed upon management exposure to the NSI
provided to the customer\'s CSMF.
This option requires the customer\'s CSMF to manage to multiple instances of
NSI to make them support a single service instance.
NOTE: This option is the combination of multiple NSI or NSSI to host a
communication service and is not per se an extension of a single NSI to
multiple operators.
{width="4.9125in" height="5.1715277777777775in"}
Figure 7..2.1.2.1: Option 1: Customer to operator interface for hosting a
communication service over NSIs across multiple operators
#### 7.2.1.3 Option 2: Multi-operator slice creation by operator management
system to management system interfaces
In this option, the customer requests the communication service to a single
operator\'s management system (OMS), operator A in Figure 7.2.1.3.1. The
operator A\'s service management function can decide to request an NSSI to
another operator\'s management system, operator B.
The steps for creating and requesting an NSI begin with the customer
contacting a single operator\'s management system and that operator\'s
management system requests the other operator\'s management system for the
life cycle management of the NSI (to be) hosted therein.
In this option, the communication service management functionality is hosted
in Operator A and it exposes an agreed upon management interface to the
customer. Operator A is responsible for the management of the NSI.
{width="4.9125in" height="5.1715277777777775in"}
Figure 7.2.1.3.1: Option 2: Operator management system (OMS) to OMS interface
for multi-operator NSI creation
#### 7.2.1.4 Option 3: Multi-operator NSI creation by operator NSMF to NSSMF
interface
This option is similar to Option 2 in sub-clause 7.2.1.3. The operator A
forwards the request to its NSMF. The NSMF of operator A then decides to use
another operator NSSMF to realize the NSSI.
The procedures for creating and requesting an NSI are similar to option 2
except that in this case the interface between the OMS of option 2 is replaced
by the interface from NSMFs to NSSMF for life cycle management of the NSSI
hosted in the other operator domain.
NOTE: This option may require the establishment of mutual trust relationships
between the operator A and B, which is currently considered out of scope of
3GPP.
{width="4.9125in" height="5.223611111111111in"}
Figure 7.2.1.4.1: Option 3: NSMF to NSSMF interface for multi-operator NSI
creation
### 7.2.2 Management support to facilitate UE roaming between Network Slice
Instances in different administrative domains
The solution assumes the Operators have a roaming agreement, and roaming is
supported through network slicing:
1\. The Operator B notifies the Operator A about the slice selection related
information for the NSI.
2\. If needed, the NSMF of Operator A maps the slice selection related
information of Operator B to the slice selection related information of
Operator A based on roaming agreement.
3\. The NSMF of Operator A provides the slice selection related information to
the related network functions of NSI to support the roaming users from the NSI
of Operator B.
## 7.3 Customer service support with network slice
### 7.3.1 Making a service request with commonly agreed service types and
attributes for service provision automation
This clause addresses the use case, where a mobile network operator provides
the types of services to the customers with their own end user/device
population distributed in a geographical area and how the customer should
specify the services it needs with the related requirements. The operator uses
the service management functionality in the 3GPP management system for this
purpose.
The customer can identify the available types of business services and the
attribute values that need to be specified in order to uniquely identify the
customer service request. The service requirements may be finalized in several
steps of negotiation which may involve iterative changes of these attribute
values.
The network management system should have the capability to assess the types
of services it can offer knowing the network infra-structure capabilities and
make it available to the service management functionality.
An operator may decide to slice the network using different criteria, such as
application types (e.g. MTC, v2V, URLLC), QoS types, mobility, security etc.
An operator may have multiple categorizational criteria or have a hybrid
categorization. The global service categorization should allow for any such
categorization and a standard service request format may be designed so that
there is a mutual understanding for customer-operator negotiation or for the
negotiations between different administrative domains.
The network management system also needs to see the feasibility of
facilitating those service types considering the issues such as resource
availability and capacity limits, and identify all the attributes related to
each service classification and prepare the attributes according to the global
categorization format.
There can be several levels of service type categorizations each higher level
service category having multiple sub-categories in order to cover numerous
possible customer service types that can be provided by a network operator.
The main classifications may be based on the following two aspects (1) Based
on the business service type; (2) based on high level service characteristics.
These are further described below.
**1) First level of categorization based on type of business service:**
The following 3 types of telecommunication services are examples of services
that may be offered by an MNO.
**a) End to end (E2E) connectivity as a service:** providing E2E
telecommunication service (e.g. user to a server) with multiple end
users/devices (single user is a subset of this case).
**b) Network as a service (NaaS):** providing a \'connected\' network that can
be used by another MNO or service provider.
**c) Asset as a service - also termed infra-structure as a service (IaaS):**
providing resources that can be used for connectivity.
This first level service category may need to be identified in any type of
negotiation, i.e. customer to operator or negotiation between different
administrative domains.
**2) Second level of categorization based on high level service
characteristics facilitated by the slices:**
In this level the key service characteristics that impacts the composition of
the network slice are used for categorization. Several examples of such key
characteristics are service function chain, security, mobility, QoS, traffic
types, and geographical locations. Different operators may choose different
characteristics when forming different slice or service types to offer to the
customers.
An operator, for example, may map all its services into one of the three
network slice types such as eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, when serving a customer.
On the other hand, another operator may categorize the services according to
the QoS ranges and prepare slices to map a combination of different ranges of
QoS and different service function chains. For example, the MEC (mobile edge
computing) applications requiring low delay may be classified as a one service
category and best effort traffic may be categorized as another.
**3) Further classification and specific attributes corresponding to each
classification**
Certain service types with much more variation in service requirements may be
further classified into sub-categories to allow for an operator to offer more
granularity to its customers. For example, eMBB type may be further classified
into QoS ranges or QoS based categorization may be further classified into
user to server and user to user service (service function chain based).
Finally, there needs to have a set of attributes to specify different options
and other service requirements, which can be different for different service
types discussed above. Some of these options include:
\- end user authentication method,
\- physical or logical isolation requirements,
\- congestion control mechanisms,
\- resource specification,
\- charging method,
\- dynamic policy change possibilities,
\- network exposure possibilities,
\- traffic monitoring and controlling possibilities for customer,
\- penalising methods for not meeting the SLA, etc.
Other service requirements may include performance requirements such as
capacity, delay, number of users, geographical coverage, traffic profiles etc.
The Table 7.3.1.1 illustrates the multiple levels of service categorization
described above.
Table 7.3.1.1
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Level 1 | Level 2 | Optional | Attributes, | | | categorization | additional | and their | | Categorization | based on | levels (3, 4, | ranges | | based on | service | 5), e.g. | | | Business | ch | exposure | e.g.: | | Service Type | aracterization | levels | Capacity, | | | | | throughput, | | (A, B, C) | (A: A1, A2, | | delay, number | | | A3) | | of users, | | | | | geographical | | | (B: B1, B2) | | id | | | | | entifications, | | | (C1, C2, C3, | | authentication | | | C4) | | level etc. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
## 7.4 Network Slice (Subnet) Instance(s) fault management
### 7.4.1 Network Slice Instance performance alarms monitoring
Figure 7.4.1.1: NSI performance alarms monitoring
Figure 7.4.1.1 shows a high-level solution of NSI performance alarms
monitoring. More details are depicted as follows:
1) The NSMF determines to monitor the performance alarms for PM parameters of
an NSI.
2) The NSMF determines to create threshold monitoring jobs for monitoring PM
parameters on non-shared NFs, and shared NFs of the NSI. In case of non-shared
NFs, threshold monitoring job information contains PM parameters and threshold
values.
3) The NSMF receives performance alarm notifications specific to an NSI.
## 7.5 Network slicing related performance measurement data aggregation
### 7.5.1 General
The different functions at different network levels may have different
requirements for the corresponding performance measurement data information.
For network slicing related performance measurement management, there are two
categories of performance measurement data:
\- Network related performance measurement data.
\- Communication service related performance measurement data.
### 7.5.2 Network related performance measurement data
Network related performance measurement data include three levels of
performance measurement data further:
1) NF performance measurement data:
a. In order to know the performance of a NF, performance measurement data at
NF level needs to be obtained.
b. The NF performance measurement data is also needed by other network
management entities besides the network slicing management.
2) NSSI performance measurement data:
a. In order to understand the performance of an NSSI, some performance
measurement data at NSSI level needs to be obtained.
b. NSSMF generates the NSSI performance measurement data based on the
performance measurement data related to NF(s) associated with the NSSI. NSSMF
may also generate the NSSI performance measurement data by using other way
which is FFS.
3) NSI performance measurement data:
a. In order to understand the performance of a NSI, some performance
measurement data at NSI level need to be obtained.
b. NSMF generates the NSI performance measurement data based on performance
measurement data related to NSSI(s) and/or NFs associated with the NSI.
For the case of NFs shared by multiple NSSIs, whether the shared NFs need to
maintain a tag for the corresponding NSSIs and/or NSIs or whether it is the
job of NSSMF, will be decided in the normative phase.
### 7.5.3 Communication service related performance measurement data
Communication service related performance measurement data:
1) In order to understand the performance of a service, some performance
measurement data at service level need to be obtained.
2) In order to obtain the service related performance measurement data, the
NSMF firstly collects performance measurement data related to NSI associated
with the service and then sends the NSI performance measurement data to CSMF.
3) The CSMF generates the service related performance measurement data based
on the received NSI performance measurement data from NSMF and other
information may owned by CSMF. Some service performance measurement data may
be provided to the CSC.
4) Customer, i.e. the CSCs of the NSI, may have a service level agreement with
the operator (as CSP) of the network slice that states that the operator
provides performance measurement data that pertains to network slice resources
used by the CSCs.
5) In some cases, the operator, who plays the role of CSP, may provide a
shared NSI to some CSCs (for example, the enterprises of an industry segment),
each CSC may have own management function, i.e. Customer Management Function
(CMF) which is out of scope of 3GPP, which will be interested to get the
service level performance measurements based on filter conditions relevant to
that CSC. Therefore, CSCs may obtain the performance measurement data related
to the corresponding service from CSMF.
## 7.6 Network slicing related alarm data aggregation
### 7.6.1 General
The different functions at different network levels may have different
requirements for the corresponding fault information. For network slicing
related fault management, there are two categories of alarm data:
\- Network related alarm data.
\- Communication service related alarm data.
### 7.6.2 Network related alarm data
Network related alarm data include three levels of alarm data:
1) NF alarm data:
a. In order to know the fault information of a NF, alarm data at NF level need
to be obtained.
b. The NF alarm data is also needed by other network management entities
besides the network slicing management.
2) NSSI alarm data:
a. In order to understand the fault information of a NSSI, some alarm data at
NSSI level need to be obtained.
b. In order to obtain NSSI alarm data, the NSSMF firstly collects alarm data
related to NF(s) associated with the NSSI. Then the NSSMF generates NSSI alarm
data based on the received alarm data related to the corresponding NF(s).
3) NSI alarm data:
a. In order to understand the fault information of a NSI, some alarm data at
NSI level need to be obtained.
b. In order to obtain NSI alarm data, the NSMF firstly collects alarm data
related to NSSI(s) associated with the NSI. Then the NSMF generates NSI alarm
data based on the received alarm data related to the corresponding NSSI(s)
and/or the received alarm data related to the corresponding NF(s).
For the case of NFs shared by multiple NSSIs, the alarm handling in network
sharing TS 32.130 [9] may be used in the normative phase.
### 7.6.3 Communication service related alarm data
Communication service related alarm data:
1) In order to understand the fault information of a communication service
which is supported by NSI, some alarm data at service level need to be
obtained.
2) In order to obtain the service related alarm data, the NSMF firstly
collects alarm data related to NSI associated with the service and then sends
the NSI alarm data to CSMF.
3) The CSMF generates the communication service related alarm data based on
the received NSI alarm data from NSMF and other information may be owned by
CSMF. Some service related alarm data may be provided to CSC.
4) Customer, i.e. the CSCs of the NSI, may have a service level agreement with
the operator (as CSP) of the network slice that states that the operator
provides Fault Management (FM) data that pertains to network slice resources
used by the CSCs.
5) In some cases, the operator, who plays the role of CSP, may provide a
shared NSI to some CSCs (for example, the enterprises of an industry segment),
each CSC may have own management function, i.e. Customer Management Function
(CMF) which is out of scope of 3GPP, which will be interested to get the
service alarm data based on filter conditions relevant to that CSC. Therefore,
CSCs may subscribe to CSMF as service alarm data receiver to obtain the alarm
data related to the corresponding service from CSMF.
## 7.7 Supervising alarm related to a NSI
1\. The NSMF determines the corresponding NSI and the corresponding NSSI alarm
notifications subscription request based on the association of NSSI(s) and the
NSI.
2\. The NSMF sends NSSI alarm notifications subscription request to the NSSMF
for receiving the alarm notifications related to the faulty NSSI.
3\. After receiving the NSSI alarm notifications subscription request from
NSMF, the NSSMF subscribes to the NF or NSSI alarm notifications for receiving
the alarm notifications related to the corresponding NFs or NSSIs that compose
the NSSI.
4\. In case fault happens on a NSSI, for example, if the NSSI fault is caused
by the faulty NF(s) which composing the NSSI, the NSSMF will receive the
corresponding NF(s) or NSSI(s) alarm notifications, supervise the NSSI, and
generate the appropriate NSSI alarm notifications related to the faulty NSSI.
5\. The NSSMF sends NSSI alarm notifications related to the faulty NSSI to the
NSMF based on the alarm notification subscription. The faulty NSSI may be
shared by multiple NSIs. The NSSMF knows which NSSIs are associated with each
NSI.
6a. If the alarm notifications are related to a dedicated NSSI, the NSMF
supervises the NSI based on the alarm notifications.
6b. If the alarm notifications are related to a NSSI shared by multiple NSIs,
the NSSMF identifies which NSI(s) the alarm notifications are applicable to,
and then the NSMF supervises the identified NSI(s) based on the alarm
notifications.
7\. The NSMF generates the NSI alarm notifications based on the received NSSI
alarm notifications.
## 7.8 Network Slice Instance performance management
1\. The NSMF determines to collect performance data of a NSI.
2\. The NSMF determines to collect performance data related to NSSIs which are
associated with the NSI.
3\. The NSMF requests a NSSMF to create performance measurement jobs in order
to collect the performance data related to the NSSI constituents (i.e. NFs and
NSSIs). The request may include: measurement types such as parameters
indicating QoS of communication services, traffic load and etc., measurement
scheduling information, and etc.
4\. The NSSMF creates performance measurement jobs to collect the performance
data related to the NSSI constituents (i.e. NFs and NSSIs).
\- For a dedicated NSSI, all performance data is identified by the NSI using
the NSSI.
\- For a NSSI shared by NSIs, the NSSMF identifies which NSI(s) the
performance data are applicable to.
5\. The NSSMF collects the performance data related to the NSSI(s) and report
to the NSMF.
6\. The NSMF generates NSI performance data based on performance data related
to NSSIs associated with the NSI.
## 7.9 Network Slice (Subnet) Instance(s) lifecycle management
### 7.9.1 Provision of different types of services by an operator
#### 7.9.1.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for different services provided to a
customer. Three generic service types provided by an operator are listed
below:
A. Providing a communication service
B. Network slice as a service
C. Network slice subnet as a service
The following sub-clauses describe potential solutions for these cases.
#### 7.9.1.2 Providing a communication service using a network slice instance
The potential solution for creating an NSI to support a communication service
is described below. In this case, a network provider as a CSP, provides a
communication service to a CSC.
1\. CSC makes the communication service request. This includes specifying the
service requirements to the CSP which may contain geographical traffic
demands, isolation requirements, application requirements and network KPIs.
2\. The Communication Service Management Function of the CSP translates
service related requirements into network slice related requirements.
3\. The information indicating whether the requested NSI could be shared with
other communication services may be included in the network slice related
requirements.
NOTE: The information indicating whether the requested NSI can be shared with
other communication services may be determined by the Communication Service
Management Function based on the service isolation requirements.
4\. The CSMF sends a request to the NSMF to allocate an NSI with network slice
related requirements.
5\. NSMF may estimate the viability of the request and may reject the request
if the service is estimated to be not viable.
6\. If there is information indicating the requested NSI can be shared with
other communication services and if an existing available NSI can be used, the
NSMF may use the existing NSI. Otherwise, the NSMF may create a new NSI to
satisfy the network slice related requirements.
7\. The NSMF derives the network slice subnet related requirements from the
network slice related requirements. The information indicating whether the
requested NSSI can be shared with other NSIs may be included in the network
slice subnet related requirement to the NSSMF.
8\. If a new NSI needs to be created, the NSMF identifies the NSSIs to be
reused and the NSSIs to be created.
9\. If an existing NSI needs to be reused, the NSMF identifies the NSSIs to be
reused.
10\. The NSMF sends the network slice subnet related requirement to the NSSMF.
11\. If the NSSI is to be created, the NSSMF creates a new NSSI with the
network slice subnet requirements.
12\. If the NSSI is to be reused, the NSSMF may reconfigure or modifies it
with the network slice subnet requirements if needed.
13\. The NSMF associates NSSIs with the corresponding NSI.
#### 7.9.1.3 Providing a network slice as a service
The following steps are required to provide a network slice as a service to a
network slice customer.
1\. CSMF of the Network slice customer checks the service catalogue of the
network provider that describes the type of network slices the network
provider can support.
2\. The CSMF makes a request with specific network slice requirements to the
NSMF of the network provider. These requirements may include the network slice
subnet characteristics, network topology, specific resource requirements, NF
related requirements such as placement, and capabilities, network KPIs such as
network outage, specific link requirements, etc.
NOTE: For security reasons, the connection from CSMF to NSMF may be routed
through a security gateway to enforce the limitations of management data
exposure. This security gateway is not in the scope of the present document.
3\. NSMF may estimate the viability of the request and may reject the request
if the service is estimated to be not viable. If viable, the NSMF creates a
new NSI.
4\. If the management of a NSI is needed to be exposed to the network slice
customer, the NSMF separates certain management functionalities in NSMF
according to the network slice requirements as a set of exposed slice specific
management functions and access is provided to the network slice customer.
#### 7.9.1.4 Providing a network slice subnet as a service
The following steps are required to provide a network slice subnet as a
service to a network slice subnet customer.
1\. NSMF of the network slice subnet customer sends a service request for a
network slice subnet to the network provider with the network slice subnet
requirements.
2\. The NSMF of the network slice subnet customer makes a request with
specific network slice subnet requirements to the NSSMF of the slice subnet
provider. These requirements may include the network slice subnet
characteristics, network topology, specific resource requirements, NF related
requirements such as placement, and capabilities, network KPIs such as network
outage, specific link requirements, etc.
NOTE: It is assumed that there is "interfacing" between NSMF to NSSMF across
customer and provider domains. For security reasons, the connection from NSMF
to NSSMF may be routed through a security gateway to enforce the limitations
of management data exposure. This security gateway is not in the scope of the
present document.
3\. NSSMF may estimate the viability of the request and may reject the request
if the service is estimated to be not viable.
4\. NSSMF creates new NSSIs and associates the NSSIs with the corresponding
NSI.
5\. If the management of a NSSI is needed to be exposed to the network slice
subnet customer, the NSSMF separates certain management functionalities in
NSSMF according to the slice subnet requirements as a set of exposed slice
subnet specific management functions and access is provided to the network
slice subnet customer.
### 7.9.2 Activating a Network Slice Instance
1\. The NSMF identifies the corresponding NSSIs to be activated.
2\. For the NSSIs to be activated, the NSMF sends NSSI activation request to
corresponding NSSMF.
3\. The NSSMF activates the NSSI through activating all necessary constituents
(i.e. NF and NSSI) and notifies the NSMF after the NSSI is activated.
4\. When all the NSSIs are activated, the NSMF changes the state of NSI to
active.
### 7.9.3 Modifying a Network Slice Instance
The potential solution for modifying an NSI is described as follows:
1\. The NSMF receives an NSI modification request or the NSMF decides to
modify an NSI based on a pre-defined policy. For example, the modification of
NSI may include changing the capacity of the NSI, changing the topology of the
NSI, and associating/de-associating network functions with the NSI.
2\. The NSMF determines the set of NSSIs that need to be modified and sends a
request to the respective NSSMF of each of the NSSI in the set with the
network slice subnet related requirements for modification.
3\. The NSSMF determines whether the received request with related requirement
could be performed.
4a. If the request with the requirement can be performed, the NSSMF determines
which of the NSSI constituents needs to be modified. The NSSMF then modifies
the NSSIs in the following way:
\- If the target NSSI constituent is shared with other NSSIs, the NSSMF
determines whether the modification of the NSSI may impact the constituents
shared by the other NSSIs:
a. If there is no negative impact, the NSSMF modifies the target NSSI
constituents and configures them according to the requirements.
b. If there is negative impact, the NSSMF decides not to modify the NSSI
constituents, or the NSSMF creates new NSSI constituents only for this NSSI
being modified to avoid the negative impact. The original NSSI constituents
are reconfigured and will no longer be associated to the NSSI being modified.
The newly created NSSI constituents are configured according to the
requirements.
\- If the target NSSI constituent is not shared with other NSSI, the NSSMF
modifies the target NSSI constituents and configures them according to the
requirements.
4b. If the request with the related requirement cannot be performed, the NSSMF
rejects the request send the feedback to NSMF accordingly.
### 7.9.4 Deactivating a Network Slice Instance
1\. The NSMF identifies the corresponding NSSIs to be deactivated. The NSSIs
shared with other NSIs are not deactivated.
2\. For the NSSIs to be deactivated, the NSMF sends NSSI deactivation request
to corresponding NSSMF.
3\. The NSSMF deactivates the NSSI through deactivating all necessary
constituents (i.e. NF and NSSI) and notifies the NSMF after the NSSI is
deactivated.
4\. When all the NSSIs are inactive, the NSMF changes the state of NSI to
inactive.
### 7.9.5 Terminating a Network Slice Instance
The following is a high-level solution for terminating an NSI.
1\. The NSMF determines to terminate the NSI which is not necessary any
longer.
2\. The NSMF de-activates the NSI. Then the NSI to be terminated is in de-
activated state.
NOTE: The solution for NSI de-activation is studied in other clauses.
3\. The NSMF identifies corresponding NSSIs to be terminated and NSSIs to be
retained.
4\. If the NSSI needs to be terminated, the NSMF sends NSSI termination
request to corresponding NSSMF. Then the NSSMF terminates the NSSI.
5\. The NSMF deletes the NSI information.
### 7.9.6 Management of the NSSI and NF used by multiple NSIs
#### 7.9.6.1 Management of the NSSI
This clause addresses the management issue when the NSSI is used by multiple
NSIs:
1\. Every NSSI is only managed by a single NSSMF. The lifecycle management of
the NSSI is performed by this NSSMF which manages it.
2\. When NSMF determines to perform the management operation (e.g. change
capacity, de-activate, terminate, modify, monitor performance), it sends the
request to the NSSMF, the NSSMF performs the corresponding operation on NSSI.
3\. When NSSMF determines to perform the management operation on NSSI, the
operation results are notified to the NSMF, the NSMF then determines whether
the other NSSMF needs to perform further.
#### 7.9.6.2 Network slice related management of the NF
This clause addresses the management issue when the NF is used by multiple
NSIs:
1\. The network slice related management of the NF is only performed by the
NSSMF which manages it.
2\. When NSMF determines to perform the management operation (e.g. change
capacity, de-activate, terminate, modify, monitor performance), it sends the
request to the NSSMF, the NSSMF performs the corresponding operation on NF.
3\. When NSSMF determines to perform the management operation on NF, the
operation results are notified to the NSMF, the NSMF then determines whether
the other NSSMF needs to perform further.
## 7.10 Configuring a Network Slice Instance
The potential solution for configuring an NSI is described as follows:
1\. The NSMF wants to configure the NSI and identifies the corresponding NSSIs
to be configured.
2\. For the NSSIs to be configured, the NSMF sends NSSI related configuration
requirements to corresponding NSSMF.
3\. The NSSMF configures the NSSI through configuring all necessary
constituents (i.e. NF or constituent NSSI) and notifies the NSMF after the
NSSI is configured.
## 7.11 Association of TN parameters to Network Slice Instance
In the process of creating an NSI, the NSMF is required to ensure the usage of
the TN parts for the network slice to meet the network slice requirements.
In order to achieve isolation between NSIs when using the TN links, it may be
beneficial to allow traffic corresponding to different NSIs to be
differentiated at the TN level. This is achieved by providing NSI specific TN
parameters to each node. These TN parameters may correspond to NSI specific IP
address allocation, or L2 parameters such as VLAN tags.
For this purpose, during the instantiation of a network slice, information
about this NSI specific TN parameters must be made available to the various
RAN and CN nodes. This information includes the corresponding TN parameters to
be used for associated transport links.
## 7.12 Management data exposure and isolation when NSI is shared by multiple
customers
### 7.12.1 Introduction
Operator may use one NSI to serve multiple customers (e.g. other network
operator or enterprise) simultaneously and customers want to get the
management data (e.g. performance data, fault data) related to itself.
There are two scenarios:
1\. Scenario 1: Network slice as NOP internals. In this scenario, the customer
wants to get communication service related management data.
2\. Scenario 2: Network slice as service. In this scenario, the customer wants
to get network slice related management data.
### 7.12.2 Communication service related management data
In the scenario1, the customers want to get the communication service related
management data.
\- Customer subscribes the communication service related management data from
CSMF.
\- CSMF collects and generates the communication service related management
data for each customer. The communication service related management data for
each customer needs to be collected and generated separately.
\- CSMF provides the communication service related management data to
corresponding customer.
Figure 7.12.2.1: Communication Service related management data provided by
CSMF
## 7.13 Limited level of management exposure for NSI
The NSI is created according to customer\'s service request, where the
management exposure may be one of requirements. The potential solution for
management exposure is to enforce management isolation as described below:
1\. The operator (or the operator\'s management system) receives the
management exposure request as a part of the customer\'s request.
2\. The NSMF identifies the type of the management exposure as below:
a) If the NSSI is shared by the other NSIs, the management isolation of the
NSSI is configured to only allow the management data and management operations
relates to the specific NSI to be exposed via the management system.
b) If the NSSI is not shared by the other NSIs, no management isolation
configuration is needed.
3\. Based on the identified type of management exposure, the CSMF derives the
valid management exposure.
4\. The operator (or the operator\'s management system) grants the permission
of the agreed management exposure (e.g. management data and management
operation). An access to the appropriate management function is authorised.
5\. The NSI management request is sent to the appropriate management function
via the authorised access.
6\. The management data and management operation result is feedback to both
the requester and the operator.
## 7.14 NSI related management data exposure to customer
When the NSI is offered as service to customer, the customer needs to access
the management data (performance measurements, alarm information, etc.)
related to NSI by the following way:
1\. Customer requests to collect the management data related to NSI from CSMF.
2\. Per the request from customer, CSMF requests to collect the management
data related to NSI from NSMF.
3\. NSMF collects the management data related to NSI and informs the CSMF
about the availability of the management data.
4\. CSMF gets the management data from NSMF.
5\. CSMF informs the customer about the availability of the management data.
6\. Customer gets the management data from CSMF.

NOTE: The provisioning of management data to the customer is not addressed in
the present document.
## 7.15 Controlling of automated healing of Network Slice Instance
Figure 7.15.1: Controlling of automated healing of an NSI
Figure 7.15.1 shows a high-level potential solution for automated healing of
NSI. Policies for automated healing need to be configured before the process
of the automated healing triggered. The NSMF receives the automated healing
policies for the NSI.
Case 1: Automated healing at NSSI level
1\. NSMF derives the automated healing policies for NSSI and forwards them to
NSSMF.
2\. When failure or severe performance degradation detected on the
constituents of NSSI, the NSSMF receives the alarm notifications for NSSI
constituents, generates and sends alarm notifications for the NSSI to the
NSMF.
3\. The NSSMF, bases on the information step 1 and policies received,
determine if actions are required such as trigger the automated healing for
NSSI, evaluate the results of automated healing, and report the results of
NSSI automated healing to NSMF.
Case 2: Automated healing at NSI level
1\. The NSMF triggers the automated healing for the NSI based on the automated
healing policies for the NSI. For example, the NSMF may request the NSSMF to
add a new NSSI to take over the fault-affected NSSI or request the NSSMF to
modify the existing NSSI to compensate the fault part. If there are conflicts
among different automated healing actions, the NSSMF solves conflicts
according to automated healing policies.
2\. The NSSMF performs according to the request from the NSMF and reports the
results of the healing actions to the NSMF
3\. The NSMF evaluates the results of automated healing actions for the NSI.
4\. The NSMF reports the results of automated healing for the NSI.
## 7.16 Controlling of automated optimization of Network Slice Instance
Figure 7.16.1: Controlling of NSI automated optimization
The Figure 7.16.1 shows a high-level solution for controlling of NSI automated
optimization. More details are depicted as follows in which step 1 and step 2
are pre-requisites of the whole control loop through step 3-6:
Case 1: Automated optimization at NSI level
1\. The NSMF receives automated optimization policies for a NSI. Automated
optimization policies include trigger condition, slice-specific parameters
being optimized and their valid range, policies for solving automated
optimization conflicts.
2\. The NSMF collects performance data related to the NSSIs that are
associated with the NSI. Based on the performance data related to the NSSIs,
the NSI performance indicators are generated and monitored.
3\. If the trigger condition of NSI automated optimization is satisfied, the
NSMF triggers NSI automated optimization action.
4\. The NSMF requests NSSMF to modify the existing NSSIs and/or add new NSSIs
for the NSI automated optimization
5\. The NSSMF performs optimization actions as requested from NSMF. The
optimization actions may result in reconfiguration of the network functions in
the NSSIs. The results of optimization actions and the performance data are
reported to the NSMF.
6\. The NSMF evaluates NSI automated optimization results. Optionally, the NSI
automated optimization results are reported to the operator.
Case 2: Automated optimization at NSSI level
1\. NSMF derives the automated optimization policies for NSSI and forwards
them to NSSMF.
2\. The NSSMF performs NSSI optimization automatically according to NSSI
automated optimization policies received from the NSMF and report the
optimization result to NSMF. If there are conflicts among different automated
optimization actions, the NSSMF solves conflicts according to automated
optimization policies.
## 7.17 State management
### 7.17.1 States for a Network Slice Instance
A Network Slice Instance (NSI) will support the following states:
\- Inactive -- An identifier exists for the NSI. The NSI is associated with
the relevant NSSIs. The NSI is ready to be activated.
\- Active -- An identifier exists for the NSI. The NSI is associated with the
relevant NSSIs. The associated NSSIs are active.
The NSMF maps NSI requirements to NSI state transitions. It is the
responsibility of the NSMF to decide when it is appropriate and safe to
perform an NSI state transition.
An NSI will support the following transitions:
\- Create -- A new NSI identifier is allocated. An initial configuration of
the NSI is created. According to this configuration, existing NSSIs may be
associated with the NSI, or new NSSIs may be created and associated with the
NSI.
\- Activate -- The associated NSSIs are activated.
\- Deactivate -- The associated NSSIs are deactivated if they are not shared
with another active NSI.
\- Terminate -- Associations to NSSIs are released. The NSI identifier is
deallocated.
The NSI states and transitions are illustrated in Figure 7.17.1.1.

Figure 7.17.1.1: Network Slice Instance state diagram
### 7.17.2 States for a Network Slice Subnet Instance
A Network Slice Subnet Instance (NSSI) will support the following states:
\- Inactive -- An identifier exists for the NSSI. The NSSI is associated with
the relevant constituents (NSSIs and/or NFs). The NSSI is ready to be
activated.
\- Active -- An identifier exists for the NSSI. The NSSI is associated with
the relevant constituents (NSSIs and/or NFs). The constituents of the NSSI are
active.
The NSSMF maps NSSI requirements to NSSI state transitions. It is the
responsibility of the NSSMF to decide when it is appropriate and safe to
perform an NSSI state transition.
An NSSI will support the following transitions:
\- Create -- A new NSSI identifier is allocated. An initial configuration of
the NSSI is created. According to this configuration, existing constituents
may be associated with the NSSI, or new constituents may be created and
associated with the NSSI.
\- Activate -- The associated constituents are activated.
\- Deactivate -- The associated constituents are deactivated if they are not
shared with another active NSSI.
\- Terminate -- Associations to constituents are released. The NSSI identifier
is deallocated.
The NSSI states and transitions are illustrated in Figure 7.17.2.1.

document.
# 8 Conclusions
The study has identified few management concepts, 42 use cases, 112
requirements and 17 solutions for management and orchestration of network
slices.
The study has identified three management functions involved in management and
orchestration of network slicing. The management functions are; the CSMF, the
NSMF, and the NSSMF.
The study has identified that for the management and orchestration of the CN
part and RAN part management concepts are needed such as an abstract
representation of the network slice and network slice instance. An abstract
representation allows the management functions to interact with each other and
provide management and orchestration functions to support network slicing.
The naming of an abstract representation of an NSI is not addressed (Network
Slice Instance used in the present document).
The naming of an abstract representation of an NSSI is not addressed (Network
Slice Subnet Instance used in the present document).
The relationship between the management functions and the management
architecture [11] is not addressed in the present document.
The relationship between the abstract representations (NSSI, NSI and NF) of a
managed network slice has not been decided.
The present document has identified use cases for the normative work.
# 9 Recommendations
It is recommended to do normative work for the management and orchestration of
network slicing for the 5G network.
It is recommended that the normative work includes specification of management
and orchestration of the CN and RAN as specified in [7], [10] and [8].
It is recommended to provide the naming of the management representation for
the managed network slice and managed network slice subnet in the normative
phase.
It is recommended that for the TN part supporting connectivity within and
between CN and RAN parts, the management system will provide link requirements
(e.g. topology, QOS parameters) to the TN management system.
It is recommended to specify the managed object models for the network slice
and the network slice subnet.
It is recommended to specify interfaces for the CSMF; the NSMF and NSSMF.

Pre-conditions | | | | | | â€¢ Deploy a multi-domain network | | | infrastructure, | | | | | | â€¢ Expose via Network APIs the | | | capabilities of this | | | multi-domain network | | | infrastructure | | | | | | â€¢ Deploy management and | | | orchestration system which | | | includes: | | | | | | - Editors for various items and | | | definitions, including | | | High-Level Network | | | Objectives/Goals, Policy | | | Generators that generate | | | Policies from High-Level Network | | | Objectives/Goals and Policy | | | Validators against conflicts | | | (Goals conflict resolution, | | | Policy conflict resolution, | | | Resolution), | | | | | | - ETSI MANO components (NFVO, | | | VNF Manager, VIM), | | | | | | - SDN Controllers, | | | | | | - Legacy OSS (NMS / EMS), | | | | | | - E2E Service orchestration | | | | | | 2. To create slice | | | | | | E2E Service orchestration | | | interprets and translates | | | service definition / Service | | | Design into configuration of | | | resources (physical and | | | virtualized) needed for service | | | establishment. The configuration | | | of resources may be for actual | | | amount of resources or the | | | policy of their allocation at | | | later time, when the service is | | | activated. | | | | | | The E2E Service orchestration | | | further triggers the components | | | of the management and | | | orchestration system (ETSI NFVO, | | | VNF Manager, VIM, SDN | | | Controller, legacy OSS to apply | | | the configuration of the | | | required resources which for | | | some resources may result in | | | their actual allocation. | | | | | | NOTE: In case when the needed | | | resources were not allocated at | | | the previous step, they will be | | | actually allocated at the time | | | of service activation, according | | | to the configuration / policies. | | | | | | - Make available a Self-Service | | | Portal and Self-Ordering APIs to | | | my customers (Residential and | | | Enterprises) to allow them for | | | self-ordering their slices with | | | SLAs and update them dynamically | | | when needed. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
**Table A.4: Analysis of potential management related aspects\ based on the
related content in NGMN \"Description of Network Slicing Concept\" [5]**
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Related content in NGMN | Potential management related | | \"Description of Network Slicing | aspect | | Concept\"[5] | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | As depicted in Figure B.1-1, the | 3GPP management related | | network slicing concept consists | | | of 3 layers: 1) Service Instance | | | Layer, 2) Network Slice Instance | | | Layer, and 3) Resource layer. | | | | | | The Service Instance Layer | | | represents the services | | | (end-user service or business | | | services) which are to be | | | supported. Each service is | | | represented by a Service | | | Instance. Typically services can | | | be provided by the network | | | operator or by 3rd parties. In | | | line with this, a Service | | | Instance can either represent an | | | operator service or a 3rd party | | | provided service. | | | | | | A network operator uses a | | | Network Slice Blueprint to | | | create a Network Slice Instance. | | | A Network Slice Instance | | | provides the network | | | characteristics which are | | | required by a Service Instance. | | | A Network Slice Instance may | | | also be shared across multiple | | | Service Instances provided by | | | the network operator. | | | | | | NOTE: Whether there is a need to | | | support sharing of Network Slice | | | Instances across Service | | | Instances provided by different | | | 3rd parties is up for discussion | | | in SDOs. | | | | | | The Network Slice Instance may | | | be composed by none, one or more | | | Sub-network Instances, which may | | | be shared by another Network | | | Slice Instance. Similarly, the | | | Sub-network Blueprint is used to | | | create a Sub-network Instance to | | | form a set of Network Functions, | | | which run on the | | | physical/logical resources. | | | | | | Figure A.1: Network slicing | | | conceptual outline | | | | | | **Service Instance:** An | | | instance of an end-user service | | | or a business service that is | | | realized within or by a Network | | | Slice. | | | | | | **Network Slice Instance:** a | | | set of network functions, and | | | resources to run these network | | | functions, forming a complete | | | instantiated logical network to | | | meet certain network | | | characteristics required by the | | | Service Instance(s): | | | | | | - A network slice instance may | | | be fully or partly, logically | | | and/or physically, isolated from | | | another network slice instance. | | | | | | - The resources comprises of | | | physical and logical resources. | | | | | | - A Network Slice Instance may | | | be composed of Sub-network | | | Instances, which as a special | | | case may be shared by multiple | | | network slice instances. The | | | Network Slice Instance is | | | defined by a Network Slice | | | Blueprint. | | | | | | - Instance-specific policies | | | and configurations are required | | | when creating a Network Slice | | | Instance. | | | | | | - Network characteristics | | | examples are ultra-low-latency, | | | ultra-reliability etc. | | | | | | **Network Slice Blueprint:** A | | | complete description of the | | | structure, configuration and the | | | plans/work flows for how to | | | instantiate and control the | | | Network Slice Instance during | | | its life cycle. A Network Slice | | | Blueprint enables the | | | instantiation of a Network | | | Slice, which provides certain | | | network characteristics (e.g. | | | ultra-low latency, | | | ultra-reliability, value-added | | | services for enterprises, etc.). | | | A Network Slice Blueprint refers | | | to required physical and logical | | | resources and/or to Sub-network | | | Blueprint(s). | | | | | | **Sub-network Instance:** A | | | Sub-network Instance comprises | | | of a set of Network Functions | | | and the resources for these | | | Network Functions: | | | | | | - The Sub-network Instance is | | | defined by a Sub-network | | | Blueprint. | | | | | | - A Sub-network Instance is not | | | required to form a complete | | | logical network. | | | | | | - A Sub-network Instance may be | | | shared by two or more Network | | | Slices. | | | | | | - The resources comprises of | | | physical and logical resources. | | | | | | **Sub-network Blueprint:** A | | | description of the structure | | | (and contained components) and | | | configuration of the Sub-network | | | Instances and the plans/work | | | flows for how to instantiate it. | | | A Sub-network Blueprint refers | | | to Physical and logical | | | resources and may refer to other | | | Sub-network Blueprints. | | | | | | **Physical resource:** A | | | physical asset for computation, | | | storage or transport including | | | radio access: | | | | | | - Network Functions are not | | | regarded as Resources. | | | | | | **Logical Resource:** Partition | | | of a physical resource, or | | | grouping of multiple physical | | | resources dedicated to a Network | | | Function or shared between a set | | | of Network Functions. | | | | | | **Network Function (NF):** | | | Network Function refers to | | | processing functions in a | | | network: | | | | | | - This includes but is not | | | limited to telecom nodes | | | functionality, as well as | | | switching functions e.g. | | | Ethernet switching function, IP | | | routing functions. | | | | | | - VNF is a virtualized version | | | of a NF (refer to ETSI NFV for | | | further details on VNF). | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
