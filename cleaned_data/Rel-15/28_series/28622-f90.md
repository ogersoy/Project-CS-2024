# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.621 Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements;
**28.622 Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Information Service (IS);**
**28.623 Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions.**
The interface Itf-N, defined in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], is built up by a number of
Integration Reference Points (IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which
realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The basic structure
of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.150 [4].
The present document is part of a set that has been developed for converged
management solutions.
The present document is part of a set that is used for **management and
orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing.**
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Generic network resource information that
can be communicated between an MnS producer and MnS consumer for
telecommunication network management purposes, including management of
converged networks and networks that include virtualized network functions.
This document specifies the semantics of information object class attributes
and relations visible across the reference point in a protocol and technology
neutral way. It does not define their syntax and encoding.
This document supports the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) concept
described in [8] in that the relevant Information Object Class (IOC)s defined
in this specification are directly or indirectly inherited from those
specified in the Umbrella Information Model (UIM) of [9].
Note that the present document is applicable to deployment scenarios using the
Service Based Management Architecture (SBMA) as defined in TS 28.533 [32].

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [22], 3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4] and
3GPP TS 32.600 [14] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [22], 3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS
32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [14].
**Association** : In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
1) name bindings,
2) reference attributes, and
3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that name containment associations shall be expressed
through name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other
types of associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate
entities in the object models (UML diagrams). Currently however, all (non-
containment) associations are modelled by means of reference attributes of the
participating MOs.
**Information Object Class (IOC): An IOC represents the management aspect of a
network resource.** It describes the information that can be passed/used in
management interfaces. **Their representations are technology agnostic
software objects.** IOC has attributes that represents the various properties
of the class of objects. See the term \"attribute\" defined in [10].
Furthermore, IOC can support operations providing network management services
invocable on demand for that class of objects. An IOC may support
notifications that report event occurrences relevant for that class of
objects. It is modelled using the stereotype \"Class\" in the UML meta-model.
See TS 32.156 [10] for additional information on IOC.
**Managed Object (MO)** : A MO is an instance of a Managed Object Class (MOC)
representing the management aspects of a network resource. Its representation
is a technology specific software object. It is sometimes called MO instance
(MOI). The MOC is a class of such technology specific software objects. An MOC
is the same as an IOC except that the former is defined in technology specific
terms and the latter is defined in technology agnostic terms. MOCs are
used/defined in SS level specifications. IOCs are used/defined in IS level
specifications.
**Management Information Base (MIB)** : A MIB is an instance of an NRM and has
some values on the defined attributes and associations specific for that
instance. In the context of the present document, an MIB consists of:
1) a Name space (describing the MO containment hierarchy in the MIB through
Distinguished Names),
2) a number of Managed Objects with their attributes and
3) a number of Associations between these MOs. Also note that TMN (ITU-T
Recommendation X.710 [7]) defines a concept of a Management Information
Tre[e]{.underline} (also known as a Naming Tree) that corresponds to the name
space (containment hierarchy) portion of this MIB definition. Figure 3.1
depicts the relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs (the shown association is of a non-containment type)
Figure 3.1: Relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs
**Name space** : A name space is a collection of names. The IRP name
convention (see 3GPP TS 32.300 [13]) restricts the name space to a
hierarchical containment structure, including its simplest form - the one-
level, flat name space.\ All Managed Objects in a MIB are included in the
corresponding name space and the MIB/name space shall only support a strict
hierarchical containment structure (with one root object). A Managed Object
that contains another is said to be the superior (parent); the contained
Managed Object is referred to as the subordinate (child). The parent of all
MOs in a single name space is called a Local Root. The ultimate parent of all
MOs of all managed systems is called the Global Root.
**Network resource:** discrete entity represented by an Information Object
Class (IOC) for the purpose of network and service management.
NOTE: A network resource could represent intelligence, information, hardware
and software of a telecommunication network.
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : A collection of IOCs, inclusive of their
associations, attributes and operations, representing a set of network
resources under management.

### 4.2.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of classes (e.g. IOCs) that encapsulates the
information relevant for this IRP. This clause provides the overview of the
relationships of relevant classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more
detailed specification of various aspects of these classes.
The following figure shows the containment/naming hierarchy and the
associations of the classes defined in the present document. See Annex A of a
class diagram that combines this figure with Figure 1 of [2], the class
diagram of UIM.

NOTE 2: Each instance of the VsDataContainer shall only be contained under one
IOC. The VsDataContainer can be contained under IOCs defined in other NRMs.
NOTE 3: If the configuration contains several instances of SubNetwork, exactly
one SubNetwork instance shall directly or indirectly contain all the other
SubNetwork instances.
NOTE 4: The SubNetwork instance not contained in any other instance of
SubNetwork is referred to as \"the root SubNetwork instance\".
NOTE 5: ManagementNode shall be contained in the root SubNetwork instance.
NOTE 6: If contained in a SubNetwork instance, IRPAgent shall be contained in
the root SubNetwork instance.
NOTE 7: Void.
Figure 4.2.1-1: Containment/Naming and Association NRM fragment
Each Managed Object is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to
3GPP TS 32.300 [13] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example,
the DN of a ManagedElement instance could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden,MeContext =MEC-Gbg-1, ManagedElement=RNC-Gbg-1.

## 4.3 Class definitions
### 4.3.1 Any
#### 4.3.1.1 Definition
This class represents the classes (e.g. IOC) that are not defined in this
specification but are or will be defined in other IRP specification(s).
#### 4.3.1.2 Attributes
None
#### 4.3.1.3 Attribute constraints
None
#### 4.3.1.4 Notifications
_This class does not support any notification._
### 4.3.2 Void
### 4.3.3 ManagedElement
#### 4.3.3.1 Definition
This IOC represents telecommunications equipment or TMN entities within the
telecommunications network providing support and/or service to the
subscriber.\ An ME communicates with a manager (directly or indirectly) over
one or more management interfaces for the purpose of being monitored and/or
controlled. MEs may or may not additionally perform element management
functionality.\ An ME contains equipment that may or may not be geographically
distributed. An ME is often referred to as a \"Network Element\".
A telecommunication equipment has software and hardware components. The IOC
described above represents the case when the software component is designed to
run on dedicated hardware component. In the case when the software is designed
to run on ETSI NFV defined NFVI [15], the IOC description would exclude the
NFVI component supporting the above mentioned subject software. A
ManagedElement may be contained in either a SubNetwork or in a MeContext
instance. A single ManagedElement may also exist stand-alone with no parent at
all.
The ManagedElement IOC may be used to represent combined ME functionality (as
indicated by the managedElementType attribute and the contained instances of
different functional IOCs).
Single function ManagedElement IOC instances will have a 1..1 containment
relationship to a function IOC instance (in this context a function IOC
instance is an instance of an IOC derived from the ManagedFunction IOC).
Multiple function ManagedElement instances will have a 1..N containment
relationship to function IOC instances.
NOTE: For some specific functional IOCs a 1..N containment relationship is
permitted. The specific functional entities are identified in the NRMs that
define subclasses of ManagedFunction.
#### 4.3.3.2 Attributes
The ManagedElement IOC includes the attributes inherited from
ManagedElement_IOC (defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top
IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable isInvariant
isNotifyable vendorName M T F F T userDefinedState M T T F T swVersion M T F F
T priorityLabel O T F T F measurementsList M T F F T
* * *
#### 4.3.3.3 Attribute constraints
* * *
Name Definition dnPrefix (inherited) Support Qualifier Condition: The
ManagedElement instance is the local root instance of the MIB; otherwise, the
attribute shall be absent or carry no information.
* * *
#### 4.3.3.4 Notifications
_The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC_. In
addition, the following set of notifications is also valid.
* * *
Name Qualifier Notes notifyDownloadNESwStatusChanged See Software Management
IRP (3GPP TS 32.532 [6])

notifyActivateNESwStatusChanged See Software Management IRP (3GPP TS 32.532
[6])
* * *
### 4.3.4 _ManagedFunction_
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition
This IOC is provided for sub-classing only. It provides attribute(s) that are
common to functional IOCs. Note that a ManagedElement may contain several
managed functions. The ManagedFunction may be extended in the future if more
common characteristics to functional objects are identified.
This IOC can represent a telecommunication function either realized by
software running on dedicated hardware or realized by software running on
NFVI. Each ManagedFunction instance communicates with a manager (directly or
indirectly) over one or more management interfaces exposed via its containing
ME instance.
#### 4.3.4.2 Attributes
The ManagedFunction IOC includes the attributes inherited from Function_IOC
(defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable isInvariant
isNotifyable vnfParametersList CM T T F T peeParametersList CM T T F T
priorityLabel O T F T F measurementsList M T F F T
* * *
#### 4.3.4.3 Attribute constraints

ManagedFunction instance is realized by one or more VNF instance(s). Otherwise
this attribute shall be absent. peeParametersList Support Qualifier
Condition:The control and monitoring of PEE parameters is supported by the
ManagedFunction or sub-class instance.
* * *
#### 4.3.4.4 Notifications
There is no notification defined.
### 4.3.5 ManagementNode
#### 4.3.5.1 Definition
This IOC represents a telecommunications management system (EM) within the TMN
that contains functionality for managing a number of ManagedElements (MEs).
The management system communicates with the MEs directly or indirectly over
one or more interfaces for the purpose of monitoring and/or controlling these
MEs.
This class has similar characteristics as the ManagedElement. The main
difference between these two classes is that the ManagementNode has a special
association to the managed elements that it is responsible for managing.
#### 4.3.5.2 Attributes
The ManagementNode IOC includes the attributes inherited from
ManagementSystem_ IOC (defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from
Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable isInvariant
isNotifyable vendorName M T F F T userDefinedState M T T F T locationName M T
F F T swVersion M T F F T
* * *
#### 4.3.5.3 Attribute constraints
None
#### 4.3.5.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions.
### 4.3.6 MeContext
#### 4.3.6.1 Definition
This IOC is introduced for naming purposes. It may support creation of unique
DNs in scenarios when some MEs have the same RDNs due to the fact that they
have been manufacturer pre-configured.\ If some MEs have the same RDNs (for
the above mentioned reason) and they are contained in the same SubNetwork
instance, some measure shall be taken in order to assure the global uniqueness
of DNs for all IOC instances under those MEs. One way could be to set
different dnPrefix for those NEs, but that would require either that:
a) all LDNs or DNs are locally modified using the new dnPrefix for the upper
portion of the DNs, or
b) a mapping (translation) of the old LDNs or DNs to the new DNs every time
they are used externally, e.g. in alarm notifications.
As both the two alternatives above may involve unacceptable drawbacks (as the
old RDNs for the MEs then would have to be changed or mapped to new values),
using MeContext offers a new alternative to resolve the DN creation. Using
MeContext as part of the naming tree (and thus the DN) means that the
dnPrefix, including a unique MeContext for each ME, may be directly
concatenated with the LDNs, without any need to change or map the existing ME
RDNs to new values.
MeContext have 0..N instances. It may exist even if no SubNetwork exists.
Every instance of MeContext contains exactly one ManagedElement during steady-
state operations.
#### 4.3.6.2 Attributes
The MeContext IOC includes the attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined in
TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8)
and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable isInvariant
isNotifyable dnPrefix CM M - - M
* * *
#### 4.3.6.3 Attribute constraints
* * *
Name Definition dnPrefix Support Qualifier Condition: The instance of
MeContext is the local root instance of the MIB. Otherwise the attribute shall
be absent or carry no information.
* * *
#### 4.3.6.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions.
### 4.3.7 SubNetwork
#### 4.3.7.1 Definition
This IOC represents a set of managed entities.There may be zero or more
instances of a SubNetwork. It shall be present if either a ManagementNode or
multiple ManagedElements are present (i.e. ManagementNode and multiple
ManagedElement instances shall have SubNetwork as parent).
The SubNetwork instance not contained in any other instance of SubNetwork is
referred to as \"the root SubNetwork instance\".
#### 4.3.7.2 Attributes
The SubNetwork IOC includes the attributes inherited from Domain_ IOC (defined
in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8)
and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable isInvariant
isNotifyable setOfMcc CM T F F T priorityLabel O T F T F measurementsList M T
F F T
* * *
#### 4.3.7.3 Attribute constraints

instance of SubNetwork is the local root instance of the MIB. Otherwise the
attribute shall be absent or carry no information. setOfMcc Support Qualifier
Condition: There is more than one value in setOfMcc of the
SubNetwork,otherwise the support is optional.
* * *
#### 4.3.7.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions
### 4.3.8 _Top_
#### 4.3.8.1 Definition
This IOC is provided for sub-classing only. All information object classes
defined in all TS that claim to be conformant to 32.102 [2] shall inherit from
Top.
#### 4.3.8.2 Attributes

### 4.3.9 VsDataContainer
#### 4.3.9.1 Definition
The VsDataContainer managed object is a container for vendor specific data.
The number of instances of the VsDataContainer can differ from vendor to
vendor. This IOC shall only be used by the Bulk CM IRP for all the NRMs.
#### 4.3.9.2 Attributes
The VsDataContainer IOC includes the attributes inherited from Top_ IOC
(defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *

* * *
#### 4.3.9.3 Attribute constraints
None
#### 4.3.9.4 Notifications
Support for notification on the change of attribute value is vendor-specific.
### 4.3.10 _Link_
#### 4.3.10.1 Definition
This IOC is provided for sub-classing only. This IOC represents a
communication link or reference point between two network entities. The Link
IOC does not indicate whether the represented communication link or reference
point is a physical or logical entity.
For the subclasses of Link, the following rules apply:
1) The subclass names shall have the form "Link_\_\", where \ is a
string that represents the IOC at one end of the association related to the
particular Link subclass, and \ is a string that represents the IOC at the
other end of the association. For the order of the two strings, \ shall
come alphabetically before \.
2) In case \ and \ are YyyFunction IOCs (inheriting from ManagedFunction
and on first level below ManagedElement), the \ and \ strings shall have
the same form as the legal values of the managedElementType attribute (see
clause 4.5.1), e.g. "Auc". Otherwise \ and \ shall be the full IOC
names.
Thus, two valid examples of Link subclass names would be: **Link_As_Cscf** and
**Link_Mrfc_Mrfp.**
#### 4.3.10.2 Attributes
The Link IOC includes the attributes inherited from TopologicalLink_ (defined
in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8)
and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable isInvariant
isNotifyable userLabel M T T F T linkType O T F F T protocolVersion O T F F T
* * *
#### 4.3.10.3 Attribute constraints
* * *
Name Definition aEnd and zEnd (inherited from _TopologicalLink_ _) Support
Qualifier Condition: The property multiplicity is 1.
* * *
#### 4.3.10.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in subclause 4.5 are valid for this IOC,
without exceptions or additions
### 4.3.11 _EP_RP_
#### 4.3.11.1 Definition
This IOC is provided for sub-classing only. This IOC represents an end point
of a link used across a reference point between two network entities.
The detailed subclassed IOC, e.g. EP_X2, will be defined in E-UTRAN NRM IRP,
by inheriting from this EP_RP.
For naming the subclasses of **EP_RP** , the following rules shall apply:
\- The name of the subclassed IOC shall have the form "EP_\", where \
is a string that represents the name of the reference point.
Thus, two valid examples of EP_RP subclassed IOC names would be: EP_S1 and
EP_X2.
#### 4.3.11.2 Attributes
The EP_RP IOC includes the attributes inherited from Top_ (defined in TS
28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8) and

_This class does not support any notification._
### 4.3.12 MeasurementControl
#### 4.3.12.1 Definition
This IOC captures the properties of the file-based and stream-based delivery
methods.
The file-based delivery method has properties for the file location, the file
reporting period and the file-based GP. The stream-based delivery method has
properties for the stream target and the stream-based GP.
These properties are labelled as default (e.g. defaultFileBasedGP) in that
they will be ignored in case the same properties captured in MeasurementReader
are used.
Instance of this IOC shall not be created nor deleted by consumer. It shall be
created and deleted by the producer.
Depending on particular deployment context and agreement between operator and
vendor, the isWritable for all attributes could be 'F'.
#### 4.3.12.2 Attributes
The MeasurementControl IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *

#### 4.3.12.3 Attribute constraints
None.
#### 4.3.12.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions
### 4.3.13 MeasurementReader
#### 4.3.13.1 Definition
This IOC identifies the entity (derivatives of ManagedFunction) whose
Measurements are required by consumer to be produced and captured. The types
of Measurements required are identified by the attribute measurementTypes.
This IOC captures the properties of the two delivery methods for delivering
the Measurements.
The file-based delivery method has properties: fileLocation, reportingPeriod
and fileBasedGP. The stream-based delivery method has properties: streamTarget
and streamBasedGP.
The MeasurementControl also can capture the properties of the file-based and
stream-based delivery methods.
If the MeasurementReader instance's file-based delivery method has valid
properties, the file-based delivery method is used and the MeasurementControl
instance's file-based delivery method is ignored
If the MeasurementReader instance's stream-based delivery method has valid
properties, the stream-based delivery method is used and the
MeasurementControl instance's stream-based delivery is ignored.
A file-based and stream-based delivery methods can be active at the same time
for a MeasurementReader instance.
The activity of a MeasurementReader instance is independent of that of other
MeasurementReader instances.
This IOC uses attributes managedObjectDNs or managedObjectDNsBasic to identify
specific managed entities whose Measurements are required by consumer.
#### 4.3.13.2 Attributes
The MeasurementReader IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute name Support Qualifier isReadable isWritable **isInvariant**
isNotifyable measurementTypes M T T F F fileBasedGP O T T F F
fileReportingPeriod O T T F F fileLocation O T T F F streamBasedGP O T T F F

#### 4.3.13.3 Attribute constraints
* * *
Name Definition managedObjectDNsBasic, managedObjectDNs Support Qualifier
Condition: It shall be supported if the MeasurementReader is a subordinate of
SubNetwork or NetworkSliceSubnet. If both attributes contain information, the
information in managedObjectDNs is ignored.

#### 4.3.13.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions
### 4.3.14 Measurements \>
#### 4.3.14.1 Definition
This \> captures the Measurement types supported by its associated
IOC, i.e. ManagedFunction or ManagedElement or _EP_RP_. It also captures the
list of GPs supported, on per Measurement type. This \> indicates
a capability of the associated IOC and therefore its isWritable property is
False and its isInvariant property is False (since vendor product upgrade can
increase or decrease the number of supported Measurement types without the
need to deleting the older-version instance and creating a newer-version
instance.)
