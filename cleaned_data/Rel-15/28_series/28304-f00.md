# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 General
With regard to the control and monitoring of their Power, Energy and
Environmental (PEE) parameters, base stations can be of two different types:
# either they have built-in sensors, which communicate with DM through Type-1
interface. In turn, DM communicates with the NM-RMS (see figure 4.1.1);
# or they have external sensors, which communicate with the NM-RMS via:
\- either XCU/DGU (see figure 4.1.1)
\- or vendor-specific RMS (VS RMS) (see figure 4.1.1).
The NM-RMS collects PEE parameters from part or whole of the radio access
network and may also control PEE related parameters through either DM(s)
and/or XCU/DGU(s) and/or VS-RMS(s).
For this reason, it is beneficial to standardize the interface to control and
monitor PEE parameters between the NM-RMS on the one hand and DM, XCU/DGU and
VS-RMS on the other hand. This TS series specifies this Type-2 interface (see
TS 32.101 [2]).
Figure 4.1.1: Overall architecture for the control and monitoring of PEE
parameters
## 4.2 Architecture
The NM-RMS is a located in the NM layer (see also TS 32.101 [2]).
VS-RMS is located in the DM layer (see also TS 32.101 [2]).
XCU/DGU is located in the Network Element layer (see also TS 32.101 [2]).
Possible interfaces between all these entities are depicted in figure 4.1.1.
The three possible scenarios for this IRP are depicted in figures 4.2.1, 4.2.2
and 4.2.3.
Figure 4.2.1: NM-RMS to XCU/DGU Type-2 interface
Figure 4.2.2: NM-RMS to VS-RMS Type-2 interface
Figure 4.2.3: NM-RMS to EM/DM Type-2 interface
## 4.3 Functionality
Both DM, XCU/DGU and VS-RMS offer a capability allowing the NM-RMS to control
and monitor PEE parameters of one or more base stations. This TS series
specifies the information model exposed by the DM, XCU/DGU and VS-RMS to the
NM-RMS, and the operations enabling the control and monitoring of PEE
parameters from the NM-RMS.
This TS series describes two non-mutually exclusive solutions:
# Solution 1: based on existing 3GPP Interface IRPs to support controlling and
monitoring of PEE parameters of base stations with built-in sensors. This
solution may be used for the interface between DM and NM-RMS.
# Solution 2: describing simplified functionalities according to ETSI ES 202
336-1 [4] and ES 202 336-12 [3]. This solution may be used for the interfaces
between XCU/DGU and NM-RMS, between VS-RMS and NM-RMS and between DM and NM-
RMS.
Solution 1 is only applicable in case of scenario depicted in figure 4.2.3.
Solution 2 is applicable in case of all scenarios depicted by figures 4.2.1,
4.2.2 and 4.2.3.
