# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
TS 28.404: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Concepts, use
cases and requirements\";
**TS 28.405: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control and
configuration\";**
TS 28.406: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Information
definition and transport\".
One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience which is why the evaluation of the at UE side is vital to network
operators. This is especially true when the operators provide high bit rate
real-time services where even intermittent quality degradation are very
annoying, like streaming services (typically video services). Many of these
streaming services are a significant part of the commercial performance growth
rate, therefore the focus on the end users' experience.
Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at session level on one or more specific UE(s).
The capability to log information within an UE, and in particular the QoE of
an end user service, initiated by an operator, provides the operator with QoE
information. The collected information (specified in Ref. 3GPP TS 26.247 [2])
cannot be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.
The QoE information is information collected by the end user application in
the UE.
The QoE information is collected by the management system (e.g. an Operations
System (OS) in TMN terminology) for analysis and/or KPI calculations.
# 1 Scope
This clause shall start on a new page.
The present document addresses the mechanisms used for the function Quality of
Experience (QoE) measurement collection in UMTS and LTE.
The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area or an individual UE for a specified end user service/end user
service type. The document describes the activation and deactivation of a
network request session, UE request session and recording session and also the
reporting of recorded information [2].

# 4 Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection
The main text of the document should start here, after the above clauses have
been added.
The following styles and editing techniques are aimed to help in the
formatting of the document using the 3GPP Template: 3GPP_70.dot, available
from the 3GPP FTP site ([ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/Information]{.underline}).
Heading Styles
Heading styles are included in the 3GPP TS Template and are used as follows:
**Do not use any built-in automatic numbering** for 3GPP documents. Although
this is sometimes useful in the early drafting stages of a document, once the
document has been placed under change control, the clause numbering needs to
be fixed in order to keep cross-reference consistency as the 3GPP
specification set develops.
Heading 1: Used for Main clauses (1, 2, 3, etc.). Also used for Annex clauses
(A.1, A.2, etc.).
Heading 2: Used for Main clauses (4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, etc.). Also used for
Annex clauses (A.1.1, A.1.2, etc.).
Heading 3: Used for 2nd level clauses (4.1.1, 4.1.2, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, etc.). Also
used for Annex clauses (A.2.1.1, A.2.1.2, etc.).
Heading 4 & 5: Used for 3rd and 4th level clauses and Annex clauses.
Heading 6 & 7: Not used, instead use style \"H6\" so that the title appears in
the document, but does not appear in the Table of Contents.
Heading 8: Used for Main Annex titles in Specifications (3GPP TS) (e.g. Annex
A (normative): ).
Heading 9: Used for Main Annex titles in Reports (3GPP TR) (e.g. Annex A: ).
Other common styles
Normal: Used for main document text.
NO: Used for Notes in the text (Allows Tab and Indent). See example below.
NW: Same as NO, but Without line space after. Used when there are many notes
in sequence.
NOTE 1: This is an example of a note formatted in style NW. The style is
designed to allow space for note numbering and line wrap with a hanging
indent. There is no line space after.
NOTE 2: This is an example of a note formatted in style NO. The style is
designed to allow space for note numbering and line wrap with a hanging
indent. There is a line space after.
Bullet styles: The following bullet styles are provided.
B1: Bullet level 1 for main bullet points.
B2: Bullet level 2 for sub bullets.
B3-B5: for further sub bullets.
NOTE: Bullets are usually formatted manually, using a hyphen ( - ) or
alphanumeric identifiers: a), b), or 1), 2) etc. followed by a tab character.
**Automatic bullet features should not be used** as they may be lost if
template styles are re-applied later.
Table styles: **TAH** , **TAL** , **TAC** , **TAR** , **TAN** , for **TA** ble
**H** eaders, **L** eft justified, **C** entred, **R** ight justified and
**N** otes in tables: Style **TH** is used for the **T** able **H** eading
(title or caption). See example below.

Figure Styles: Figures and graphics are formatted with style \"**TH** \" which
keeps the figure with the following paragraph, usually the figure title. **F**
igure **T** itles (captions) are formatted with style \"**TF** \". See example
below.

## 4.1 _Management based activation_
### 4.1.1 Activation of measurement collection job in UTRAN
The parameters for the network request session are sent from the management
system to the RNCs that host the cells that are included in the collection nob
request in the activateAreaQoEJob operation [3]. For the duration of the
network request session, the RNC(s) checks for connections where the UE has
the QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services capability [4]. The QoE
Measurement Collection for streaming services capability is sent from the UE
to RNC (via the NB) in message UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION [4].
When a session is found that has an UE with the QoE Measurement Collection for
streaming services capability, the RNC starts a UE request session, assigns a
unique UE request session id [3] and sends a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message [4]
to the UE via the NB.
When the requested application is started in the UE, the XXXX part of the UE
sends a YYYY message to the application. The application assigns a Recording
session id and starts recording the requested information. The UE sends a ZZZZ
message to the RNC (via NB) informing the network that a recording session is
started. The network counts how many recording sessions are started per
network request session.
Editor's note: The XXXX, YYYY and ZZZZ need to be coordinated with other WGs.
### 4.1.2 Activation of measurement collection for a UE
### 4.1.3 Handling of measurement collection at handover
### 4.1.4 Deactivation of measurement collection job in UTRAN
#### 4.1.4.1 Pre-set time has elapsed
When the pre-set time is elapsed, the RNC sets the network request session to
ended, but do not delete the UE request session id and the Collection Entity
Address parameters [3], due to that reports still can come from the UE that
has to be transferred to the collection centre. The UE request session id and
the Collection Entity Address parameters [3] are deleted when the session is
ended.
#### 4.1.4.2 Forced deactivation
If the operator technician or the management application wants to deactivate a
measurement collection job before the pre-set time has expired, the management
system sends the deactivateQoEJob operation [3] to the RNC. The RNC sets the
network request session to ended, but does not delete the UE request session
id and the Collection Entity Address parameters [3], as the UE still may send
reports which shall be send to the collection centre. The UE request session
id and the Collection Entity Address parameters [3] are deleted when the
session is ended.
#### 4.1.4.3 Deactivation of recording session
Regardless of whether the pre-set time has elapsed or not, the recording
session continues to be active until the session for the application is ended.
### 4.1.5 Deactivation of measurement collection for a UE
## 4.2 _Signalling based activation_
### 4.2.1 Activation of measurement collection job
### 4.2.2 Activation of measurement collection for a UE
### 4.2.3 Handling of measurement collection at handover
### 4.2.4 Deactivation of measurement collection job
### 4.2.5 Deactivation of measurement collection for a UE
## 4.3 Reporting of collected data
# 5 Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement management parameters
_This first class of requirements is referenced to as business level
requirements. A subject matter expert shall be able to determine that the
requirements adequately represent the needs of the management problem being
solved, described on a high level, related to the business cases for the
operators._
## 5.1 _Parameter 1_
## 5.2 _Parameter 2_
###### ## Annex \ (normative): \
Annexes are only to be used where appropriate:
###### ## Annex \ (informative): \
