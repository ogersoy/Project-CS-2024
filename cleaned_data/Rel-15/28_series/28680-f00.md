# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 Overview
The architecture for management of WLAN AP is conformant to the Management
reference model as defined in Figure 1 of TS 32.101 [2] where the WLAN AP is
depicted as NE. The system context of the WLAN management is in compliance
with the System Context A, defined in Figure 4.7.1 in TS 32.150 [3].
## 4.2 Mapping Function
Figure 4.2-1 provides an example of 3GPP -- WLAN mapping function. The mapping
function is to map the relevant management data produced by WLAN AP in a form
suitable for distribution via the Type-2 interface to IRPManager(s). The
mapping function is a logical function. Its location, as well as its internal
and external interfaces, if any, are out the scope of 3GPP specification.

## 4.3 WLAN alarm notification
WLAN AP alarms can be generated from ifOperStatus (RFC 2863 [4]) object. The
following examples extracted from RFC 3877 [6] shows that the WLAN AP embeds
the ifOperStatus object in the linkUp/linkDown notifications to report the
WLAN AP alarms.

WLAN AP will send a notification when ifOperStatus object changes its value.
The value of ifOperStatus object is shown below (see RFC 2863 [4]).
ifOperStatus OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX INTEGER {
up(1), -- ready to pass packets
down(2),
testing(3), -- in some test mode
unknown(4), -- status can not be determined
\-- for some reason.
dormant(5),
notPresent(6), -- some component is missing
lowerLayerDown(7) -- down due to state of
\-- lower-layer interface(s)
}
MAX-ACCESS read-only
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
\"The current operational state of the interface. The
testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus
should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1)
then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is
ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should
change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for
external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an
incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state
if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going
to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6)
state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware)
components.\"
::= { ifEntry 8 }
The following tables show that IRPAgent, together with the mapping function
will map the IETF alarm notification attributes for down(2) and up(1) to the
3GPP alarm parameters as defined in TS 32.111-2 [5]. For each table, it also
includes the example of on what conditions the 3GPP alarm notification will be
sent.
