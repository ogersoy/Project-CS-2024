Model (NRM); Stage 2 and stage 3.**
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Information Model and Solution Set for the
Network Resource Model (NRM) definitions of NR, NG-RAN, 5G Core Network (5GC)
and network slice, to fulfil the requirements identified in 3GPP TS 28.540
[10].
The Information Model defines the semantics and behaviour of information
object class attributes and relations visible on the management interfaces in
a protocol and technology neutral way. And Solution Set defines one or more
solution set(s) with specific protocol(s) according to the Information Model
definitions.

### 4.2.1 Class diagram for gNB and en-gNB
#### 4.2.1.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of classes (e.g. IOCs) that encapsulates the
information relevant for this gNB and en-gNB. For the UML semantics, see 3GPP
TS 32.156 [43]. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these classes.
The models are for the management of gNB and en-gNB for all NG-RAN deployment
scenarios as listed below.
\- Non-split NG-RAN deployment scenario, represents the gNB defined in TS
38.401[4].
\- 2-split NG-RAN deployment scenario, represents the gNB consist of a gNB-CU
and gNB-DU defined in TS 38.401[4] clause 6.1.1.
\- 3-split NG-RAN deployment scenario, represents the gNB consist of gNB-CU-
CP, gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU defined in TS 38.401[4] clause 6.1.2.

Figure 4.2.1.1-5: Cell Relation view for all deployment scenarios
Note: The above NRM fragment uses NRNetwork to hold NR external entities and
frequency and using EUtraNetwork to hold LTE external entities and frequency.
The NRNetwork and EUtraNetwork are subclasses of SubNetwork (defined in TS
28.622 [30]) with no additional attributes. The reason using NRNetwork and
EUtraNetwork is for a clean separation of NR external entities and frequency
and LTE external entities and frequency.

### 4.3.5 NRCellDU
#### 4.3.5.1 Definition
This IOC represents the part of NR cell information that describes the
specific resources instances.
An NR cell transmits SS/PBCH block and always requires downlink transmission
at a certain carrier frequency with a certain channel bandwidth. Transmission
may be performed from multiple sector-carriers using different transmission
points, and these may be configured with different carrier frequencies and
channel bandwidths, as long as they are aligned to the cell\'s downlink
resource grids as defined in subclause 4.4 in TS 38.211 [32]. The values of
arfcnDL and bSChannelBwDL attributes define the resource grids which each
sector-carrier needs to be aligned to. See subclauses 5.3 and 5.4.2 of TS
38.104 for definitions of BS channel bandwidth and NR-ARFCN, respectively.
An NR cell requires an uplink in order to provide initial access. In case of
TDD, the values of arfcnUL and bSChannelBwUL have to always be set to the same
values as for the corresponding DL attributes. For both FDD and TDD, the
arfcnUL and bSChannelBwUL define uplink resource grids to which each sector-
carrier needs to align to.
An NR cell can in addition be configured with a supplementary uplink, which
has its own arfcnSUL and bSChannelBwSUL, which define resource grids for
supplementary uplink sector-carriers.
Each of downlink, uplink and supplementary uplink (if configured) need an
initial bandwidth part (BWP), which defines resources to be used by UEs during
and immediately after initial access. Additional BWPs can be either configured
or calculated by gNB internally and be applied to UEs dynamically by gNB based
on e.g. UE capability and bandwidth need of each UE.
NOTE: The S-NSSAI(s) in the S-NSSAIList are common to all PLMNs listed in the
pLMNIdList attribute for the NRCellDU.
#### 4.3.5.2 Attributes

### 4.3.6 NRSectorCarrier
#### 4.3.6.1 Definition
This \>NRSectorCarrier represents the resources of each transmission
point included in the cell. These in general have different physical locations
(of the antennae), and possibly different frequencies or bandwidths. The UE is
not directly aware of which NRSectorCarrier resources the network uses for its
connection.
An NR sector-carrier can have downlink, uplink or both **_as specified by
txDirection_. _Attributes related to unavailable direction (DL or UL) shall
not be set_.**
Additional NRSectorCarriers not directly associated to one cell only can also
be configured.
If a value of arfcnDL, arfcnUL, bSChannelBwDL or bSChannelBwUL can be derived
unambiguously from the referring cell, then that attribute needs not be
present. That will not be possible if the NRSectorCarrier is used for
supplementary uplink, if it is not directly associated to a cell, or if the
sector-carrier uses only a part of the cell\'s channel bandwidth. Thus, at
least in those cases the applicable attributes have to be present and their
values need to be set.
#### 4.3.6.2 Attributes
The NRSectorCarrier IOC includes attributes inherited from ManagedFunction IOC
(defined in TS 28.622[30]) and the following attributes:

### 4.3.36 RRMPolicyRatio2 \>
#### 4.3.36.1 Definition
This \> represents the properties of RRMPolicyRatio2. The RRM
policy setting the ratios for the split of the Radio resources between the
supported S-NSSALists. in average over time. RRMPolicyRation2 is a list and
each item of the list has seven attributes. Four of them specify the
percentage of radio resources to be allocated to the corresponding sNSSAIList.
The attribute rRMPolicyMaxRatio defines the maximum resource limitation for
the sNSSAIList. The attribute rRMPolicyMarginMaxRatio defines the safety
margin that allows for maximum float limit use with other sNSSAIs borrowing
free resources while keeping safety margin to ensure that resources are
available for quota specific sNSSAIList. The attribute rRMPolicyMinRatio
defines the minimum resource limitation for the sNSSAIList. The attribute
rRMPolicyMarginMinRatio defines the safety margin that allows for minimum
float limit use with other sNSSAIs borrowing free resources while keeping
safety margin to ensure that resources are available for quota specific
sNSSAIList.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Cell state handling
# A.1 Relation between the administrative state and the \"Pre-operation state
of the gNB-DU Cell\"
The administrative state indicates the permission to use or prohibition
against using the cell, imposed through the OAM services. The administrative
state has three values: \"LOCKED\", \"SHUTTING DOWN\" or \"UNLOCKED\"
The meanings of these values are defined in ITU‑T Recommendation X.731 [18].
The relation between the administrative state and the \"Pre-operation state of
the gNB-DU Cell\" is defined in subclause 8.5 of TS 38.401 [4]. See below an
extract from subclause 8.5 of TS 38.401 [4] on the F1 startup and cell
activation.
If the operationalState is \"ENABLED\" (i.e. the resource is physically
installed and working) and if the administrativeState is \"UNLOCKED\", the
step \"0: Pre-operational state\" will exit and the step \"1: F1 Setup
Request\" will be executed.\"
8.5 F1 Startup and cells activation
This function allows to setup the F1 interface between a gNB-DU and a gNB-CU
and it allows to activate the gNB-DU cells.

Figure A.2-1: Combined gNB cell state diagram
The gNB-DU maintains cell states. The following table is the gNB cell state
transition table.
In 3-split and 2-split deployment scenarios, the interactions between gNB-CU
and gNB-DU are standardized. The interactions specified under the column \"The
state transition events and actions\" of \"The gNB Cell state transition
table\" below shall be present for the state transition.
In the non-split deployment scenarios, the interactions between gNB-CU and
gNB-DU are not standardized. The interactions between gNB-CU and gNB-DU
specified under the column \"The state transition events and actions\" of
\"The gNB Cell state transition table\" can be replaced by other means that is
not standardized.

###### ## Annex B (normative): NSI and NSSI state handling
# B.1 NSI state handling
A NetworkSlice instance (NSI) is a logical object in the management system
that represents a complex grouping of resources that may be in various states.
At any time, the management system needs to know the state of an NSI.
The ITU-T X.731 [18], to which [17] refers, has defined the inter-relation
between the administrative state and operational state and usage state of
systems in general.
Figure B.1: Combined NSI state diagram
The interactions specified under the column \"The state transition events and
actions\" of \"NSI state transition table\" below shall be present for the
state transition.

###### ## Annex C (normative): XML definitions for NR NRM
# C.1 General
This annex contains the XML definitions for the NR and NG-RAN NRM, in
accordance with NR and NG-RAN NRM Information Model definitions specified in
clause 4.
# C.2 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of NR NRM information model is specified in
clause 4, this clause specifies features that are specific to the Schema
definitions.
The XML definitions of the present document specify the schema for a
configuration content, which can be included in a configuration file for Bulk
configuration management operations
# C.3 Mapping
## C.3.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the
Information Model. An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding
IOC\'s XML element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the
attribute\'s name in the Information Model.
## C.3.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of the present document.
# C.4 Solution Set definitions
## C.4.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [33].
The present document defines the NRM-specific XML schema nrNrm.xsd for the NR
NRM Information Model defined in clause 4.
XML schema nrNrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types for
the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [33].
## C.4.2 Graphical representation
The graphical representation is not present in the current version of the
present document.

# E.6 Graphical representation
See the H.6 for the YANG module tree diagram for NR and NG-RAN NRM.
# E.7 Mount information
If the class ManagedElement and the underlying hierarchy is contained under a
SubNetwork all YANG modules containing IOCs that can be contained under the
ManagedElement directly or under other IOCs contained by the ManagedElement
and the YANG module for ManagedElement itself shall be mounted at the
mountpoint \"children-of-SubNetwork\" in the YANG module _3gpp-common-
subnetwork.
See IETF RFC 8528 [47] that describes the mechanism that adds the schema trees
defined by a set of YANG modules onto a mount point defined in the schema tree
in another YANG module.
###### ## Annex F (normative): XML definitions for 5GC NRM
# F.1 General
This annex contains the XML definitions for the 5GC NRM specified in clause 5,
in accordance with 5G NRM Information Model definitions specified in clause 4.
# F.2 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of 5GC NRM information model is specified in
clause 4, this clause specifies features that are specific to the Schema
definitions.
The XML definitions of the present document specify the schema for a
configuration content, which can be included in a configuration file for Bulk
configuration management operations.
# F.3 Mapping
## F.3.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the
Information Model. An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding
IOC\'s XML element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the
attribute\'s name in the Information Model.
## F.3.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of the present document.
# F.4 Solution Set definitions
## F.4.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [33].
The present document defines the NRM-specific XML schema ngcNrm.xsd for the
5GC NRM Information Model defined in clause 4.
XML schema ngcNrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types for
the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [33].
## F.4.2 Graphical representation
The graphical representation is not present in the current version of the
present document.
## F.4.3 XML schema \"ngcNrm.xsd\"

# H.7 Mount information
If the class ManagedElement and the underlying hierarchy is contained under a
SubNetwork all YANG modules containing IOCs that can be contained under the
ManagedElement directly or under other IOCs contained by the ManagedElement
and the YANG module for ManagedElement itself shall be mounted at the
mountpoint \"children-of-SubNetwork\" in the YANG module _3gpp-common-
subnetwork.
See IETF RFC 8528 [47] that describes the mechanism that adds the schema trees
defined by a set of YANG modules onto a mount point defined in the schema tree
in another YANG module.
###### ## Annex I (normative): XML definitions for network slice
# I.1 General
This annex contains the XML definitions for the network slice NRM, in
accordance with network slice NRM Information Model definitions specified in
clause 6.
# I.2 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of network slice information model is
specified in clause 6, this clause specifies features that are specific to the
Schema definitions.
The XML definitions of the present document specify the schema for a
configuration content, which can be included in a configuration file for Bulk
configuration management operations.
# I.3 Mapping
## I.3.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the
Information Model. An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding
IOC\'s XML element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the
attribute\'s name in the Information Model.
## I.3.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of the present document.
# I.4 Solution Set (SS) definitions
## I.4.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [33].
This annex defines the NRM-specific XML schema sliceNrm.xsd for the network
slice Information Model defined in clause 6.
XML schema sliceNrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types for
the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [33].
## I.4.2 Graphical representation
The graphical representation is not present in the current version of the
present document.
