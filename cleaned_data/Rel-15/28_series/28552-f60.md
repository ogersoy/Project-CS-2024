# 1 Scope
This document specifies the performance measurements for 5G networks including
network slicing. Performance measurements for NG-RAN (clause 5.1) as well as
for 5GC (clause 5.2 to 5.6) are defined in this document. Related KPIs are
defined to those measurements in TS 28.554 [8].
The performance measurements for NG-RAN applies also to NR option 3 in many
cases, but not to the RRC connection related measurements which are handled by
E-UTRAN for NR option 3 (those are measured according to TS 32.425 [9] and
related KPIs in TS 32.451 [10]).
The performance measurements are defined based on the measurement template as
described in TS 32.404 [3].

# 3 Definitions, abbreviations and measurement family
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**IP Latency:** the time it takes to transfer a first/initial packet in a data
burst from one point to another.
**Mapped 5QI:** In case when a single 5QI is assigned to the DRB, the mapped
5QI refers to the 5QI that is used for a DRB within the gNB.
NOTE 1: In this case the mapped 5QI is used for separating certain
measurements per QoS class.
NOTE 2: Individual QoS flows into a common 5QI is specified in TS 38.473 [6].
**Packet Delay:** the time it takes to transfer any packet from one point to
another.
**Packet Drop Rate:** share of packets that were not sent to the target due to
congestion or traffic management and should be seen as a part of the packet
loss rate.
**Packet Loss Rate:** share of packets that could not be received by the
target including packets droped, packets lost in transmission and packets
received in wrong format.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements
# A.1 Monitoring of UL and DL user plane latency in NG-RAN
Satisfying low latency expectations for 5G services, such as URLLC, is one of
the key tasks for the operator to meet service performance expectations. As
the performance in UL and DL differs, it is important for operators to be able
to monitor the UL and DL user plane latencies separately. With performance
measurements allowing the operator to obtain or derive the UL and DL user
plane latency information separately, the operators can pinpoint the services
performance problems to specific problems in UL or DL.
The DL IP latency monitoring in NG-RAN refers to the transmission within gNB
of IP packets arriving when there is no other prior data to be transmitted to
the same UE in the gNB.
To further pinpoint performance problem detected, separate counters may be
provided per mapped 5QI (which are particularly useful when the mapped 5QI is
used by few services and users and the packet size does not vary much).
# A.2 Monitoring of UL and DL packet loss in NG-RAN
Keeping track of UL and DL packet loss in the NG-RAN is essential, since for
certain services packets that are lost along the way through the system may
have a noticeable impact on the end user. UL and DL packet loss measurements
can be useful for evaluation, optimization and for performance assurance
within the integrity area (user plane connection quality).
UL packet loss is a measure of packets dropped in the UE and the packets lost
on the interfaces (air interface and F1-U interface). If parts of the gNB are
deployed in a virtualized environment, it is important to measure also the
F1-U UL interface packet loss in a separate measurement, to be able to
pinpoint the reason for high packet loss.
# A.3 Monitoring of DL packet drop in NG-RAN
Keeping track of DL packet drops in the NG-RAN is essential, since for certain
services packets that are dropped along the way through the system may have a
noticeable impact on the end user. DL packet drop measurements can be useful
for evaluation, optimization and for performance assurance of the network.
For gNBs that are deployed in a split architecture, e.g. when parts of a gNB
are deployed in a virtualized environment, the DL packet drops may occur in
two parts; the gNB CU-UP and the gNB DU. Therefore, it is important to measure
this separately.
# A.4 Monitoring of UL and DL user plane delay in NG-RAN
Satisfying low packet delay is of prime concern for some services,
particularly conversational services like speech and instant messaging. As the
performance in UL and DL differs, it is important for operators to be able to
monitor the UL and DL user plane delay separately. With performance
measurements allowing the operator to obtain or derive the UL and DL user
plane delay information separately, the operators can pinpoint the services
performance problems to specific problems in UL or DL.
The DL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the average delay of any packet
within NG-RAN, including air interface delay until the UE receives the packet.
A gNB deployed in a split architecture, the user plane delay will occur in
gNB-CU-UP, on the F1 interface, in gNB-DU and on the air interface. Therefore,
four gNB related delay measurements needs to be monitored for the DL delay to
pinpoint where end user impact from packet delay occurs.
To further pinpoint a detected delay performance problem, the packet delay
measurement separation may be based on mapped 5QI (or for QCI in case of NR
option 3).
# A.5 Monitoring of UE Context Release Request (gNB-DU initiated)
In order to monitor the stability of the network and detect the
service/connection interruption caused by NGRAN, monitoring the UE Context
Release Request initiated by gNB-DU is an effective method. Collecting the
measurement information of the message and analysing the releasing cause
conveyed in the message, operators could detect the stability of NG-RAN, and
could decide a specific means to improve the NG-RAN performance.
# A.6 Monitoring of physical radio resource utilization
The physical radio resource utilization measurements could provide operators
the load information of the radio network during the measurement time period.
The physical radio resource utilization measurements should reflect the
average usage and the usage distribution of the radio resource of the physical
layer. The measurements can make the operator to be aware of whether a cell
has ever experienced high load or not in the monitoring period, and is a key
input to network capacity planning and load balancing.
# A.7 Monitoring of RRC connection number
The number of the users in RRC connected and inactive mode need to be
monitored as it reflects the load of the radio network, the operators can use
this information for dynamic frequency resource allocation or load balance
purpose. Moreover, it is an important factor to be evaluated in the radio
network capacity enhancement decision-making.
# A.8 Monitoring of UE Context Release
In order to monitor the stability of the network and detect the
service/connection interruption caused by NG-RAN, monitoring the UE Context
Release Request initiated by gNB-DU and UE Context Release Command initiated
by gNB-CU is an effective method. Collecting the measurement information of
the message and analysing the releasing cause conveyed in the message,
operators could detect the stability of NG-RAN, and could decide a specific
means to improve the NG-RAN performance.
# A.9 Monitoring of UE Throughput in NG-RAN
Keeping track of UL and DL UE throughput in the NG-RAN is essential, to ensure
end user satisfaction and well-functioning and well configured cells and
scheduling features.
The restricted UE throughput per mapped 5QI will show the scheduling
efficiency and QoS priority handling in the gNB and the ratio between
unrestricted and restricted volume will show the gNB ability to handle small
data transfers efficiently.
To be able to monitor the spread of throughput within the cell, and estimate
the ratio of satisfied users, the throughput distribution measurement can be
used.
When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple NSIs may be
supported. The UL and DL UE throughput for each NSI is then of importance to
the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.
# A.10 Monitoring of Unrestricted volume in NG-RAN
Measuring the share of unrestricted user data volume in the NG-RAN is
important, to show the gNB ability to handle small data transfers efficiently
and to see how large share of the volume that is part of the UE throughput
measurement. It is not meaningful to measure throughput for data transfers so
small that they fit in one single slot but it is still important to know how
much such transfers can be handled by the gNB.
When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple NSIs may be
supported. The share of unrestricted volume for each NSI is then of importance
to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.
# A.11 N3 data volume related measurements
N3 related measurements are used to measure data volume on N3 interface
including incoming and outgoing of GTP data packets without counting the
mandatory part of the GTP-U header
It is useful to analyse transport bandwidth usage of N3 interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed, or
load balance should be considered according to core network dimension if there
are multiple UPFs connected to multiple gNodeBs.
So it is necessary to define N3 related measurements.
# A.12 N6 related measurements
N6 related measurements are used to measure data volume on N6 interface
including incoming and outgoing of IP data packets.
It is useful to analyse transport bandwidth usage of N6 interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed.
So it is necessary to define N6 related measurements.
# A.13 Registration related measurements
A UE needs to register with the 5GS to get authorization to receive services,
to enable mobility tracking and to enable reachability. The following
registration types are defined:
\- Initial Registration to the 5GS;
\- Mobility Registration Update (upon changing to a new Tracking Area (TA)
outside the UE\'s Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state, or
when the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol parameters that are
negotiated in Registration procedure with or without changing to a new TA);
\- Periodic Registration Update (due to a predefined time period of
inactivity); and
\- Emergency Registration (i.e. the UE is in limited service state).
The performance of registration for each registration type needs to be
monitored by the operator since it is relevant to whether the end user can use
the service of 5GS or a specific network slice.
# A.14 PDU session establishment related measurements
The PDU session establishment is one of essential procedures for 5G network.
The performance of PDU session establishment directly impacts the QoS of the
network and the QoE of the end users. Therefore, the performance measurements
are needed to reflect the performance of the PDU session establishment.
The number and success rate of PDU session creations, the number of PDU
sessions running on the SMF are some of the basic performance measurements to
monitor the performance of the PDU session establishment. And the performance
measurements of failed PDU session creations are helpful to solve the network
issues in case the performance is below the expectation.
# A.15 Policy association related measurements
To ensure the UE properly use the services provided by 5GS, the UE needs to be
associated with a policy. The policies are categorized into AM policy and SM
policy, and are executed by AMF and SMF respectively. Both kinds of policies
are provisioned by PCF.
The AM policy association needs to be established in case the UE initially
registers to the network or the UE needs the AMF re-allocation.
The SM policy association needs to be established when the UE requests a PDU
Session Establishment.
The policy association establishment is the essential steps allowing the UE to
be served by the 5GS under the designed policies, therefore it needs to be
monitored.
