# 4 General
## 4.1 Overview
5G system consists of 5G Access Network (AN), 5G Core Network (5GC). Network
slicing is one of 5G key features.
The management aspects of a Network Slice Instance (NSI) are described by the
four phases shown in Figure 4.3.1.1 of TS 28.530 [4].
The provisioning of network slicing includes the four phases which are
preparation, commissioning, operation and decommissioning:
\- In the preparation phase the NSI does not exist. The preparation phase
includes network slice design, on-boarding, evaluation of the network slice
requirements, preparing the network environment and other necessary
preparations required to be done before the creation of an NSI.
\- During the NSI lifecycle stage which include commissioning phase, operation
phase and decommissioning phase, the NSI provisioning operations include:
\- Create an NSI;
\- Activate an NSI;
\- Deactivate an NSI;
\- Modify an NSI;
\- Terminate an NSI.
The operations of the provisioning of an NSI occurs during different phases of
a NSI:
a) During the commissioning phase:
\- Create an NSI.
> During NSI creation all resources to the NSI have been created and
> configured to satisfy the network slice requirements. NSI creation may
> trigger NSSI(s) creation or using existing NSSI(s) and setting up the
> corresponding associations.
b) During the operation phase:
\- Activate an NSI;
\- Modify an NSI;
\- Deactivate an NSI.
NSI activation includes any actions that make the NSI active to provide
communication services. NSI activation may trigger NSSI activation.
NSI modification in operation phase could map to several workflows, e.g.
changes of NSI capacity, changes of NSI topology, NSI reconfiguration. NSI
modification can be triggered by receiving new network slice related
requirements, new communication service requirements, or the result of NSI
supervision automatically. NSI modification may trigger NSSI modification.
The NSI deactivation operation may be needed before NSI modification operation
and the NSI activation operation may be needed after the NSI modification
operation. NSI deactivation includes any actions that make the NSI inactive
and not providing any communication services. NSI deactivation trigger NSSI
deactivation to deactivate constituent NSSI(s) which is not used by other
NSI(s). Operator may decide to keep the NSI without termination after
deactivation and reactivate it when receives new communication service
request.
c) During the decommissioning phase:
\- Terminate an NSI.
> NSI termination step includes any action that make the NSI does not exist
> anymore and release resources that are not used by other NSI(s). NSI
> termination may trigger NSSI termination to terminate constituent NSSI(s)
> which is not used by other NSI(s).
Similarly, provisioning for network slice subnet instance includes the
following operations:
\- Create an NSSI;
\- Activate an NSSI and associate it with certain NSI to be used by the NSI;
\- Disassociate the NSSI with certain NSI and deactivate the NSSI if it's not
associated with any NSI;
\- Modify an NSSI;
\- Terminate an NSSI.
The following are NSSI states:
**NSSI_NULL** \-- the NSSI does not exist
**NSSI_NOT_IN_USE** \-- the NSSI exists, but is not used by (associated with)
any NSI or NSSI
**NSSI_IN_USE** \-- the NSSI is used by (associated with) at least one NSI or
at least one NSSI
The following is the state diagram:
Figure 4.1-1
## 4.2 Configuration information for the constituents of an NSI
To use network slice to support communication service or deliver a network
slice as a service, the 3GPP defined constituents of the NSI should be
configured by 3GPP management system according to the types and requirements
of the network slice so that the NSI can be operated and maintained.
The configuration information of these components may include:
_\- Information on the requirements to be applied to every NSI constituent to
satisfy the requirements of multiple NSIs_ if the constituent is shared by
multiple NSIs;
_\- Network function selection information:_ Information on the selection of
the NFs (e.g., AMF) according to the requirements of this NSI;
_\- Connection information_ : _The information of the logical links to carry
the NSI's CP and UP data between the component and other NFs and NSSIs
belonging to the NSI._
NOTE 1: The list of information above is not exhaustive.
NOTE 2: The list of information above is not all necessary for an NSI.
## 4.3 General information for network slice instance
The general information used to describe network slice instance may include:
\- Resource model information, which describes the static parameters and
functional components of network slice, includes service profile, network
slice type (e.g. eMBB), additional system feature (e.g. multicast, Edge
Computing), priority.
\- Management model information, which describes the information model that is
used for network slice lifecycle management, includes configuration profile
(e.g. application configuration parameters).
\- Capability model information, which describes the capability including
supported communication service characteristic information (e.g. service type,
UE mobility level, density of users, traffic density), QoS attributes (e.g.
bandwidth, latency, throughput and so on) and capacity (e.g. maximum number of
UEs), can be exposed to CSC via CSMF.
## 4.4 General information for network slice subnet instance
The general information used to describe network slice subnet instance may
include:
\- Resource model information, which describes the static parameters and
functional component of network slice subnet, includes slice profile, network
slice subnet type (e.g. RAN eMBB, CN eMBB), additional system feature (e.g.
multicast, Edge Computing), priority, QoS attributes (e.g. bandwidth, latency,
number of subscribers and so on), NSD ID.
\- Management model information, which describes the information model that is
used for network slice subnet lifecycle management, includes configuration
profile (e.g. application configuration parameters).
\- Capability model information, which describes the capability including
supported communication service characteristic information (e.g. service type,
UE mobility level, density of users, traffic density), QoS attributes (e.g.
bandwidth, latency, throughput and so on) and capacity (e.g. maximum number of
UEs).
## 4.5 General information for service profile
Depending on industry requirements and operator's design requirements,
different service profiles may be used to represent SLS associated with
instances of Network Slice IOC.
The following are examples for service profile:
\- A service profile is used to capture a set of requirements for the new
network slice instance such as (i.e. eMBB, MIoT, URLLC).
\- A service profile is used to capture a set of specific industry
requirements for creation of network slice instance such as (e.g. V2X, smart
grid, Remote Healthcare).
## 4.6 General information for network slice related identifiers
There are following network slice related identifiers which serve different
purposes:
* * *
**Identifier** **Description** **Identifiers for network slice management
purpose**  
NetworkSlice identifier Represent the management identifier of network slice
instance. Management identifier of network slice instance is defined in TS
28.541[6] as objectinstance attribute of NetworkSlice IOC. NetworkSliceSubnet
identifier Represent the management identifier for a network slice subnet
instance. Management identifier of network slice subnet instance is defined in
TS 28.541[6] as objectinstance attribute of NetworkSliceSubnet IOC.
**Identifiers for network slice selection purpose**  
NSI ID Represent Core Network part of a Network Slice instance when multiple
Network Slice instances of the same Network Slice are deployed, and there is a
need to differentiate between them in the 5GC. Referred to TS 23.501[9].
S-NSSAI Represent network slice. Referred to TS 23.501[9] and TS 38.300[10].

### 5.1.1 Network slice instance allocation
* * *
Use case stage Evolution/Specification \>\ Related use
**Goal** To satisfy request for allocation of a network slice instance with
certain characteristics, by creation of new or using existing network slice
instance.
**Actors and Roles** CSMF, who acts as an example of network slice management
service consumer.\  
NOP operator
**Telecom resources** Network slice instance\  
Network slice subnet instance\  
Transport network\  
NSMF, who acts as an example of network slice management service provider.\  
NSSMF, who acts as an example of network slice subnet management service
provider.
**Assumptions** N/A
**Pre-conditions** N/A
**Begins when** NSMF receives the request for allocation of the network slice
instance with network slice related requirements.
**Step 1 (M)** If the requested NSI can be shared and if an existing NSI can
be used, the NSMF decides to use the existing NSI.\  
Modification of the existing NSI may be needed to satisfy the network slice
instance related requirements. Use case is completed go to "Step 8\".\  
Otherwise, the NSMF triggers to create a new NSI, for which the following
steps 2 -- 8 are needed.
**Step 2 (M)** NSMF decides on the constituent NSSIs and the topology of the
NSI to be created using the information from service profile [6]. For the
constituent NSSIs, the NSMF derives network slice subnet related requirements
from the network slice related requirements. If reconfiguration of the
transport network is needed, the NSMF derives transport network related
requirements (e.g., latency, bandwidth) from the network slice related
requirements.
**Step 3 (M)** For the required NSSI(s), the NSMF sends network slice subnet
related requirements to the NSSMF to request allocation of the required
NSSI(s). Network slice subnet instance allocation use case
**Step 4 (M)** NSMF receives the information of the allocated NSSI(s) (e.g,
the management identifier of NSSI, service access point information of NSSI,
external connection point information of NSSI) from NSSMF.
**Step 5 (M)** NSMF, via NSSMF, sends the transport network related
requirements (e.g. , external connection point, latency and bandwidth) to the
TN Manager. The TN manager reconfigures the TN accordingly and responds to the
NSMF via NSSMF.
**Step 6 (M)** NSMF receives the response from TN Manager via NSSMF.
**Step 7 (M)** NSMF associates the NSSI(s) with the corresponding NSI (e.g,
allocation of the management identifier of NSI and mapping the management
identifier of NSI with the received management Identifier of NSSI(s)) and
triggers to establish the links between the service access points of the
NSSI(s).
**Step 8 (M)** NSMF notifies the network slice instance information of NSI
(e.g., the management identifier of NSI).
**Ends when** All the steps identified above are successfully completed.
**Exceptions** One of the steps identified above fails.
**Post-conditions** An NSI is ready to satisfy the network slice related
requirements.

* * *
Use case stage Evolution/Specification \>\ Related use
**Goal** To check the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet to
determine whether network slice subnet requirements can be satisfied at a
particular point of time (e.g., in terms of resources)
**Actors and Roles** Network slice subnet management service consumer. For
example, when a network slice subnet instance is to be provided as a
constituent of a network slice instance.
**Telecom resources** Network slice subnet instance\  
Network slice management service provider. For example, a management function
that plays the role of network slice management service provider.
**Assumptions** Network slice subnet management service consumer has decided
to check the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet based on, for
example, internal decision or to facilitate an external service requests.
**Pre-conditions** Network slice subnet requirements have been derived or
received by network slice subnet management service consumer.
**Begins when** Network slice subnet management service provider receives the
request to evaluate the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet
according to the network slice requirements at a particular point in time.
**Step 1 (M)** Network slice subnet management service provider identifies the
network slice subnets constituents according to the requirements, e.g.,
network services to be requested from MANO.
**Step 2 (O)** For the purpose of checking the feasibility of provisioning a
network slice subnet(s) of the network slice instance, network slice subnet
management service provider(s) may obtain information from the network (e.g.,
current or predicted load level information, current or predicted resource
usage information from management data analytics services).
**Step 3 (M)** Network slice subnet management service provider sends
enquiries with reservation requests to other management providers (e.g., MANO)
to determine availability of network constituents, e.g., network services,
network functions. If some of the responses are negative, network slice subnet
management service provider may send enquiries to different management
providers.
**Ends when** Feasibility check results have been provided to network slice
subnet management service consumer.
**Exceptions** One of the mandatory steps fails.

# 7 Provisioning procedures of networks and network slicing
## 7.1 General
The procedures of provisioning of 5G networks are listed in this following
subclauses.
## 7.2 Procedure of Network Slice Instance Allocation
The Figure 7.2-1 illustrates the procedure of creating a new NSI or using an
existing NSI to satisfy the required network slice related requirements.
{width="5.767361111111111in" height="5.999305555555556in"}
Figure 7.2-1: Network Slice Instance Allocation Request procedure
1) Network Slice Management Service Provider (NSMS_Provider) receives an
AllocateNsi request (see AllocateNsi operation defined in clause 6.5.1) from
Network Slice Management Service Consumer (NSMS_Consumer) with network slice
related requirements (the network slice related requirements are defined as
the attributes in the ServiceProfile see clause 6.3.3 in TS 28.541[6]).
2) Based on the network slice related requirements, the NSMS_Provider decides
whether to use an existing NSI or create a new NSI. If the network slice
related requirements allow the requested NSI to be shared and if an existing
suitable NSI can be reused, the NSMS_Provider may decide to use the existing
NSI.
3a) If using an existing NSI and the existing NSI needs to be modified to
satisfy the network slice related requirements, the NSMS_Provider invokes the
procedure to modify the existing NSI as described in clause 7.6.
3b-1) If creating a new NSI, the NSMS_Provider derives the network slice
subnet related requirements from the received network slice related
requirements. Before NSMS_Provider derives the network slice subnet related
requirements, NSMS_Provider may invoke corresponding network slice subnet
capability information querying procedure as described in clause 7.8.
3b-2) The NSMS_Provider invokes the NSSI allocation procedure as described in
clause 7.3.
3b-3) The NSMS_Provider creates the MOI for NSI and configures the MOI with
the DN of MOI for the NSSI, other configuration information may be configured
for the created MOI.
Note: The detailed configuration information is described in network slice NRM
(see NetworkSlice IOC defined in clause 6.3.1 in TS 28.541 [6]).
4) The NSMS_Provider sends NSI allocation result (see AllocateNsi operation
defined in clause 6.5.1) to the NSMS_Consumer. If an existing NSI is modified
or a new NSI is created successfully to satisfy the network slice related
requirements, the result includes the relevant network slice instance
information (see NetworkSlice IOC defined in clause 6.3.1 in TS 28.541 [6]):
\- DN of the MOI for NSI.
Otherwise the result may include the reason of failure, for example, the
required latency or user number cannot be satisfied, or the physical resource
is not enough.
## 7.3 Procedure of Network Slice Subnet Instance Allocation
The Figure 7.3-1 illustrates the procedure of creating a new network slice
subnet instance or using an existing network slice subnet instance to satisfy
the required network slice subnet related requirements.
{width="5.770833333333333in" height="8.49375in"}
Figure 7.3-1: Network Slice Subnet Instance Allocation Request procedure
1) Network Slice Subnet Management Service Provider (NSSMS_P) receives an
AllocateNssi request (see AllocateNssi operation defined in clause 6.5.2) from
Network Slice Subnet Management Service Consumer (NSSMS_C) with network slice
subnet related requirements (network slice subnet related requirements defined
in SliceProfile see clause 6.3.4 in TS 28.541[6]).
2) NSSMS_P check the feasibility of network slice subnet related requirements.
If the network slice subnet related requirements can be satisfied, the
following step 3) are needed, else go to step 5).
3) Based on the network slice subnet related requirements, NSSMS_P decides
whether to use an existing NSSI or create a new NSSI. If the network slice
subnet related requirements allow the requested NSSI to be shared and if an
existing suitable NSSI can be reused, the NSSMS_P decides to use the existing
NSSI.
4.1a) If using an existing NSSI and the existing NSSI needs to be modified to
satisfy the network slice subnet related requirements, the NSSMS_P invokes the
procedure to modify the existing NSSI as described in clause 7.7.
4.1b.1) If creating a new NSSI, the NSSMS_P creates the MOI for the NSSI to be
created. NSSMS_P derives the corresponding network slice subnet constituent
(i.e. NF, constituent NSS) related requirements and transport network related
requirements (e.g. 3GPP endpoint information, latency requirements, bandwidth
requirements, isolation requirements) from the received network slice subnet
related requirements. Before NSSMS_Provider derives the constituent network
slice subnet related requirements, NSMS_Provider may invoke corresponding
network slice subnet capability information querying procedure as described in
clause 7.8.2.
4.1b.2) If the NSSI to be created contains virtualisation part (i.e. VNF or
VL), NSSMS_P derives the NS instance instantiation information (the NS
instance instantiation information is described in clause 7.3.2.2 and clause
7.3.3.2 [3]) based on network slice subnet related requirements. NSSMS_P
determines VNF instance(s) that need to be deployed according to the necessary
network function(s) and then derives the profile of virtual link(s) according
to the connection requirements between the network functions. NSSMS_P chooses
a proper NSD deployment flavour and creates data concerning the SAPs of the NS
instance. NSSMS_P invokes the NS instantiation procedures to create a NS
instance. NSSMS_P configures the NSS MOI with the NS instance identifier.
Note: NS instantiation procedure is described in TS 28.526 [7].
4.1b.3) For each required NSSI constituent, the following step 4.1b.3a) and
4.1b.3b) are needed:
4.1b.3a) If the required NSSI constituent is constituent NSSI, NSSMS_P invokes
NSSI Allocation Procedure.
4.1b.3b) If the required NSSI constituent is NF instance, NSSMS_P invokes NF
Creation Procedure as described in clause 7.10 or NF Modification Procedure as
described in clause 7.11.
4.1b.4) NSSMS_P configures the MOI for NSSI with the DN of the MOI for NSSI
constituent (i.e. NF, constituent NSSI).
4.1b.5) For each required transport network related requirements, NSSMS_P
invokes corresponding procedure of coordination with relevant TN Manager to
handle the TN part as described in clause 7.9.
5) The NSSMS_P sends the NSSI allocation result (see AllocateNssi operation
defined in clause 6.5.2) to the NSSMS_C. If the NSSI is created successfully,
the result includes the relevant constituent network slice subnet instance
information (see NetworkSliceSubnet IOC defined in clause 6.3.2 in TS 28.541
[6]):
\- DN of the MOI for NSSI.
\- NS instance Info (e.g. NSinstanceId)
Otherwise the result may include the reason of failure, for example, the
required latency or user Number cannot be satisfied, or the physical resource
is not enough.

This clause describes procedures of coordination with TN Manager to handle TN
part supporting network slicing.
NOTE: The present document: addresses interactions with NFVO as TN manager,.
interactions with other types of TN Manager (e.g. Optical, IP bearer transport
network, etc.) have not been addressed.
## 7.9.2 Interaction with NFVO as TN Manager
This clause considers the procedure of interaction between the 3GPP management
system and the NFVO, which behaves as TN Manager, to satisfy the TN related
requirements for the virtual links used in NSSI. The procedure is applicable
to creation and modification of the NSSI.
{width="3.59375in" height="2.0833333333333335in"}
Figure 7.9.2-1: Interaction with NFVO as TN manager to support network slicing

related requirements (e.g. 3GPP endpoint information, latency requirements,
bandwidth requirements, isolation requirements) for the TN part to be used in
the NSSI.
2) To satisfy the TN related requirements NSSMS_P invokes the corresponding NS
instance lifecycle management procedures as described in TS 28.526 [7].
3) After the NFVO executes the requested operation, it sends the corresponding
notification to the NSSMS_P as described in TS 28.526 [7].
