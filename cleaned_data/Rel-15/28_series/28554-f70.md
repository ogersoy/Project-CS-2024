###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for end to end KPIs
# A.1 Use case for end-to-end latency measurements of 5G Network related KPI
The end-to-end latency is an important performance parameter for operating 5G
network. In some scenarios (e.g. uRLLC), if end-to-end latency is
insufficient, the 5G network customer cannot obtain guaranteed network
performance provided by the network operator. So it is necessary to define
end-to-end latency of network related measurement to evaluate whether the end-
to-end latency that network customer requested has been satisfied. A procedure
is invoked by network management system and is used:
\- to update the CSMF/NSMF with the end-to-end latency parameter for
monitoring;
\- to inform the network customer/network operator the end-to-end latency;
\- to make CSMF/NSMF aware if the end-to-end latency can meet network
customer's service requirement.
If high end-to-end latency are measured, it is also of benefit to pinpoint
where in the chain from application to UE that the latency occurs.
# A.2 Use case for number of registered subscribers of single network slice
instance related KPI
Number of registered subscribers of single network slice instance can be used
to describe the amount of subscribers that are successfully registered, it can
reflect the usage of network slice instance, It is useful to evaluate
accessibility performance provided by one single network slice instance which
may trigger the lifecycle management of the network slice, this kind of KPI is
valuable especially when network functions (e.g. AMF) are shared between
different network slice instances. This KPI is focusing on both network and
user view.
# A.3 Use case for upstream/downstream throughput for one single network slice
instance related KPI
Measuring throughput is useful to evaluate system load of end to end network
slice. If the throughput of the specific network slice instance cannot meet
the performance requirement, some actions need to be performed to the network
slice instance e.g. reconfiguration, capacity relocation. So it is necessary
to define the IP throughput for one single network slice instance. This KPI is
focusing on network and user view.
# A.4 Use case for mean PDU sessions number in Network Slice instance
It is necessary to evaluate the mean PDU session number in the network slice
instance to indicate system load level. For example, if the mean value of the
PDU sessions is high, maybe the system capacity should be increased. This KPI
is focusing on network view.
# A.5 Use case for virtualised resource utilization of Network Slice instance
related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate the current utilization of virtualised resources
(e.g. memory and storage utilization) that a network slice instance is
occupied. If the utilization is larger or smaller than the threshold, maybe
some scale in/out operations will be made by the management system. This KPI
is focusing on network and user view.
# A.6 Use case for 5GS registration success rate of one single network slice
instance related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by 5GS. 5GS
registration for a UE is important when they have registered to the network
slice instance. If users or subscribers cannot register to the network slice
instance, they cannot access any network services in the network slice
instance. This KPI is focusing on network view.
# A.7 Use case for RAN UE throughput related KPI
The UE perceived throughput in NG-RAN is an important performance parameter
for operating 5G network. If the UE throughput of the NR cell cannot meet the
performance requirement, some actions need to be performed to the network,
e.g. reconfiguration or capacity increase. So it is necessary to define UE
throughput KPI to evaluate whether the end-users are satisfied. The KPI covers
volume large enough to make the throughput measurement relevant, i.e.
excluding data volume of the last or only slot.
The UE throughput KPI covers also \"NR option 3\" scenarios. Then the gNB is
\"connected\" towards the EPC, and not towards 5GC.
It is proposed to allow the KPI separated based on mapped 5QI (or for QCI in
case of NR option 3).
When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple NSIs may be
supported. The UL and DL UE throughput for each NSI is then of importance to
the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.
