# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document gives the stage 3 description of the Location Service
(LCS) operations for mobile station. These operations shall apply to both CS
and PS domain.
The group of location services operations is divided into two different
classes:
‑ Network initiated location services operations (clause 4);
‑ Mobile initiated location services operations (clause 5).
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

Abbreviations used in the present document are listed in 3GPP TS 21.905 and
3GPP TS 23.271.
The following terms are used in the present document:
**\- MS,** Mobile Station. The present document makes no distinction between
MS and UE.
# 4 Network initiated location services operations
## 4.1 Location Notification
### 4.1.1 Normal operation
The network invokes a location notification procedure by sending a REGISTER
message containing a LCS-LocationNotification invoke component to the MS. This
may be sent either to request verification for MT-LR or to notify about
already authorized MT-LR.
In case of privacy verification the MS shall respond to the request by sending
a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing the mobile subscriber\'s response in a
return result component (figure 4.1).
If the timer T(LCSN) expires in the network before any response from the MS
(e.g. due to no response from the user), the network shall interprete this by
applying the default treatment defined in TS 23.271 (i.e. dissallow location
if barred by subscription and allow location if allowed by subscription).
In the case of location notification no response is required from the MS, the
MS shall terminate the dialoque by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message
containing a LocationNotification return result.
If the MS is unable to process the request received from the network, it shall
return an error indication by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing a
return error component. Error values are specified in 3GPP TS 24.080

### 4.2.3 Area Event Cancellation
The network invokes a Deferred MT-LR Area Event Cancellation procedure by
sending a REGISTER message containing an LCS-Area Event Cancellation invoke
component to the MS.
If the MS is unable to process the request received from the network, it shall
return an error indication by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing a
return error component. Error values are specified in 3GPP TS 24.080
