# 1 Scope
This document defines a mobile device 3GPP IMS Management Object. The
management object is compatible with OMA Device Management protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD _DM-V1_2 [12].
The 3GPP IMS Management Object consists of relevant parameters that can be
managed for the IM CN Subsystem. This includes the basic framework defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [4] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], and early IMS as defined in 3GPP TS
23.221 [3]. This also includes relevant parameters that can be managed for the
application of SMS over IP networks defined in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5a].
The IMS Management Object defines a repository of data into the ME including
parameters that are provisioned from the ISIM application (i.e. 3GPP TS 31.103
[11]) or, after derivation, from the USIM application (i.e. 3GPP TS 31.102
[10]).

NOTE 1: The SS_domain_setting leaf does not provide a mechanism for the
network operator to select the domain used for mobile originating USSD
requests.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: int
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1, 2
0 -- Indicates that the UE only uses the PS domain for SS setting control
1 -- Indicates that the UE only uses the CS domain for SS setting control
2 - Indicates that the UE uses the PS domain for SS setting control when the
PS domain is being used by the UE for voice services, and the UE uses the CS
domain for SS setting control when the CS domain is being used by the UE for
voice services
The network operator can select the preference for the selection of the domain
used by the UE when performing supplementary services (SS) setting control for
voice services, according to the domain(s) where the supplementary services
are provisioned. For example:
\- if the supplementary services are provisioned only in the PS domain, the UE
can be restricted to configure only the supplementary services part of the IMS
multimedia telephony communication service by setting value \"0\";
NOTE 2: If voice services are centralized in IMS, and if the UE accesses the
CS domain for voice services, the supplementary services part of the IMS
multimedia telephony communication service can also be configured in the PS
domain by the UE.
\- if the supplementary services are provisioned only in the CS domain, the UE
can be restricted to configure only the supplementary services for CS speech
by setting value \"1\"; and
NOTE 3: If the supplementary services are provisioned in the PS domain, then
the supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony communication
service can also be configured by a UE accessing the CS domain towards an MSC
server enhanced for ICS implementing the interworking between call independent
supplementary service signalling and the XCAP application usage for
manipulating supplementary services data, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.292 [22].
\- if the supplementary services are provisioned in both the CS domain and PS
domain, then value \"2\" can be set to restrict the UE to:
a) configure the supplementary services for CS speech when the UE is using the
CS domain for voice services; and
b) configure the supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony
communication service when the UE is using the PS domain for voice services.
## 5.42 /_\ _/PS_domain_IMS_SS_control_preference
The PS_domain_IMS_SS_control_preference leaf provides a means to define the
method for which Supplementary Services as defined by 3GPP TS 22.173 [19] are
controlled by the UE when SS setting control is to be invoked over the PS

###### ## Annex B (informative): 3GPP IMS Client Provisioning Application
Characteristics (CP AC)
# B.1 General
This annex defines the 3GPP IMS Client Provisioning Application
Characteristics (CP AC) as supported in the Enabler Release Definition OMA-
ERELD-DM-V1_2 [12].
If the initial IMS parameters cannot be provisioned as specified in OMA-ERELD-
DM-V1_2 [12], initial IMS parameters can be provisioned using OMA CP.
If a client is provisioned with 3GPP IMS related parameters by both OMA DM and
OMA CP, the client will use the 3GPP IMS related parameters provisioned by OMA
DM.
