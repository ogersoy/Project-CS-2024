# 1 Scope
The present document defines a number of Mission Critical Services (MCSs)
Management Objects (MO) that are configured for the UE for the operation of
MCSs. The management objects are compatible with OMA Device Management
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
MCSs are services that require preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services, e.g. in support of police or fire brigade.
MCSs can be used for public safety applications and also for general
commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
The present document is applicable to an UE supporting on-line, off-line or
both on-line and off-line configuration of the configuration management
client.
The present document is applicable to an UE supporting off-line configuration
of the group management client.
The parameters defined by the management objects in the present document are
configured in the UE using on-line configuration over the CSC-4 reference
point and using off-line configuration over the CSC-11 and CSC-12 reference
points. Other specifications define how these parameters are used in the
operation of MCSs, and whether they are applicable to on-network operation or
off-network operation, or both:
\- 3GPP TS 24.379 [7];
\- 3GPP TS 24.380 [8];
\- 3GPP TS 24.481 [9];
\- 3GPP TS 24.482 [11];
\- 3GPP TS 24.484 [12];
\- 3GPP TS 24.282 [16];
\- 3GPP TS 24.582 [17];
\- 3GPP TS 24.281 [18]; and
\- 3GPP TS 24.581 [19].
The common network operation means both on-network operation and off-network
operation in the present document.
The following management objects are defined in the present document:
\- MCPTT UE configuration MO;
\- MCPTT user profile MO;
\- MCS group configuration MO;
\- MCPTT service configuration MO;
\- MCS UE initial configuration MO;
\- MCData UE configuration MO;
\- MCData user profile MO;
\- MCData service configuration MO;
\- MCVideo UE configuration MO;
\- MCVideo user profile MO; and
\- MCVideo service configuration MO.
The MOs listed above define repositories of data in the ME.

# 4 MCPTT UE configuration MO
## 4.1 General
The MCPTT UE configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure MCPTT
Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCPTT Service. The MCPTT UE
configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM as specified
in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both the ME and the
USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM shall take
precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-UE-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCPTT UE configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCPTT UE
configuration node as described in figure 4.1.1.

# 6 MCS group configuration MO
## 6.1 General
The MCS group configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure the
MCS Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MC services. The MCS
group configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both the
ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM
shall take precedence.
NOTE: For historical reasons some of the elements in the MCS group
configuration Management Object (MO) use the terminology \"MCPTT\", however
this MO is common to all MCS with some MCPTT specific elements, some MCData
specific elements and some MCVideo specific elements. Not all elements that
contain the terminology \"MCPTT\" are just MCPTT specific. In the clauses that
follow, it is made clear what aspects are specific to MCPTT and what aspects
are specific to all MC services. MCData specific elements are contained under
\"MCData\" nodes. MCVideo specific elements are contained under \"MCVideo\"
nodes.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-group-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCS group configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCS group
configuration node as described in figure 6.1.1.
Figure 6.1.1: The MCS group configuration MO (1 of 5)

# 7 MCPTT service configuration MO
## 7.1 General
The MCPTT service configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure
MCPTT Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCPTT Service. The
MCPTT service configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM
as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both
the ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM
shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-service-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCPTT service configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCPTT service
configuration node as described in figure 7.1.1.

# 9 MCData UE configuration MO
## 9.1 General
The MCData UE configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure MCData
Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCData Service. The MCData
UE configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both the
ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM
shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCData-UE-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCData UE configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCData UE
configuration node as described in figure 9.1.1 and figure 9.1.2.

# 10 MCData user profile MO
## 10.1 General
The MCData user profile configuration Management Object (MO) is used to
configure the MCData Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCData
Service. The MCData user profile configuration parameters may be stored in the
ME, or in the USIM as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and
the USIM. If both the ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values
stored in the USIM shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCData-user-
profile:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCData user profile MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCData user
profile node as described in figure 10.1.1, figure 10.1.2 and figure 10.1.3.
Figure 10.1.1: The MCData user profile MO (1 of 3)

# 14 MCVideo service configuration MO
## 14.1 General
The MCVideo service configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure
MCVideo Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCVideo Service.
The MCVideo service configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in
the USIM as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM.
If both the ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in
the USIM shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCVideo-service-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCVideo service configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCVideo service
configuration node as described in figure 14.1.1.
