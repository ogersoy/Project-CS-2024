# 1 Scope
This document specifies the identity management and authentication protocols
needed to support Mission Critical Services (MCSs). Identity management
applies only to on-network operation.
MCSs are services that require preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services, e.g. in support of police or fire brigade.
MCSs can be used for public safety applications and also for general
commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
This document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) supporting the identity
management client functionality, and to application servers supporting the
identity management server functionality.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Identity management
The Identity Management functional model for MC services is shown in figure
4.1-1 below and consists of the identity management server located in the
common services core and the identity management client located in the MC UE.
The IdM server and the IdM client in the MC UE establish the foundation for MC
services user authentication and user authorisation.
Figure 4.1-1: Functional model for MC services identity management
The CSC-1 reference point, between the IdM client in the UE and the Identity
Management server, provides the interface for user authentication. CSC-1
supports OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [6] and IETF RFC 6749 [5].
The OpenID Connect profile for MC services is implemented as described in 3GPP
TS 33.180 [17]. The MC services user authentication, the MC services user
authorisation, the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [6] and the OpenID Connect profile
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17] for MC services forms the basis of the MC
services identity management architecture.
Subclause 6.2.1 and subclause 6.3.1 describes the procedures for the MC
services user authentication. OIDC is flexible with respect to the user
authentication mechanism used. As 3GPP TS 33.180 [17] has indicated that
username and password authentication is mandatory to support, that mechanism
is included in subclause 6.2.1 and subclause 6.3.1, although other mechanisms
are possible.
When the MC services user is authenticated, the procedure will provide an id
token, an access token and a refresh token, which are all described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [17]. The access token is scoped to the services the MC services user
is authorised for, e.g., group management services, key management services
and MC services. The access token will be utilized for MCPTT service
authorisation, MCData service authorisation and MCVideo service authorisation
as documented in 3GPP TS 24.379 [12], 3GPP TS 24.282 [22] and 3GPP TS 24.281
[21] respectively.
After an MC service user has obtained an access token from their home IdM
server, they can acquire a security token from their home IdM server by means
of the procedures of subclause 6.2.2, subclause 6.3.2. The security token can
be used to acquire an access token from the IdM server of a partner system to
allow access to resources in the partner system\'s domain by means of the
procedures of subclause 6.2.3 and subclause 6.3.3.
# 5 Entities
## 5.1 Identity management client
The identity management client acts as the application user agent for MC ID
transactions. It interacts with the identity management server. The identity
management client:
\- shall support identity management registration to the identity management
server;
\- shall support the MC services user authentication framework as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [17];
\- shall support a username and password method of authentication as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17]; and
\- may support additional methods of authentication.
## 5.2 Identity management server
The identity management server is a functional entity that is capable of
authenticating the MC ID. It contains the knowledge and means to do
authentication by verifying the credentials supplied by the user. The identity
management server:
\- shall support identity management registration of the identity management
client;
\- shall support the MC services user authentication framework as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [17];
\- shall support a username and password method of authentication as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17]; and
\- may support additional methods of authentication.
## 5.3 MC service client
The MC service client shall interact with the IdM client as specified in
subclause 6.2:
\- to trigger initiation of the user authentication procedure; and
\- to receive the credentials obtained from the IdM server.
## 5.4 HTTP proxy
The HTTP proxy acts as the proxy for all hypertext transactions between the
HTTP client and the HTTP server. The HTTP proxy terminates the TLS session
with the HTTP client of the MC UE in order to allow the HTTP client to
establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with multiple HTTP
servers as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
NOTE: The HTTP proxy is in the same trust domain as the HTTP servers that are
located within a MC service provider\'s network.

3) shall send the HTTP POST request method towards the IdM server.
Upon receipt of an OIDC Token Response message, the IdM client:
1) shall validate the id_token, access_token and refresh token in the received
OIDC Token Response message as specified in the OpenID Connect 1.0 [6]
specification; and
2) shall provide the id_token and access_token in the received OIDC Token
Response message to the MC service client.
NOTE 4: The method in which the IdM client provides the id_token and
access_token to the MC service client is implementation specific.
The MC UE may repeat the entire procedure in this subclause as needed to
obtain the necessary authorisation tokens for the MC service clients,
depending on the scope parameter in the Authentication Request message as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17].
### 6.2.2 Token exchange procedure

obtain access tokens from the partner systems indicated by the resource
parameter included in the Token Exchange Request message for access to the
resources of that partner system.
NOTE 2: The security token only needs to be stored until it\'s lifetime has
expired or until it is replaced by a newly acquired security token.
### 6.2.3 Token request to a partner system IdM server
Upon an indication from the MC service client to acquire an access token from
a partner IdM server to authorise the MC service user to access the resources
of a partner system, the IdM client:

# 7 Inter/intra domain interface security
Inter/intra domain interface security shall be provided as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.180 [17];
###### ## Annex A (normative): HTTP entities
# A.1 Scope
This annex describes the functionality expected from the HTTP entities (i.e.
the HTTP client, the HTTP proxy and the HTTP server) defined by 3GPP TS 23.280
[16] and 3GPP TS 33.179 [2].
# A.2 Procedures
## A.2.1 HTTP client
### A.2.1.1 General
The HTTP client in the UE shall support the client role defined in IETF RFC
2616 [4].
### A.2.1.2 HTTP client in UE
The HTTP client in the UE shall support the client role defined in IETF RFC
2818 [10].
The HTTP client in the UE shall support transport layer security (TLS) as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17].
The HTTP client in the UE is configured with the following parameters:
1) a home HTTP proxy FQDN;
2) a home HTTP proxy port;
3) a TLS tunnel authentication method. The TLS tunnel authentication method
parameter is set to one of the following:
a) one-way authentication of the HTTP proxy based on the server certificate;
b) mutual authentication based on certificates; and
c) mutual authentication based on pre-shared key;
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17];
4) if the TLS tunnel authentication method is the mutual authentication based
on certificates:
a) TLS tunnel authentication X.509 certificate; and
5) if the TLS tunnel authentication method is the mutual authentication based
on pre-shared key;
a) TLS tunnel authentication pre-shared key.
The HTTP client in the UE shall establish a TCP connection towards the home
HTTP proxy FQDN and the home HTTP proxy port, unless the specific TCP
connection is to be used for the IdM client to IdM server procedures described
in subclause 6.2 and subclause 6.3 in the present document, in which case the
HTTP client shall establish a TCP connection towards the IdM server.
The HTTP client in the UE shall establish a TLS tunnel via the TCP connection
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [17]. When establishing the TLS tunnel, the
HTTP client in the UE shall act as a TLS client and the UE shall perform the
TLS tunnel authentication using the TLS authentication method indicated by the
TLS tunnel authentication method parameter according to 3GPP TS 33.180 [17].
The UE shall use the configured TLS tunnel authentication X.509 certificate
and the configured TLS tunnel authentication pre-shared key when applicable
for the used TLS authentication method. In order to prevent man-in-the-middle
attacks, the HTTP client in the UE shall check the home HTTP proxy FQDN
against the server\'s identity as presented in the received server\'s
certificate message if the TCP connection terminates on the HTTP proxy. The
HTTP client in the UE shall not check the portion of dereferenced HTTP URL
against the server\'s identity as presented in the received server\'s
certificate message if the TCP connection terminates on the HTTP proxy, but
shall do so if the TCP connection terminates on the IdM server.
NOTE: The TLS tunnel can be terminated in the HTTP proxy (rather than in the
HTTP server providing the dereferenced HTTP URL).
The HTTP client in the UE shall send and receive all HTTP messages via the TLS
tunnel.
If the HTTP client in the UE has an access token of the \"bearer\" token type
as specified in IETF RFC 6750 [14], the HTTP client in the UE shall include an
Authorization header field with the \"Bearer\" authentication scheme as
specified in IETF RFC 6750 [14] in HTTP requests.
### A.2.1.3 HTTP client in network entity
The HTTP client in the network entity is configured with the following
parameters:
1) a home HTTP proxy FQDN; and
2) a home HTTP proxy port.
The HTTP client in the network entity shall send and receive all HTTP messages
via the home HTTP proxy.
The HTTP client in the network entity shall insert an X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity
header field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.109 [15] in the HTTP request and shall
set X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header field to the identity of the HTTP client
in the network entity. The identity of the HTTP client in the network entity
can be a public service identity, an MC service group ID, or an MC service ID.
## A.2.2 HTTP proxy
### A.2.2.1 General
The HTTP proxy shall support proxy role of IETF RFC 2616 [4].
### A.2.2.2 HTTP request method from HTTP client in UE
The HTTP proxy shall support the server role of IETF RFC 2616 [4], and IETF
RFC 2818 [10].
The HTTP proxy shall support transport layer security (TLS) as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [17].
The HTTP proxy is configured with the following HTTP proxy parameters:
1) an FQDN of an HTTP proxy for UEs; and
2) a TCP port of an HTTP proxy for UEs.
The HTTP proxy shall support establishing TCP connections on the FQDN of HTTP
proxy for UEs and the TCP port of HTTP proxy for UEs. The HTTP proxy shall
support establishing a TLS tunnel via each such TCP connection as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [17]. When establishing the TLS tunnel, the HTTP proxy shall
act as TLS server.
Upon reception of an HTTP request method via a TLS tunnel:
1) if the HTTP request method contains an X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header
field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.109 [15], the HTTP proxy shall reject the
HTTP request method with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) response and do not continue
with rest of the steps;
2) if the HTTP request method contains a Request-URI identifying a resource in
a partner\'s MC serviceprovider, the HTTP proxy shall forward the HTTP request
method according to the Request-URI; and
3) if an HTTP request method contains a Request-URI identifying a resource in
own MC service provider, the HTTP proxy shall act as reverse proxy for the
HTTP request method and shall forward the HTTP request method according to the
MCPTT provider policy.
### A.2.2.3 HTTP request method from HTTP client in network entity within
trust domain
The HTTP proxy is configured with the following parameters:
1) a FQDN of an HTTP proxy for trusted entities; and
2) a TCP port of an HTTP proxy for trusted entities.
Upon receiving an HTTP request method via a TCP connection established on the
FQDN of HTTP proxy for UEs and the TCP port of HTTP proxy for UEs, if the TCP
connection is between network elements within trusted domain as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [17]:
1) if the HTTP request method contains a Request-URI identifying a resource in
a partner\'s MC service provider, the HTTP proxy shall forward the HTTP
request method according to the Request-URI; and
2) if an HTTP request method contains Request-URI identifying a resource in
own MC service provider, the HTTP proxy shall act as reverse proxy for the
HTTP request method and shall forward the HTTP request method according to MC
service provider policy.
## A.2.3 HTTP server
The HTTP server shall support the server role of IETF RFC 2616 [4].
Upon reception of an HTTP request:
1) if the received HTTP request does not contain an Authorization header field
with the \"Bearer\" authentication scheme and a bearer access token as
specified in IETF RFC 6750 [14] and the received HTTP request does not contain
an X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.109 [15],
the HTTP server shall reject the request with HTTP 403 (Forbidden) response;
2) if the received HTTP request contains an Authorization header field with
the \"Bearer\" authentication scheme and a bearer access token as specified in
IETF RFC 6750 [14];
a) the HTTP server shall validate the bearer access token as specified in IETF
RFC 6750 [14]; and
b) the HTTP server shall consider the MC service ID derived from the bearer
access token as the identity of the sender of the HTTP request; and
3) if the received HTTP request does not contain an Authorization header field
with the \"Bearer\" authentication scheme and a bearer access token as
specified in IETF RFC 6750 [14] and the received HTTP request contains an
X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.109 [15], the
HTTP server shall consider the URI in the X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header
field as the identity of the sender of the HTTP request.
