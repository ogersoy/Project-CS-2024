# Introduction
The railway community is considering a successor communication system to
GSM-R, as the forecasted obsolescence of the 2G-based GSM-R technology is
envisaged around 2030, with first FRMCS trial implementations expected to
start around 2020.
The Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) Functional Working
Group (FWG) of the International Union of Railways (UIC) have investigated and
summarised their requirements for the next generation railway communication
system in the Future Railway Mobile Communication User Requirements
Specification (FRMCS URS) [2]. **The present document is based on this input
given by the UIC/** ETSI TC-RT NG2R
# 1 Scope
**The present document** analyses FRMCS Use cases, system principles of FRMCS
and Interworking between GSM-R and FRMCS in order to derive potential
requirements.

# 4 Overview
FRMCS will adapt 3GPP transport to provide communication to railway users. It
eventually will resemble GSM-R and will additionally provide communication
capabilities beyond what GSM-R was able to. It will provide higher data rates,
lower data latencies, multimedia communication and improved communication
reliability. FRMCS considers end-to-end use cases and also provides
application layer requirements that might or might not be in scope of 3GPP
work. To facilitate smooth migration from GSM-R to FRMCS interworking
requirements between GSM-R and FRMCS are provided.

### 9.2.4 Use case: -- Interruption of a communication link
#### 9.2.4.1 Description
Alternative 1: The FRMCS system provides a so called negative notification to
the FRMCS-users as soon as voice communication link is interrupted.
Alternative 2: A positive notification will be given by the FRMCS system as
long as the voice communication link is unaffected.
#### 9.2.4.2 Pre-conditions
A FRMCS-user is part of a voice communication with one or more FRMCS-users.
AVC is invoked on all links of the voice communication.
#### 9.2.4.3 Service flows
**Positive Notification**
The FRMCS system continuously checks whether the voice communication links are
unaffected.
The FRMCS system indicates to all FRMCS-users involved in the voice
communication service is working properly e.g.by a periodic audio signal.
If a interruption of at least one of the communication links is detected, the
positive notification is immediately stopped.
If AVC itself fails, the positive notification shall be stopped immediately.
Active speech transmission shall suppress the positive notification to all
FRMCS-users involved.
Optionally all FRMCS-users have to confirm their availability periodically
(e.g. by pressing a button or by talking). If this confirmation is not
received, AVC shall be stopped immediately.
A FRMCS user terminating his participation in the voice communication shall
immediately stop AVC.
When AVC is stopped the ongoing voice communication is continued. Assured
Voice Communication may be reinvoked for the remaining FRMCS-users of the
ongoing voice communication.
**Negative Notification**
The FRMCS system continuously checks whether the voice communication links are
unaffected.
If a degradation of a voice communication link is detected the FRMCS system
warns all involved FRMCS-users, e.g. by generating a warning audio signal. If
possible, the FRMCS-user with the interrupted communication link shall also be
warned.

## 9.3 Role management and presence
### 9.3.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to role management and presence are
defined:
  * Registration to a functional identity
  * Deregistration of a functional identity
  * FRMCS-user changing functional identity
  * User log-in to the system
  * User log-out from the system
  * Presentation of identities
  * Interrogation of identities within a certain context
Examples of role management, like functional roles, functional identities,
FRMCS equipment identities, etc. in the railway environment are covered by
annex A.
Note: The FRMCS equipment further referred to in this section consists of a
3GPP UE on which the FRMCS application resides.
Editor\'s Note:\ The note above needs to be moved to definitions section\ Also
definition of functional identity etc. needs to be added to definitions
section
### 9.3.2 General pre-conditions
In order to fully understand the uses cases in this chapter, Figure 9.3.2-1
illustrates the different steps required to complete the registration process.
Figure 9.3.2-1: Example of role management
In this definition it is needed to make a distinction between different types
of end user devices. The following are, as a principle, defined:
a) Equipment without MMI, without the possibility to be addressed via a
functional identity related to the equipment (e.g. sensor in the track or
simple modem operation)
b) Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity related to the
equipment (e.g. maintenance log collecting device connected to a power
station) but without other FRMCS user login
c) Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity and that allows a
FRMCS user to login and register to functional identities related to the user
(e.g. cab radio)
d) Equipment that cannot register to a functional identity, but that allows a
FRMCs user to login and to register to functional identities related to the
user (e.g. a generic handheld device)
Steps:
  1. [UE-Power on]{.underline}: The end user device has started up and is attached to the FRMCS network on telecoms level. The end user device is reachable via its subscriber identity address.
  2. [Start FRMCS application]{.underline}: On the end user device the applicable FRMCS application(s) start up and are ready for use.
  3. [FRMCS equipment login]{.underline}: The equipment is logging in into the FRMCS system on application level.
  4. [Initialise equipment type]{.underline}: the type of equipment used is identified. This can be changed at any time depending on the use.
At this stage of the user flow four different routes can be followed, based on
the determined equipment type of the end user device.
_[Type a) "sensor":]{.underline}_
  * No action required. The FRMCS equipment is now reachable via its subscriber identity address.
After this step the process of registration is completed.
_[Type b) "PA":]{.underline}_
  * [Register to a functional number]{.underline}: the equipment will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional number is related to the equipment and identifies the device, like a PA system on a train.
  * [Functional identity added]{.underline}: the request for a functional identity is granted by the FRMCS system. The end user device is now reachable via its functional identity (and its subscriber identity address).
After this step the process of registration is completed.
_[Type c) "cab radio":]{.underline}_
  * [Register to a functional number]{.underline}: the user will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional number is related to the user and identifies where the equipment is used, like a cab radio in a cabin of a train.
  * [Functional identity added]{.underline}: the request for a functional identity is granted by the FRMCS system. The FRMCS equipment is now reachable via its functional identity related to the equipment (and its subscriber identity address).
_[Type d) "Handheld":]{.underline}_
  * For an equipment type like a handheld, it is likely that a functional registration will not take place related to the position.
Next, for both the types c) and d) the following steps apply:
  * [User login dialog]{.underline}: the user is presented with a log-in MMI action. The user can now login into the end user device via his credentials. This can be functional or personal.
  * [FRMCS-User]{.underline}: The user is now identified by the FRMCS system. The FRMCS equipment is now reachable via its user identity (and its functional identity related to the equipment, and its subscriber identity address).
  * [Register to a functional number]{.underline}: the user will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional number is related to the user and identifies where the equipment is used, like a cab radio in a cabin of a train.
  * [Functional identity added]{.underline}: the request for a functional identity is granted by the FRMCS system. The FRMCS equipment is now reachable via its functional identity related to the user (and its functional identity related to the equipment, and its user identity, and its subscriber identity address).
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Note: Use cases related to power up the UE until complete initialisation of
the equipment type are covered in chapter 5.

  * Request for identities based on location
### 9.4.2 Use Case: Provide location information
#### 9.4.2.1 Description
The FRMCS equipment provides its location information to the FRMCS system for
further processing e.g. for automatic train operation. External systems can be

## 9.6 End to End Prioritisation related use cases
### 9.6.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to prioritisation are defined. The
following use cases are defined:
  * Prioritisation
This priority is an end to end priority to be applied on application layer. In
certain cases priority on transport layer might be derived from this.
Note: For examples of role management, like functional identities, FRMCS
equipment identities, etc. in the railway environment, see annex A.
### 9.6.2 Use case: Prioritisation
### 9.6.2.1 Description
The FRMCS system shall be able to prioritise different communication scenarios
over each others.
### 9.6.2.2 Pre-conditions
The receiving FRMCS-user is logged-in into the FRMCS system.
The receiving FRMCS-user is registered into a functional identity.
The receiving FRMCS-user is involved or not involved in an ongoing
communication.
### 9.6.2.3 Service flows
The originating FRMCS-user initiates a communication to the receiving FRMCS
user.
The priority level is used to assure the appropriate priority handling of the
communication by the FRMCS system.
If applicable and required the ongoing communication at the originating FRMCS
user side may be released or put on hold.
If the originating FRMCS-user didn't request for a priority level, the FRMCS
system will assign a priority level.
If the originating FRMCS-user requested a priority level, the FRMCS system may
accept or change the priority level.
The FRMCS system is processing the setup of the communication according to the
priority level.
The FRMCS system, , decides, based on the priority level, whether the incoming
communication is accepted, rejected, put on hold.
### 9.6.2.4 Post-conditions
The ongoing communication and the incoming communication are treated according
the rules given by the priority levels.
### 9.6.2.5 Potential requirements and gap analysis

## 9.7 Multi user talker control related use cases
### 9.7.1 Introduction
Editor\'s Note:\ The impact to the active talkers need to be clarified if the
number of talker permissions get reduced.\ Should that work on-net as well as
off-net?\ Should a user be able to mute another user?\ Where should the voice
be mixed?
In this chapter the use cases related to multi user talker control for voice
communication are defined. The following use cases are defined:
  * Set the number of simultaneous talkers
  * Set initial talker permissions and priorities
  * Request permission to talk
  * Grant permission to talk
  * Revoke permission to talk
Note: For examples of role management, like functional identities, FRMCS
equipment identities, etc. in the railway environment, see annex A.
### 9.7.2 Use case: Set the number of simultaneous talkers
### 9.7.2.1 Description
For multi user communication, i.e. when several users are involved in the same
communication, the number of users that are granted the right to talk at the
same time can be limited to either one, a limited number or unrestricted
number.
The communication application (e.g. shunting team communication) will set the
number of simultaneous talkers and/or the identities of involved FRMCS-users
and if required other application specific criteria.
### 9.7.2.2 Pre-conditions
An active communication application capable to use the multi users talker
control.
### 9.7.2.3 Service flows
The communication application sends the number of simultaneous talker(s)
information to the multi user talker control.
This information is used by multi user talker control when setting up the
communication.
If there is a need to change the number of simultaneous talkers, it is the
communication application which sends this information to the multi user
talker control.
The multi user talker control then uses this updated information for
controlling the number of simultaneous talkers in the communication.
### 9.7.2.4 Post-conditions
The multi user talker control is aware about the number of simultaneous FRMCS-
users and uses this information during communication.
### 9.7.2.5 Potential requirements and gap analysis
[R-9.7.2.5-001] The FRMCS system shall be able to limit the number of
simultaneous talkers in a multi user communication.
[Gap Analysis: To be assessed.]
[R-9.7.2.5-002] The maximum number of simultaneous talkers in a multi user
communication shall be provided by the communication application. The number
of simultaneous talkers can be either one, a limited number or an unrestricted
number and shall be changeable during the communication.
[Gap Analysis: To be assessed.]
### 9.7.3 Use case: Set initial talker permissions and priorities
### 9.7.3.1 Description
There are different requirements for talker permissions and to prioritise
talkers in different communication applications.
The FRMCS-users are identified by their functional identities.
The communication application defines the talker permissions and priorities
based on the functional identities and the type of communication application,
e.g. railway emergency call, shunting, multi train.
One or multiple FRMCS-users can be granted with the permission to perform as
talker in a certain communication. These FRMCS-users are able to request
permission to talk during communication.
Certain FRMCS-user(s) that have requested the permission to talk at the same
time or while another user is talking can be granted with an initial talker
permission i.e. they will be given the permission first before requests of
others are served independent of whether they were the first requesting the
permission to talk or not.
Different FRMCS-users can be granted with a different talker priority. In case
of parallel requests for permission to talk, the permission is granted to the
FRMCS-user(s) with highest talker priority. The requests with identical talker
priorities will be queued based on the time of request.
### 9.7.3.2 Pre-conditions
An active communication application capable to use the multi users talker
control.
### 9.7.3.3 Service flows
The communication application sends information about talker permissions and
talker priorities to the multi user talker control application.
This information is used in multi user talker control when setting up the
communication.
If there is a need to change the information about talker permissions and
talker priorities, it is the communication application that sends this
information to multi user talker control.
The multi user control then uses this updated information for controlling the
talker permissions and talker priorities in the communication.
### 9.7.3.4 Post-conditions
The multi user control is aware of the talker permissions and talker
priorities and uses this information for communication control/setup.
### 9.7.3.5 Potential requirements and gap analysis
[R-9.7.3.5-001] The FRMCS system shall be able to handle talker permissions
and priorities as provided by the communication application, e.g. railway
emergency call, shunting, multi train.

the permission to perform as talker in a certain communication.
[R-9.7.3.5-002.1] FRMCS-users shall be able to request permission to talk
during communication.
[Gap Analysis: To be assessed]
[R-9.7.3.5-003] The FRMCS system shall be able to grant FRMCS users an initial
talker permission (i.e. to be the first speaker in the communication) ensuring
that the entitled FRMCS-user(s) are able to talk first, once the communication
is established.
[Gap Analysis: To be assessed.]
[R-9.7.3.5-004] The FRMCS system shall be able to grant the permission to talk
based on a FRMCS-user talker priority. In case of pending requests for
permission to talk, the permission shall be granted to the FRMCS-user with
highest talker priority. Requests of identical talker priority shall be
handled based on the time of request.
[Gap Analysis: To be assessed.]
### 9.7.4 Use case: Request permission to talk
### 9.7.4.1 Description
There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to mitigate
the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for example:
  * Emergency communication
  * Shunting communication
  * Trackside worker communication
The system shall therefore be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers
in a voice communication.
An entitled FRMCS-user shall be able to select and de-select FRMCS-user(s)
being able to talk in a voice communication.
The FRMCS-user shall be able to request the permission to talk (raise the
hand).
### 9.7.4.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS-user is involved in an active voice communication. The number of
simultatious talkers is limited in this communication.
### 9.7.4.3 Service flows
The FRMCS-user requests permission to talk on the MMI of the communication
application (e.g. by pressing a Push-to-talk button)
The communication application sends the request to the multi user talker
control in the FRMCS system.
The communication application indicates on the MMI that talker permission has
been requested.
### 9.7.4.4 Post-conditions
Permission to talk has been requested and a response from the multi user
talker control in the FRMCS system expected.
### 9.7.4.5 Potential requirements and gap analysis

[Gap Analysis: To be assessed.]
### 9.7.5 Use case: Grant permission to talk
### 9.7.5.1 Description
There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to mitigate
the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for example:
  * Emergency communication
  * Shunting communication
  * Trackside worker communication
The system shall be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers in a
voice communication.
The list of FRMCS-users with permission to talk and those who have requested
it, shall be available to the Multi User Talker Control application.
### 9.7.5.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS-user is an active voice communication.
Multi User Talker Control is configured by the communication application to
limit the number of simultaneous talkers.
By default the Multi User Control uses a set of criteria, like priorities,
identities, etc. to manage the requests automatically
In addition an entitled FRMCS-user (i.e. based on functional identity) who is
monitoring the progress of the communication can select and de-select
simultaneous talkers.
### 9.7.5.3 Service flows
**Automatic management of requests**
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS system receives a request to talk
from a FRMCS-user.
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS system verifies the number of
FRMCS-users who already have permission to talk.
If the number of FRMCS-users with permission to talk does not exceed the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control grants
automatically the permission to the requester.
If the number of FRMCS-users with permission to talk exceeds the maximum
number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control decides based on
certain criteria, like priorities, functional identity, etc. who will keep the
right to speak and who will be granted the permission to talk the Multi User
Talker Control configures the system accordingly.
The Multi User Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS-users
whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.
**Management of requests by an entitled FRMCS-user**
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS system receives a request to talk
from a FRMCS-user.
The Multi User Talker Control service in the FRMCS system verifies the number
of FRMCS-users who already have permission to talk.

### 9.8.1 Use case: Robust mission critical group communications
### 9.8.1.1 Description
For reliable railway services, conventional way is to use dualization
methodology. Most of railway services are based on on-network communication,
which is supported by base station and core networks. However, when disaster
happens so that the communication infrastructure is not feasible, railway
service based on the communication infrastructure cannot be maintained any
more. From 3GPP Rel. 12, device-to-device communications has been considered
to be supported not only in the transport layer [2] but also in the
application layer. [3] Subsequently, off-network group communications became
feasible in 3GPP technology. Therefore, by using the transformation of on-
network railway service into off-network railway service, we can overcome
inherent limitation of on-network railway services. Figure 1 depicts a
required transformation of group communications mode.
#### 9.8.1.2 Pre-conditions
1\. User equipments for train driver, customer service staff, and train
operations staff support device to device communications in the perspective of
transport layer.
2\. User equipments for train driver, customer service staff, and train
operations staff support on-network and off-network group communications
services in the perspective of applications layer.

Figure 9.X.1.2-1. Transformation of group communication mode
#### 9.8.1.3 Service Flows
1\. After initial disaster happens, emergency message (including voice or
data) delivery service based on on-network group communication among train
driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff have been proceeded
without any problem.
2\. Disaster becomes worse, and associated communication infrastructure are
destroyed and are not feasible anymore.
3\. Transformation of on-network group communication into off-network group
communication is accomplished among group members for maintaining the
emergency message delivery services even in the worse disaster.
#### 9.8.1.4 Post-conditions
Off-network group communication among train driver, customer service staff, or
train operations staff is activated and emergency message delivery service is
maintained normally.

# X Examples for Styles
The main text of the document should start here, after the above clauses have
been added.
The following styles and editing techniques are aimed to help in the
formatting of the document using the 3GPP Template: 3GPP_70.dot, available
from the 3GPP FTP site ([ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/Information]{.underline}).
## X.1 Heading Styles
Heading styles are included in the 3GPP TR Template and are used as follows:
**Do not use any built-in automatic numbering** for 3GPP documents. Although
this is sometimes useful in the early drafting stages of a document, once the
document has been placed under change control, the clause numbering needs to
be fixed in order to keep cross-reference consistency as the 3GPP
specification set develops.
Heading 1: Used for Main clauses (1, 2, 3, etc.). Also used for Annex clauses
(A.1, A.2, etc.).
Heading 2: Used for Main clauses (4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, etc.). Also used for
Annex clauses (A.1.1, A.1.2, etc.).
Heading 3: Used for 2nd level clauses (4.1.1, 4.1.2, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, etc.). Also
used for Annex clauses (A.2.1.1, A.2.1.2, etc.).
Heading 4 & 5: Used for 3rd and 4th level clauses and Annex clauses.
Heading 6 & 7: Not used, instead use style \"H6\" so that the title appears in
the document, but does not appear in the Table of Contents.
Heading 8: Used for Main Annex titles in Specifications (3G TS) (e.g. Annex A
(normative): ).
Heading 9: Used for Main Annex titles in Reports (3G TR) (e.g. Annex A: ).
## X.2 Other common styles
Normal: Used for main document text.
NO: Used for Notes in the text (Allows Tab and Indent). See example below.
NW: Same as NO, but Without line space after. Used when there are many notes
in sequence.
NOTE 1: This is an example of a note formatted in style NW. The style is
designed to allow space for note numbering and line wrap with a hanging
indent. There is no line space after.
NOTE 2: This is an example of a note formatted in style NO. The style is
designed to allow space for note numbering and line wrap with a hanging
indent. There is a line space after.
Bullet styles: The following bullet styles are provided.
B1: Bullet level 1 for main bullet points.
B2: Bullet level 2 for sub bullets.
B3-B5: for further sub bullets.
NOTE: Bullets are usually formatted manually, using a hyphen ( - ) or
alphanumeric identifiers: a), b), or 1), 2) etc. followed by a tab character.
**Automatic bullet features should not be used** as they may be lost if
template styles are re-applied later.
Table styles: **TAH** , **TAL** , **TAC** , **TAR** , **TAN** , for **TA** ble
**H** eaders, **L** eft justified, **C** entred, **R** ight justified and
**N** otes in tables: Style **TH** is used for the **T** able **H** eading
(title or caption). See example below.
Table 1: Example of Table styles

Col 1 Header (TAH) Col 2 Header (TAH) Col 3 Header (TAH) Left Justified (TAL)
Centred (TAC) Right Justified (TAR) NOTE: A special style is provided for
notes within a table (TAN).
* * *
Figure Styles: Figures and graphics are formatted with style \"**TH** \" which
keeps the figure with the following paragraph, usually the figure title.
Figure titles (captions) are formatted with style \"**TF** \". See example
below.

graphic and \"Format Object ...\" - Deâ€‘select \"float over text\" in the
Position Tab
Annex A: Examples of role management
This annex gives some examples on how role management is used in the railway
environment. This to better understand the use.
**[Functional roles]{.underline}**
Every operational railway function e.g. train driver, a shunter or controller
is identified by their functional role. A non-exhaustive list is provided in
the table underneath.
* * *
**Functional roles** Leading train driver Driver 2 Driver 3 Shunting leader
Shunting member Track side maintenance leader Track side maintenance member
Primary train controller Secondary train controller Power controller Shunting
controller Trackside maintenance controller Platform inspector Public
announcement Chief conductor Second conductor Third conductor Catering staff
chief Diagnostics
* * *
**[Functional identity]{.underline}**
A functional role can be associated to a specific railway function e.g. train,
engine, coach or train controller functions.
To do so, the owner of the role has to register itself to a specific
functional identity.
For example an owner of the functional role can be authorised by the railway
undertaking to be a train driver (functional role) of a train. When driver
start the scheduled train ride, from A to B at time x, the train running
schedule assigns a specific train running number for this train . In principle
the train keeps this number for the complete journey. The train driver uses
his communication equipment to register himself, as the leading train driver
(functional role), of train number 123 (functional identity). After
registration the train driver is now registered to the FRMCS system as the
leading train driver of train 123. In some cases there can be multiple drivers
on one train so the individual drivers can register themselves accordingly.
**[FRMCS equipment type]{.underline}**
The equipment used in the railway environment can be very specific. The FRMCS
equipment is constituted of an UE and the FRMCS application on this UE. This
depends on the location and situation the equipment is used. The following
different equipment types can be used, as an example:
* * *
**Equipment type** **Equipment Capabilities (Examples)** Cabin radio Emergency
button, external loudspeaker Shunting radio Loudspeaker Trackside maintenance
radio  
Security staff radio  
Catering staff radio  
Train controller device  
Shunting controller device
* * *
These different types of FRMCS equipment are relevant for the registration
process of functional roles and functional identities. For example a train
driver cannot register himself to a FRMCS equipment which does not fit for the
train driver to perform his role. So a train driver cannot perform a
registration as train driver of train 123 if he uses a catering staff FRMCS
equipment (where there is no train emergency button available, no loudspeaker
and handset, etc.). The registration request will be rejected by the FRMCS
system.
The FRMCS equipment shall also be reachable based on the identity of the FRMCS
equipment. For example the cabin radio of a specific train can be reached by
their FRMCS equipment identity.
**[FRMCS-user identity]{.underline}**
The railway employee (a dedicated person) is also reachable even if no
functional identity has been assigned. This is done by using a unique FRMCS-
user identity. This can be an E.164 number, any other number according to a
specific railways numbering plan or by fully qualified domain names (FQDN).
Such a number or FQDN is dedicated assigned to a specific railway employee.
After the employee has performed the log-in procedure to the FRMCS system, he
is reachable via his individual FRMCS-user identity.
