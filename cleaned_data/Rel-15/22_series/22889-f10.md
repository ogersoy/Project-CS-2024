# Introduction
The railway community is considering a successor communication system to
GSM-R, as the forecasted obsolescence of the 2G-based GSM-R technology is
envisaged around 2030, with first FRMCS trial implementations expected to
start around 2020.
The Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) Functional Working
Group (FWG) of the International Union of Railways (UIC) have investigated and
summarised their requirements for the next generation railway communication
system in the Future Railway Mobile Communication User Requirements
Specification (FRMCS URS) [2]. **The present document is based on this input
given by the UIC/** ETSI TC-RT NG2R
# 1 Scope
**The present document** analyses FRMCS Use cases, system principles of FRMCS
and Interworking between GSM-R and FRMCS in order to derive potential
requirements.

# 4 Overview
FRMCS will adapt 3GPP transport to provide communication to railway users. It
eventually will resemble GSM-R and will additionally provide communication
capabilities beyond what GSM-R has been able to. It will provide higher data
rates, lower data latencies, multimedia communication, and improved
communication reliability. FRMCS considers end-to-end use cases and also
provides requirements that might or might not be in scope of 3GPP existing
specifications. To facilitate smooth migration from legacy communication
systems (e.g. GSM) to FRMCS, interworking requirements between legacy
communication systems and FRMCS are provided.
FRMCS Equipment shall connect to application domain through 3GPP radio access
or other access. It provides emergency group communication, low latency and
high reliable data and video service in high speed train environment. Amongst
others it has the following important features:
\- Prioritized emergency group communication, train control data and video
service
\- Seamless connectivity in high speed railway moving environments
\- Low latency and high reliable data and video service
\- Real time train monitoring and management for safe train operation
\- Reliable location tracking including tunnel condition
\- Legacy railway communication interworking to GSM-R system

Figure 4-1: High-level relation of FRMCS and legacy systems
Basically, railway communication services [5] can be categorized into
\- Train control services
\- Maintenance services
\- Railway specific services (such as Railway Emergency Call, functional
addressing, and location-based addressing)
\- Other services (providing train crews or train Drivers with information of
train operation and interworking with the existing railway communication
systems)
This study categorizes all the use cases by considering inherent
characteristics of railway applications. Specifically, the following
categories of use cases are considered.
\- Basic functionality
\- Critical communication applications
\- Performance communication applications
\- Business communication applications
\- Critical support applications
\- Performance support applications
\- Business support applications
\- FRMCS System principles
The categories can be depicted conceptually as follows:

# 6 Critical communication applications related use cases
## 6.1 Introduction
Critical communications applications are essential for train movements,
safety, shunting, presence, trackside maintenance, legal aspects such as
emergency communications, etc
## 6.2 Multi-train voice communication for Drivers including Ground FRMCS
User(s)
### 6.2.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to the function of Multi-train voice
communication from the Drivers towards the Ground FRMCS Users are defined.
Ground FRMCS Users may include Controllers. The following use cases are
defined:
  * Initiation of Multi-train voice communication for Drivers including Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
  * Termination of Multi-train voice communication for Drivers including Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
  * Interworking GSM-R and FRMCS for Multi-train voice communication for Drivers including Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
### 6.2.2 Use case: Initiation of Multi-train voice communication for Drivers
including Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
#### 6.2.2.1 Description
A Driver and/or a Ground FRMCS User shall be able to initiate a voice
communication to other Drivers and/or Ground FRMCS Users.
#### 6.2.2.2 Pre-conditions
The Driver and the Ground FRMCS User are authorised to initiate the
communication. This is managed by the authorisation of communication
application.
The authorisation application authorises the Driver and the Ground FRMCS User
to use the Multi-train voice communication for Drivers including Ground FRMCS
User(s)
#### 6.2.2.3 Service flows
The Driver and/or Ground FRMCS User initiates the voice communication to the
(other) Driver(s) and/or Ground FRMCS Users. The priority of the communication
is managed by the prioritisation application.
The FRMCS System determines the Driver(s) and the Ground FRMCS User(s) to be
included in the communication, based on:
  * location information of all users provided by the locations services application, and/or
  * functional identity of all users provided by the Role management and presence application.
The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication within a setup time
specified as NORMAL (see 12.10). The information from the Role management and
presence application is used to present the identities for both Driver(s) and
Controller(s). The initiating Driver is indicated to the Controller(s). Also
the location of the Driver(s) in the voice communication is presented to the
Controller(s) which is retrieved from the location services application.
If the Driver and/or Ground FRMCS User is connected to more than one Drivers
and/or Controllers, the multi user talker control application is used.
The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Driver and the
Controller is managed by the prioritisation application.
The voice communication is recorded by the Voice recording and access
application.
#### 6.2.2.4 Post-conditions
The Driver and/or the Controller is connected to requested Driver(s) and/or
Controller(s).

### 6.2.4 Use case: Service Interworking and service continuation between
GSM-R and FRMCS for Multi-train voice communication for Drivers including
Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
#### 6.2.4.1 Description
For migration purposes the service interworking and service continuation
between the GSM-R system and FRMCS System for Multi-train voice communication
for Drivers including Ground FRMCS User(s) communication needs to be defined.
Interworking between FRMCS and GSM-R shall not require any changes in the
GSM-R system.
Depending on the migration scenario a Ground FRMCS User or a Driver can be
attached to the FRMCS sytsem, to the GSM-R system or both. The Driver can be
attached either in the GSM-R system or in the FRMCS System. Functional
identities are applicable in one system only.
This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS and GSM-R
systems.
#### 6.2.4.2 Pre-conditions
None.
#### 6.2.4.3 Service flows
**Driver attached to GSM-R**
When the Driver is attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating voice
communication to other Drivers and Ground FRMCS User, the GSM-R system will
route the voice communication to other Drivers the Ground FRMCS User (s)
accordingly.
If the Driver or the Ground FRMCS User is located in the FRMCS System the
GSM-R system can only route the call if it can be reached by an address or
identity understood by the GSM-R system. The Role management in FRMCS provides
the appropriate address or identity e.g. by provide a mapping of GSM-R
identities and FRMCS identities.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
route the communication and to present the identities of both Driver and
Ground FRMCS User.
**Driver attached to FRMCS**
When the Driver is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating voice
communication to other Drivers and and Ground FRMCS User, the FRMCS System
will route the communication to the Ground FRMCS User accordingly. The
information from the Role management and presence application is used to route
the communication and to present the identities of both Driver and Ground
FRMCS User. The Role management in FRMCS shall provide the appropriate address
or identity e.g. by provide a mapping of GSM-R identities and FRMCS
identities.
**Driver moving from GSM-R to FRMCS**
When the GSM-R user equipment of the Driver is detached from the GSM-R system
the FRMCS end user device shall provide service continuation by setting up the
communication via the FRMCS System. An interruption of voice communication is
acceptable.
Note 1: This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS
and GSM-R systems, i.e. contains a FRMCS UE and a GSM-R UE. It is assumed the
FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment will have some control of the GSM-R
part of the UE.

## 6.3 On-train outgoing voice communication from the Driver towards the
Controller(s) of the train
### 6.3.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to the function of On-train outgoing
voice communication from the Driver towards the Controller(s) of the train are
defined. This use case allows the Driver to only communicate with Controllers.
The following use cases are defined:
  * Initiation of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication
  * Termination of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication
  * Interworking GSM-R and FRMCS of Driver to Controller(s) communication
### 6.3.2 Use case: Initiation of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication
#### 6.3.2.1 Description
The Driver shall be able to initiate a voice communication to the
Controller(s) that was, is, or will be responsible for the movement of the
train.
#### 6.3.2.2 Pre-conditions
The Driver is authorised to initiate the voice communication to the
Controller. This is managed by the authorisation of voice communication
application.
The Driver is authorised to use the On-train outgoing voice communication from
the Driver towards the Controller(s) of the train application by the
application authorisation of application.
#### 6.3.2.3 Service flows
**Driver to responsible Controller(s)**
The Driver initiates the voice communication to the Controller. The priority
of the communication is managed by the prioritisation application.
The FRMCS System determines the responsible Controller(s), based on:
  * location information of the train provided by the locations services application, and/or
  * functional identity provided by the Role management and presence application.
  * System configuration on which Controller is responsible for which part of the track/station/etc.
The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication to the Controller(s)
within a setup time specified as NORMAL (see 12.10). The information from the
Role management and presence application is used to present the identities for
both Driver and Controller. Also the location of the Driver is presented to
the Controller which is retrieved from the location services application.
If the Driver is connected to more than one Controller, the multi user talker
control application is used.
The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Controller is
managed by the prioritisation application.
The voice communication is recorded by the Voice recording and access
application.
**Driver to another Controller(s)**
The Driver initiates the voice communication to the Controller who was or will
be responsible for the movement of the train. The addressing is performed by
selecting an entry from a list or entered manually. The priority of the
communication is managed by the prioritisation application.
The FRMCS System presents the list of Controllers to the Driver, based on:
  * location information provided by the locations services application, and/or
  * functional identity provided by the Role management and presence application.
  * System configuration on which Controller is responsible for which part of the track/station/etc.
The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication to the Controller(s)

For migration purposes the service interworking and service continuation
between the GSM-R system and FRMCS System for Driver to Controller(s) voice
communication needs to be defined.
Interworking between FRMCS and GSM-R shall not require any changes in the
GSM-R system.
Depending on the migration scenario a Controller can be attached to the FRMCS
sytsem, to the GSM-R system or both. The Driver can be attached either in the
GSM-R system or in the FRMCS System. Functional identities are applicable in
one system only.
This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS and GSM-R
systems.
#### 6.3.4.2 Pre-conditions

#### 6.3.4.3 Service flows
**Driver attached to GSM-R**
When the Driver is attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating voice
communication to Controller(s), the GSM-R system will route the voice
communication to the Controller(s) accordingly.
If the Controller is located in the FRMCS System the GSM-R system can only
route the call to the Controller if the Controller can be reached by an
address or identity understood by the GSM-R system. The Role management in
FRMCS provides the appropriate address or identity e.g. by provide a mapping
of GSM-R identities and FRMCS identities.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
route the communication and to present the identities of both Driver and
Controller.
**Driver attached to FRMCS**
When the Driver is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating voice
communication to Controller(s), the FRMCS System will route the communication
to the Controller(s) accordingly. The information from the Role management and

### 6.4 Railway emergency communication
### 6.4.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to Railway emergency communication are
defined. The following use cases are defined:
\- Initiation of the Railway emergency alert
\- New entry to the Railway emergency alert
\- Changing of the Railway emergency alert
\- Leaving of the Railway emergency alert
\- Termination of the Railway emergency alert;
\- Initiation of railway emergency voice communication
\- Termination of railway emergency voice communication
\- Initiation of Data communication during Railway Emergency Alert
\- Service interworking and service continuation with GSM-R
\- Interface to train borne recorder
### 6.4.2 General overview
Railway Emergency Communication serves two main purposes in railway operation
\- Alert Drivers or other railway staff about an emergency situation.
Receiving such alert will result to immediate actions to be taken by the
recipients. These actions are defined by operational rules, e.g. a Driver has
to slow down train speed to 40km/h, drive on sight, etc.
\- Based on operational rules, additional information about the emergency
situation can be exchanged using voice and/or data communication.
While the alert needs to be setup very fast, the information part that may
follow is less time critical and not always required. The Railway Emergency
Communication consists of :
  1. A mandatory alert phase indicating the emergency situation;
  2. An optional voice and/or data communication phase depending on operational situation and / or operational rules.
> Alert is the general term used that encompasses the different phases
> initiation, continuation and termination. This receives priority handling
> which is linked to the application category within the FRMCS System (see
> 12.10).
When an railway emergency alert is triggered by a FRMCS-user, the FRMCS System
determines which other FRMCS-users shall receive an alert, depending on
following conditions:
\- Location, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity, direction
of movement, speed of the initiating entity
\- Location, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity, direction
of movement, speed of the FRMCS-users which are concerned of the emergency
situation
\- Any additional information provided by the initiating entity
By applying alert conditions only FRMCS-users will receive an alert who are
concerned by this emergency situation. Figure x-1 outlines this principle.
{width="6.988194444444445in" height="4.790972222222222in"}
Figure 6.4.2-1 Illustration of FRMCS Users in an Railway emergency alert area
Independently of any ongoing interactions between the FRMCS-user and the FRMCS
Equipment, the railway emergency alert has to be continuously indicated to the
FRMCS-user until the railway emergency situation is over (alert is
terminated).
While an alert is active, the FRMCS System shall continuously check:
\- If additional FRMCS-users do match to the conditions of the Railway
emergency alert. FRMCS-user entering the emergency area/location/etc. will
receive the alert.
\- If an FRMCS-user does not fulfil the conditions to be alerted anymore,
because the FRMCS User has moved away from the emergency area, the alert will
be withdrawn from this FRMCS-user.
A Controller is able to change the conditions to select the applicable FRMCS
Users while an alert is active.
While an alert is active on a FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS-user is still able to
establish and / or receive other types of communication. If a railway
emergency voice communication is established by the FRMCS-user of an ongoing
alert, any other ongoing voice communications are terminated.
### 6.4.3 Use case: Initiation of the Railway emergency alert
#### 6.4.3.1 Description
An FRMCS- user is able to initiate a Railway emergency alert. Based on a set
of conditions the FRMCS System will determine which FRMCS-users that shall be
informed about the emergency situation.(see 6.4.2 General overview) The
targeted FRMCS-user can be e.g. a mobile FRMCS User, a Driver, an External
System, a Controller, maintenance staff or a member of a shunting team.
#### 6.4.3.2 Pre-conditions
The initiating FRMCS User is authorised to establish a Railway emergency
alert.
#### 6.4.3.3 Service flows
In any service flow, a mobile FRMCS User, e.g. a Driver, a maintenance staff
or a member of a shunting team, is not able to leave or terminate the Railway
emergency alert.
**Controller initiated**
The Controller provides the conditions (e.g. train number/area/track
section/station) to the FRMCS System selecting the appropriate recipients of
the Railway emergency alert. The conditions (e.g. train number/area/track
section/station) can be pre-configured for comfortable selection by the
Controller. The Controller may need to confirm the selection.
The FRMCS System will determine, based on the conditions, which FRMCS Users
are to receive the Railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS-users within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which is presented to the FRMCS-user.
The priority of the Railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority which matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In case a FRMCS-user is already involved in another Railway emergency alert,
FRMCS System does not forward new alerts to this particular FRMCS-user. The
waiting alert is send as soon as the FRMCS User is no longer involved in the
other Railway emergency alert.
The Controller is informed about the alerted FRMCS Users.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
**External system initiated**
FRMCS System receives the conditions from the External System (e.g. a
list/train number/area/track section/station) to address/determine the
appropriate recipients of the Railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS System will determine, based on the conditions, which users will
receive the Railway emergency alert.
The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS-users within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are presented to the FRMCS Users.
The priority of the Railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority which matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In the case that a mobile FRMCS-user is already active in another Railway
emergency alert, the FRMCS System does not forward new alerts to this
particular FRMCS-user. A waiting alert is send as soon as the FRMCS-user is no
longer involved in an ongoing Railway emergency alert. The Controller is
informed about the alerted FRMCS-users and the alert initiating External
System.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
**Mobile FRMCS User initiated**
A FRMCS-user, like a Driver, maintenance staff or a member of a shunting team,
presses the Railway emergency button.
The FRMCS Equipment requests the alert communication to the FRMCS System.
The FRMCS System determines the FRMCS-users to be included in the Railway
emergency alert. This is based on the location information of the initiator
and certain conditions (e.g. functional identity, track area, accuracy of the
location, maximum track speed, station, shunting yard,
location/speed/direction of users).
The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS- users within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are forwarded to the concerned
FRMCS-users.
The priority of the Railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority that matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In the case that a mobile FRMCS-user is already active in another Railway
emergency alert, the FRMCS System does not forward new alerts to this
particular FRMCS-user. A waiting alert is sent as soon as the FRMCS-user is no
longer involved in an ongoing Railway emergency alert. The applicable
Controller(s) is informed about the alerted FRMCS-users, including which user
initiated the alert.
The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when active.
The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded
data application.
#### 6.4.3.4 Post-conditions
The applicable FRMCS-users are alerted.

### 6.4.5 Use case: Changing of the Railway emergency alert
#### 6.4.5.1 Description
The Controller or an External System is able to change the conditions
selecting the appropriate recepients of the Railway emergency alert. The
change may result in an expansion or a reduction of FRMCS Users that shall be
informed about the emergency situation.
#### 6.4.5.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS User (Controller) is authorised to initiate the Railway emergency
alert. This is managed by the application authorisation of application.
There is an onging Railway emergency alert.
#### 6.4.5.3 Service flows
The Controller or an External System shall be able to change the conditional
criteria selecting the appropriate recipients of the Railway emergency alert.
The change of the conditions could imply the merge of multiple ongoing Railway
emergency alerts.
The FRMCS System shall continuously check if users still meet the conditions
of the Railway emergency alert. The user can be e.g. a mobile FRMCS User, a
Driver, maintenance staff, a member of a shunting team or a Controller.
The FRMCS System shall forward the Railway emergency alert to all additional
users within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert
notification can include additional information (e.g. text, voice prompts)
which are forwarded to the FRMCS -user.
The priority of the Railway emergency alert is managed by the prioritisation
application. The alert has the priority that matches the application category
of CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10) within the FRMCS System.
In case of an ongoing Railway emergency voice communication, the additional
FRMCS Users are added.
In case FRMCS-user is already active in another Railway emergency alert, the
new alert is not forwarded by the FRMCS System to this particular FRMCS-user.

### 6.4.11 Use case: Service interworking and service continuation with GSM-R
#### 6.4.11.1 Description
For migration purposes, the service interworking and service continuation
between the GSM-R system and FRMCS System for Railway emergency alerts and
Railway emergency voice communication needs to be defined.
Service interworking between FRMCS and GSM-R shall not require any changes in
the GSM-R system specifications.
Depending on the migration scenario, a Controller can be attached to the FRMCS
System, to the GSM-R system or both. The mobile FRMCS User can be attached
either to the GSM-R system or to the FRMCS System.
The service continuation use cases only apply where a FRMCS Equipment and a
GSM-R UE are linked together.
#### 6.4.11.2 Pre-conditions
None.
#### 6.4.11.3 Service flows
**Mobile FRMCS User attached to GSM-R**
When the mobile FRMCS User is attached to the GSM-R system and is initiating a
Railway Emergency Call, the GSM-R system, (in parallel to processing the
railway emergency call internally according to GSM-R definitons), routes the
Railway Emergency Call to the FRMCS System, which requires the FRMCS System to
be reachable by identities that are understood by the GSM-R system. The FRMCS
System will determine, based on configuration, if a Railway emergency alert
needs to be established. If a Railway emergency alert is established a Railway
emergency voice communication is initiated automatically.
The Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and the Railway emergency voice
communication in the FRMCS System are linked together and controlled by the
FRMCS System.
Service interworking between the talker control in the GSM-R system and the
FRMCS System is required, but without changing the GSM-R system.
When the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system is terminated, the Railway
emergency alert and the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS
System are terminated too.
When the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System is
terminated and there is a Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system linked
together, Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and Railway emergency
alert / the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System are
terminated too.
When the Railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is terminated and there
is a Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system connected, both the Railway
Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and Railway emergency voice communication
in the FRMCS System are not terminated.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
forward the identities between the systems. The identity of the initiator of
the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system is made available to the FRMCS
System.
**Mobile FRMCS User attached to FRMCS**
When the FRMCS User is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating a
Railway emergency alert, and the Railway emergency alert is also relevant for
the GSM-R system based on configuration, the Railway emergency voice
communication becomes initiated in the FRMCS System and as Railway Emergency
Call in the GSM-R system.
The Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System and Railway
Emergency Call in the GSM-R system are linked and controlled by the FRMCS
System.
Service interworking between the talker control in the FRMCS System and the
GSM-R system is required, but without changing the GSM-R system.
When the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System is
terminated and there is a Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system linked,
Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and Railway emergency alert / the
Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System are also terminated.
When the Railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is terminated and there
is a Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system linked, both the Railway
Emergency Call in the GSM-R system and Railway emergency voice communication
in the FRMCS System remains active.
When the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM-R system is terminated, the Railway
emergency alert and the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS
System are terminated.
The information from the Role management and presence application is used to
forward the identities between FRMCS System and GSM-R system. The identity of
the initiator of the Railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is made
available to the GSM-R system to be used accordingly.
**Mobile FRMCS User moving from GSM-R to FRMCS**
When the GSM-R system becomes unavailable e.g. lack of coverage, the FRMCS
Equipment should provide service continuation by setting up the communication
via the FRMCS System. An interruption of voice communication is acceptable. It
is up to the end user device implementation how this service continuation is
as seamless as possible presented to the user.
**Mobile FRMCS User moving from FRMCS to GSM-R**
When the FRMCS radio access becomes unavailable, the FRMCS Equipment shall
able to provide service continuation by setting up the communication via the
GSM-R system. An interruption of voice communication is acceptable. It is up
to the end user device implementation how this service continuation is as
seamless as possible presented to the user.
Note: Both scenarios described above only apply when a FRMCS Equipment and a
GSM-R UE are linked together. It is further assumed the FRMCS Application on
the FRMCS Equipment to have some control of the GSM-R UE.

6.6 Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication related use cases
6.6.1 Introduction
Generally trackside maintenance occurs during daily train operation. For
safety reasons trackside maintenance staff need to be informed about
approaching trains entering the area of maintenance. Thus the intention of a
trackside warning system is to inform trackside staff about the approaching
train.
Trackside warning system consist of several specific sensors and warning
entites. The sensors are responsible to detect the approaching train and
warning entities indicate trackside workers about the approaching train. A
warning entity provide this indication in form of visual signal e.g. flashing
light and an audio signal e.g. tone. In addition, the local maintenance staff
will receive the train approaching indication on its FRMCS Equipment. When the
train has left the track section, the warning system withdraw the indication.
Sensors and warning entities constitutes the warning system that requires
continues communication between the sensors and the warning entities. In
addition, it encompasses the communication among the warning system and the
FRMCS Equipment of the local maintenance staff.
Due to the fact that such a warning system deployment is temporary and not
always fixed network communication facilites are available at the track, FRMCS
System provides necessary mobile communication services for the trackside
warning system.
Hence this chapter describes the use cases related to Trackside Maintenance
Warning System communication. The following use cases are identified:

## 9.3 Functional identities and role management
### 9.3.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to functional identities and role
management are defined:
\- Registration to a functional identity
\- Deregistration of a functional identity
\- FRMCS-user changing functional identity
\- User log-in to the system
\- User log-out from the system
\- Presentation of identities
\- Interrogation of identities within a certain context
Examples of Role management, like functional identities, FRMCS Equipment
Identities, etc. in the railway environment are covered by annex A.
### 9.3.2 General pre-conditions
In order to fully understand the uses cases in this chapter, Figure 9.3.2-1
illustrates the different steps required to complete the registration process.
Figure 9.3.2-1: Example of Role management
In this definition, it is needed to make a distinction between different types
of FRMCS Equipment. The following are, as a principle, defined:
a) FRMCS Equipment without MMI, without the possibility to be addressed via a
functional identity related to the equipment (e.g. sensor in the track or
simple modem operation)
b) FRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity related to
the equipment (e.g. maintenance log collecting device connected to a power
station) but without other FRMCS User login
c) FRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity and that
allows a FRMCS User to login and register to functional identities related to
the user (e.g. cab radio)
d) FRMCS Equipment that cannot register to a functional identity, but that
allows a FRMS User to login and to register to functional identities related
to the user (e.g. a generic handheld device)
Steps:
  1. [UE-Power on]{.underline}: The UE has started up and is attached to the FRMCS network on telecoms level. The UE is reachable via its subscriber identity address.
  2. [Start FRMCS Application]{.underline}: On the UE the FRMCS Application start up and is ready for use.
  3. [FRMCS Equipment login]{.underline}: The FRMCS Application is logging in into the FRMCS System and the FRMCS Equipment becomes known to the FRMCS System.
  4. [Initialise]{.underline} FRMCS Equipment [type]{.underline}: the type of FRMCS Equipment used is identified..
At this stage of the user flow four different routes can be followed, based on
the determined FRMCS Equipment type of the FRMCS Equipment.
Type a) "sensor":
  * No action required. The FRMCS Equipment is now reachable via its subscriber identity address.
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Type b) "Announcement System":
  * [Register to a functional]{.underline} identity: the FRMCS Equipment will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional number is related to the equipment and identifies the device, like a PA system on a train.
  * [Functional identity added]{.underline}: the request for a functional identity is granted by the FRMCS System. The end user device is now reachable via its functional identity (and its subscriber identity address).
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Type c) "cab radio":
  * Register to a functional identitiy: the FRMCS Equipment will request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity is related to the FRMCS Equipment and identifies the environment where the equipment is used, like a cab radio in a cabin of a train.
  * Functional identity added: The FRMCS User is now only reachable via all of its functional identities related to the FRMCS Equipment (and its subscriber identity address).
Type d) "Handheld":
Next, for both the types c) and d) the following steps apply:
  * User login dialog: the user is presented with a log-in MMI action. The user can now login into the FRMCS System.. By successfully logging into the FRMCS System the user becomes a FRMCS User.
  * FRMCS User: The FRMCS User is now reachable via its FRMCS User Identity (and in case c) the functional identity registered by the FRMCS Equipmentand its subscriber identity address).
  * Register to a functional identity: the FRMCS User may request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity relates to the FRMCS User and identifies the role of the FRMCS User e.g. driver, controller etc and the environment e.g. train number. Functional identity added: The FRMCS User is now reachable via all the functional identities registered to the user (Further, the FRMCS Equipment is reachable via its registered functional identity(ies) and its subscriber identity address.
After this step the process of registration is completed.
Note: Use cases related to power up the UE until complete initialisation of
the equipment type are covered in chapter 5.

### 9.3.3 Use case: Registration to a functional identity
#### 9.3.3.1 Description
A FRMCS-user or the FRMCS Equipment shall be able to register to one or
multiple functional identities. A functional identity can therefore be
equipment related or user related.
#### 9.3.3.2 Pre-conditions
The equipment type is identified.
Functional registration of the user, the user is logged in into the FRMCS
System.
#### 9.3.3.3 Service flows
**Requested functional identity is not in use**
The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment selects the functional identity. The
identity can be selected from a list based on the location of the FRMCS-user,
operational schedules, etc. or the functional identity can be entered
manually.
The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment requests the FRMCS System to register
the new functional identity.
The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment about the
outcome of the registration request.
**Requested functional identity that is in use**
The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment selects the functional identity. The
identity can be selected from a list based on the location of the FRMCS-user,
operational schedules, etc. or the functional identity can be entered
manually.
The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment requests the FRMCS System to register
the new functional identity.
The FRMCS-user is or the FRMCS-equipment informed of the functional identity
already in use.
The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment shall be able to select from the
following options:
  * Cancel the registration
  * If the selected functional identity allows take over the functional identity.
  * If the selected functional identity allows register as an additional FRMCS-user to this functional identity.
The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS-user about the outcome of the registration
request.
In the case of taking over a functional identity, the FRMCS System deregisters
the other FRMCS-user or FRMCS-equipment from this particular functional
identity. The deregistered FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment gets informed
about the deregistration by the FRMCS System.
**Registration by the Railway Subsystem of the FRMCS System**
Based on the user identification, operational conditions, like schedules when
entering the train, location, time, recent activity etc., the Railway
Subsystem shall be able automatically register a FRMCS User or an FRMCS
Equipment to a functional identity.
The FRMCS-user gets informed about the registration by the FRMCS System.
#### 9.3.3.4 Post-conditions
In case of successful registration, the FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment can
be reached based on the functional identity. The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-
equipment can be registered to different functional identities. The FRMCS-user
or the FRMCS-equipment are also reachable by using the FRMCS Equipment
Identity, the FRMCS User Identity (if logged in) and its subscriber identity.
If the FRMCS System has not accepted the registration, the FRMCS-user or the
FRMCS-equipment cannot be reached on a particular functional identity.

A FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment shall be able to deregister from one or
multiple functional identities.
#### 9.3.4.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS-user user or the FRMCS-equipment has at least one functional
identity.
#### 9.3.4.3 Service flows
**Deregistration functional identity initiated by the FRMCS-user**
The FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment chooses the functional identities to be
deregistered among the list of currently registered functional identities by:
  * electing a set of functional identities (the application may select the appropriate set of functional identities automatically)
  * selecting one functional identity
The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User or the FRMCS-equipment about the
outcome of the registration request.
**Deregistration by the Railway Subsystem**
Based on certain criteria the FRMCS System deregisters a FRMCS-user or the
FRMCS-equipment from one or multiple functional identities and informs the
FRMCS-user or the FRMCS-equipment about the deregistration.
For example, possible criteria are timer, location, operational schedules,
another FRMCS-user taking over the functional identity.
#### 9.3.4.4 Post-conditions
If the FRMCS System has deregistered the functional identity, the previously

## 9.4 Location services related use cases
### 9.4.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to location services are defined. The
following use cases are defined:
  * Provide location information
  * Request for location information
  * Request for identities based on location
### 9.4.2 Use Case: Provide location information
#### 9.4.2.1 Description
The FRMCS Equipment provides its location information to the FRMCS System for
further processing e.g. for automatic train operation. External systems can be
supported in providing additional location information with or without
functional identity reference to the FRMCS System for further processing.
The location information may be shared directly with other applications on the
same FRMCS Equipment without the involvement of the FRMCS System.
#### 9.4.2.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS Equipment supports some mechanisms to obtain its location.
#### 9.4.2.3 Service flows
The FRMCS Equipment determines its current location in a periodic or an event-
triggered manner. The frequency of the location reporting may change according
to the application requirements.
The FRMCS Equipment reports location information that may include its
applicable FRMCS Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request, the FRMCS
Equipment shall be able to report its location information.
External systems can provide additional information to the FRMCS System in
order to improve location accuracy of an FRMCS Equipment.
The received location information is stored by FRMCS System.
In case of periodic location reporting, the FRMCS System supervises the
continuous supply of the location information. If the supply of periodic
location information by the FRMCS Equipment stops, the FRMCS System initiates
the re-establishment of the periodic location information data flow. The FRMCS
System can correlate other identities from the FRMCS Equipment Identity.

Comments [R-9.7.1-001] Multi user talker control shall be available for both
on-net and off-net communication. A Not covered
* * *
### 9.7.2 Use case: Set the number of simultaneous talkers
#### 9.7.2.1 Description
For multi user communication, i.e. when several users are involved in the same
communication, the number of users that are granted the right to talk at the
same time can be limited to either one, a limited number or unrestricted
number.
The communication application (e.g. shunting team communication) will set the
number of simultaneous talkers and/or the identities of involved FRMCS-users
and if required other application specific criteria.
#### 9.7.2.2 Pre-conditions
An active communication application capable to use the multi user talker
control.
#### 9.7.2.3 Service flows
The communication application sends the number of simultaneous talker(s)
information to the multi user talker control.
This information is used by multi user talker control when setting up the
communication.
If there is a need to change the number of simultaneous talkers, it is the
communication application which sends this information to the multi user
talker control.
The multi user talker control then uses this updated information for
controlling the number of simultaneous talkers in the communication.
#### 9.7.2.4 Post-conditions
The multi user talker control is aware about the number of simultaneous FRMCS-
users and uses this information during communication.
#### 9.7.2.5 Potential requirements and gap analysis

communication shall be provided by the communication application. The number
of simultaneous talkers can be either one, a limited number or an unrestricted
number and shall be changeable during the communication. A Not covered
* * *
### 9.7.3 Use case: Set initial talker permissions and priorities
#### 9.7.3.1 Description
There are different requirements for talker permissions and to prioritise
talkers in different communication applications.
The FRMCS-users are identified by their functional identities.
The communication application defines the talker permissions and priorities
based on the functional identities and the type of communication application,
e.g. railway emergency call, shunting, multi train.
One or multiple FRMCS-users can be granted with the permission to perform as
talker in a certain communication. These FRMCS-users are able to request
permission to talk during communication.
Certain FRMCS-user(s) that have requested the permission to talk at the same
time or while another user is talking can be granted with an initial talker
permission i.e. they will be given the permission first before requests of
others are served independent of whether they were the first requesting the
permission to talk or not.
Different FRMCS-users can be granted with a different talker priority. In case
of parallel requests for permission to talk, the permission is granted to the
FRMCS-user(s) with highest talker priority. The requests with identical talker
priorities will be queued based on the time of request.
#### 9.7.3.2 Pre-conditions
An active communication application capable to use the multi user talker
control.
#### 9.7.3.3 Service flows
The communication application sends information about talker permissions and
talker priorities to the multi user talker control application.
This information is used in multi user talker control when setting up the
communication.
If there is a need to change the information about talker permissions and
talker priorities, it is the communication application that sends this
information to multi user talker control.
The multi user control then uses this updated information for controlling the
talker permissions and talker priorities in the communication.
#### 9.7.3.4 Post-conditions
The multi user control is aware of the talker permissions and talker
priorities and uses this information for communication control/setup.

### 9.7.5 Use case: Grant permission to talk
#### 9.7.5.1 Description
There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to mitigate
the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for example:
  * Emergency communication
  * Shunting communication
  * Trackside worker communication
The system shall be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers in a
voice communication.
The list of FRMCS-users with permission to talk and those who have requested
it, shall be available to the Multi User Talker Control application.
#### 9.7.5.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS-user is an active voice communication.
Multi User Talker Control is configured by the communication application to
limit the number of simultaneous talkers.
By default the Multi User Control uses a set of criteria, like priorities,
identities, etc. to manage the requests automatically
In addition an entitled FRMCS-user (i.e. based on functional identity) who is
monitoring the progress of the communication can select and de-select
simultaneous talkers.
#### 9.7.5.3 Service flows
**Automatic management of requests**
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS System receives a request to talk
from a FRMCS-user.
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS System verifies the number of
FRMCS-users who already have permission to talk.
If the number of FRMCS-users with permission to talk does not exceed the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control grants
automatically the permission to the requester.
If the number of FRMCS-users with permission to talk exceeds the maximum
number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control decides based on
certain criteria, like priorities, functional identity, etc. who will keep the
right to speak and who will be granted the permission to talk the Multi User
Talker Control configures the system accordingly.
If the number of talker permissions are reduced and the reduction results in
having more active talkers than permitted, the active talkers lose their
permission to talk as soon as they stop talking (i.e. release PTT) until the
new maximum allowed number of talkers is met.
The Multi User Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS-users
whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.
**Management of requests by an entitled FRMCS-user**
The Multi User Talker Control in the FRMCS System receives a request to talk
from a FRMCS-user.
The Multi User Talker Control service in the FRMCS System verifies the number
of FRMCS-users who already have permission to talk.
If the number of FRMCS-users with permission to talk does not exceed the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control service
grants automatically the permission to the requester.
If the number of FRMCS-users with permission to talk exceeds the maximum
number of simultaneous talkers, the Multi User Talker Control service alerts
the entitled FRMCS-user that is monitoring the communication, who is presented
with the list of simultaneous talkers and the list of pending requests and
decides who will keep the right to speak and who will be granted the
permission to talk by selecting and de-selecting the corresponding FRMCS-user.
The Multi User Talker Control service configures the system accordingly.
The Multi User Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS-users
whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.

### 9.8.1 Use case: Robust mission critical group communications
#### 9.8.1.1 Description
For reliable railway services, conventional way is to use dualization
methodology. Most of railway services are based on on-network communication,
which is supported by base station and core networks. However, when disaster
happens so that the communication infrastructure is not feasible, railway
service based on the communication infrastructure cannot be maintained any
more. From 3GPP Rel. 12, device-to-device communications has been considered
to be supported not only in the transport layer [2] but also in the
application layer. [3] Subsequently, off-network group communications became
feasible in 3GPP technology. Therefore, by using the transformation of on-
network railway service into off-network railway service, we can overcome
inherent limitation of on-network railway services. Figure 9.8.1.2-1 depicts a
required transformation of group communications mode.
#### 9.8.1.2 Pre-conditions
1\. User equipments for train driver, customer service staff, and train
operations staff support device to device communications in the perspective of
transport layer.
2\. User equipments for train driver, customer service staff, and train
operations staff support on-network and off-network group communications
services in the perspective of applications layer.

#### 9.8.1.3 Service Flows
1\. After initial disaster happens, emergency message (including voice or
data) delivery service based on on-network group communication among train
driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff have been proceeded
without any problem.
2\. Disaster becomes worse, and associated communication infrastructure are
destroyed and are not feasible anymore.
3\. Transformation of on-network group communication into off-network group
communication is accomplished among group members for maintaining the
emergency message delivery services even in the worse disaster.
#### 9.8.1.4 Post-conditions

## 9.8 Authorisation of communication
### 9.8.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to authorisation of communication are
described, the following use cases are identified:
  * Permit / deny communication
### 9.8.2 Use case: Permit / deny communication
#### 9.8.2.1 Description
The purpose of the authorisation function it to allow the network operator to
control and regulate communications in order to avoid disruption/distraction
to the users (for example Drivers during voice communication)and preventing
unauthorised communication and to minimise network load.
The system may therefore restrict communication based on a configurable access
matrix related to the FRMCS subscriber identity, the FRMCS Functional Identity
of the equipment, the FRMCS User Identity, the FRMCS Functional Identity of
the FRMCS-users considering the source and destination address.
#### 9.8.2.2 Pre-conditions
The user attempts to establish a communication.
#### 9.8.2.3 Service flows
Upon an attempt to establish a communication, the system checks if the source
FRMCS-user address is allowed to invite the destination FRMCS-user address.
FRMCS System shall consider for the verification process the source and
destination FRMCS User address.
If multiple identities are simultaneously active to a FRMCS User, the
following order shall be applied to determine the authorisation of the
communication establishment:
  * Functional identities related to the FRMCS-user
  * FRMCS User Identity
  * FRMCS functional identities related to the equipment
  * FRMCS subscriber identity
If the FRMCS-user is allowed to establish the communication, the FRMCS System
proceeds the communication setup.
If the FRMCS User is not allowed establish the communication, the FRMCS System
shall rejects the attempt including the reason of the rejection.
#### 9.8.2.4 Post-conditions
Either the communication has been established or the FRMCS-user has been
informed about the denial of the call attempt.

## 9.9 Authorisation of application
### 9.9.1 Introduction
In this chapter the use cases related to authorisation of application are
described, the following use case is identified
  * Enabling/Disabling applications
### 9.9.2 Use case: Enabling/Disabling applications
#### 9.9.2.1 Description
The FRMCS System shall allow the network operators to control the use of FRMCS
Applications in order to avoid disruption/distraction to the FRMCS Users (for
example Drivers), preventing unauthorised usage according to his Role.
The FRMCS System shall therefore be able to enable / disable FRMCS
Applications for a FRMCS User depending on subscriber identity, the functional
identity of the FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS User Identity or the functional
identity/ies of the FRMCS User. Also context based criteria like location and
other conditions are to be taken into account.
#### 9.9.2.2 Pre-conditions
The FRMCS User equipment is powered on and the FRMCS Application on the FRMCS
User equipment has started.
#### 9.9.2.3 Service flows
**Power-on**
After powering on the FRMCS Equipment and start of the FRMCS Application on
the FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS System enables the FRMCS Application(s) on the
FRMCS Equipment according to the Role related to the FRMCS subscriber
identity.
**Change of registration status**
Upon a change in registration status by registration / deregistration to /
from a functional identity, change of a functional identity, user login
/logout to / from the FRMCS System, the FRMCS System enables / disables
applications.
If multiple identities are active, the following order is used to determine
the correct state:
  * FRMCS functional identities related to the FRMCS User
  * FRMCS-user identity
  * FRMCS functional Identities related to the FRMCS Equipment
  * FRMCS subscriber identity
If a FRMCS-user has registered to multiple functional identities, the FRMCS
User is authorised to use all applicable FRMCS Applications related to the
different FRMCS functional identities.
If an FRMCS Application is relying on other FRMCS Applications, enabling of
all required FRMCS Applications is managed by the FRMCS System.
Only authorised FRMCS Applications shall be presented to the FRMCS-user.
**Change of location**

### 9.9.1 Use case: Robust mission critical group communication services
#### 9.9.1.1 Description
For reliable railway services, conventional way is to use dualization
methodology. Most of railway services are based on on-network communication,
which is supported by base station and core networks under 3GPP standard.
However, when disaster happens so that the communication infrastructure is not
feasible, railway service based on the communication infrastructure cannot be
maintained any more. From 3GPP Rel. 12, device-to-device communications has
been considered to be supported not only in the transport layer but also in
the application layer. In addition, interworking of FRMCS System with legacy
systems including GSM-R and TRS is expected to be supported in Rel. 15. As a
consequence, off-network and legacy systems will become feasible for group
communication services in 3GPP technology. Therefore, by considering not only
off-network but also legacy systems, reliability of mission critical group
communication service in the on-network can be enhanced. Figure 9.9-1 depicts
a required transformation of group communication service mode.
#### 9.9.1.2 Pre-conditions
FRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train operations
staff support device to device communications in the perspective of transport
layer.
FRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train operations
staff support on-network, off-network group communication services in the
perspective of applications layer.

Figure 9.9.1.3-1. Transformation of group communication service mode
#### 9.9.1.3 Service Flows
1\. After initial disaster happens, emergency message (including voice or
data) delivery service based on on-network group communication among train
driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff have been preceded
without any problem.
2\. Disaster becomes worse, and associated communication infrastructure is
destroyed and is not usable anymore.
3\. Transformation of on-network group communication service into off-network
or legacy network based group communication service is accomplished among
group members for maintaining the group communication services even in the
worse disaster.
#### 9.9.1.4 Post-conditions
Off-network or legacy network based group communication among train driver,
customer service staff, or train operations staff is activated and group
communication service is maintained normally.

### 9.11.1 Description
The FRMCS Naming Authority (NA) is a registry service provided by FRMCS System
to facilitate the handling of various namespaces, number spaces or other
information sets needed to support FRMCS services.
For example, FRMCS User identification requires a registry to manage the
identification information which shall not be duplicated during its
registration process.

## 9.12 Wayside-Centric Automatic Train Control
### 9.12.1 Description
Signalling block system, which is a fundamental factor in the perspective of
train control, enables the safe and efficient operation of railways to avoid
collisions between trains. The signalling block system basically keep a train
away from entering the block occupied by the other train. It is commonly known
that moving block system compared to fixed block system. As shown in Figure
9.12-1, the train in moving block system can approach the leading train more
closely.
Figure 9.12-1 Examples of various railway block systems
One way to realize the moving block system is that a centralized server
communicates with trains and manages the moving block based on the positions
of the trains. The On-board Automatic Train Protection (OATP), which is on the
train, report the position of the train to the Wayside Automatic Train
Protection (WATP), and the WATP decides and provide the movement authority of
the train to the OATP. The train controls itself based on the movement
authority, and trigger brake when it approaches the border of its authorized
moving area.
### 9.12.2 Pre-conditions
1\. The user equipment dedicated to train control gets power-on, and registers
to the train control system.
2\. WATPs are located in the Packet Data Network (PDN), and each train knows
the nearby WATP which can offer a movement authority and make it move.
3\. The user equipment establish a connection through the 3GPP network for
transporting periodical data between WATP and OATP.
### 9.12.3 Service flows
1\. The OATP periodically report its position to the serving WATP.
2\. The WATP periodically provide movement authority to the OATP
3\. The train accelerates or triggers brake based on the last received
movement authority. It moves till the position that it is authorized to move,
and stops if it reaches to the border of the authorized area.
### 9.12.4 Post-conditions
The train triggers emergency brake and stops immediately if the connection is
lost and data is not received for a certain time from WATP.

## 9.13 Autonomous Train Control and Operation
### 9.13.1 Description
In legacy train control systems, trains typically decide its movement by
interacting with trackside devices (e.g. track circuits, balise, radio block
system) or communicating with a trackside server. If a train can autonomously
figure out the positions of the nearby trains and decide its movement
authority, the transport capacity of the railway will be enhanced. In the
autonomous train control system whose service concept is aligned to the eV2X
service, trains share its position by exchanging the information without any
centralized server, and each train decides how far it can be authorized to
move based on the position information. It is expected that main application
area will be mass transportation such as subway.
Figure 9.13.-1 An example of autonomous train control scenario
### 9.13.2 Pre-conditions
1\. Trains know the overall schedule, and the user equipment of each train is
connected to the user equipment of the other trains operating at the same
time.
2\. A user equipment of each train is able to establish a connection with the
object Controller for the nearby point machine.
### 9.13.3 Service Flows
1\. A train gets started and try registration to the currently operating
trains. The registration message includes the position of the train.
2\. The train gets the responses of the registration from the other trains and
estimates the positions of the trains.
3\. The train decides its movement authority based on the position information
and starts moving.
4\. The train positions in the corresponding areas are shared through
multicasting.
5\. Based on the periodically updated information, each train updates its
movement authority and conduct train control based on it.
6\. If needed, the train connects to the nearby point machine and sends switch
command.
### 9.13.4 Post-conditions
The autonomous train control is achieved by activating movement authority for
each train or activating object Controller for nearby point machine.

## 9.14 Virtual Coupling
### 9.14.1 Description
One of the important missions that the future railway service should achieve
is to increase its transport capacity. A straight-forward solution is to
minimize the distance between successive trains so that train interval is
reduced. It is difficult to do so in a legacy train control system, because
the successive trains need to have distance as much as a safety margin, which
should be larger than the full braking distance.
{width="6.741666666666666in" height="2.5006944444444446in"}
Figure 9.14-1 Sharing acceleration and braking control information to shorten
safety margin
This safety margin can be further shortened if the successive trains share
control information (acceleration and braking) and apply it to its own train
control. As shown in Figure 9.14.1, the safety margin can be shortened if the
following train immediately knows that the leading train starts braking and
also triggers braking. This is the fundamental principle and the main purpose
of virtual coupling. Figure 9.14.2 shows the basic concept of the virtual
coupling scenario. Multiple trains which are in close distance move together
_as they are physically coupled_. As the distance between two trains gets
smaller, the control information of a train should be delivered to the other
in shorter time.

1\. The leading and following trains in operation recognize each other and
have just got configured to be coupled virtually.
2\. The user equipments for train control support device to device
communications in the perspective of transport layer.
{width="5.739583333333333in" height="4.1875in"}
Figure 9.14-3 Overall procedure of virtual coupling
### 9.14.3 Service Flows
1\. The following train begins to approach to the leading train by exchanging
the information about their position. The two trains, which are far enough to
allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, are initially connected through
the 3GPP network.
2\. As the following train approaches to the leading train, they start
exchanging the information about movement control and each train then controls
itself while considering the control of the other train. The two trains, which
are still far enough to allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, keep the
connection through the 3GPP network.
3\. As the following train further approaches to the leading train, the safe
braking distance gets shorter and they are required to have a connection of
which end-to-end latency is very short for delicate train control. At this
moment, they seamlessly switch the connection from the 3GPP network to PC5
interface
### 9.14.4 Post-conditions
For safety train operation, integrity needs to be checked for train control
information delivery in the perspective of application or transport layer. Any
error on integrity check shall be immediately reported to the train control

## 9.15 Composite-based train operation
### 9.15.1 Description
This use case considers the composition and decomposition of trains or
tractions. One is the case, where two autonomous trains / traction (train A
and train B) are conducted as one composition (Train C). The other case
describes the decomposition of a train set (Train C) into autonomous train A
and train B. For these scenarios, specific FRMCS Equipment Identity management
need to be provided by the FRMCS System.
### 9.15.2 Pre-conditions
Train A and Train B share information for train operation such as position and
velocity profile.
### 9.15.3 Service Flows
**Train composition**
  1. Train/traction A and Train/traction B are autonomous trains and moving on different tracks.
  2. Train/traction A and the train/traction B are put together into one train composition using the same railway.
  3. Consequently, the different FRMCS UE identities of train/traction A and train/traction B are changed into common FRMCS UE identity composite train C/traction C.
**Train decomposition**
  1. Train/traction C which is the composition of train/traction A and train/traction B is moving along the railway.
  2. Based on the train routing i.e. different destination of train/traction A and train/traction B of train/traction A and train/traction B uses two different railway.
Consequently, the FRMCS UE identity of train/traction C is decomposed again
into FRCMS UE identities of train/traction A and train/traction B.
### 9.15.4 Post-conditions

## 12.9 Use case: Bearer flexibility
### 12.9.1 Description
FRMCS envisages bearer flexibility to allow a certain level of independence
between Railway Applications and the underlying transport system. FRMCS
includes wireless and wireline access. It comprises multiple access systems
and shall support various voice and data applications.
The rationale behind these requirements is that the lifecycle of railway
applications is in general much longer than the lifecycle of telecommunication
access/transport systems. Moreover, bearer flexibility aims at improving
service availability and performance.
The characteristics of bearer flexibility are:
  1. A Railway Application may use one or several access systems as > appropriate.
  2. Connection of FRMCS Equipment to different access systems is dynamic > (i.e. the most appropriate 3GPP or non-3GPP access technologies > are selected automatically, potentially using multiple access > technologies for one or more Railway Applications).
  3. The set of access systems chosen meets the defined QoS and the > service requirements e.g. FRMCS User mobility and connectivity > which are necessary to guarantee the functionality.
  4. The introduction of a new access system should not negatively impact > existing Railway Applications.
The approach taken within FRMCS allows the integration of 3GPP and non-3GPP
radio access evolution.
IP is used as a generic interface towards Railway Applications, facilitating
connectivity, quality of service control, security and the separation of
transport system and applications. NOTE: Non-3GPP access can consist of non-
terrestrial e.g. Satellite as well as of terrestrial access systems.
### 12.9.2 Pre-conditions
The Railway Adaptation Sub-System as part of the FRMCS System is embedded
between the Railway Applications and the Multi Access Core Network (MACN) and
enables the access system independence towards those applications. This Sub-
System adapts application characteristics to the access systems. It manages
e.g. QoS, address conversion, functional roles and train location information.
The MACN has the ability to manage and interwork with wireless access systems
(i.e. 3GPP and non-3GPP) as well as with wireline access systems. It
encompasses for example the management of FRMCS User mobility, FRMCS User
session/communication handling and control of end-to-end communication
prioritisation. The MACN interworks with legacy communication systems and
other FRMCS Systems.
The Access Control & Management function of the FRMCS Equipment is able to
manage the different access systems as well as access via GSM-R (for roaming
and simultaneous operation).
### 12.9.3 Service flows
**Case 1 (data communication)**
As an example the Automatic Train Control (ATC) application of a train
establishes a data communication session with the applicable ground
communication entity which is connected via the fixed network service. For ATC
message exchange, the on-board system can encompass a railway operated private
3GPP 4G access system and a public 3GPP 5G access system (e.g. a VPN service)
as part of the FRMCS System. ATC periodically reports train position
information and receives Control Command instructions from the ground
communication entity. The FRMCS Equipment is registered to both access systems
and uses these simultaneously if applicable.\ Simultaneous use of radio access
systems may improve communication resilience, availability, and QoS and
increases bandwidth.
The concept as described here can generally be extended to other data
communication applications and (non-)3GPP access systems.
**Case 2 (voice railway emergency communication)\** The on-board FRMCS Users
are registered to the FRMCS System. An on-board FRMCS User establishes a
Railway Emergency Communication (REC) from a specific location in the FRMCS
network. This particular communication request takes into account the most
appropriate radio access system, for example the railway-operated private 3GPP
network. The FRMCS System notifies the applicable users determined by the
location of the initiator of the communication by using all available access
system(s) e.g. 3GPP (public and private), WLAN or wireline. The applicable
Controller is notified via the wireline access system. The intended recipients
of the call may be using different access systems.
The concept as described here can in general be extended to other voice group
communication applications and point to point communication services.
**Case 3 (telemetry operation at a railway depot)\** A train is located in a
railway depot where only WLAN coverage (non-3GPP access) as part of the FRMCS
System is provided. FRMCS Users of this train are attached to the FRMCS
System. An FRMCS User starts a data session towards the applicable vehicle
diagnostic entity. At that point in time WLAN provides the radio access system
for this telemetry communication. Once the train leaves the depot and enters
into a 3GPP coverage area, the FRMCS Equipment adapts the transmission of the
telemetry data session to the most QoS effective radio access system (3GPP
access). The telemetry session continues uninterrupted when the train changes
its location.
The concept as described here can in general be extended to other voice and
data applications where other combinations of access systems at specific
locations are possible.
**Case 4 (Backup operation/resilience)**
In a certain area with dedicated 3GPP access, coverage fails. Despite
unavailability of the dedicated railway 3GPP access, FRMCS Users have the
capability to continue communications by using public 3GPP access using an
access system which may support the required or some degraded form of QoS and
which is provided in the area and which serves as a backup or complementary
system. Communication applications on trains continue to operate, service
continuity is preserved. When the functionality of the dedicated 3GPP access
system is restored, the FRMCS Equipment resumes operation on that system.
The concept as described here can generally be extended to any combination of
access systems, e.g. WLAN and private 3GPP access.
**Case 5 (Notification of radio bearer availability)**
In general, there is only little radio spectrum resources allocated to
railways in most regions.These should be preferably used for operational rail
communication purposes. In parallel, there are communications that require
broadband wireless communication services. The availability of broadband
wireless access can be limited e.g. to railway stations. Thus, the FRMCS
System is able to take into account radio bearer availability at the FRMCS
User's position allowing to start communication such as a file download/upload
not harming operational rail communication.
### 12.9.4 Post-conditions
**Case 1 (data communication)\** The train controlled by ATC arrives on time
without service interruptions of the communication .
**Case 2 (voice railway emergency communication)\** Railway emergency voice
communication is established to all FRMCS-users in the designated area
independent of the used access network.
**Case 3 (telemetry operation at a railway depot)\** Telemetry communication
continued while relocating the train/vehicle.
**Case 4 (Backup operation/resilience)\** Communication continued when the
private 3GPP access is unavailable in an area.

## 12.10 Use Case: QoS in a railway environment
### 12.10.1 Introduction
This system principle use case provides the framework for Quality of Service
within the FRMCS System including the railway applications. The main purpose
is to specify the list of attributes applicable to the FRMCS bearer service.
Railway applications require a QoS classification ranging from high to low as
low is "best effort". The most important QoS parameters that determine the
quality of the transport system are latency of the user data and reliability
of the communication. In addition, guaranteed bandwidth assures the
continuation of critical communication.
QoS impacts train punctuality and the entire utilisation of the track system.
Therefore the FRMCS System has to consider the various QoS requirements.
Apart from high train speed operation, which goes up to 500kmh^-1^, other
fundamental factors affect wireless communication. Railways are facing various
radio signal propagation conditions such as in free space and in tunnels. Free
space encompasses various structural and constructional scenarios. Railway
corridors in hilly terrain or forest aisle are some examples.
Radio propagation in large railway stations and shunting yards is different
from the one of the main lines. Moving trains in stations or moving cargo
wagons in shunting yards cause different propagation conditions.
Radio tower site-to-site distance requires special attention. This distance
varies depending on the type of area (rural or urban) and is determined by the
boundary conditions of the RF signal (e.g. frequency band and power budget).
Railways clearly require to deploy FRMCS while keeping the same distance
between the radio towers in order to reuse the infrastructure deployed for
GSM-R.
## 12.10.2 Use case: Quality of Service and railway environment
#### 12.10.2.1 Description
The basis for this use case is the UIC FRMCS URS wherein communication
attributes define the QoS to be achieved for the various kinds of railway
applications. These attributes are not part of the functional use case
description but relevant for the FRMCS System and therefore subject of this
use case.
Regarding the URS communication attributes, not all attributes are covered in
the QoS use case. The following items are considered:
  * Type of communication
  * Latency, the delay between action and reaction
  * Session Reliability
  * Setup of communication, the time to establish a voice or data communication session
For further details refer to the corresponding use case in chapters 5 -- 9\.
In these chapters the QoS requirements are specified on functional level. A
reference is used which refers to real values' in this QoS use case.
#### 12.10.2.2 Pre-conditions
The pre-conditions of the functional use cases out of chapter 5 -- 9 are
applicable.
#### 12.10.2.3 Service flows
The service flows of the functional use cases out chapter 5 -- 9 are
applicable.
**Application categories**
Application categories describe the data transfer characteristic to be
achieved by a bearer service. The FRMCS System shall consider the following
user plane application categories:
> **Voice** for user to user or multiuser communication; Voice follows the
> typical conversational pattern requires low delay inside the transport
> system;
>
> **Critical Voice** follows the voice conversational pattern but requires
> immediate session setup;
>
> **Video** used for visual train remote control or observations purposes;
> Video requires low jitter;
>
> **Critical Video** used for door monitoring by the Driver, passenger
> surveillance, driverless mode in urban rail;
>
> **Very critical data** for future rail applications;
>
> **Critical data** follows the response pattern requires high reliable
> transport. This category comprises future and legacy application e.g. ETCS;
>
> **Non-Critical data** used for the exchange of railway system or
> communication relevant information; requires high reliable transmission and
> preservation of the response pattern;
>
> **Messaging** for the exchange of non-critical short information messages,
> recorded voice (for example voicemail), data, pictures, video; requires
> reliable transmission;
**Priority Level**
In order to reach the QoS applicable for each application category, transport
priority levels are required to differentiate among the application
categories.
**Service Attributes**
From FRMCS User point of view there are two main service attributes latency
and communication reliability.
For the **Latency** two classifications are applicable:
> Low User data delay harms the functioning of the application.
>
> Normal User data delay does not harm the sequence and progress of the
> application.
From FRMCS System point of view, latency quantifies the end-to-end user data
transport delay between the involved communication entities.
**Reliability (%):** the amount of sent network layer packets successfully
delivered to a given node within the time constraint required by the targeted
service, divided by the total number of sent network layer packets.
Two levels are to be taken into account:
> High The packet loss at transport level is exceptional rare.
>
> Normal The packet loss at transport level is seldom.
From the FRMCS System point of view, transport reliability quantifies the end-
to-end packet loss (from one FRMCS Equipment to another FRMCS Equipment)
between the involved communication entities.
To meet the different application characteristics e.g. conversational pattern,
real-time or critical data further itemisation is necessary. The mapping of
the service attributes latency and reliability among functional requirements
and FRMCS System as well as their target values are summarised in Table 1-1.
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Service | FRMCS - | FRMCS -- | Service | | Attribute | Functional | System | Attribute | | | Requirement | Requirement | value | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Latency | Low | Ultra-Low | â‰¤10ms | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | | Low | â‰¤100ms | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | Normal | Normal | â‰¤500ms | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | | Best Effort | >500ms | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Transport | High | Ultra-Low | 99.9999% | | reliability - | | | | | | | | | | Packet Loss | | | | | (%) | | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | | Low | 99.9% | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | Normal | Normal | 99% | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
Table 12.10-1 - Service attribute mapping
Some application categories are time stringent e.g. critical voice or critical
data.
The applications are considered as real-time when the FRMCS functional
requirement for the latency is specified as "Low", according to table 12.10 1.
**Session handling**
**Setup time** of a session is essential because of their safety related
character. Session setup encompasses the value of the elapsed time between the
establishment request and the indication of successful session establishment.
The FRMCS User requires two classes:
> **Immediate** The FRMCS-user requires immediate setup of the session. The
> duration of the immediate session establishment shall not exceed 1 second.
>
> **Normal** Normal session setup time range does not harm the use of the
> application. The time duration of the normal session establishment shall not
> exceed 3 seconds.
**Session Loss Rate (SLR)** indicates the number of sessions released
unintentionally per accumulated session time. SLR shall be \ Rural environment: between 5 - 7km.

# 13 Potential New Requirements
This chapter lists the potential new requirements that have been considered
for introduction in Rel-15 normative specifications. Only parts of "9.3 Role
management and presence" and "9.7 Multi user talker control related use cases"
were introduced. All other requirements identified in the TR above but not
listed below are not covered in Rel-15.
The third column "SA1 spec covering" identifies the specification and the
requirement number within that specification where the 22.889 requirement with
the number as specified in the first column of the table is covered. The
fourth column provide additional explanation if needed.
# 14 Conclusion and Recommendations
This TR provides use cases and potential requirements for Railway
Communication. It is proposed to start normative work based on these potential
requirements.
Where applicable, it is proposed to include the requirements identified by
this work into the set of existing stage 1 missing critical and other
specifications.
Requirements not fitting to any existing specification are proposed to go into
a new TS.
###### ### Annex A: Examples of Role management
This annex gives some examples on how Role management is used in the railway
environment. This is to better understand the use.
**[Functional identity]{.underline}**
Every operational railway function e.g. train driver, a shunter or Controller
is identified by their functions. A non-exhaustive list is provided in the
table underneath.
* * *
Functional identities Leading train driver Driver 2 Driver 3 Shunting leader
Shunting member Track side maintenance leader Track side maintenance member
Primary train controller Secondary train controller Power controller Shunting
controller Trackside maintenance controller Platform inspector Public
announcement Chief conductor Second conductor Third conductor Catering staff
chief Diagnostics
* * *
In order to make a function of a user known to other users, the user has to
register itself to a specific functional identity.
For example, user can be authorised by the railway undertaking to be a train
driver (functional Role) of a train. When the Driver starts the scheduled
train ride, from A to B at time x, the train running schedule assigns a
specific train running number for this train. In principle the train keeps
this number for the complete journey. The train driver uses his communication
equipment to register himself, as the leading train driver (functional Role),
of train number 123 (functional identity). After registration the train driver
is now registered to the FRMCS System as the leading train driver of train
123. In some cases there can be multiple Drivers on one train so the
individual Drivers can register themselves accordingly.
**[FRMCS Equipment Type]{.underline}**
The equipment used in the railway environment can be very specific. The FRMCS
Equipment is constituted of an UE and the FRMCS Application on this UE. This
depends on the location and situation the equipment is used. The following
different equipment types can be used, as an example:
* * *
Equipment type Equipment Capabilities (Examples) Cabin radio Emergency button,
external loudspeaker Shunting radio Loudspeaker, hands free Trackside
maintenance radio  
Security staff radio Emergency button, public emergency call button Catering
staff radio  
Train controller device Emergency button, call to maintenance staff button,
call to power controllers button Shunting controller device  
Sensor No HMI
* * *
These different types of FRMCS Equipment are relevant for the registration
process of functional identities. For example a train driver cannot register
to a functional identity using a FRMCS Equipment which is not fit for the
train driver to perform his Role. So a train driver cannot perform a
registration as train driver of train 123 if he uses a catering staff FRMCS
Equipment (where there is no train emergency button available, no loudspeaker
and handset, etc.). The registration request will be rejected by the FRMCS
System.
The FRMCS Equipment shall also be reachable based on the identity of the FRMCS
Equipment. For example the cabin radio of a specific train can be reached by
their FRMCS Equipment Identity.
**[FRMCS-user identity]{.underline}**
The railway employee (a specific person) is also reachable even if no
functional identity has been assigned. This is done by using a unique FRMCS-
user identity. This can be an E.164 number, any other number according to a
specific railways numbering plan or by fully qualified domain names (FQDN).
Such a number or FQDN is dedicated/ assigned to a specific railway employee.
After the employee has performed the log-in procedure to the FRMCS System, he
is reachable via his individual FRMCS-user identity.
###### ### Annex B: Minimum functional and performance requirements for FRMCS
from a perspective of Korea LTE-based railway services
In this annex, minimum functional and performance requirements [5]-[6] are
introduced for FRMCS from a perspective of Korea\'s LTE-based railway
services. Here, the term 'minimum' is used from the fact that the requirements
are expected to be satisfied even with previous Rel. version of 3GPP LTE.
Specifically, all the functionalities and performance requirements except for
the high speed (500km/h) listed in the above have been shown to be fully
supported by LTE Rel. 9, which have been validated in a commercial railway
with a length of 54.2km [7]. Also, train control service named as Korea Radio-
Based Train Control System (KRTCS) has been shown to be feasible by handling
priorities among multiple data, where the level of KRTCS is equivalent to
European Train Control System (ETCS) level 3 in a train control perspective.
All the specific test scenarios regarding functional and performance
requirements including KRTCS have been validated in a commercial railway [8].
For promising FRMCS supporting LTE Rel. 15, more enhanced and sophisticated
requirements should be provided. In that sense, these requirements can be
considered as basic functional and performance requirements for FRMCS.
**[Minimum functional requirements]{.underline}**
In a communication perspective, the followings can be minimum functional
requirements for LTE based railway communication systems. The contents of each
function and each digital radio equipment are described in detail in [5]-[6].
