# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 25.141 section 4 defines Test
Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545.
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home Base Stations
unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 99, 4 and 5.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.

Normally it should be sufficient for all tests to be conducted using normal
test conditions except where otherwise stated. For guidance on the use of test
conditions to be used in order to show compliance refer to TS 25.141.
## 4.5 Applicability of requirements
For BS that is UTRA (single-RAT) capable only, the requirements in the present
document are applicable and additional conformance to TS 37.104 [10] is
optional. For a BS additionally conforming to TS 37.104 [10], conformance to
some of the RF requirements in the present document can be demonstrated
through the corresponding requirements in TS 37.104 [10] as listed in Table
4.2.
Table 4.2: Alternative RF minimum requirements for a BS additionally
conforming to TS 37.104 [10]
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | RF requirement | Clause in the | Alternative clause | | | present document | in TS 37.104 [10] | +======================+======================+======================+ | Base station output | 6.2 | 6.2.1 | | power | | | | | | 6.2.2 | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Unwanted emissions | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Spectrum emission | 6.6.2.1 | 6.6.2 (except for | | mask | | 6.6.2.3 and 6.6.2.4) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Transmitter spurious | 6.6.3 (except for | 6.6.1 (except for | | emissions | 6.6.3.8) | 6.6.1.1.3) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Transmitter | 6.7.1 | 6.7.1 | | intermodulation | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Narrowband blocking | 7.5.1 | 7.4.2 | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Blocking | 7.5.1 | 7.4.1 | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Out-of-band blocking | 7.5.1 | 7.5.1 | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Co-location with | 7.5.2, 7.5.3 | 7.5.2 | | other base stations | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Receiver spurious | 7.7.1 | 7.6.1 | | emissions | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Intermodulation | 7.6.1 | 7.7.1 | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Narrowband | 7.6.1 | 7.7.2 | | intermodulation | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
## 4.6 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where the BS operates can either be contiguous or non-
contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum operation
and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply also
inside the sub-block gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the
limits apply relative to the sub-block edges.
## 4.7 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, spectrum emission mask, ACLR,
transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions requirements apply
to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.

## 5.3 Tx-Rx frequency separation
a) UTRA/FDD is designed to operate with the following TX-RX frequency
separation:
Table 5.0A: Tx-Rx frequency separation
* * *
Operating Band TX-RX frequency separation I 190 MHz II 80 MHz III 95 MHz IV
400 MHz V 45 MHz VI 45 MHz VII 120 MHz VIII 45 MHz IX 95 MHz X 400 MHz XI 48
MHz XII 30 MHz XIII 31 MHz XIV 30 MHz XIX 45 MHz XX 41 MHz XXI 48 MHz XXII 100
MHz XXV 80 MHz XXVI 45MHz
* * *
b) UTRA/FDD can support both fixed and variable transmit to receive frequency
separation.
c) The use of other transmit to receive frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
d) When configured to operate in DC-HSDPA with a single UL frequency, the TX-
RX frequency separation in Table 5.0A shall be applied for the serving HS-DSCH
cell. For bands XII, XIII and XIV, the TX-RX frequency separation in Table
5.0A shall be the minimum spacing between the UL and either of the DL
carriers.
e) When configured to operate on dual cells in both the DL and UL, the TX-RX
frequency separation in Table 5.0A shall be applied to the primary UL
frequency and DL frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary
UL frequency and the frequency of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
respectively.
f) When configured to operate on single/dual band 4C-HSDPA or single band
8C-HSDPA or single band NC-4C-HSDPA with a single UL frequency, the TX-RX
frequency separation in Table 5.0A shall be applied for the DL frequency of
the serving HS-DSCH cell. When configured to operate on single/dual band
4C-HSDPA or single band 8C-HSDPA or single band NC-4C-HSDPA with dual UL
frequencies, the TX-RX frequency separation in Table 5.0A shall be applied to
the primary UL frequency and DL frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to
the secondary UL frequency and the frequency of the 1st secondary serving HS-
DSCH cell respectively.
g) For bands XII, XIII and XIV, the requirements in TS 25.104 are applicable
only for a single uplink carrier frequency, however dual cell uplink operation
may be considered in future releases.
h) When configured to operate on dual band dual cell HSDPA or dual band
4C-HSDPA with dual band UL frequencies, the TX-RX frequency separation in
Table 5.0A shall be applied to the primary UL frequency and DL frequency of
the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary UL frequency and the frequency
of the 1st secondary serving HS-DSCH cell respectively.
## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to table 5.1A, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 5.4.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN). For each operating Band, the UARFCN values are
defined as follows:
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 5.1 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 5.1A.

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of transmit diversity, DB-DC-
HSDPA or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter
antenna connector.
A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously. A
BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously on adjacent carrier
frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
Figure 6.1: Transmitter test ports
## 6.2 Base station output power
Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
Rated output power, Prated,c, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna
connector.
### 6.2.1 Base station maximum output power
Maximum output power, Pmax,c, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference condition.
The rated output power, Prated,c, of the BS shall be as specified in Table
6.0A.
Table 6.0A: Base station rated output power
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | BS class | Prated,c | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wide Area BS | - (note) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Medium Range BS | [\ Maximum code domain power: BS maximum output power - 3 dB or greater
>
> Minimum code domain power: BS maximum output power - 28 dB or less
### 6.4.3 Total power dynamic range
The total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and the
minimum output power for a specified reference condition.
NOTE: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the BS maximum output power. The
lower limit of the dynamic range is the lowest minimum power from the BS when
no traffic channels are activated.
#### 6.4.3.1 Minimum requirement
The downlink (DL) total power dynamic range shall be 18 dB or greater.
### 6.4.4 Primary CPICH power
Primary CPICH (P-CPICH) power is the code domain power of the Primary Common
Pilot Channel. P-CPICH power is indicated on the BCH..
#### 6.4.4.1 Minimum requirement
The difference between the P-CPICH power transmitted at the antenna connector
and the P-CPICH power indicated on the BCH shall be within ±2.1 dB.
### 6.4.4A Secondary CPICH power
Secondary CPICH (S-CPICH) power is the code domain power of the Secondary
Common Pilot Channel. S-CPICH power is equal to the sum of the P-CPICH power
and the power offset, which are signalled to the UE. The power offset is
signalled in the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO\", for MIMO mode as
defined in section 10.3.6.41b in TS 25.331 [11].
When the UE supports MIMO mode with four transmit antennas, the power offset
of S-CPICH on antenna 2 is signalled in the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH for
MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna2\" as defined in section
10.3.6.143 in TS 25.331 [11]. The power offset of S-CPICH on antenna 3 and 4
is signalled in the IE \"Common Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with
four transmit antennas on Antenna3 and 4\", as defined in section 10.3.6.143
in TS 25.331 [11].
#### 6.4.4A.1 Minimum Requirement for MIMO mode
The difference between P-CPICH power transmitted at the first antenna
connector and the S-CPICH power transmitted at the second antenna connector
shall be within ±2 dB of the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO\".
Note: The accuracy level of the power offset for S-CPICH may affect both MIMO
HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI reporting performance.
#### 6.4.4A.2 Minimum Requirement for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas
The difference between P-CPICH power transmitted at the first antenna
connector and the S-CPICH power transmitted at the second antenna connector
shall be within ±2 dB of the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with
four transmit antennas on Antenna2\".
The difference between P-CPICH power transmitted at the first antenna
connector and the S-CPICH power transmitted at the third and four antenna
connector shall be within ±2 dB of the IE \"Common Power Offset for S-CPICH
for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna3 and 4\".
Note: The accuracy level of the power offset for S-CPICH transmitted on
antennas 2, 3 and 4 may affect both MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI
reporting performance.
### 6.4.4B Demodulation CPICH power for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas
Demodulation CPICH (D-CPICH) power is the code domain power of the
Demodulation Common Pilot Channel. D-CPICH power is equal to the sum of the
P-CPICH power and the power offset, which are signalled to the UE. The power
offset of D-CPICH on antenna 3 and 4 is signalled in the IE "Common Power
Offset for D-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna3 and
4\", as defined in section 10.3.6.143 in TS 25.331 [11].
#### 6.4.4B.1 Minimum Requirement
The difference between P-CPICH power transmitted at the first antenna
connector and the D-CPICH power transmitted at the third and four antenna
connector shall be within ±2 dB of the IE \"Common Power Offset for D-CPICH
for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna3 and 4\".
Note 1: The accuracy level of the power offset for D-CPICH transmitted on
antennas 2, 3 and 4 may affect both MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI
reporting performance.
Note 2: At high geometry level PDSCH performance may be affected if D-CPICH is
not scheduled.
### 6.4.5 IPDL time mask
To support IPDL location method, the Node B shall interrupt all transmitted
signals in the downlink (i.e. common and dedicated channels).
The IPDL time mask specifies the limits of the BS output power during these
idle periods.
The requirement in this section shall apply to BS supporting IPDL.
#### 6.4.5.1 Minimum Requirement
The mean power measured over a period starting 27 chips after the beginning of
the IPDL period and ending 27 chips before the expiration of the IPDL period
shall be equal to or less than
BS maximum output power - 35 dB
see also Figure 6.1A.
Figure 6.1A: IPDL Time Mask
The requirement applies to all output powers within the total power dynamic
range as specified in subclause 6.4.3.
### 6.4.6 Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection
The Home BS shall be capable of adjusting the transmitter output power to
minimize the interference level on the adjacent channels licensed to other
operators in the same geographical area while optimize the Home BS coverage.
These requirements are only applicable to Home BS. The requirements in this
clause are applicable for AWGN radio propagation conditions.
The output power, Pout, of the Home BS shall be as specified in Table 6.3
under the following input conditions:
\- CPICH Êc, measured in dBm, is the code power of the Primary CPICH on one of
the adjacent channels present at the Home BS antenna connector for the CPICH
received on the adjacent channels. If Tx diversity is applied on the Primary
CPICH, CPICH Êc shall be the sum in [W] of the code powers of the Primary
CPICH transmitted from each antenna.
\- Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received power density, including
signals and interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, present at the
Home BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.
In case that both adjacent channels are licensed to other operators, the most
stringent limit shall apply for Pout. In case the Home BS's operating channel
and both adjacent channels are licensed to the same operator, the requirements
of this clause do not apply.
The input conditions defined for the requirements in this section are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For Home BS receivers with
diversity, the requirements apply to each antenna connector separately, with
the other one(s) terminated or disabled .The requirements are otherwise
unchanged. For Home BS(s) without measurement capability, a reference antenna
with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for converting these power levels into field
strength requirements.

## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter via the antenna.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a WCDMA interfering signal is injected into the antenna
connector at a power level of 30 dB lower than the rated total output power in
the operating band.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply regardless of
the interfering signals position relative to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For multi-carrier operation, the interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the lower/upper edge of the wanted signal or edge of sub-block inside a
gap. The interfering signal frequency offset shall be as in Table 6.21.
Table 6.21: Interfering signal frequency offset
+---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Parameter | Value | +=========================================================+===========+ | Interfering signal centre frequency offset from the | -5 MHz | | wanted signal centre frequency | | | | -10 MHz | | | | | | -15 MHz | | | | | | +5 MHz | | | | | | +10 MHz | | | | | | +15 MHz | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Interfering signal centre frequency offset from the | -2.5 MHz | | lower/upper edge of the wanted signal or edge of | | | sub-block inside a gap | -7.5 MHz | | | | | | -12.5 MHz | | | | | | +2.5 MHz | | | | | | +7.5 MHz | | | | | | +12.5 MHz | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | NOTE 1: Interference frequencies that are outside of | | | any allocated frequency band for UTRA-FDD downlink | | | specified in subclause 5.2 are excluded from the | | | requirement, unless the interfering signal positions | | | fall within the frequency range of adjacent downlink | | | operating bands in the same geographical area. | | | | | | NOTE 2: NOTE 1 is not applied in Band I, III, VI, VIII, | | | IX, XI, XIX, XXI, and XXXII operating within | | | 1475.9-1495.9MHz, in certain regions. | | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
### 6.7.1 Minimum requirement
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band
emission or the spurious emission requirements of clauses 6.6.2 and 6.6.3 in
the presence of a WCDMA interfering signal with a power level 30 dB lower than
the rated total output power in the operating band.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement is also applicable
inside a Inter RF Bandwidth gap for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
## 6.8 Transmit modulation
Transmit modulation is specified in three parts, Frequency Error, Error Vector
Magnitude and Peak Code Domain Error. These specifications are made with
reference to a theoretical modulated waveform.
The theoretical modulated waveform is created by modulating a carrier at the
assigned carrier frequency using the same data as was used to generate the
measured waveform. The chip modulation rate for the theoretical waveform shall
be exactly 3.84 Mcps. The code powers of the theoretical waveform shall be the
same as the measured waveform, rather than the nominal code powers used to
generate the test signal.
### 6.8.1 Transmit pulse shape filter
The transmit pulse-shaping filter is a root-raised cosine (RRC) with roll-off
α =0.22 in the frequency domain. The impulse response of the chip impulse
filter _RC_ ~0~(_t_) is
Where the roll-off factor α = 0.22 and the chip duration:
### 6.8.2 Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine filter
with bandwidth 3.84 MHz and roll-off α =0.22. Both waveforms are then further
modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and
chip clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %. The measurement interval is one
timeslot as defined by the C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement
interval is one timeslot starting with the beginning of the SCH. [
]{.underline} The requirement is valid over the total power dynamic range as
specified in subclause 6.4.3.
#### 6.8.2.1 Minimum requirement
The Error Vector Magnitude shall not be worse than 17.5 % when the base
station is transmitting a composite signal using only QPSK modulation.
The Error Vector Magnitude shall not be worse than 12.5 % when the base
station is transmitting a composite signal that includes 16QAM modulation.
### 6.8.3 Peak code Domain error
The Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 6.8.2) onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. The
Code Domain Error for every code in the domain is defined as the ratio of the
mean power of the projection onto that code, to the mean power of the
composite reference waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak Code
Domain Error is defined as the maximum value for the Code Domain Error for all
codes. The measurement interval is one timeslot as defined by the C-PICH (when
present) otherwise the measurement interval is one timeslot starting with the
beginning of the SCH.
#### 6.8.3.1 Minimum requirement
The peak code domain error shall not exceed -33 dB at spreading factor 256.
### 6.8.4 Time alignment error
This requirement applies to frame timing in Tx diversity, MIMO transmission,
DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA, 4C-HSDPA, NC-4C-HSDPA, 8C-HSDPA and their combinations.
Frames of the WCDMA signals present at the BS transmitter antenna port(s) are
not perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals
present at the BS transmitter antenna port(s) experience certain timing
differences.
For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode,
Time Alignment Error (TAE) is defined as the largest timing difference between
any two signals.
#### 6.8.4.1 Minimum Requirements
For MIMO or TX diversity transmissions, in each cell, TAE shall not exceed ¼
T~c~.
For transmission of multiple cells, with or without MIMO or TX diversity, in
the same frequency band, TAE shall not exceed ½ T~c~.
For transmission of multiple cells, with or without MIMO or TX diversity, in
different frequency bands, TAE shall not exceed 5 T~c~.
### 6.8.5 Relative Code Domain Error for 64QAM modulation
The Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 6.8.2) onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. Only
the active code channels in the composite reference waveform are considered
for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for every active code is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection onto that code,
to the mean power of the active code in the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame.
The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for 64QAM
modulated codes.
#### 6.8.5.1 Minimum requirement
The average Relative Code Domain Error for 64QAM modulated codes shall not
exceed -21 dB at spreading factor 16.
# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply for
each receiver antenna connector.
For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of
the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel frequency of the
lowest carrier frequency used and positive offsets of the interfering signal
apply relative to the assigned channel frequency of the highest carrier
frequency used.
A BS supporting DC-HSUPA receives two cells simultaneously on adjacent carrier
frequencies.
A BS supporting DB-DC-HSUPA receives two cells simultaneously in different
operating bands.
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. The requirements in clause 7
shall be met with the transmitter(s) on. If any external apparatus such as a
RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS is configured to transmit and
receive at the same time. The transmitter may be off for some of the tests as
specified in 25.141.
Figure 7.1: Receiver test ports
## 7.2 Reference sensitivity level
The reference sensitivity level is the minimum mean power received at the
antenna connector at which the Bit Error Ratio (BER) shall not exceed the
specific value indicated in section 7.2.1.
### 7.2.1 Minimum requirement
Using the reference measurement channel specification in Annex A, the
reference sensitivity level and performance of the BS shall be as specified in
Table 7.1.
Table 7.1: BS reference sensitivity levels
* * *
BS Class Reference measurement channel data rate BS reference sensitivity

kbps -107 BER shall not exceed 0.001
* * *
### 7.2.2 Maximum Frequency Deviation for Receiver Performance
The need for such a requirement is for further study.
## 7.3 Dynamic range
Receiver dynamic range is the receiver ability to handle a rise of
interference in the reception frequency channel. The receiver shall fulfil a
specified BER requirement for a specified sensitivity degradation of the
wanted signal in the presence of an interfering AWGN signal in the same
reception frequency channel.
### 7.3.1 Minimum requirement
The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 7.2.
Table 7.2: Dynamic range

signal -73 -63 -59 -39 dBm/3.84 MHz Note 1: For Home BS, this additional
requirement ensures the performance is met over a large dynamic range.
* * *
## 7.4 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the center
frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receiver filter
attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receiver filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
The interference signal is offset from the wanted signal by the frequency
offset Fuw. The interference signal shall be a W-CDMA signal as specified in
Annex C.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-
block gap size is at least 5MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and is
equal to -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz, respectively.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is
at least 5MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap
and is equal to -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz, respectively.
### 7.4.1 Minimum requirement
The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 7.3.

### 7.4.2 Minimum requirement - Co-location with UTRA-TDD
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with UTRA-TDD on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS
minimum coupling loss.
Further information and analysis for this scenario can be found in TR 25.942
[4].
## 7.5 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristics are measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an unwanted
interferer on frequencies other than those of the adjacent channels. The
interferences are either a WDCMA signal for in-band blocking or a CW signal
for out-of-band blocking. The blocking performance requirement applies as
specified in the tables 7.4 to 7.5B below, using a 1 MHz step size.
NOTE: The minimum requirements for Home BS when co-located with DECT and
WiFi/WLAN are FFS.
### 7.5.1 Minimum requirement
The static reference performance as specified in clause 7.2.1 shall be met
with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
following parameters.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the
sub-block gap size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and is
equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap,
in case the sub-block gap size is at least 400kHz or 600kHz, depending on the
operating band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and is equal to
-200kHz/+200kHz or -300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF bandwidth edges inside the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the exception
that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands
according to Tables 7.4, 7.4A and 7.4B shall be excluded from the out-of-band
blocking requirement.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap size is at least 400kHz or 600kHz, depending on the operating
band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to
-200kHz/+200kHz or -300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.

### 7.5.2 Minimum Requirement - Co-location with GSM, DCS, PCS, CDMA, UTRA
and/or E-UTRA, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA TDD and/or NR
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of FDD
BS receivers when GSM, DCS, PCS, CDMA, UTRA BS, E-UTRA and/or NR are co-
located with a UTRA FDD BS.
The requirements in this chapter assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
transmitter and receiver. If BSs of different classes are co‑sited, the
coupling loss should be increased by the value as stated in TR 25.942 [4]
chapter 10.3 in Table 10.1 and Table 10.2.
For a Wide Area (WA) FDD BS, the static reference performance as specified in
clause 7.2.1 shall be met with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
BS antenna input using the parameters in Table 7.5C.
Table 7.5C: Blocking performance requirement for Wide Area BS when co-located
with BS in other bands.

# 8 Performance requirement
## 8.1 General
Performance requirements for the BS are specified for the measurement channels
defined in Annex A and the propagation conditions in Annex B. The requirements
only apply to those measurement channels that are supported by the base
station. For FRC8 in Annex 9 and Annex 17 the Non E-DPCCH boosting and E-DPCCH
boosting requirement only apply for the option supported by the base station.
The performance requirements for the high speed train conditions which
scenarios defined in Annex B.4A are optional.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single cell
only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements. The requirements in clause 8
shall be met with the transmitter(s) on.
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS is configured to transmit and
receive at the same time. The transmitter may be off for some of the tests as
specified in 25.141.
For BS with dual receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements with Rx diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ shall be applied
separately at each antenna port.
For BS without receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements without Rx diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ shall be
applied at the BS Rx antenna port.
The E~b~/N~0~ used in this section is defined as:
Where:
is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH, E-DPDCH, S-E-
DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per antenna from all paths.
is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise sources
is the number of chips per frame
is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

## 8.10B Performance of ACK/NACK detection for 8C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH
This requirement only applies to NodeB supporting 8C-HSDPA.
In 8C-HSDPA two identical HS-DPCCH channels similar to the 4C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH
are used and they are transmitted by means of I/Q multiplexing. One HS-DPCCH
is serving carriers 1 to 4, while the other HS-DPCCH is serving carriers 5 to
8. The same performance requirements as for 4C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH, as defined in
section 8.10A, shall apply for both I and Q HS-DPCCH channels.
Performance requirements are specified for the reference measurement channel
of HS-DPCCH and two propagation conditions: static and multi-path fading case
1. The reference measurement channel for HS-DPCCH is defined in Annex A.8A.
The propagation conditions are defined in Annex B.1 and B.2.
## 8.11 Demodulation of E-DPDCH in multipath fading condition
The performance requirement of the E-DPDCH in multi path fading condition is
determined by the minimum throughput, R. For the test parameters specified in
Table 8.18, the minimum requirements are specified in Table 8.19. For a BS
supporting DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA the requirements for FRC1, FRC2, FRC3 and
FRC8 shall apply on each cell.

are non-fading channel models with two taps. The moving propagation condition
has two tap, one static, Path0, and one moving, Path1. The time difference
between the two paths is according Equation (B.1). The parameters for the
equation are shown in Table B.2. The taps have equal strengths and equal
phases.

# B.4 Birth-Death propagation conditions
The dynamic propagation conditions for the test of the baseband performance is
a non-fading propagation channel with two taps. The birth-death propagation
conditions has two taps, Path1 and Path2 which alternate between \'birth\' and
\'death\'. The positions the paths appear are randomly selected with an equal
probability rate and are shown in Figure B.2. For BS with receiver diversity,
the same path positions shall be applied to both receiver antenna connectors,
and the path switching times shall be synchronized on the two receiver antenna
connectors, but the AWGN signals applied to the two receiver antenna
connectors shall be uncorrelated.

# B.4A High speed train conditions
High speed train conditions are as follows:
Scenario 1: Open space
Scenario 2: Tunnel with leaky cable
Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas
The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are 2
non fading propagation channels (scenario 1 and 3) and 1 fading propagation
channel (scenario 2) with one tap. For BS with Rx diversity defined in
scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same between anttenas.
For scenario 1 and 3, Doppler shift is given by:

where is the Doppler shift and is the maximum Doppler frequency. The cosine of
angle is given by

, (B.4)
, (B.5)
where is the initial distance of the train from BS, and is BS-Railway track
distance, both in meters; is the velocity of the train in m/s, is time in
seconds.
For scenario 2, Rician fading is considered where Rician factor, _K_ is
defined as the ratio between the dominant signal power and the variant of the
other weaker signals.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation B.2 and B.3-B.5
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table B.2A and the
resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure B.3 and B.4 are applied for all
frequency bands.

###### ## Annex C (normative): Characteristics of the W-CDMA interference
signal
The W-CDMA interference signal shall be a DPCH containing the DPCCH and one
DPDCH. The data content for each channelization code shall be uncorrelated
with each other and to the wanted signal and spread and modulated according to
clause 4 of TS25.213 [6]. Further characteristics of DPDCH and DPCCH are
specified in table C.1.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Regional requirement for protection of DTT
The European Communications Committee (ECC) has adopted the "ECC Decision on
harmonised conditions for Mobile/Fixed Communications Networks operating in
the band 790-862 MHz" [9] applicable for BS operating in band XX. The decision
defines a requirement for "Out-of-block BEM baseline requirements for
'mobile/fixed communications network' (MFCN) base stations within the spectrum
allocated to the broadcasting (DTT) service", where three different cases A,
B, and C for protecting broadcasting DTT are defined. These cases can be
applied on a per-channel and/or per-region basis, i.e. for the same channel
different cases can be applied in different geographic areas (e.g. area
related to DTT coverage) and different cases can be applied to different
channels in the same geographic area.
For band XX, compliance with the regulatory requirements in Europe referenced
above can be assessed based on the manufacturer's declaration of P~EM,N~
specified in subclause 6.6.2.1, together with the deployment characteristics.
Maximum output Power in 10 MHz (P~10MHz~) is also declared by the
manufacturer. The parameters G~ant~ and N~ant~ are deployment specific
parameters related to the deployment of the BS, where G~ant~ is the antenna
gain and N~ant~ is the number of antennas.
For each channel (N) the EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP,N~ = P~EM,N~ +
G~ant~ + 10*log(N~ant~ ). The regulatory requirement in [9] limits the EIRP
level to the Maximum level in Table D-1 for the protection case(s) defined in
the regulation.
