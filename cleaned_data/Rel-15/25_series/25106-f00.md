# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and the
donor base station.
**Down-link** : Signal path where base station transmits and mobile receives.
**Operating band** : the frequency range in which UTRA FDD operates, that is
defined with a specific set of technical requirements.
NOTE 1: The operating band(s) for an UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 5.1, Table 5.1.
NOTE 2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating band
and downlink operating band.
**Pass band:** The frequency range in which the repeater operates in with
operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to one or
several consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels. If they are not consecutive each
subset of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band. A repeater
can have one or several pass bands.
**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from the mobile to the base
station). In operating bands specified with only down-link or up-link, only
the up-link or down-link as specified for the operating band is repeated.
**Up-link:** Signal path where mobile transmits and base station receives.

# 4 General
This specification applies only to UTRA-FDD repeaters.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements in this specification apply to both
the up-link and down-link directions, where applicable.
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The repeater test specification 25.143 section 5 [2]
defines Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for
each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in
this specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5
[4].
## 4.2 Regional requirements

b) A UTRA/FDD repeater can support both fixed and variable up-link to down-
link frequency separation.
c) The use of other up-link to down-link frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
## 5.3 Channel arrangement
### 5.3.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.3.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition, a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to the table 5.3, which
means that and the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 5.3.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN).
For each operating band, the UARFCN values are defined as follows.
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ â‰¤ F~UL~ â‰¤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ â‰¤ F~DL~ â‰¤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ andï€  F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 5.3 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 5.4.

# 6 Output power
Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal
load impedance of the transmitter.
Rated output power, PRAT, of the repeater is the mean power level per carrier
at maximum repeater gain that the manufacturer has declared to be available at
the antenna connector.
## 6.1 Maximum output power
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference condition.
### 6.1.1 Minimum Requirements
The requirements shall apply at maximum gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass
band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated output power
per channel.
When the power of all signals is increased by 10 dB, compared to the power
level that produce the maximum rated output power, the requirements shall
still be met.
In normal conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain within
limits specified in Table 6.1 relative to the manufacturer\'s rated output
power.

# 10 Modulation accuracy
## 10.1 Error Vector Magnitude
The modulation accuracy is defined by the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), which
is a measure of the difference between the theoretical waveform and a modified
version of the measured waveform. This difference is called the error vector.
The measured waveform is modified by first passing it through a matched root
raised cosine filter with bandwidth 3.84 MHz and roll-off Î±=0.22. The waveform
is then further modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute
amplitude and chip clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM
result is defined as root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference signal power expressed as a %.
The measurement interval is one power control group (timeslot). The repeater
shall operate with an ideal WCDMA signal in the pass band of the repeater at a
level, which produce the maximum rated output power per channel, as specified
by the manufacturer.
### 10.1.1 Minimum requirement
The Error Vector Magnitude shall not be worse than 12,5 %.
## 10.2 Peak code domain error
The peak code domain error is computed by projecting the power of the error
vector (as defined in subclause 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified
spreading factor. The code domain error for every code in the domain is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the projection onto that code, to
the mean power of the composite reference waveform. This ratio is expressed in
dB. The peak code domain error is defined as the maximum value for the code
domain error for all codes. The measurement interval is one power control
group (timeslot).
### 10.2.1 Minimum requirement
The peak code domain error shall not exceed -35 dB at spreading factor 256.
## 10.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE) for 64QAM modulation
The Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. Only
the active code channels in the composite reference waveform are considered
for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for every active code is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection onto that code,
to the mean power of the active code in the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame.
The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for Repeater
supporting 64QAM modulated codes.
### 10.3.1 Minimum requirement
The average Relative Code Domain Error for 64QAM modulated codes shall not
exceed -21 dB at spreading factor 16.
# 11 Input Intermodulation
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.
## 11.1 General Requirement
The following requirement applies for interfering signals in the frequency
bands defined in sub-clause 5.1, depending on the repeaters pass band. The
requirement shall bet met with the repeater operating at maximum gain.
### 11.1.1 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 11.1, the power in the pass band, shall
not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as measured in
the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without
interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the 3^rd^ order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre of
the pass band.
Table 11.1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals, where:
\- f_offset is the separation between the centre frequency of first or last 5
MHz channel in the pass band and one the interfering signals.
Table 11.1: Input intermodulation requirement
* * *
f_offset Interfering Signal Levels Type of signals Measurement bandwidth 3,5
MHz -40 dBm 2 CW carriers 1 MHz
* * *
## 11.2 Co-location with BS in other systems
The requirement shall bet met with the repeater operating at maximum gain.
### 11.2.1 Minimum requirements - Co-location with GSM, DCS, PCS, UTRA FDD
and/or E-UTRA FDD
This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of FDD Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA
FDD and/or UTRA FDD BS are co-located with a UTRA FDD Repeater.
For the parameters specified in table 11.2, the power in the pass band shall
not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as measured in
the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without
interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre
of the pass band.
NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation product corresponds to the 4^th^ and 3^rd^
order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

### 11.2.2 Minimum Requirement - Co-location with UTRA-TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD
An additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of FDD BS receivers when UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD is co-located
with a UTRA FDD Repeater.
The requirements in this chapter assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
transmitter and receiver.
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with UTRA-TDD on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-
Repeater minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [5].

## 11.3 Co-existence with other systems
The following requirement may be applied when GSM 900, DCS 1800, PCS1900,
GSM850, E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD BS and/or UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD BS operating in
another frequency band and UTRA-FDD Repeaters co-exist. The requirement shall
bet met with the repeater operating at maximum gain.
### 11.3.1 Minimum requirements
For the parameters specified in table 11.3 and table 11.3A, the power in the
pass band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level
obtained without interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre
of the pass band.
NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation product corresponds to the 4^th^ and 3^rd^
order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

## 12 Output intermodulation
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products signals created
by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the repeater via the output
port.
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the output port at
a level of 30 dB lower than that of the wanted signal. The frequency of the
interference signal shall be Â±5 MHz, Â±10 MHz and Â±15 MHz offset from the
wanted signal, but within the frequency band allocated for UTRA FDD downlink
as specified in subclause 4.1.
The requirement is applicable for downlink signals.
### 12.1 Minimum requirement
The output intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band emission or
the spurious emission requirements of section 9.1 and 9.2.
# 13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
## 13.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted gain
per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the
repeater on an adjacent channel.
The requirement shall apply to the Uplink and Downlink of Repeater where the
donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air Repeater).
## 13.2 Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified in the
Table 13.1.
