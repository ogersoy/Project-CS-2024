# 4 Introduction
# 5 Self evaluation of eMBB technical performance
[Editor's note: The grouping of the technical performance requirements for
eMBB usage scenario are based on Report ITU-R M.2410 "Minimum requirements
related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)". However, it
does not imply that each of the following technical performance requirements
is only related to eMBB. It is just the minimum requirement that shall be
evaluated under eMBB. This should also be noted for Section 6 and 7.]
## 5.1 Peak spectral efficiency
## 5.2 Peak data rate
## 5.3 5^th^ percentile user spectral efficiency
## 5.4 Average spectral efficiency
## 5.5 User experienced data rate
## 5.6 Area traffic capacity
## 5.7 Latency
### 5.7.1 User plane latency
### 5.7.2 Control plane latency
As defined in Report ITU-R M.2410, control plane latency refers to the
transition time from a most "battery efficient" state (e.g. Idle state) to the
start of continuous data transfer (e.g. Active state).
#### 5.7.2.1 NR
#### 5.7.2.2 LTE
For LTE Rel-15, control plane latency is evaluated from IDLE state to
CONNECTED state. It is noted that, for LTE, when RRC connection is suspended,
RRC connection resume is permitted by E-UTRAN. Figure 5.7.2.2-1 provides an
example control plane flow for the above-mentioned IDLE to CONNECTED state
transition for LTE Rel-15.
Figure 5.7.2.2-1 C-plane activation procedure (example for Rel-15)
It is noted that for Step 9, the processing delay in UE might be different for
the start of DL and UL continuous data transfer. Therefore the evaluation of
control plane latency is conducted for DL and UL, respectively.
The evaluation results of LTE FDD on control plane latency are provided in
Table 5.7.2.2-1.

For LTE TDD, the achieved latency will depend on when the procedure is
initiated due to the TDD-pattern (i.e. in some cases the eNB and UE must wait
for a subframe where DL and UL can be transmitted).
For DL data transfer, the evaluation results of LTE TDD are provided in Table
5.7.2.2-2.

###### ### Annex A: Calibration for self evaluation
To facilitate the self evaluation towards IMT-2020 submission, the system
level simulators have been calibrated to ensure the results from different
3GPP entities are comparable.
The following metrics are selected for calibration of self evaluation:
  * DL Geometry (wideband SINR)
  * Coupling gain
The cell association mechanisms as defined in calibration assumptions are used
to derive the above metrics, including multi-path based UE attachment model,
and analog beamforming (BF) model, etc. Detailed calibration parameters and
assumptions are found in Section 4 of RP-180524. It should be noted that these
parameters are used for calibration purpose only.
The calibration was conducted to the corresponding evaluation configurations
of Indoor Hotspot -- eMBB, Dense Urban -- eMBB, Rural -- eMBB, Urban Macro --
mMTC, and Urban Macro - URLLC test environment as defined in Report ITU-R
M.2412. The two channel model variants (channel model A and channel model B)
are applied in the calibration.
Twenty-one 3GPP entities provided the calibration results, including CATR,
CATT, CEWiT, China Telecom, CMCC, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, ITRI, LG
Electronics, MediaTek, Motorola Mobility/Lenovo, NEC, Nokia, NTT DOCOMO, OPPO,
Qualcomm, Samsung, Sharp, vivo and ZTE.
The calibration results for the five test environments are shown through
Figure A.1 to Figure A.5, respectively. The results are based on the average
of the independent results from the simulators of the contributing entities.
The results of DL geometry (wideband SINR) from the independent samples are
typically within 1\~2 dB of the average SINR.

and evaluation configuration is shown in Table A.1.

  * Option 2: 0dBi gain (linear gain = 1) for the paths within the 3dB > beamwidth; linear gain = 0 (-âˆž dB gain) for the paths outside the > 3dB beamwidth.
  * Option 3: Use the pattern defined in Section 8.5 in Report ITU-R > M.2412 for BS and UE side with maximum directional gain of 0dBi > for related test environments.
The inter-port spacing calculation is reported by the companies. The
calculation method given by equation (B.2.2-1) and (B.2.2-2) as shown below
can be used for reference.
The Tx horizontal and vertical inter-port spacing (for the same polarization)
can be calculated by
(B.2.2-1)
(B.2.2-2)
where _d_ ~tx_element,H~ and _d_ ~tx_element,V~ are the Tx inter-element
spacing on horizontal and vertical domain, respectively, and and are the
number of antenna elements on the same polarization that virtualizes the Tx
antenna port on horizontal and vertical domain, respectively. An illustration
is given in Figure B.2.2-1.
