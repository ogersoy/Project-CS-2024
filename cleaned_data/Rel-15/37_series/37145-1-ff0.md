# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the conducted test methods and conformance
requirements for _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ , _single RAT UTRA operation_
(FDD and TDD) and Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) UTRA, E-UTRA and NR Active
Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS). These have been derived from, and are
consistent with the non-AAS BS specifications in TS 25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3],
TS 36.104 [4], TS 38.104 [36] or TS 37.104 [5]. The technical specification TS
37.145 is in 2 parts, part TS 37.145-1 (the present document) covers conducted
requirements and part TS 37.145-2 [40] covers radiated requirements.
The present document does not establish conducted test methods and conformance
requirements for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by AAS BS, but Band
46 test requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of and
against Band 46 operation.
The present document does not establish conducted test methods and conformance
requirements for Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in band, NB-IoT guard
band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA
operation_ as defined in TS 36.141 [14], or for AAS BS in _MSR operation_
using E-UTRA as defined in TS 37.141 [13].

or standalone NB-IoT operation are not supported by AAS BS and not covered by
this specification. When referring to standalone E-UTRA test requirements for
_single RAT operation_ in TS 36.141 [14] or to E-UTRA test requirements for
_MSR operation_ in TS 37.141 [13], any test requirements specified in those
specifications for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for
standalone NB-IoT, shall not be considered for the AAS BS. Unless otherwise
stated, the exclusion of the NB-IoT test requirements in this specification
applies to all operation modes (i.e. _in-band NB-IoT operation_ , _guard band
NB-IoT operation_ and _standalone NB-IoT operation_).
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
When a requirement is applied per _TAB connector_ then the test uncertainty is
applied to the measured value. When a requirement is applied for a group of
_TAB connectors_ then the test uncertainty is applied to sum of the measured
power on each _TAB connector_ in the group.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

For single carrier tests unless otherwise stated the tests shall be performed
with a single carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency
range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
\- M~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be shifted
maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with the channel
raster.
\- T~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
For the test of certain conducted RF requirements the present specification
refers to test procedures defined in the single-RAT specifications [15], [14],
[19]. In this case, the interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall
be according to the definitions in the corresponding single-RAT specifications
[15], [14], [19].
Occupied bandwidth test in this TS is performed with the Aggregated Channel
Bandwidth and sub-block bandwidths located at the bottom, middle and top of
the supported frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as
B~BW\ Channel\ CA~(bottom), M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (middle) and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
(top) for contiguous spectrum operation.
Unless otherwise stated, the test for contiguous spectrum operation shall be
performed at B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
defined as following:
\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~: Aggregated Channel Bandwidth located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in each operating band;
\- M~BW\ Channel\ CA~: Aggregated Channel Bandwidth located close in the
middle of the supported frequency range in each operating band, with the
center frequency of each component carrier aligned to the channel raster;
\- T~BW\ Channel\ CA~: Aggregated Channel Bandwidth located at the top of the
supported frequency range in each operating band.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ capable of dual-band operation, unless
otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and
B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~_ T\'~RFBW~: the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ located at the bottom
of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the
highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum _Radio
Bandwidth_ , in the upper operating band.
\- B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~: the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ located at the top of
the supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum _Radio Bandwidth_
, in the lower operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the
declared maximum _Radio Bandwidth_ (see table 4.10-1, D6.16) spans both
operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ are
located at the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating
band and at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating
band.

spectrum operation in each supported operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

For the test of certain RF requirements clause 5 refers to the test
configurations as defined in the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the
transmitter test signals and test models as defined within the referred test
specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
## 4.13 Format and interpretation of tests
Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:
**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under consideration
and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or only to a
certain subset. Required manufacturer declarations may be included here.
**X.2 Minimum requirement**
This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference (or
core) specification which defines the minimum requirement. For each
requirement, there are separate references for MSR and single RAT, where
applicable in the core requirement. If the requirement does not apply to a
particular RAT, this is explicitly stated here (rather than through a
reference).
**X.3 Test purpose**
This clause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 General**
In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial conditions. In
such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and test procedures can be
applied are stated here. In the case only one test procedure is applicable,
that is stated here. Guidance to which TAB connectors are subject to the test
is also given here.
**X.4.2y First test method**
**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**
This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the test
environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-up.
The test system is assumed to be correctly calibrated as part of the initial
conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.
**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**
This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port),
domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g. average
result from several measurement positions).
**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**
If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its initial
conditions and procedures.
**X.5 Test requirement**
This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test, see
clause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. Test requirements for
every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are listed here. Cases where
minimum requirements do not apply need not be mentioned.
The test requirements may be different depending on the test method applied. A
test requirement for each test method applicable to the respective MSR/Single
RAT requirement is given in separate clauses where applicable.
# 5 Applicability of Requirements
## 5.1 General
The present clause defines for each conducted test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance for each _TAB connector_.
Test configurations for _TAB connectors_ supporting multiple RAT in the tested
operating band are specified in clause 5.2.
Test configurations for _TAB connectors_ declared to support single RAT
requirements (see table 4.10-1, D6.13) by either MSR requirements for UTRA
only or E-UTRA only or with a single-RAT UTRA requirements or single RAT
E-UTRA requirements are specified in clause 5.3.
Test configurations for _Multi-band TAB connectors_ are specified in clause
5.4.
Requirements apply to _TAB connectors_ according to the declared RAT
Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D6.12) within each supported operating band
and capability set of the _TAB connector_ and the Band Category of the
declared operating band (see table 4.10-1, D6.1), as listed in the heading of
each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not be mandatory or
they may apply only regionally. This is further specified for each requirement
in clauses 6 and 7, and in table 4.4-1.
For a declared RAT Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D6.12) in tables 5.2-1,
5.3.2-1, 5.3.3-1, 5.3.4-1, 5.4.1-1 or 5.4.2.1 only the requirements listed in
the column for that Capability Set apply. Requirements listed under CSA other
than the declared CSA(s) need not be tested.
For a _TAB connector_ declared to support MSR and to be capable of contiguous
spectrum operation only, the test configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1
denoted by a \"C\" and entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall
be used for testing.
For a _TAB connector_ that is declared: to support MSR and to be capable of
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see table 4.10-1, D6.14),
where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are identical for contiguous and
non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1, D6.15), shall use for each
declared operating band the test configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1
denoted by \"CNC\" and entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall
be used.
For a _TAB connector_ that is declared: to support MSR and to be capable of
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see table 4.10-1, D6.14),
where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are not identical for contiguous
and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1, D6.15), shall use for each
declared operating band the test configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1
denoted by \"C/NC\" and entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall
be used.
For a MSR capable _multi-band TAB connector_ the applicability of the
requirement for each operating band is determined by the RAT configuration
within that operating band as identified in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1, unless
otherwise stated. The testing of MSR capable _multi-band TAB connectors_ shall
be according to table 5.4.1-1 as follows:
\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 shall be used for each operating
band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.
\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration(s) in table 5.4.1-1 shall be used depending on the Band Category
of the declared operating band combination.
For a single-RAT UTRA only _TAB connector_ for each declared operating band
clause 5.3.3 defines for each conducted test requirement the set of mandatory
test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. The
applicable test configurations are specified in table 5.3.3-1 for each
supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according to clause 4.10.
The generation and power allocation for each test configuration is defined in
clause 4.11.2.
For a single-RAT E-UTRA only _TAB connector_ for each declared operating band
clause 5.3.4 defines for each conducted test requirement the set of mandatory
test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. The
applicable test configurations are specified in table 5.3.4-1 for each
supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according to clause 4.10.
The generation and power allocation for each test configuration is defined in
clause 4.11.2.
For a _TAB connector_ declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
in an operating band (see table 4.10-1, D6.23), a single carrier (SC) shall be
used for testing.

## 5.3 Test configurations for multi-carrier capable TAB connector(s) in
operating bands where one RAT capability sets are supported
### 5.3.1 General
A _TAB connector_ may support only one RAT operation in an operating band by
fulfilling different sets of requirements. Both UTRA and E-UTRA have two
complete sets of requirements that may be fulfilled depending on whether the
TAB connector is declared to be MSR or single RAT in the operating band. MSR
and single RAT requirements are addressed separately by separate test
requirements (and corresponding core requirements). They are also identified
by different capability sets as described in clauses 4.11 and 5.2.
### 5.3.2 TAB connector supporting one RAT only MSR in the operating band
This clause contains test configuration applicability to requirements and
capability sets for _TAB connectors_ supporting one RAT only MSR operation
operating with multiple carriers (MC).

# 6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.8.
If a number of _TAB connectors_ have been declared equivalent (see table
4.10-1, D6.70), only a representative one is necessary to be tested to
demonstrate conformance.
In clause 6.6.3.1, if representative _TAB connectors_ are used then per
connector criteria (i.e. option 2) shall be applied.
_The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported geographical
cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with the minimum amount of cell
splitting supported with transmission on all TAB connectors supporting the
operating band. The manufacturer shall also declare TAB connector TX min cell
groups._ Every _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in an operating band
shall map to one _TAB connector TX min cell group_ supporting the same
operating band _. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation
dependent._
_The number of active transmitter units that are considered when calculating
the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for an AAS BS is calculated as
follows:_
N~TXU,\ counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~ , 8Â·N~cells~)_ for E-UTRA single RAT AAS
BS and MSR AAS BS (except UTRA only MSR AAS BS); and
N~TXU,\ counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~, 4Â·N~cells~)_ for UTRA single RAT AAS BS
and UTRA only MSR AAS BS
_Further:_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ = _N~TXU,counted~/N~cells~_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the _basic limits_ as described in
clause 6.6.
NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of _active transmitter unit_
s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.
Any transmitter test requirement specified for Band 46 operation in TS 36.104
[4] for E-UTRA, or in TS 37.104 [5] for E-UTRA in MSR operation, and referred
in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.
Any transmitter test requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard
band, or standalone NB-IoT operation in TS 36.141 [14] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT
(in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in TS 37.141 [13] for
E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in _MSR operation_ , and referred in
clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.
## 6.2 Base station output power
### 6.2.1 General
The configured carrier power is the target maximum power for a specific
carrier for the operating mode set in the BS within the limits given by the
manufacturer\'s declaration.
### 6.2.2 Maximum output power
#### 6.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
The rated carrier output power of the _AAS BS_ shall be as specified in table
6.2.2.1-1.
Table 6.2.2.1-1: AAS Base Station rated output power limits for BS classes
AAS BS class PRated,c,sys PRated,c,TABC
* * *
Wide Area BS (note) (note) Medium Range BS â‰¤ 38 dBm +10log(_N_ TXU,counted) â‰¤
38 dBm Local Area BS â‰¤ 24 dBm +10log(_N_ TXU,counted) â‰¤ 24 dBm NOTE: There is
no upper limit for the PRated,c,sys or PRated,c,TABC of the Wide Area Base
Station.
The output power limit for the respective BS classes in table 6.2.2.1-1 shall
be compared to the rated output power and the declared BS class. It is not
subject to testing.
The requirement in clause 6.2.2.2 applies per _TAB connector_.
#### 6.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.105 [8], clause 6.2.2.2.
#### 6.2.2.3 Test Purpose
The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the _maximum carrier output
power per TAB connector_ (P~max,c,TABC~) across the frequency range and under
normal and extreme conditions for all _TAB connectors_ in the AAS BS.
#### 6.2.2.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment:
\- normal; see clause B.2.
\- extreme; see clauses B.3 and B.5.
> RF channels to be tested:
\- B, M and T; see clause 4.12.1
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ positions to be tested:
\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for _single band TAB connector(s)_ , see
clause 4.12.1; B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ for _multi-band TAB
connector(s)_ , see clause 4.12.1.
Under extreme test environment, it is sufficient to test on one RF channel or
one _Base Station RF bandwidth_ position, and with one applicable test
configuration defined in clauses 4.11 and 5. Testing shall be performed under
extreme power supply conditions, as defined in Annex B.5.
NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.
##### 6.2.2.4.2 Procedure
The minimum requirement is applied to all _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is
repeated until all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate conformance have
been tested.
1) Connect the power measuring equipment to the _TAB connector(s)_ as shown in
annex clause D.1.1. All _TAB connectors_ not under test shall be terminated.
2) Set each _TAB connector_ to output according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.12.2. For single carrier set the _TAB connector_
to transmit at manufacturers declared _rated carrier output power per TAB
connector_ (P~Rated,c,TABC~).
3) Measure the mean power for each carrier at each _TAB connector_.
In addition, for _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ , the following steps shall
apply:
4) For _multi-band TAB connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
#### 6.2.2.5 Test Requirements
In normal conditions, the measurement result in step 3 of clause 6.2.2.4.3
shall be:
\- within +2.7 dB and -2.7 dB of the manufacturer\'s _rated carrier output
power per TAB connector_ (P~Rated,c,TABC~) for carrier frequency f â‰¤ 3.0 GHz.
\- within +3.0 dB and -3.0 dB of the manufacturer\'s _rated carrier output
power per TAB connector_ (P~Rated,c,TABC~) for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \ The sum of the measured P-CPICH code domain power on each of the _TAB
> connectors_ transmitting the P-CPICH shall be:
Within Â±2.9 dB of the configured absolute value for carrier frequency f â‰¤ 3.0
GHz.
Within Â±3.2 dB of the configured absolute value for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz
\ The sum of the measured PCCPCH code domain power on each of the _TAB
> connectors_ transmitting the PCCPCH shall be within the limits defined in
> table 6.2.4.5-1.
Or
> The measured PCCPCH code domain power on each of the _TAB connectors_
> transmitting the PCCPCH shall be within the tolerance indicated in table

resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

after end of one transmitter ON period + 17 Î¼s to 35Î¼s before start of next
transmitter ON period - 17 Î¼s.

resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but
excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are
caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but
exclude out of band emissions.
For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ and _MSR operation_ , the out-of-
band emissions requirement for the AAS BS transmitter is specified in terms of
an operating band unwanted emissions requirement that defines limits for
emissions in each supported _downlink operating band_ plus the frequency
ranges Î”f~OBUE~ above and Î”f~OBUE~ below each band, where Î”f~OBUE~ is the
maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emission mask from the operating
band edge. Emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious
emissions requirement. For UTRA FDD single RAT AAS BS, the out of band
emission requirement for AAS BS transmitter is specified in terms of spectrum
emission mask requirement.
The values of Î”f~OBUE~ are defined for _hybrid AAS BS_ for E-UTRA and UTRA
operating bands in Table 6.6.1-1.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode is power responding.
The analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power (root-mean-
square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
In addition, for _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ , the following steps shall

above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.6.3.5.3.4 Cumulative ACLR requirement in non-contiguous spectrum
{#cumulative-aclr-requirement-in-non-contiguous-spectrum .H6}
The following test requirement applies for sub-block or _Inter RF Bandwidth
gap_ sizes listed in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1 for UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD or E-UTRA
operation or table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1A for NR operation:
\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in non-
contiguous spectrum.
\- Inside an _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ for a BS operating in multiple bands,
where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector.
The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a sub-block gap
or the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ is the ratio of:
a) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block gap or
the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ ; and
b) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to one of
the respective sub-block edges or _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_.
The requirement applies to adjacent channels of E-UTRA or UTRA or NR carriers
allocated adjacent to each side of the subâ€‘block gap or the _Inter RF
Bandwidth gap_. In case of mixed UTRA and E-UTRA (but not NR) carriers on
either side of the gap, table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1 is applicable. In case of mixed NR
and E-UTRA or UTRA or NR only carriers on either side of the gap, table
6.6.3.5.3.4-1A is applicable. The assumed filter for the adjacent channel
frequency is defined in tables 6.6.3.5.3.4-1 and 6.6.3.5.3.4-1A and the
filters on the assigned channels are defined in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-2.
NOTE: If the RAT on the assigned channel frequencies is different, the filters
used are also different.
The CACLR for E-UTRA and UTRA carriers located on either side of the sub-block
gap or the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ shall be higher than the value specified
in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1.

shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated
until all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate conformance have been
tested.
a) Connect _TAB connector_ to measurement equipment as shown in clause D.1.1.
All _TAB connectors_ not under test shall be terminated.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515
MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.
\- Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4.0
MHz and (f_offsetmax - 500 kHz).shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth.
\- Detection mode: True RMS.
The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.
b) For single carrier operation set the _TAB connector_ to transmit at
manufacturers declared rated carrier output power per _TAB connector_
(P~Rated,c,TABC~)
For a _TAB connector_ declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation set the _TAB connector_ to transmit on all carriers configured using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of physical channels in
clause 4.12.
##### 6.6.4.4.2.1 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-17 .H6}
1) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth. For _multi-band TAB connector_ or _TAB connector_
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF
Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be measured using the specified measurement
bandwidth from the closest _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or sub block edge.
In addition, for _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ , the following steps shall
apply:
> 2) For _multi-band TAB connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
##### 6.6.4.4.2.2 UTRA TDD {#utra-tdd-12 .H6}
1) Measure the power of the _TAB connector_ spectrum emissions by applying
measurement filters with bandwidths as specified in the relevant table in
clause 6.6.4.5.2.2. The characteristic of the filters shall be approximately
Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filters). The centre frequency of the
filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps over the ranges of frequency
offsets f_offset as given in the tables. The step width shall be equal to the
respective measurement bandwidth. The time duration of each step shall be
sufficiently long to capture one active time slot.
2) The measurement shall be performed by applying filters with measurement
bandwidth of 50 kHz or less and integrating the measured results over the
nominal measurement bandwidth 1 MHz specified in the tables in clause
6.6.4.5.2.2 when the measurement bandwidth is 1 MHz.
In addition, for _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ , the following steps shall
apply:
> 3) For _multi-band TAB connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
The same procedure applies to _TAB connectors_ declared to support 16QAM.
#### 6.6.4.5 Test requirements
##### 6.6.4.5.1 General
Conformance may be shown to either the measure and sum test requirement or the
per _TAB connector_ test requirement.
1) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
measure and sum alternative are that for each _TAB connector TX cell group_
and each applicable _basic limit_ as specified in this clause, the power
summation of emissions at the _TAB connectors_ of the _TAB connector TX cell_
_group_ shall not exceed a limit specified as the _basic limit_ \+
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).
2) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the per
_TAB connector_ alternative are that for each _TAB connector TX cell group_
and each applicable _basic limit_ as specified in this clause, the emissions
at each of the _TAB connectors_ of the _TAB connector TX cell_ _group_ shall
not exceed a limit specified as the _basic limit_ \+
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) - 10log(n) where n is the number of _TAB
connectors_ in the _TAB connector TX cell group_.
The appropriate table for the basic limit is based on the same power level
(P~Rated,c,sys~) as used for the AAS BS rated power limits for BS classes in
table 6.2.2.1-1 the same method of scaling the power level using
N~TXU,counted~ is used.
##### 6.6.4.5.2 Basic Limits
##### 6.6.4.5.2.1 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-18 .H6}
The _basic limit_ is specified in tables 6.6.4.5.2.1-1 to 6.6.4.5.2.1-11 for
the appropriate P~Rated,c,sys~, where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal -3 dB
point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the centre of
the measurement filter;
\- f_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge as
defined in clause 3.4.1, whichever is the greater.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 6.6.6.5.2.4 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
{#protection-of-the-bs-receiver-of-own-or-different-bs .H6}
This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent the
receivers of Base Stations being desensitised by emissions from the
transmitter _TAB connector_. It is measured at the transmit _TAB connector_
for any type of _TAB connector_ which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna
ports.
The basic limit of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
6.6.6.5.2.4 -1, depending on the declared Base Station class and Band
Category.

##### 6.6.6.5.2.5 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical
area {#co-existence-with-other-systems-in-the-same-geographical-area .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the _TAB connector_ downlink operating band. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed
in the same geographical area as the AAS BS, or they may be set by local or
regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in
some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is
mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this
is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements
in the present document is given in clause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below. The basic limit any spurious emission are
in table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 for _TAB connector(s)_ where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For _multi-band
TAB connector(s)_ , the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.6.5.2.5-1 apply for each supported operating band.

outside the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). Emission
limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in table 4.4-1 or table 4.4â€‘2 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III, E-UTRA Band 3 or NR Band
n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection
requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 5: For Band 28/n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 6: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for coâ€‘existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85
UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band and Î”f~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
operating band.
The basic limit for any spurious emission is:

##### 6.6.6.5.2.6 Co-location with other Base Stations {#co-location-with-
other-base-stations .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receiver
units when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD,
E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The basic limit for any spurious emission are in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 for a
MSR, E-UTRA or UTRA FDD _TAB connector_ or tables 6.6.6.5.2.6-2 and
6.6.6.5.2.6-3 for UTRA TDD, where requirements for co-location with a BS type
listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station
class. For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the exclusions and conditions in the
Notes column of table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 do not apply for the Î”f~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the _TAB connector_ transmit frequency
range of a downlink operating band (clause 4.5). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [21].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding _TAB connector_ transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause
4.5 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For
such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 4: For UTRA MR BS the measurement bandwidth is the same as for E-UTRA
(100 kHz).

## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability
#### 6.7.1.1 General
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array. The requirement
applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and the _transmitter transient
period_.
The requirement applies at each _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in the
operating band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal is injected into the _TAB connector_.
For AAS BS there are two types of transmitter intermodulation cases captured
by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:
1) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from a co-located base station.
2) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from other transmitter units within the AAS BS.
For AAS BS, the co-location transmitter intermodulation requirement is
considered sufficient if the interfering signal for the co-location
requirement is higher than the declared interfering signal for intra-system
transmitter intermodulation requirement.
For _TAB connectors_ capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are
mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply
regardless of the interfering signals position relative to the _Inter RF
Bandwidth gap_.
### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for MSR operation are defined in TS 37.105 [8], clause
6.7.2.
The minimum requirement for UTRA operation are defined in TS 37.105 [8],
clause 6.7.3.
The minimum requirement for UTRA operation are defined in TS 37.105 [8],
clause 6.7.4.
### 6.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units associated
with the _TAB connector_ under test to restrict the generation of
intermodulation products in its nonlinear elements caused by presence of the
wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the
antenna to below specified levels.

# 7 Conducted receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the AAS
BS _TAB connector_ with full complement of transceivers for the configuration
in normal operating condition.
The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas) in clause 4.10. The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with
minimum amount of cell splitting. The manufacturer shall also declare _TAB
connector RX min cell groups for this minimum number of cells configuration_.
Every _TAB connector_ supporting reception in an operating band shall map to
one _TAB connector RX min cell group_ supporting the same. The mapping of _TAB
connectors_ to cells is implementation dependent.
The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating the
emission limit (N~RXU,counted~) for an AAS base station is calculated as
follows:
\- N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,active~, 8_ Â· _N~cells~)_ for E-UTRA single RAT
AAS BS and MSR AAS BS (excluding UTRA only MSR AAS BS).
And
\- N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,\ active~, 4_ Â· _N~cells~)_ for UTRA single RAT
AAS BS and UTRA only MSR AAS BS.
Further:
\- N~RXU,countedpercell~ = _N~RXU,counted~/N~cells~_
N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the _basic limits_ as described in
clause 7.6.
NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and is
independent to the declaration of N~cells~.
If a number of _TAB connectors_ have been declared equivalent (see table
4.10-1, D6.70), only a representative one is necessary to demonstrate
conformance.
In clause 7.6.5.1, if representative _TAB connectors_ are used then per
connector criteria (option 2) shall be applied.
Any receiver test requirement specified for Band 46 operation in TS 36.104 [4]
for E-UTRA, or in TS 37.104 [5] for E-UTRA in _MSR operation_ , and referred
in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS. The requirements for co-location
blocking for Band 46 are applicable for AAS BS.
Any receiver requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or
standalone NB-IoT operation in TS 36.104 [4] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band
or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in TS 37.104 [5] for E-UTRA with
NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in _MSR operation_ , and referred in clause 7, is

## 7.4 Adjacent channel selectivity and narrowband blocking
### 7.4.1 Definition and applicability
The adjacent channel selectivity, general blocking and narrowband blocking
characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to receive a wanted
signal at its assigned channel at the _TAB connector_ in the presence of an
unwanted interferer inside the operating band.
NOTE For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity characteristics is
referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\", whereas for the MSR
requirements, the corresponding property is referred to as \"general
blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not carry a channel
addressable from the interfered carrier.
The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL_low~ - Î”f~OOB~ to
F~UL_high~ + Î”f~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the _operating
band_. The values of Î”f~OOB~ are defined in table 7.4.1-1.
Table 7.4.1-1: Î”f~OOB~ offset for operating bands
_Operating band_ characteristics Î”f~OOB~ [MHz]
* * *
F~UL_high~ -- F~UL_low~ \ NOTE: The requirement in tables 7.4.5.1.1-1 assumes that two operating
> bands, where the _downlink operating band_ (see table 4.4-1 and table 4.4-2
> in TS 37.141 [16].) of one band would be within the in-band blocking region
> of the other band, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
##### 7.4.5.1.2 General narrowband blocking test requirement
For the narrowband blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be an
E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified in clause A.3 in TS 37.141 [16].
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Maximum Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Maximum Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For a _TAB connector_ operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement
applies in addition inside any _sub-block gap_ , in case the _sub-block gap_
size is at least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the sub-block edges inside the _sub-block gap_.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement applies in addition inside
any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ in case the gap size is at least 3 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ _edges_ inside the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the _TAB connector_ , using
the parameters in table 7.4.5.1.2-1 the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the
_maximum throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in clause
7.2.5.3.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.1.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.
\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104 [17], clause
7.2.5.3.

##### 7.4.5.1.3 Additional BC3 blocking test requirement
The interfering signal is a 1,28Mcps UTRA TDD modulated signal as specified in
clause A.2 in TS 37.141 [16].
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Maximum Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Maximum Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement applies in addition inside
any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ , in case the gap size is at least 4.8MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ _edges_ inside the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the _TAB connector_ , using
the parameters in table 7.4.5.1.3-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the
_maximum throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in clause
7.2.5.3.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.

##### 7.5.5.1.2 Co-location test requirements
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
receiver units associated with _TAB connectors_ when a E-UTRA, UTRA, CDMA or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with the
AAS BS.
The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between the
interfering transmitter and the _TAB connector_ and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to _TAB connector_ using the
parameters in table 7.5.5.1.2-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the
_maximum throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in clause
7.2.5.3.
\- For any measured NR carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.4.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.1.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.

#### 7.5.5.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation
For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters
specified in tables 7.5.5.2-1 to 7.5.5.2-9 if applicable for the _TAB
connector_ under test.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Maximum Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the lower/upper _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_ or _Maximum Radio
Bandwidth_ edges.
For a _TAB connector_ operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any _sub-
block gap_ , in case the _sub-block gap_ size is at least 15 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper sub-block
edge inside the _sub-block gap_ and is equal to -7.5 MHz/+7.5 MHz,
respectively.
For a _TAB connector_ operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the narrowband blocking requirements in tables 7.5.5.2-7 to
7.5.5.2-9 apply in addition inside any _sub-block gap_ , in case the _sub-
block gap_ size is at least 400 kHz or 600 kHz, depending on the operating
band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper
sub-block edge inside the _sub-block gap_ and is equal to -200 kHz/+200 kHz or
-300 kHz/+300 kHz, respectively.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement in the in-band blocking
frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The requirement
applies in addition inside any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ , in case the _Inter
RF Bandwidth gap_ size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to lower/upper _Base Station RF bandwidth edges_ inside the
_Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ and is equal to -7.5 MHz/+7.5 MHz, respectively.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement in the out-of-band blocking
frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the exception that the
in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands according
to tables 7.5.5.2-1 to 7.5.5.2-3 shall be excluded from the out-of-band
blocking requirement.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the narrowband blocking requirement applies
in addition inside any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ , in case the _Inter RF
Bandwidth gap_ size is at least 400 kHz or 600 kHz, depending on the operating
band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper _Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges_ inside the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ and is equal
to -200 kHz/+200 kHz or -300 kHz/+300 kHz, respectively.

NOTE 1: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation of how the
Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex
C.
NOTE 2: Annex C of TS 25.141 [18] describes the procedure for BER tests taking
into account the statistical consequence of frequent repetition of BER
measurements within the blocking test. The consequence is: a DUT exactly on
the limit may fail due to the statistical nature 2.55 times (mean value) in
12750 BER measurements using the predefined wrong decision probability of
0.02%. If the fail cases are â‰¤ 12, it is allowed to repeat the fail cases 1
time before the final verdict.
#### 7.5.5.3 Single RAT UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option operation
##### 7.5.5.3.1 General requirements
The static reference performance as specified in clause 7.2 shall be met with
a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the _TAB connector_ using the
parameters specified in table 7.5.5.3.1-1 to table 7.5.5.3.1-12, respectively.
The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ or _Maximum Radio Bandwidth_ edges. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the lower / upper _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_
or _Maximum Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement in the in-band blocking
frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The requirements
applies in addition inside any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ as long as the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 4.8MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the lower / upper _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_
inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to -2.4 MHz/+2.4 MHz,
respectively.
For _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement in the out-of-band blocking
frequency ranges apply for each supported operating band, with the exception
that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands
shall be excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

##### 7.5.5.3.2 Co-location with GSM, DCS, UTRA FDD and/or E-UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
receiver units associated with _TAB connectors_ with TDD operation when GSM,
DCS, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA FDD, FDD unsynchronized UTRA TDD and/or unsynchronized
E-UTRA TDD BTS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.
The blocking performance requirement applies to interfering signals with
centre frequency within the ranges specified in the tables below, using a 1
MHz step size.
In case this additional blocking requirement is applied, the static reference
performance as specified in clause 7.2.1 shall be met with a wanted and an
interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the following parameters.

#### 7.5.5.4 Single RAT E-UTRA operation
##### 7.5.5.4.1 General test requirement
For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the
_maximum throughput_ of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and
an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the parameters in
tables 7.5.5.4.1-1, 7.5.5.4.1-2, 7.5.5.4.1-3 and 7.5.5.4.1-4. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is specified in tables 7.2.5.3-1,
7.2.5.3-2 and 7.2.5.3-3 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in TS
36.141 [17], Annex A.
The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ or _Maximum Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_ or _Maximum Radio
Bandwidth_ edges.
For a _TAB connector_ operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any _sub-
block gap_ , in case the _sub-block gap_ size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.6-2. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the _sub-block gap_.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement in the in-band blocking
frequency ranges applies for each supported operating band. The requirement
applies in addition inside any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ , in case the _Inter
RF Bandwidth gap_ size is at least as wide as twice the interfering signal
minimum offset in table 7.6-2.
For a _multi-band TAB connector_ , the requirement in the out-of-band blocking
frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the exception that the
in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands according
to tables 7.5.5.4.1-1, 7.5.5.4.1-2 and 7.5.5.4.1-3 shall be excluded from the
out-of-band blocking requirement.

NOTE 3: Table **7.5.5.4.1-3** assumes that two operating bands, where the
_downlink operating band_ see clause 4.5 of one band would be within the in-
band blocking region of the other band, are not deployed in the same
geographical area.

NOTE 4: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation of how the
Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex
C.
##### 7.5.5.4.2 Co-location with other base stations
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
E-UTRA receiver units associated with the _TAB connectors_ under test when
GSM, CMDA, UTRA or E-UTRA BS operating in a different frequency band are co-
located with an E-UTRA BS. The requirement is applicable to all channel
bandwidths supported by the E-UTRA BS.
The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and E-UTRA BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.
For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the
_maximum throughput_ of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and
an interfering signal coupled to the _TAB connector_ using the parameters in
table 7.5.5.4.2-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.5.5.4.2-2 for
AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.5.5.4.2-3 for AAS BS of Medium
Range BS class. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
specified in tables 7.2.5.3-1, 7.2.5.3-2 and 7.2.5.3-4 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A of TS 36.141 [17].

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the _TAB connector_. The
requirements apply to all AAS BS with separate RX and TX _TAB connectors_.
NOTE: In this case for FDD AAS BS the test is performed when both TX and RX
are on, with the TX _TAB connector_ terminated.
For a _TAB connector_ supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements apply
during the _transmitter OFF period_. For a _TAB connector_ supporting both RX
and TX in FDD, the receiver spurious requirements are superseded by the TX
spurious requirements in TS 37.105 [8], clause 6.6.6.
For RX only _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ , the RX spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating band.
For _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ that both transmit and receive in operating
bands supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are applicable during
the TX OFF period~~,~~ and are subject to exclusion zones in each supported
operating band. _The unwanted emission level limit of a TAB connector RX min
cell group is in general defined by the unwanted emission basic limit which is
the same as the corresponding applicable Non-AAS BS per transmitter
requirement specified in [3], [4], or [5], and its scaling by_
N~RXU,countedpercell~ . The _basic limits_ and corresponding scaling are
defined in each relevant clause. The receiver spurious emission requirements
are applied per the _TAB connector RX min cell groups for all the
configurations supported by the AAS BS._
### 7.6.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for MSR operation is in TS 37.105 [8], clause 7.6.2.
The minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation is defined in TS 37.105
[8], clause 7.6.3.
The minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation is defined in TS
37.105 [8], clause 7.6.4.
### 7.6.3 Test Purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the AAS BS to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.
### 7.6.4 Method of test

1) For _TAB connector(s)_ capable of single carrier operation only, set each
_TAB connector_ declared in the same RAT and operating band to transmit a
signal according to table 7.6.4.2.4-1, at the manufacturer\'s declared rated
output power, P~Rated,c,TABC~.
For _TAB connector(s)_ declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set
each _TAB connector_ declared in the same RAT and operating band to transmit a
signal according to table 7.6.4.2.4-1on all carriers configured, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting for receiver
tests, as specified in clause 4.11.

## D.1.3 Transmitter spurious emissions
_TAB connectors_ may be connected to the measurement equipment singularly and
tested one at a time (figure D.1.3-1), or may be tested simultaneously in
groups (figure D.1.3-2) where the group size may range from two to all the
_TAB connectors_ which are subject to transmitter spurious emissions test.
In all cases the measurement is per _TAB connector_ but the measurement may be
done in parallel.
