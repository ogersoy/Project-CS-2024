incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for 2 types of AAS BS; _hybrid requirements set_ which specify
requirements for a _hybrid AAS BS_ with both a conducted and a radiated
interface and _OTA requirements set_ which specify requirements for an _OTA
AAS BS_ which has a radiated interface only.
The _hybrid AAS BS_ requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base Station
(BS), the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), the 1,28 Mcps TDD mode of
UTRA AAS Base Station (BS) in single RAT and any MSR AAS Base Station (BS)
implementation of these RATs including NR operation.
The _OTA AAS BS_ requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base Station (BS),
the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), in single RAT and any MSR AAS Base
Station (BS) implementation of these RATs and/or NR.
The requirements have been derived from, and are consistent with non-AAS BS
specifications in TS 25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3], TS 36.104 [4] or TS 37.104 [5]
and where applicable with the NR specification 38.104 [33]. The technical
specification TS 37.145 is in 2 parts, part TS 37.145-1 [9] covers conducted
requirements and part TS 37.145-2 (the present document) covers radiated
requirements.
The present document does not establish radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by AAS BS. Conducted
Band 46 test requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of
and against Band 46 operation, as specified in TS 37.145-1 [9].
The present document does not establish minimum RF characteristics or minimum
performance requirements for Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in band,
NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in _single RAT
E-UTRA operation_ or in _MSR operation_ using E-UTRA.

# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2 of
this specification, i.e. to all AAS BS radiated tests.
The minimum requirements for AAS BS radiated requirements are given in TS
37.105 [14] clause 9 and 10 for the radiated transmitter and radiated receiver
characteristics, respectively. Test Tolerances for the radiated test
requirements explicitly stated in part 2 of the present specification are
given in annex C of this specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, OTA measurement
methodology description (including calibration and measurement stage for each
test range), MU budget format and its contributions, refer to TR 37.941 [38].

# 5 Applicability of Requirements
## 5.1 General
The present clause defines for each radiated test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance for radiated requirement.
Test configurations for beams supporting multiple RAT in the tested operating
band are specified in clause 5.1.
Test configurations for radiated requirements where the operating band has
been declared to support single RAT requirements (see table 4.10-1, D9.5) by
either MSR requirements for UTRA only or E-UTRA only or with a single-RAT UTRA
requirements or single RAT E-UTRA requirements are specified in clause 5.2.
Test configurations for an AAS BS with operating bands which have multi-band
dependencies are specified in clause 5.3.
Requirements apply to AAS BS according to the declared RAT radiated Capability
Set (see table 4.10-1, D9.25) within each supported operating band the Band
Category of the declared operating band (see table 4.10-1, D9.4), as listed in
the heading of each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not
be mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified for
each requirement in clauses 6 and 7, and in table 4.4-1.
For a declared RAT radiated Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D9.25) in tables
5.2-1, 5.3.2-1, 5.3.3-1, 5.3.4-1, 5.4.1-1 or 5.4.2-1 only the requirements
listed in the column for that radiated Capability Set apply. Requirements
listed under RCSA other than the declared RCSA(s) need not be tested.
An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs (MSR)
and to be capable of contiguous spectrum operation only, the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by a \"C\" and entries
that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR), to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.28), where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are
identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1,
D9.29). Shall use for each declared operating band the test configuration(s)
in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"CNC\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used.
An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR), to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.28), where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are not
identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1,
D9.29). Shall use for each declared operating band the test configuration(s)
in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"C/NC\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used.
For an AAS BS operating bands which have multi-band dependencies which is MSR
capable the applicability of the requirement for each operating band is
determined by the RAT configuration within that operating band as identified
in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1, unless otherwise stated. The testing of an AAS BS
in operating bands with multi-band dependencies which are MSR capable shall be
according to table 5.4.1-1 as follows:
\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 shall be used for each operating
band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.
\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in table 5.4.1-1 shall be used depending on the Band
Category of the declared operating band combination.
For a single--RAT UTRA only operating bands clause 5.3.3 defines for each
radiated test requirement the set of mandatory test configurations which shall
be used for demonstrating conformance. The applicable test configurations are
specified in table 5.3.3-1 for each supported RF configuration, which shall be
declared according to clause 4.10. The generation and EIRP allocation for each
test configuration is defined in clause 4.11.2.
For a single-RAT E-UTRA only operating bands clause 5.3.4 defines for each
radiated test requirement the set of mandatory test configurations which shall
be used for demonstrating conformance. The applicable test configurations are
specified in table 5.3.4-1 for each supported RF configuration, which shall be
declared according to clause 4.10. The generation and EIRP allocation for each
test configuration is defined in clause 4.11.3.
For an AAS BS operating band declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only (see table 4.10-1, D9.4), a single carrier (SC) shall be used
for testing.
In Table 5.1-1, the requirement applicability for each requirement set is
defined. For each requirement, the applicable requirement clause in the
specification is identified. Requirements not included in a requirement set is
marked not applicable (NA).

## 5.3 Test configurations for multi-carrier capable AAS BS in operating bands
where one RAT capability sets are supported
### 5.3.1 General
An AAS BS may support only one RAT operation in an operating band by
fulfilling different sets of requirements. Both UTRA and E-UTRA have two
complete sets of requirements that may be fulfilled depending on whether the
beam is declared to be MSR or single RAT in the operating band. MSR and single
RAT requirements are addressed separately by separate test requirements (and
corresponding core requirements). They are also identified by different
capability sets as described in clauses 4.11 and 5.2.
### 5.3.2 AAS BS supporting one RAT only MSR in the operating band
This clause contains test configuration applicability to requirements and
capability sets for AAS BS supporting one RAT only MSR operation operating
with multiple carriers (MC).

capability sets for operating bands supporting one RAT only MSR operation

# 6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configuration for testing. AAS BS
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.8.
If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (see table 4.10-1, D9.12,
D9.13), only a representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance. _The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported
geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with the minimum
amount of cell splitting supported._
_OTA AAS BS_ transmitter requirements apply per geographical cell.
Any radiated transmitter test requirement specified in TS 37.105 [6] is not
applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.
For OTA base station output power (clause 6.3), OTA transmit ON/OFF power
(clause 6.5), OTA unwanted emissions requirements (clause 6.7) and OTA
receiver spurious emissions (clause 7.7), TRP is defined in spherical
coordinates as:
, where P~D~(r,Î¸,Ï•) is the power density in W/m^2^ of two orthogonal
polarizations at a distance r (meters).
NOTE: General TRP expression that is obtained by integrating the Poynting
vector over a spherical surface.
## 6.2 Radiated Transmit Power
### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability
This is an output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during the
_transmitter ON period_.
An AAS BS is declared to support one or more beams. Radiated transmit power is
defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific _beam peak
direction_.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declarations (see table 4.10-1) of
a beam identifier (D9.3), _reference beam direction pair_ (D9.7), _rated beam
EIRP_ (D9.10) at the _reference beam direction pair_ , _OTA peak directions
set_ (D9.8), the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering directions
(D9.9) and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and _beamwidth(s)_ (D9.11) for
_reference beam direction pair_ and maximum steering directions.
For a declared beam identifier and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam
EIRP_ level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated _beam peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in clause
6.2.4.1.
NOTE 1: The _OTA peak directions set_ for a beam is the complete continuous or
discrete set of all _beam direction_ for which the EIRP accuracy is intended
to be achieved for the beam.
NOTE 2: A beam direction pair consists of a beam centre direction and an
associated beam peak direction.
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
For _operating bands_ where the supported _fractional bandwidth_ (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and
\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.
For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier EIRP is:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ â‰¤ f \ 20 | > 20 | +--------+--------+--------+-----+-----+-----+--------+--------+ | Span | 10 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 30 | $$2 | ![] | | (MHz) | | | | | | \time | (media | | | | | | | | s \tex | /image | | | | | | | | t{BW}_| 17.wmf | | | | | | | | {\text | ){widt | | | | | | | | {Chann | h="0.9 | | | | | | | | el}}$$ | 611111 | | | | | | | | | 111111 | | | | | | | | | 111in" | | | | | | | | | height | | | | | | | | | ="0.25 | | | | | | | | | 347222 | | | | | | | | | 222222 | | | | | | | | | 22in"} | +--------+--------+--------+-----+-----+-----+--------+--------+ | M | 1429 | 667 | 400 | 400 | 400 | $ | ![] | | inimum | | | | | | $\frac | (media | | number | | | | | | {2 \ti | /image | | of | | | | | | mes \t | 18.wmf | | measu | | | | | | ext{BW | ){widt | | rement | | | | | | }_{\te | h="1.2 | | points | | | | | | xt{Cha | 402777 | | | | | | | | nnel}} | 777777 | | | | | | | | }{100\ | 778in" | | | | | | | | text{k | h | | | | | | | | Hz}}$$ | eight= | | | | | | | | | "0.480 | | | | | | | | | 555555 | | | | | | | | | 555555 | | | | | | | | | 57in"} | +--------+--------+--------+-----+-----+-----+--------+--------+
7) Compute the total of the EIRP, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the EIRP
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total EIRP
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0. Measure the EIRP
for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total
radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_ as EIRP =
EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
8) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all EIRP in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
9) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all EIRP in the
measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.
10) Compute the OTA occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
11) For _multi-band RIBs_ and single band tests, repeat the steps 6) - 10)
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.3.4.2 Procedure
##### 6.7.3.4.2.1 General Procedure {#general-procedure-3 .H6}
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to measure TRP
is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If so, follow
steps 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. When calibrated and operated within the guidance of
3GPP TR 37.941 [38] the measurement methods are applicable and selected
depending on availability at the test facility.
1) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see table
4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.
3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.3.5.
\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.
4) For single carrier operation, set the AAS BS to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause 4.12.2 at manufacturers declared _rated carrier TRP_
(P~rated,c,TRP~).
For an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use
the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause 4.11.
5) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
performed (see annex F).
6) Measure the absolute total power of the assigned channel frequency and the
(adjacent channel frequency)
7) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for TRP~Estimate~ for each of the assigned channel frequency and the
adjacent channel frequency (see Annex F).
8) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the wanted
channel and the adjacent channel and the ACLR estimate using the measurements
made in Step 7.
9) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.
NOTE: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the assigned
channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent frequency channel.
NOTE: For FR1 the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation chamber for the
relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty in clause 4.1.2 the
test requirements in Table 6.7.3.5.1-1 shall be tightened following the

In addition to the requirements in clauses in the present clause, the AAS BS
may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC
Title 47 [18], when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and
under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.
The following requirement shall be applied to AAS BS operating in Bands 13 and
14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz
public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency
range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS _downlink operating
band_ up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS _downlink operating
band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except
for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 25,
Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in table
6.7.6.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the Î”f~OBUE~ frequency range immediately
outside the _downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). Emission limits for
this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.4.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in clause 4.7 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except
in Band 46), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered
by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85
UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink operating
band_ and Î”f~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink
operating band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 do not apply for the Î”f~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [31].
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
##### 6.7.6.5.5.2 Single RAT UTRA operation {#single-rat-utra-operation-3 .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirements are co-location emission requirements and specified as the
power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted output(s).
The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the conducted output(s) of the CLTA and shall not exceed the
limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.2-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location
with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared
Base Station class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in
the Notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.2-1 apply for each supported operating
band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.2.5-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [31].
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.2.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
##### 6.7.6.5.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation {#single-rat-e-utra-operation-3
.H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirements are co-location emission requirements and specified as the
power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted output(s).
The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the conducted output(s) of the CLTA and shall not exceed the
limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.3-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location
with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared
Base Station class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in
the notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.3-1 apply for each supported operating
band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 do not apply for the Î”f~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [31].
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
## 6.8 OTA Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located
base station. The requirement applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and
the _transmitter transient period_.
The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the operating
band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the _total radiated power_ of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.
For _OTA_ _AAS BS_ , the transmitter intermodulation requirement is captured
by the co-location transmitter intermodulation scenario case, in which the
interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.
### 6.8.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _MSR operation_ is defined in TS 37.105
[6], clause 9.8.2.
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.8.3.
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.8.4.
### 6.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units associated
with the _RIB_ under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation
products in its nonlinear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna
array from a co-located base station to below specified levels.

unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.7.3 (OTA ACLR), 6.7.4 (OTA
spectrum mask) and 6.7.5 (OTA OBUE), for all third and fifth order
intermodulation products which appear in the frequency ranges defined in
clauses 6.7.3, 6.7.4 and 6.7.5 (NOTE 2). The width of the intermodulation
products shall be taken into account.

transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in clause 6.7.6 (OTA spurious
emission), except OTA co-location spurious emission, for all third and fifth
order intermodulation products which appear in the frequency ranges defined in
clause 6.7.6 (NOTE 2). The width of the intermodulation products shall be

2F2Â±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1Â±2F2,
3F2Â±2F1, 4F1Â±F2, and 4F2Â±F1 where F1 represents the test signal centre
frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the
interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation products
are:
\- (n*BWF1 + m*BWF2) for the nF1Â±mF2 products;
\- (n*BWF2 + m*BWF1) for the nF2Â±mF1 products;
where BW~F1~ represents the test signal RF bandwidth or channel bandwidth in
case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth, and BW~F2~ represents the

# 7 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the _AAS BS_ including all
its functional components active unless otherwise stated in each requirement.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the AAS BS
_receive period._
The requirements in clause 7 shall be met for any transmitter setting.
The (E-UTRA) throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics
in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
Any radiated receiver test requirement specified in TS 37.105 [6] is not
applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.
Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.
For requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Î”~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log10(BeW~Î¸,REFSENS*~BeW~Ï†,REFSENS~) (dB) for the
reference direction.
And
Î”~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log10(BeW~Î¸,REFSENS*~BeW~Ï†,REFSENS~) (dB) for all
other directions.
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Î”~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
## 7.2 OTA sensitivity
### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD), related to an _AAS BS
receiver_.
The _AAS BS receiver_ may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing the
_receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple
_sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting from the current AAS BS
settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target
redirection range_ in the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the _AAS BS_.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in [7].
\- The receiver target reference direction.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
NOTE 3: (Void)
If the _AAS BS_ is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The receiver target reference direction.
NOTE 4: For _AAS BS_ without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) _sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 7.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for MSR & NR operation is in TS 37.105 [6], clause
10.2.2.
For AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.2.3.
For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.2.4.
### 7.2.3 Test Purpose
The test purpose is to verify that the AAS BS can meet the BER or throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the range
of angles of arrival declared in the OSDD.
### 7.2.4 Method of test
#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment:
\- normal: see annex G.2.
RF channels to be tested:
\- M; see clause 4.12.1.
Directions to be tested:
\- receiver target reference direction (see table 4.10-1, D10.9),
\- conformance test directions (see table 4.10-1, D10.10).
#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference
point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in
annex D1.1.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the AAS BS
with the test system.
3) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be tested.
4) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power from the
test antenna is captured by the AAS BS under test.
5) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to declared
_reference beam direction pair_ for the appropriate beam identifier.
6) Set the AAS BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same operational band and RAT
as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test configuration in
clause 5.
7) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:
\- 12.2 kbps DPCH with reference measurement channel defined in annex A in TS
25.141 [10] (PN-9 data sequence or longer) for UTRA FDD.
\- UL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) defined in annex A.2.1 in TS
25.142 [11] for UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps operation.
\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.4 for E-UTRA.
\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.5 for NR.
8) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at the AAS
BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified in clause
7.2.5.
9) Measure:
\- BER according to annex C in TS 25.141 [10] for FDD UTRA.
\- BER according to annex F in TS 25.142 [11] for TDD UTRA.
\- Throughput according to annex E in TS 36.141 [12] for E-UTRA.
\- Throughput according to annex A in TS 38.141-2 [34] for NR.
10) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the AAS BS (see table
4.10-1, D10.1), and supported polarizations.
For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
### 7.2.5 Test Requirements
#### 7.2.5.1 General
The minimum EIS level is a declared figure for each OSDD (see table 4.10-1,
D10.6). The test requirement is calculated from the declared value offset by
the EIS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.2.3.
#### 7.2.5.2 UTRA FDD Test Requirements
The BER measurement result in step 9 of clause 7.2.4.2 shall not be greater
than the limit specified in table 7.2.5.2-1.
Table 7.2.5.2-1: EIS levels

\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n}

Where due to practical reasons such as time constraints or turn-table
precision, measurement with the reference steps is not practical, sparser
grids can be used. Use of sparse grids can lead to errors in TRP assessment.
In order to characterize these errors, the SF (sparsity factor) of the grid is
defined as:
$\text{SF} = max(\frac{\Delta u_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta
u_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta v_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta v_{\text{ref}}})$
Where $\Delta u_{\text{grid}}$and $\Delta v_{\text{grid}}$ are the actual
steps used in the wave vector space in the measurement and the upper bound of
their value is 15 degrees.
# F.7 Orthogonal 2 cuts with pattern multiplication
This method can be used when the antenna symmetries are compatible with
pattern multiplication, see Clause F.1.2.4. The procedure is as follows:
1\. Calculate the reference angular steps as described in Clause F.1.2.
2\. Align the EUT to allow for proper pattern multiplication. See Clause F.5.
Measure EIRP on two orthogonal cuts with steps smaller or equal to the
reference steps according to step 1.
3\. Apply pattern multiplication according to Clause F.5 to extrapolate the
two cuts data to full-sphere.
4\. Apply numerical integration to obtain the TRP estimate as described in
Clause F.5.
# F.8 Void
# F.9 Full sphere with sparse sampling
The procedure is as follows:
1\. Set the angular grid:
a. Non-harmonic frequencies: choose the angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and
$\Delta\theta$ smaller than or equal to 15 degrees. Calculate the sparsity
factor (SF) as
$\text{SF} = \max\left(
\frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}}
\right)$
and the correction factor as:
$\text{Î”TRP} = \frac{SF - 1}{SF_{\max} - 1} \cdot 1.0\ dB,$
where $SF_{\max}$ _corresponds to 15 degrees angular step._ If the sparsity
factor is smaller than 1, the correction factor Î”TRP is 0 dB.
b. Harmonic frequencies with fixed beam test signal: choose the angular steps
smaller than or equal to the reference angular steps $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$
and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. Correction factor Î”TRP is 0 dB.
c. Harmonic frequencies with beam sweeping test signal: set the angular steps
to 15 degrees. Correction factor is Î”TRP 0 dB.
2\. Apply a suitable numerical integration to calculate the TRP estimate.
3\. Add the appropriate correction factor Î”TRP according to step 1 to ensure
an overestimation with 95% confidence.
4\. Compare the (TRP estimate + Î”TRP) with the limit. If the (TRP estimate +
Î”TRP) is above the limit, choose a smaller angular step and repeat steps 2-4.
If the sparsity factor is less than one, no significant improvement of
accuracy is expected.
# F.10 Beam-based directions
Beam-based direction can be used in the base station operating band only if
the directivity of the radiation pattern of the emssions being measured is
known._band_. TRP~Estimate~ is defined as:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} =
\frac{\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}}{D_{\text{EUT}}}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}$ is the maximum EIRP in the _beam peak
direction_ within a particular _beam direction pair_ and $D_{\text{EUT}}$ is
directivity of the EUT antenna.
# F.11 Peak method
The peak method can be used when frequencies with unwanted peak emissions are
identified during pre-scan. The method does not provide an estimate of TRP.
For each peak emission frequency identified during pre-scan, measure peak EIRP
or power density as follows:
1\. Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the peak emission is
recorded during the pre-scan.
2\. Move the EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find the
final peak EIRP or power density.
3\. The measured peak power density or EIRP shall be used to demonstrate
conformance.
NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarised components.
# F.12 Equal sector with peak average
Equal sector with peak average can be performed on frequencies with unwanted
peak emission, which are considered by the peak method for further
measurements.
The spherical angle $\phi$ is divided into K equal sectors. If the largest
dimension of EUT is less than 60 cm, then each sector is a half quadrant of
45Â°.
For each peak emission frequency, measure peak EIRP of beams belonging to
different sectors of the sphere as follows:
1\. Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the emission peak is
recorded during the pre-scan.
2\. Move EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find the
final peak EIRP.
3\. Repeat Steps 1 to 2 until all sectors are covered.
4\. Calculate TRP~Estimate~ as:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\text{EIRP}_{k}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{k}$ is the peak EIRP in the kth sector.
NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarised components.
# F.13 Pre-scan
Pre-scan is used to identify frequencies with unwanted emission power levels
above a certain threshold. The pre-scan does not provide an estimate of TRP.
An emission frequency identified by a pre-scan may be further investigated by
any of the TRP measurement methods in this annex.
The procedure for pre-scan is as follows:
1\. Scan the entire surface around EUT.
2\. Rotate test antenna to cover all possible polarisations of emissions to
detect maximum emissions.
3\. Record the list of frequencies and corresponding unwanted emission power
levels, EUT spatial positions, and test antenna polarization for which the
maximum emission levels occur.
4\. Emissions which are 20 dB or more below the specified limit shall not
require further measurements.
###### ## Annex G (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment
# G.1 General
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the AAS BS is to be tested are defined. The environmental conditions and
class shall be from the relevant IEC specifications or the corresponding ETSI

stated and tested separately.
## G.3.2 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum operating temperatures
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
Minimum temperature:
The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-1 [25].
Maximum temperature:
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-2 [26].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
# G.4 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test. This shall
use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60068-2-6 [27]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in annex G.2.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to

be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
Upper voltage limit:
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and

specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
# G.7 OTA extreme test methods
## G.7.1 Direct far field method
The AAS BS under test is placed inside a sealed RF transparent environmental
enclosure , as showed in Figure G.7.1-1. This is connected to an environment
control system which regulates the temperature inside the enclosure. The
remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any suitable antenna test range
chamber type is acceptable) is outside the environmental control and is at
nominal temperature. Positioners, test antennas and all other OTA test
equipment do not need to be specified over the extreme temperature range.
{width="6.695833333333334in" height="3.0in"}
Figure G.7.1-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy
using direct far field method
The prescence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may affect
the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and refractions, also
the loss through the environmental enclosure may not be consistant with
direction as the path through the radome may vary with angle. Hence the system
should be calibrated in all tested directions.
NOTE. Currently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing so a
single calibration directipon is sufficient.
Conformance may be demonstated by measuring the diference between the nominal
measurement and the extreme measurement (Î”~sample~) or by measuring
P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ directly.
Measure the EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
## G.7.2 Relative method
The AAS BS under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field
chamber) anachoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for
environmental conditioning. The RF conditionals inside the chamber are
absorbative and capable of dispating the power the the AAS BS when radiating.
A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which gives a sample of
the main beam EIRP but does not have to accuarctly measure the EIRP directly,
instead the near-field response is measured. For this method test components
are exposed to the full temperature range for example the test antenna/probe,
cables, absorbers etc. may change as a function of temperature.
Using the relative method it is also necassary to measure the EIRP under
nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near field)
test range to obtain P~max,c,EIRP~.
{width="5.127777777777778in" height="2.727777777777778in"}
Figure F.7.2-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy
using difference method
Measurements from the test antenna/ probe are taken under nominal conditions
and extreme conditions to calculate (Î”~sample~). The difference between the
nominal and extreme conditions (Î”~sample~) is then used along with the nominal
EIRP measurement (P~max,c,EIRP~) made in the appropriate far field or near
field chamber and compared against the extreme requirement. As follows:
P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ = P~max,c,EIRP~ + Î”~sample~.
Measure the EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Measuring noise close to noise-floor
As the emission level seen by the meausurement receiver (_P~UEM~_) for co-
location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure relative noise
change instead of absolute noise level. The relations between measured noise
change _Î´~1~_ , noise floor N~0~ and the relation to _P~UEM~_ with respect to
the noise floor denoted _Î´~2~_ is visualized in Figure H-1.
{width="2.75in" height="1.5104166666666667in"} {width="2.8958333333333335in"
height="2.1770833333333335in"}
Figure H-1: Relative noise measurement
The absolute emission level in decibel scale is calculated as:
{width="1.0729166666666667in" height="0.25in"}, where _N~0~_ is the noise
floor of the measurement receiver and _Î´~2~_ is plotted s function of _Î´~1~_
in Figure H-1. The absolute noise floor of the measurement receiver, including
probe antenna, cables, filter and LNA is determined by a calibration
procedure. The calibration will determine the absolute emission level (_N~0~_)
accuracy of measuring out-of-band unwanted emission close to the thermal noise
floor.
