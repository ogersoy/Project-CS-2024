# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between the AAS BS specification and non‑AAS BS single RAT
& MSR specifications
An AAS BS is distinguished from a _non-AAS BS_ by including a dedicated
antenna system in its design.
The transceiver to antenna RF interface of the AAS BS (referred to as the
_transceiver array boundary_) comprises one or several _TAB connectors_. There
is no general one-to-one relationship between _non-AAS BS_ antenna connectors
and AAS BS _TAB connectors_ , but it can be expected the number of _TAB
connectors_ in AAS BS will be greater than or equal to the number of _non-AAS
BS_ antenna connectors for respective base stations with corresponding
functionality.
For the conducted requirements, the AAS BS requirements are formulated in such
a way that the impact of what they are meant to regulate is expected to be
\"equivalent\" to the corresponding _non-AAS BS_ requirements; i.e. the
outside world sees the same level of emissions, power levels, or can expect
the same demodulation performance at the UE from the AAS BS as it would from a
_non-AAS BS_ with equivalent functionality. All _non-AAS BS_ RF requirements
(referenced to the _non-AAS BS_ antenna connector) have been adapted to AAS BS
conducted requirements. Many requirements are also direct references to the
_non-AAS_ BS RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS
36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].
NOTE 1: Applying _non-AAS BS_ antenna connector requirements directly to
individual _TAB connectors_ renders certain AAS BS requirements excessively
strict from a system perspective.
NOTE 2: Both specific references and non-specific references occur.
In addition, some new OTA requirements are introduced. These requirements have
no corresponding _non-AAS BS_ requirements.
For a _OTA AAS BS_ there are no conducted requirements. The radiated
requirements have been derived based on the principle that they offer the same
level of performance and protection as the _hybrid AAS BS_ requirements. The
radiated requirements therefore use the same equivalence to the non-AAS
requirements. The _non-AAS BS_ RF requirements have therefore been further
adapted to apply to OTA metrics in the far field. Some requirements are direct
references to the _non-AAS BS_ RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS
25.105 [3], 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5]. Some co-location
requirements which have been developed from assumptions on BS-to-BS coupling
do not have direct OTA equivalents. The radiated co-location requirements use
the same scenarios used to develop the _non-AAS_ RF requirements.
In this specification, the term \"requirements for _single RAT operation_ \"
refers to requirements that are derived from the 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS
25.105 [3], or 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] specifications baseline, whilst
\"requirements for _MSR operation_ \" refers to requirements derived from the
3GPP TS 37.104 [5] specification baseline (including NR operation as part of
MSR).
NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation is not
supported by AAS BS. When referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements for
_single RAT operation_ in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or to E-UTRA requirements for
_MSR operation_ in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5], any requirements specified in those
specifications for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for
standalone NB-IoT, shall not be considered for the AAS BS. Unless otherwise
stated, the exclusion of the NB-IoT requirements in this specification applies
to all operation modes (i.e. _in-band NB-IoT operation_ , _guard band NB-IoT
operation_ and _standalone NB-IoT operation_).NR requirements for _single RAT_
operation are not specified in the present document because AAS RF
requirements for single RAT NR are fully captured in the NR specification
38.104 [27].
Band 46 operation and Band 49 operation is not supported by AAS BS. When
referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements for _single RAT operation_ in 3GPP
TS 36.104 [4] or to E-UTRA requirements for _MSR operation_ in 3GPP TS 37.104
[5], any requiremetns specified in those specifications for Band 46 or Band 49
operation shall not be considered for the AAS BS with E‑UTRA.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the
test requirements specified in the conformance specifications TS 37.145-1 [29]
and TS 37.145-2 [30].
The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 37.145-1 [29] and TS
37.145-2 [30] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum
requirements in this specification to create test requirements. For some
requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to
zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle. The shared risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
[11].
## 4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
AAS BS requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified by
radiated requirements and conducted requirements.

Figure 4.3-2: Radiated points of reference of _OTA AAS BS_
Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA) at the _radiated
interface boundary_ (RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA
requirements. The (spatial) directions in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.
Some OTA requirements are specified as co-location requirements where the
requirements are specified at the conducted interface of the _co-location
reference antenna_ , co-location requirements are further defined in subclause
4.10.
Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of _TAB
connectors_ at the _transceiver array boundary_ , which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.
The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality
generating modulated transmit signal structures and performing receiver
combining and demodulation.
The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver units.
Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver units.
The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.
The composite antenna contains a _radio distribution network_ (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the RF
power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array, and/or
distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to the
transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.
How a conducted requirement is applied to the _transceiver array boundary_ is
detailed in the respective requirement subclause.
## 4.4 Base station classes for AAS BS
The requirements in the present document apply to AAS BS of Wide Area BS,
Medium Range BS and Local Area BS classes unless otherwise stated. The
associated deployment scenarios and definitions of BS classes are exactly the
same for AAS BS with and without connectors.
BS classes for _OTA AAS BS_ are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 5 m.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to
2 m.
BS classes for _hybrid AAS BS_ are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area BS are characterized by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios. For _AAS BS_ of Wide Area BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 70 dB.
\- Medium Range BS are characterized by requirements derived from Micro Cell
scenarios. For _AAS BS_ of Medium Range BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 53 dB.
\- Local Area BS are characterized by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios. For AAS _BS_ of Local Area BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 45 dB.
> NOTE: Whenever WA BS is referred in this specification, the NB-IoT Wide Area
> BS and related requirements as defined in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4], are not
> applicable for _OTA AAS BS_ , nor for _hybrid AAS BS_.
## 4.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by local and
regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions. _Non‑AAS BS_ requirements are
applicable as defined in the present document. In many cases, such
requirements include regional requirements that are implicitly referenced from
the present specification, and listed in the specification for the
specifications concerned 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS
36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].

## 4.6 Operating Bands and Band Categories
The operating bands and _band categories_ for AAS BS are the same as for _non-
AAS BS_ , as described in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].
NOTE 1: AAS BS does not support GSM, but BC2 is still applicable for
protection of and against GSM operation in BC2 operating bands.
NOTE 2: AAS BS does not support Band 46 (and all its sub-bands defined in 3GPP
TS 36.104 [8], subclause 5.5) operation nor Band 49 operation, but Band 46 or
Band 49 requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of and
against Band 46 or Band 49 operation.
## 4.7 Channel arrangements
The channel arrangements for AAS BS are the same as those for UTRA _non-AAS
BS,_ E-UTRA _non-AAS BS_ and NR _non-AAS BS_ as described in 3GPP TS 37.104
[5].
NOTE: Requirements for nominal carrier spacing of 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz for
carriers in Band 46 as specified in 36.104 [8] subclause 5.7.1, are not
applicable for AAS BS.
## 4.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where an AAS BS operates can be either contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for AAS BS configured for both _contiguous spectrum_
operation and _non-contiguous spectrum_ operation.
For AAS BS operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , some requirements apply
both at the _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_ and inside the _sub-block gaps_.
For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_ and the _sub-block_ edges respectively.
## 4.9 Requirements for AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating
bands
For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, the RF
requirements in clause 6, 7, 9, and 10 apply separately to each supported
operating band unless otherwise stated.
A _hybrid AAS BS_ may be capable of supporting operation in multiple operating
bands with one of the following implementations of _TAB connectors_ in the
_transceiver array boundary_ :
\- All _TAB connectors_ are _single band TAB connectors_.
\- Different sets of _single band TAB connectors_ support different operating
bands, but each _TAB connector_ supports only operation in one single
operating band.
\- Sets of _single band TAB connectors_ support operation in multiple
operating bands with some _single band TAB connectors_ supporting more than
one operating band.
\- All _TAB connectors_ are multiband _TAB connectors_.
\- A combination of single band sets and multi-band sets of _TAB connectors_
provides support of the _hybrid AAS BS_ capability of operation in multiple
operating bands.
Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an operating band apply
only to the set of _TAB connectors_ supporting that operating band.
In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band TAB connectors_ as detailed
in the requirement subclause. When referencing the NR specification 3GPP TS
38.104 [27] for a BS type 1-H the multi-band connector term is equivalent to a
_multi-band TAB connector_ in this specification.
In the case of an operating band being supported only by _single band TAB
connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min
cell group_ , _single band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB
connectors_.
NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately during
conformance testing on _single band TAB connectors_.
For a band supported by a _TAB connector_ where the transmitted carriers are
not processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other
band, TX _single band requirements_ shall apply. For a band supported by a
_TAB connector_ where the received carriers are not processed in active RF
components together with carriers in any other band, RX _single band
requirements_ shall apply.
In the case of an operating band being supported only by _multi-band TAB
connector_ s supporting the same operating band combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ , _multi-
band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB connectors_.
The case of an operating band being supported by both _multi-band TAB
connectors_ and _single band TAB connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell
group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not covered by the present
release of this specification.
The case of an operating band being supported by _multi-band TAB connectors_
which are not all supporting the same operating band combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not
covered by the present release of this specification.
An _OTA AAS BS_ may be capable of supporting operation in multiple operating
bands with one of the following implementations at the _radiated interface
boundary_ :
\- All RIBs are _single band RIBs_.
\- All RIBs are _multiband RIBs_.
\- A combination of _single band RIBs_ and _multi-band RIBs_ provides support
of the _OTA AAS BS_ capability of operation in multiple operating bands.
In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band RIBs_ as detailed in the
requirement subclause.
NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately during
conformance testing for single RIBs.
For _multi-band TAB connectors_ and _multi-band RIBs_ supporting the bands for
TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous
uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements for _multi-band TAB connectors_ and _multi-band RIBs_
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release
of this specification.
A RIB may operate multi-RAT where the individual RATs are operated in
different RAT specific bands that partially or fully overlap; Δf~OBUE~ and
Δf~OOB~ are according to the combined frequency range occupied by the
overlapping bands.
## 4.10 OTA Co-location with other base stations
Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming the AAS
BS is co-located with another BS of the same base station class, they ensure
that both co-located systems can operate with minimal degradation to each
other.
Unwanted emissions and out-of-band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are mandatory
requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as it represents
the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.
NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level, co-location is the most suitable method to show
conformance.
The _co-location reference antenna_ , shall be a single column passive antenna
which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency range,
polarization, as the composite antenna of AAS BS and nominal 65° horizontal
half-power beamwidth (suitable for 3-sector deployments) and is placed at a
distance _d_ from the edge of the AAS BS, as shown in Figure 4.10-1.
{width="6.075694444444444in" height="3.660416666666667in"}
Figure 4.10-1 Illustration of AAS BS enclosure and _co-location reference
antenna_
Edge-to-edge separation d, between the AAS BS and the _co-location reference
antenna_ shall be set to 0.1 m.
The AAS BS and the _co-location reference antenna_ shall be aligned in a
common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction, as shown in
figure 4.10-1.
The _co-location reference antenna_ and the AAS can have different width.
The vertical radiating regions of the _co-location reference antenna_ and the
AAS composite antenna shall be aligned.
For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at the
_co-location reference antenna_ is different from the AAS BS, a _co-location
reference antenna_ suitable for the frequency stated in the requirement is
assumed.
OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted interface
of a _co-location reference antenna_ , depending on the requirement this
interface is either an input or an output.
For AAS BS with dual polarization the _co-location reference antenna_ has two
conducted interfaces each representing one polarization.
# 5 Applicability of Requirements
## 5.1 General
The applicability of requirements is related to the band categories described
in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5]. This clause captures the requirement clauses\'
applicability for the respective band categories depending on the operating
band specific BS RAT/MSR capability. For each individual band, the
manufacturer declares whether the AAS BS conforms to MSR or single RAT
requirements.
The applicability of requirements is further related to the declared AAS BS
architecture, either a _hybrid AAS BS_ or a _OTA AAS BS_. This clause captures
the requirement clauses applicability to either the _hybrid AAS BS requirement
set_ or the _OTA AAS BS requirement set_. The manufacturer declares whether
the AAS BS conforms to the _hybrid AAS BS requirement set_ or the _OTA AAS BS
requirement set_.
In the present specification, requirements for _MSR operation_ and for _single
RAT operation_ are defined. If the AAS BS is declared to be single RAT in an
operating band, the respective requirements for _single RAT operation_
(derived from 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3] or 3GPP TS 36.104 [4])
apply in that operating band. If the AAS BS is declared to be MSR (operating
one or more RATs) in the operating band, the requirements for _MSR operation_
(derived from 3GPP TS 35.104 [5]) apply to that operating band. Where
requirements for _MSR operation_ comprise RAT specific requirements, these
apply only when the AAS BS is operating the RAT in the operating band.
NOTE: An AAS BS declared MSR in an operating band and operating only one RAT
is differentiated from an AAS BS declared single RAT in the operating band by
the fact that requirements are derived from 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] rather than
from the single RAT specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3] or
3GPP TS 36.104 [4].
## 5.2 Band category 1 (BC1) and band category 2 (BC2)
The RF requirements listed in table 5.2-1 apply to AAS BS for each supported
operating band belonging to BC1 and BC2. Requirements apply according to the
RAT/MSR capability of the AAS BS in the operating band, as listed in the
heading of the table and the declared requirement set (hybrid or OTA). Some
requirements listed in the table may not be mandatory or they may apply only
regionally. This is further specified in the subclause treating each
requirement and in table 4.5-1.
NOTE: Bands in BC1 and BC2 categories are also used for NB-IoT operation. NB-
IoT is not applicable for AAS BS.
For operation in multiple operating bands, the applicability of the
requirements in table 5.2-1 is determined based on the manufacturer declared
AAS BS RAT and single RAT/MSR conformance for each operating band. The
applicability of _multi-band requirements_ respective _single band
requirements_ is defined in clause 4.9 and in each referred clause in the
table but it cannot be determined by the table itself.

NOTE: For some requirements, the requirement is defined by reference to the
respective _non-AAS BS_. These requirements cannot be identified from this
table.
* * *
## 5.3 Band category 3 (BC3)
The RF requirements listed in table 5.3-1 apply to AAS BS for each supported
operating band belonging to BC3. Requirements apply according to the RAT/MSR
capability of the AAS BS in the operating band, as listed in the heading of
the table and the declared requirement set (hybrid or OTA). Some requirements
listed in the table may not be mandatory or they may apply only regionally.
This is further specified in the clause of each requirement and in table
4.5-1.
For operation in multiple operating bands, the applicability of the
requirements in table 5.3-1 is determined based on the manufacturer declared
AAS BS RAT and single RAT/MSR conformance for each operating band. The
applicability of _multi-band requirements_ respective _single band
requirements_ is defined in clause 4.9 and in each referred clause in the
table but it cannot be determined by the table itself.

# 6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified with a
full complement of transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating
conditions.
_The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported geographical
cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with the minimum amount of cell
splitting supported with transmission on all TAB connectors supporting the
operating band. The manufacturer shall also declare TAB connector TX min cell
groups._ Every _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in an operating band
shall map to one _TAB connector_ _TX min cell group_ supporting the same
operating band _. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation
dependent._
_The number of active transmitter units that are considered when calculating
the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for an AAS BS is calculated as
follows:_
N~TXU,\ counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in _single RAT

## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.7.1 General
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array. The requirement
applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and the _transmitter transient
period_.
The requirement applies at each _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in the
operating band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal is injected into the _TAB connector_.
For AAS BS there are two types of transmitter intermodulation cases captured
by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:
1) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from a co-located base station.
2) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from other transmitter units within the AAS BS.
For AAS BS, the co-location transmitter intermodulation requirement is
considered sufficient if the interfering signal for the co-location
requirement is higher than the declared interfering signal for intra-system

# 7 Conducted receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the AAS
BS _TAB connector_ with full complement of transceivers for the configuration
in normal operating condition. For FDD operation the requirements in clause 7
shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) on.
NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is configured to
transmit and receive at the same time.
NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is configured to
TX OFF power during _receive period_.
The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported geographical
cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with minimum amount of cell
splitting. The manufacturer shall also declare _TAB connector RX min cell
groups for this minimum number of cells configuration_. Every _TAB connector_
supporting reception in an operating band shall map to one _TAB connector_ RX
min cell group supporting the same. The mapping of _TAB connectors_ to cells
is implementation dependent.
The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating the
emission limit (N~RXU,counted~) for an AAS BS is calculated as follows:
N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,active~, 8_ _× N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in _single
RAT E-UTRA operation_ and MSR AAS BS (excluding UTRA only MSR AAS BS).
And
N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,\ active~, 4_ _×_ _N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in
_single RAT UTRA operation_ and UTRA only MSR AAS BS.
Further:
N~RXU,countedpercell~ = _N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~_
N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the _basic limits_ as described in
subclause 7.6.
NOTE 3: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and is
independent to the declaration of N~cells~.
Any receiver requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or
standalone NB-IoT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-

The adjacent channel selectivity (ACS), general blocking and narrowband
blocking characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the _TAB connector_ in the presence
of an unwanted interferer inside the operating band.
NOTE: For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity characteristics is
referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\", whereas for the MSR
requirements, the corresponding property is referred to as \"general
blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not carry a channel
addressable from the interfered carrier.
The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
_operating band_. The values of Δf~OOB~ are defined in table 7.4.1-1.

_Operating band_ characteristics Δf~OOB~ [MHz]
* * *

> in the _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall be less than or equal to the
> AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective frequency span.

for each applicable _basic limit_ as specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6] or 3GPP
TS 25.105 [7], for each _TAB connector RX min cell group,_ the power sum of
emissions at the _TAB connectors_ of the _TAB connector RX min cell group_
shall not exceed an AAS BS limit specified as the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X
= 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional

### 7.6.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation
The single RAT E-UTRA wide area, medium range area and local area RX spurious
emissions _basic limit_ s are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS 36.104
[8], subclause 7.7.1 with the exception that the frequency range around the
band edge (within which the requirement is not applicable) is Δf~OBUE~.
The RX spurious emissions requirements for a single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS are that
for each applicable _basic limit_ specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] for each
_TAB connector RX min cell group_ , the power sum of emissions at the _TAB
connectors_ of the _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall not exceed an AAS
limit specified as the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X =
10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.
NOTE: Conformance to the _AAS BS receiver_ spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:
> 1) The sum of the emissions power measured on each _TAB connector_ in the
> _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall be less than or equal to the AAS BS
> limit as defined above for the respective frequency span.

## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.7.1 General
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver unit to
receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
two interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the
wanted signal. The requirement applies per _TAB connector._
### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
#### 7.7.2.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 [9], annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For _multi-band TAB connectors_ , the requirement applies in addition inside
any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ at those connectors, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edge_. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ inside
the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the _TAB connector_ , using the parameters in tables
7.7.2.1-1 and 7.7.2.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 36.104
[8], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 [7], subclause 7.2.1.2.
\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channel defined for _BS type 1-H_ in TS 38.104
[28], subclause 7.2.2

#### 7.7.2.2 General narrowband intermodulation minimum requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified
in 3GPP TS 37.104 [9], annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For _TAB connector_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ within
each supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
_sub-block gap_ in case the _sub-block gap_ is at least as wide as the
_channel bandwidth_ of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.7.2.2-2. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_ edges inside
the gap.
For _multi-band TAB connectors_ , the requirement applies in addition inside
any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ at those connectors in case the gap size is at
least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.7.2.2-2. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ _edges_ inside the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the _TAB connector_ , using the parameters in tables
7.7.2.2-1 and 7.7.2.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 36.104
[8], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 [7], subclause 7.2.1.2.
\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channel defined for _BS type 1-H_ in TS 38.104

# 8 Performance requirements
## 8.1 General
Performance requirements specify the ability of the AAS BS to correctly
demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
The demodulation requirements for an AAS BS are the same as _non-AAS BS_
demodulation requirements specified for:
\- _Single RAT UTRA operation_ in TS 25.104 [9] clause 8 for FDD operation,
and in TS 25.105 [10] clause 8 for TDD operation,
\- _Single RAT E-UTRA operation_ in TS 36.104 [11], subclauses 8.2 -- 8.4 and
8.6 -- 8.7.
### 8.1.1 UTRA operation
Performance requirements for _single RAT UTRA operation_ in FDD are specified
for the measurement channels defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2] and 3GPP TS 25.105
[3]. The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are
supported by AAS BS. For FRC8 in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2] the non E-DPCCH boosting
and E-DPCCH boosting requirement only apply for the option supported by the
AAS BS. The performance requirements for the high speed train scenarios
defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2] and 3GPP TS 25.105 [3] are optional.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single cell
only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS supporting UTRA FDD DC-HSUPA or
DB-DC-HSUPA and UTRA TDD MC-HSUPA are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements. For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with
the transmitter unit(s) associated with the _TAB connectors(s)_ in the
operating band ON.
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the _TAB connectors(s)_ in UTRA FDD
operation are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
transmitter unit(s) associated with the _TAB connectors_ may be OFF for some
of the tests as specified in TS 37.145-1 [29] and TS 37.145-2 [30].
In the referred UTRA specifications and in this clause, the term BS with RX
diversity refers to performance requirements for two _demodulation branches_ ,
and BS without RX diversity refers to performance requirements for one
_demodulation branch_.
For AAS BS with RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements with RX
diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and Î~or~/I~oc~ for UTRA
TDD shall be applied separately for each _demodulation branch_.
For AAS BS without RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements without
RX diversity apply. The required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and Î~or~/I~oc~ for
UTRA TDD shall be applied for each AAS BS _demodulation branch_.
The E~b~/N~0~ used for UTRA FDD is defined as:
Where:
is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH, E-DPDCH, S-E-
DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per _demodulation branch_ from all
branches
is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise sources
is the number of chips per frame
is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for UTRA and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for
E-UTRA.

_BS type 1-O_ defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 [28] in subclause 9.6.2.2.
#### 9.6.4.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the ideal
waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the error
vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine filter to the
considered chip rate and roll-off α=0.22. Both waveforms are then further
modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and
chip clock timing to minimize the error vector. The EVM result is defined as
the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean
reference power expressed as a percentage.
For UTRA FDD the measurement interval is one timeslot as defined by the C-PICH
(when present) otherwise the measurement interval is one timeslot starting
with the beginning of the SCH. The requirement is valid over the total power
dynamic range as specified in subclause 9.4.4. The minimum requirements are
the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], subclause 6.8.2.1.
For UTRA FDD the Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error
vector onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. The Code Domain
Error for every code in the domain is defined as the ratio of the mean power
of the projection onto that code, to the mean power of the composite ideal
waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak Code Domain Error is defined
as the maximum value for the Code Domain Error for all codes. The measurement
interval is one timeslot as defined by the C-PICH (when present) otherwise the
measurement interval is one timeslot starting with the beginning of the SCH.
The minimum requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6],
subclause 6.8.3.1.
For UTRA FDD the Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the
error vector onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. Only the
active code channels in the composite ideal waveform are considered for this
requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for every active code is defined
as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection onto that code, to the
mean power of the active code in the composite ideal waveform. This ratio is
expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame. The minimum
requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], subclause 6.8.5.1.
The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for 64QAM
modulated codes.
#### 9.6.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

## 9.7 OTA Unwanted Emissions
### 9.7.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions 3GPP TS 25.331 [16]. In ITU
terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside
the _channel bandwidth_ resulting from the modulation process and non-
linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious
emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such
as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
OTA unwanted emissions for _OTA AAS BS_ in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ and
_MSR operation_ using E-UTRA consist of an OTA operating band unwanted
emissions requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement. OTA operating
band unwanted emissions requirement defines limits for emissions in each
supported _downlink operating band_ plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above
and Δf~OBUE~ below each band, where Δf~OBUE~ is the maximum offset of the
operating band unwanted emission mask from the operating band edge. Emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by OTA spurious emissions
requirement.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined for _OTA AAS BS_ for E-UTRA and UTRA
operating bands in Table 9.7.1-1.

##### 9.7.4.3.2 Minimum requirements for single RAT UTRA FDD operation
The minimum requirement is specified in table\'s 9.7.4.3.2-1 to 9.7.3.4.2-10
for the appropriate P~max,c,TRP~, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal -3 dB
point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the centre of
the measurement filter;
\- f_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge as
defined in clause 5.2, whichever is the greater.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

#### 9.7.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation
There is no spectrum emission mask requirement for a single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS.
### 9.7.5 OTA Operating band unwanted emission
#### 9.7.5.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, for E-UTRA single band and MSR the operating band
unwanted emission limits are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency
of each supported _downlink operating band_ to the lower _Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge_ located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper _Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge_ located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported _downlink operating band_. The values of Δf~OBUE~
are defined in table 9.7.1-1.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.
The operating band unwanted emissions minimum requirements are quoted as TRP
per _RIB_ unless otherwise stated.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of RIB is considered (single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification. In addition, for a RIB operating in _non-
contiguous spectrum_ , the requirements apply inside any _sub-block gap_. In
addition, for a _multi-band RIB_ the requirements apply inside any _Inter RF
Bandwidth gap_.
The unwanted emission limits in the part of the _downlink operating band_ that
falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation SM.329
[14].
Additional limits in clause 9.7.5.2.4.7 may apply outside OBUE frequency
domain.
Emissions shall use the minimum requirements specified in the tables below,
where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the
_downlink operating band_.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

NOTE 9: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of f_offset is
continuous.
NOTE 10: As a general rule for the requirements in the present subclause, the
resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity
and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in
order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
NOTE 11: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \ \- The frequency range from **Δf~OBUE~** below the lower _Base Station RF

NOTE 1: Local or regional regulations may specify another excluded frequency
range, which may include frequencies where synchronised TDD systems operate.
NOTE 2: TDD base stations that are synchronized and operating in BC3 can
transmit without these additional co-existence requirements.
###### 9.7.5.2.4.3 Protection of DTT
In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of DTT.
For an AAS BS operating in Band 20, the level of emissions in the band 470-790
MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre frequencies F~filter~
according to table 9.7.5.2.4.3-1, shall not exceed the maximum emission TRP

###### 9.7.5.4.6.7 Additional requirements for band 48
The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 48 in certain
regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in table
9.7.5.4.6.7-1.

All 0 MHz ≤ ∆f \ \- E-UTRA BS as specified in TS 36.104 [4]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
> frequency of the _downlink operating band_ up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
> frequency of the _downlink operating band_ , where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
> subclause 9.7.1.
\- MSR BS as specified in TS 37.104 [5]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of the _downlink operating band_ up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of the _downlink operating band_ , where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
subclause 9.7.1.
For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the _downlink operating band_
, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 [14]. In some exceptional cases,
requirements apply also closer than Δf~OBUE~ MHz from the _downlink operating
band_ ; these cases are highlighted in the requirement tables in respective
referenced UTRA, E-UTRA or MSR specifications. For operating bands supported
by _multi-band RIB_ each supported band including the Δf~OBUE~ around the band
are excluded from the spurious emissions requirements.
The requirements applies for both _single band_ _RIBs_ and _multi-band_ _RIBs_
(except for frequencies at which exclusion bands or other multi-band
provisions apply) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are
measured as mean power.
For operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in [18] is
applicable, the emissions limits are the same regardless of the number of
transceiver units so the limits are equivalent to those for a single
transceiver unit as specified in the _as the corresponding applicable non-AAS
BS per transmitter requirement specified in_ 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS
25.105 [3], 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or 3GPP TS 37.104 [5]. For E-UTRA the limits
will be 9dB lower and for UTRA FDD the limits will be 6 dB lower, unless
stated differently in regional regulation.
The AAS BS requirements for spurious emissions limits which are specified for
Band 46 or for Band 49 in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5], are applicable for AAS BS.
For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable in the spurious emissions frequency domain are
specified in clause 9.7.5.2.4.7.

##### 9.7.6.3.4 Co-location with other base stations
###### 9.7.6.3.4.1 General
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA BS
and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirements are co-location emission requirements are specified as the
power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the _co-location reference_
antenna conducted output(s).
###### 9.7.6.3.4.2 Minimum Requirement
The output of the _co-location reference antenna_ of any spurious emission
shall not exceed the limits of table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 for a AAS BS where
requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared Base Station class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the
exclusions and conditions in the Notes column of table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 apply for
each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see subclause 9.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [12].
NOTE 2: Table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

##### 9.7.6.4.1 Mandatory Requirements
###### 9.7.6.4.1.1 Minimum requirement (Category A)
The minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA BS is the same as that defined
for an MSR BS in subclause 9.7.6.2.1.1.
###### 9.7.6.4.1.2 Minimum Requirement (Category B)
The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table

##### 9.7.6.4.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
This requirement shall be applied for E-UTRA FDD operation in order to prevent
the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being desensitised by
emissions from a _OTA AAS BS_.
The requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are specified
at the _co-location reference antenna_ output.
The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations of the _co-location reference antenna_ and shall not exceed the
limits in table 9.7.6.4.2-1.
Table 9.7.6.4.2-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of the BS
receiver

Medium Range BS F~UL_low~ -- F~UL_high~ - 112 dBm 100 kHz  
Local Area BS F~UL_low~ -- F~UL_high~ -109 dBm 100 kHz
##### 9.7.6.4.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements
###### 9.7.6.4.3.1 General
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS _downlink operating band_. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in subclause 4.5.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.
All additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.
###### 9.7.6.4.3.2 Minimum Requirement
The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of table
9.7.6.4.3.2-1 for an AAS BS where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the
exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 9.7.6.4.3.2-1 apply for
each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in
Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in table
9.7.6.2.3.2-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately
outside the _downlink operating band_ (see subclause 9.7.1). Emission limits
for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 9.7.6.2.3.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in
the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except
in Band 46, or in Band 49), special co-existence requirements may apply that
are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85
UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink operating
band_ and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink
operating band_.

##### 9.7.6.4.4 Co-location with other base stations
###### 9.7.6.4.4.1 General
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD E-UTRA BS
and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are specified
at the _co-location reference antenna_ output.
###### 9.7.6.4.4.2 Minimum Requirement
The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations of the _co-location reference antenna_ and shall not exceed the
limits of table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location
with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared
Base Station class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in
the notes column of table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 apply for each supported operating
band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see subclause 9.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [12].
NOTE 2: Table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
## 9.8 OTA Transmitter intermodulation
### 9.8.1 General
The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located
base station. The requirement applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and
the _transmitter transient period_.
The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the operating
band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the _total radiated power_ of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the _co-
location reference antenna_.
### 9.8.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
#### 9.8.2.1 General minimum requirement
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious emission in subclause 9.7.6.1,
9.7.6.2.1 and 9.7.6.2.3, OTA operating band unwanted emission in subclause
9.7.5 and OTA ACLR in subclause 9.7.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and
an interfering signal according to table 9.8.2.1‑1 for _OTA AAS BS_ operation
in BC1, BC2 and BC3.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For RIB _s_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the
requirement is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ for interfering signal
offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the _sub-block
gap_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_
edges.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement applies relative to the _Base Station
RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of each operating band. In case the inter _Base Station
RF Bandwidth_ gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only
for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap.
Table 9.8.2.1-1: Interfering signal for the OTA transmitter intermodulation
requirement
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +==================================+==================================+ | Wanted signal type | E-UTRA or NR signal | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal type | E-UTRA signal of _channel | | | bandwidth_ 5 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal power level | min(46 dBm, P~rated,t,TRP~) | | applied to the _co-location | | | reference antenna_ | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal centre | ±2.5 MHz | | frequency offset from _Base | | | Station RF Bandwidth_ edge or | ±7.5 MHz | | edge of _sub-block_ inside a gap | | | | ±12.5 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE 1: Interfering signal | | | positions that are partially or | | | completely outside of any | | | _downlink operating band_ of the | | | RIB is excluded from the | | | requirement, unless the | | | interfering signal positions | | | fall within the frequency range | | | of adjacent _downlink operating | | | band_ s in the same geographical | | | area. In case that none of the | | | interfering signal positions | | | fall completely within the | | | frequency range of the _downlink | | | operating band_ , 3GPP TS 37.141 | | | [19] provides further guidance | | | regarding appropriate test | | | requirements. | | | | | | NOTE 2: In certain regions, NOTE | | | 1 is not applied in Band 1, 3, | | | 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 28, 32 | | | operating within 1 475.9 MHz to | | | 1 495.9 MHz, 34. | | | | | | NOTE 3: For _OTA AAS BS_ with | | | dual polarization, the | | | interfering signal power shall | | | be equally divided between the | | | supported polarizations at the | | | _co-location reference antenna_. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
#### 9.8.2.2 Additional minimum requirement (BC1 and BC2)
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits specified for transmitter spurious emission in subclause 9.7.6.1,
9.7.6.2.1 and 9.7.6.2.3 operating band unwanted emission in subclause 9.7.5
and ACLR in subclause 9.7.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and an
interfering signal according to table 9.8.2.2-1 for BS operation in BC2.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ edges
for BC2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_.
For RIBs supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ in BC1 or BC2, the
requirement is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ with a gap size larger
than or equal to two times the interfering signal centre frequency offset. For
RIBs supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ in BC1, the requirement
is not applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ with a gap size equal to or larger
than 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-
block_ edges.
For _multi-band_ _RIBs_ , the requirement applies relative to the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of a BC2 operating band. The requirement is also
applicable for BC1 and BC2 inside an inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap
equal to or larger than two times the interfering signal centre frequency
offset. For RIBs supporting operation in multiple operating bands, the
requirement is not applicable for BC1 band inside an inter _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ gap with a gap size equal to or larger than 5 MHz.

#### 9.8.2.3 Additional minimum requirement (BC3)
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious emission in subclause 9.7.6.1,
9.7.6.2.1 and 9.7.6.2.3 OTA operating band unwanted emission in subclause
9.7.5 and OTA ACLR in subclause 9.7.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and
an interfering signal according to table 9.8.2.3-1 for AAS BS operation in
BC3.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement applies relative to _the Base Station
RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of each operating band. In case the _Inter RF Bandwidth
gap_ is less than 3.2 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap.

#### 9.8.2.4 Additional minimum requirements
### 9.8.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation
#### 9.8.3.1 General minimum requirement for FDD UTRA
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the OTA out of band
emission or the OTA spurious emission requirements of subclause 9.7.5 and
subclause 9.7.6.1, 9.7.6.3.1 and 9.7.6.3.3, in the presence of interfering
signal according to table 9.8.3.1-1.

For RIBs supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the requirement
is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the _sub-block gap_. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_ edges.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement is also applicable inside an inter
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the inter _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ gap.
### 9.8.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation
#### 9.8.4.1 General minimum requirement
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits in subclauses 9.7.6.1, 9.7.6.4.1, 9.7.6.4.3, 9.7.5 and 9.7.3 in the
presence of an E-UTRA interfering signal according to table 9.8.4.1‑1.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the

For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement applies relative to the _Base Station
RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of each supported operating band. In case the inter
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the
gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal
falls completely within the inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap.
The wanted signal and interfering signal centre frequency is specified in
table 9.8.4.1‑1.

# 10 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 10.1 General
OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the _AAS BS_ including all
its functional components active unless otherwise stated in each requirement.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 10 apply during the AAS BS
_receive period._
The requirements in clause 10 shall be met for any transmitter setting.
The (E-UTRA) and NR throughput requirements defined for the receiver
characteristics in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.
For requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB) for the
reference direction.
And
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB) for all
other directions.
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
> Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
## 10.2 OTA sensitivity
### 10.2.1 General
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD), related to an _AAS BS
receiver_.
The _AAS BS receiver_ may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing the
_receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple
_sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting from the current AAS BS
settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target
redirection range_ in the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the AAS BS.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 37.145-2 [30].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
NOTE 3: (Void)
If the _AAS BS_ is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 4: For AAS BS without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
_sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
The minimum requirements for a UTRA FDD and for UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option
carrier OTA sensitivity are defined in subclause 10.2.3.
The minimum requirement for an E-UTRA carrier OTA sensitivity is defined in
subclause 10.2.4.
The minimum requirement for an NR carrier OTA sensitivity is the same as that
defined for _BS type 1-O_ in 3GPP TS 38.104 [28] in subclause 10.2.1.2
### 10.2.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as described below
shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is equal to the minimum EIS
level in the respective declared set of EIS level, RAT and _channel
bandwidth_.
For UTRA FDD, the BER shall not exceed 0,001, using the 12,2 kbps data rate
reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2].
For UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option, the BER shall not exceed 0,001, using the 12,2
kbps data rate reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 [3].
NOTE: The requirement applies for all declared sets of EIS, RAT and _channel
bandwidth_ , within the OSDD comprising UTRA, and for all related active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ settings within the AAS BS capability.
### 10.2.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD the throughput criterion, as described below,
shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is equal to the minimum EIS
level in the respective declared set of EIS level, RAT and _channel
bandwidth_.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum throughput_ of the reference
measurement channel as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] with parameters
specified in table 10.2.4-1.
NOTE 1: The requirement applies for all declared sets of EIS level, RAT and
_channel bandwidth_ , within the OSDD comprising E-UTRA, and for all related
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ settings within the AAS BS capability.

## 10.4 OTA Dynamic range
#### 10.4.1 General
The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver unit to
receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal inside the
received _channel bandwidth_ or the capability of receiving high level of
wanted signal.
The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of a
received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction and are
within the OTA REFSENS _RoAoA._
The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under
the assumption of _polarization match_.
#### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
For UTRA, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is specified in subclause
10.4.3.
For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is specified in
subclause 10.4.4.
For NR, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is the same as that
specified for BS type 1-O in 3GPP TS 38.104 [28] in subclause 10.4.2

## 10.5 OTA Adjacent channel selectivity, general blocking, and narrowband
blocking
### 10.5.1 General
The adjacent channel selectivity (ACS), general blocking and narrowband
blocking characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer inside the operating band.
The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of a
received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction, and:
\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~ : the AoA of the incident
wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within the OTA
REFSENS _RoAoA._
\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~ : the AoA of the incident
wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within the within the
_minSENS RoAoA_.
The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under
the assumption o _f polarization match_.
NOTE: For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity characteristics is
referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\", whereas for the MSR
requirements, the corresponding property is referred to as \"general
blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not carry a channel
addressable from the interfered carrier.
The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
_operating band_. The Δf~OOB~ is defined in table 10.5-1.
Table 10.5-1: Δf~OOB~ offset for operating bands
_Operating band_ characteristics Δf~OOB~ [MHz]
* * *
F~UL_high~ -- F~UL_low~ \ TRP limit per antenna: P~TRP,\ antenna~ = P~EIRP~ - G~Ant~
>
> E-UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS: P~TRP~ =P~TRP,antenna~ + 9dB
>
> UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS: P~TRP~ =P~TRP,antenna~ + 6dB
It is noted that the AAS architecture assumes that a BS subject to OTA
requirements will have at least 8 antennas.
In case the TRP requirement is set per polarisation, the summation shall be
made per polarisation.
\"P~EIRP~\" is the effective isotropic radiated power (or radiated power
spectral density) set in the regulation (assuming a passive BS antenna) in dBm
(or dBm/measurement BW).
\"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, the antenna gain (dBi) is a fixed
reference value of 17 dBi. Directivity value should be used in above
equations, however with all antenna losses are assumed zero then we can use
effective antenna gain.
