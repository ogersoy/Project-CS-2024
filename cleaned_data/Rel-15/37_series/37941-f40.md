# 1 Scope
The present document is the Technical Report for the Work Item on Over The Air
(OTA) Base Station (BS) testing.
This Technical Report covers background information of OTA testing methods,
measurement uncertainty and test tolerance values derivation for the radiated
conformance testing requirements. This Technical Report covers radiated
conformance testing requirements for the following BS types:
_\- Hybrid AAS BS_ as specified in AAS BS radiated testing specification TS
37.145-2 [4] for the following radio technologies:
\- Hybrid AAS BS in single RAT UTRA operation, TDD
\- Hybrid AAS BS in single RAT UTRA operation, FDD
\- Hybrid AAS BS in single RAT E-UTRA operation
\- _Hybrid AAS BS_ in _MSR operation_ implementing any of the above RATs,
including NR operation.
\- OTA AAS BS as specified in AAS BS radiated testing specification TS
37.145-2 [4] for the following radio technologies:
\- OTA AAS BS in single RAT UTRA operation, FDD
\- OTA AAS BS in single RAT E-UTRA operation
\- OTA AAS BS in _MSR operation_ implementing any of the above RATs, and/or
NR.
\- _BS type 1-H_ in single RAT NR operation in FR1, as specified in NR BS
radiated testing specification TS 38.141-2 [6],
_\- BS type 1-O_ in single RAT NR operation in FR1, as specified in NR BS
radiated testing specification TS 38.141-2 [6],
_\- BS type 2-O_ in single RAT NR operation in FR2, as specified in NR BS
radiated testing specification TS 38.141-2 [6].
Generic term \"BS\" is used to refer to any of these BS types, unless
otherwise stated.
This 3GPP external Technical Report consolidates the OTA measurement related
information originating from multiple AAS BS and NR BS internal technical
reports. This information is needed to supplement the BS radiated testing
specifications as a single, 3GPP external technical report, such that the
information can be referred to from external specifications and bodies.
The NR BS specification refers to two frequency ranges, FR1 and FR2. The AAS
BS specification is only applicable for operating bands within FR1. Thus,
clauses in this report referring to FR2 should be considered as applicable to
NR only.

# 4 Coordinate system
OTA requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic and spatial
parameters. The electromagnetic parameters are specified either in terms of
power (dBm) or field strength (dBμV/m). The spatial parameters are specified
in a Cartesian coordinate system (_x, y, z_) with an addition of spherical
coordinates (r, Θ, φ) for manufacturer declared parameters.
The orientation of these coordinates is depicted in the following figures 4-1,
4-2 and 4-3. In figure 4-2, φ** __** is the angle in the x/y plane and it is
between the x-axis and the projection of the vector onto the x/y plane and is
defined between -180° and +180°, inclusive. In figure 4-3, the angle Θ is the
angle between the projection of the vector in the x/y plane and the vector and
is defined between -90° and +90°, inclusive.
A point in the spherical coordinates (r, Θ,**__** φ) can be transformed to
Cartesian coordinate system (_x_ , _y_ , _z_) using the following
relationships:
The inverse transformation from Cartesian coordinate system (_x_ , _y_ , _z_)
to spherical coordinates (r, Θ,**__** φ) is given by:
$\phi = \ \left{ \begin{matrix} \arctan\frac{y}{x},\ x \geq 0\ \text{and}\ y
\geq 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \arctan\frac{y}{x} + \ 180^{{^\circ}},\ x  0 \
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n}
\right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } +
\sum_{\begin{matrix} u^{2} + v^{2} > λ, there is a
potential risk that emission leaking through the encapsulation or the antenna
aperture can be directed in a certain direction. Therefore, the process to
determine the sampling grid and corresponding resolution needs to include the
frequency as one parameter. Consequently, a concept with a fixed sampling grid
over the whole spurious frequency domain is not suitable to balance
measurement uncertainty with test time.
### 6.3.6 TRP summation error
In practice, discrete samples of EIRP or power density are measured at
different directions $(\theta,\phi)$ over the entire sphere, which are used to
numerically approximate the surface TRP~Reference~ integral. The obtained
value, TRP~Estimate~, is an approximation of TRP~Reference~ and the difference
between them is defined as the _TRP summation error_ (SE) which is
SE = \| TRP~Estimate~ -- TRP~reference~ \| (in dB)
The SE is the error caused by the numerical integration of measured values on
the grid to obtain TRP~Estimate~, given that the number of test points
correspond to the reference angular steps, which are in turn dependent on
antenna size and frequency, as described in clause 6.3.4. A reasonable trade-
off between accuracy and sampling time is achieved when the SE = 0.75 dB.
## 6.4 Co-location measurements
### 6.4.1 General
Co-location measurements are required for the OTA co-location requirements
which are based on assuming the BS is co-located with another BS of the same
base station class. They ensure that both co-located systems can operate with
minimal degradation to each other.
Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of the
conducted interface of the _co-location reference antenna_. For conformance
testing the requirements are translated to the input or output of a _co-
location test antenna_ (CLTA).
CLTA is a practical passive antenna that is used for conformance testing of
the co-location requirements and is based on the definition of the _co-
location reference antenna_. Basic principle of the CLTA are outlines in
clause 6.4.2. For more details on the _co-location test antenna_
characteristics, refer to TS 37.145-2 [4] clause 4.15.2.2, or TS 38.141-2 [6]
clause 4.12.2.2. The CLTA is suitable for testing BS implemented with a planar
_antenna array_.
The alignment between the BS under test and the _co-location test antenna_ is
depicted in figure 6.4.1-1. For more details on the _co-location test antenna_
alignment and test arrangement, refer to TS 37.145-2 [4] clause 4.15.2.3, or
TS 38.141-2 [6] clause 4.12.2.3. The same physical alignment applies to in-
band and out-of-band co-location requirements.
Co-location requirements are not applicable to FR2.

Figure 6.4.1-1: Alignment of BS and CLTA
### 6.4.2 Co-location test antenna
The _co-location test antenna_ is a practical passive antenna based on the
definition of the _co-location reference antenna,_ and it is used for
conformance testing of the co-location requirements. Thus the CLTA should be
within a certain tolerance of the _co-location reference antenna_ definition,
so that commonly available passive BS antennas can be used to test the co-
location requirements without having to use a large number of test antennas
and without having to design specialized _co-location test antennas_.
For example, where the _co-location reference antenna_ definition specifies
that the _co-location reference antenna_ , should be a single column passive
antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h) as the composite
antenna of BS, this would be very restrictive when selecting a test antenna.
Hence the CLTA should be within a certain tolerance for the vertical radiating
dimension (h) such that a suitable practical BS antenna can be found for each
BS.
The CLTA is hence defined as follows:
\- The CLTA is a single column passive antenna which has a vertical radiating
dimension (h) which is equal to the vertical radiating dimension of the BS
composite antenna ±30 %.
\- For in-band requirements, the CLTA supports the same frequency range and
polarizations as the BS composite antenna.
\- For out-of-band co-location requirements, the half power vertical beamwidth
of the CLTA equals the narrowest declared vertical beamwidth ±3 °.
\- The polarization should match the in-band CLTA polarization.
\- The CLTA has a horizontal half-power beamwidth of 65 ° ± 10 °.
\- The front faces of the BS and the CLTA need to be aligned in a common plane
perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction.
\- The centre of the vertical radiating regions of the CLTA and the BS
composite antenna need to be aligned.
### 6.4.3 Standard test antenna
Co-location requirements may also be tested with a standardised test antenna
such as a dipole. This has a number of advantages:
\- Standard test antennas are easily available and easier to specify.
\- Repeatability between different conformance testing runs will be greater.
\- Using standard test antennas, fewer antennas will be required for
conformance testing.
\- A standard test antenna can have higher gain in the direction of the BS
than a CLTA, so that signal levels can be higher relative to the noise floor
in emission measurements and lower test levels can be used in interference
measurements.
In order to test with a standard test antenna, the translation between
measured power levels in the standard test antenna and the _co-location
reference antenna_ must be shown. The method for translating the power levels
in the _co-location reference antenna_ to the standard test antenna and vice
versa is not covered by the present release of this technical report.
## 6.5 Requirements classification

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | TX requirement | Description | Classification | +======================+======================+======================+ | Radiated transmit | The minimum | Directional | | power | requirements for | | | | radiated transmit | | | | power, are placed on | | | | one or more | | | | manufacturer | | | | declared beams over | | | | a declared OTA peak | | | | direction set. OTA | | | | requirements for BS | | | | output power are | | | | defined for | | | | directional EIRP | | | | requirements as | | | | radiated transmit | | | | power requirements. | | | | | | | | This requirement | | | | originates from the | | | | Rel-13 AAS BS | | | | requirement for the | | | | EIRP accuracy. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA BS output power | TRP metric is used | TRP | | | for BS output power | | | | limit requirement. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA output power | OTA output power | Directional | | dynamics | dynamics consists of | | | | the Total power | | | | dynamic range, as | | | | well as the RE power | | | | control dynamic | | | | range requirements. | | | | | | | | For E-UTRA | | | | specification, the | | | | RE power control | | | | dynamic range | | | | requirement has no | | | | specific test and is | | | | tested together with | | | | the EVM. | | | | Furthermore, | | | | verification of the | | | | output power | | | | dynamics is not | | | | impacted by the | | | | spatial aspects | | | | around the BS. | | | | Therefore, the OTA | | | | output power | | | | dynamics | | | | requirements are | | | | considered as | | | | directional | | | | requirements. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA transmit OFF | The OTA transmit OFF | FR1: Co-location | | power | power is a | | | | co-location | FR2: TRP | | | requirement in FR1, | | | | defined at the | | | | _co-location | | | | reference antenna_ | | | | conductive output | | | | side, subject to | | | | scaling. | | | | | | | | For FR2, it is | | | | defined as _TRP | | | | requirement_. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA transient period | Same as OTA transmit | FR1: Co-location | | | OFF power, the OTA | | | | transient period is | FR2: directional | | | a co-location | | | | requirement in FR1, | | | | defined at the | | | | _co-location | | | | reference antenna_ | | | | conductive output | | | | side, subject to | | | | scaling. | | | | | | | | For FR2, it is | | | | defined as | | | | directional | | | | requirement. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA transmitted | EVM: The range of | Directional | | signal quality | directions where the | | | | EVM requirement must | | | | be met is declared | | | | by the manufacturer | | | | as _OTA coverage | | | | range_ , while the | | | | requirement itself | | | | is considered | | | | directional. | | | | | | | | Frequency error: The | | | | frequency error is | | | | coherent and will | | | | have a \'flat\' | | | | response in the | | | | spatial domain, i.e. | | | | OTA frequency error | | | | will not depend on | | | | the selection of the | | | | measurement point | | | | within beam\'s | | | | compliance | | | | directions set. | | | | Therefore, single | | | | directional | | | | requirement can be | | | | applied. | | | | | | | | TAE: In terms of | | | | testing effort it is | | | | beneficial, to | | | | coordinate testing | | | | of OTA TAE with | | | | testing of other | | | | transmitter | | | | parameters such as | | | | OTA frequency error | | | | and radiated | | | | transmit power. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA occupied | For occupied | Directional | | bandwidth | bandwidth, the beam | | | | characteristics are | | | | not important. The | | | | requirement should | | | | however cover the | | | | fact that all | | | | transmitter is | | | | active and the | | | | system is operating | | | | at the maximum | | | | declared rated | | | | _total radiated | | | | power_. Occupied | | | | bandwidth is | | | | specified as a | | | | directional | | | | requirement valid | | | | over the _OTA | | | | coverage range_. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA ACLR | ACLR requirement is | TRP | | | the ratio of two TRP | | | | measures: the total | | | | radiated filtered | | | | mean power centred | | | | on the assigned | | | | channel frequency to | | | | the total radiated | | | | filtered mean power | | | | centred on an | | | | adjacent channel | | | | frequency. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA operating band | The OBUE unwanted | TRP | | unwanted emission | emissions | | | | requirement in the | | | | OTA domain must | | | | capture all | | | | emissions around the | | | | BS by application of | | | | the TRP metric. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA transmitter | Similar to other | TRP except for | | spurious emission | Unwanted emissions | co-location | | | requirements, the | requirements | | | metric used to | applicable in FR1 | | | capture transmitter | | | | spurious emissions | | | | OTA is TRP. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | OTA transmitter | OTA transmitter | Co-location | | intermodulation | intermodulation | | | | requirement relies | | | | on Unwanted emission | | | | requirements (i.e. | | | | operating band | | | | unwanted emission, | | | | transmitter spurious | | | | emission, and ACLR; | | | | all defined as TRP) | | | | in the presence of a | | | | wanted signal and an | | | | interfering signal. | | | | | | | | No requirement for | | | | FR2 is defined. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
Directional requirements are to be met over one of two defined directions
sets, with each direction set being declared:
\- The _OTA coverage range_ : range of directions over which _directional
requirements_ associated with BS-UE communication are intended such as
modulation quality, TAE and frequency error. It can be regarded as the range
of directions which define the cell coverage. There is only one _OTA coverage
range_ per BS.
\- The _OTA peak directions set_ : intended for _directional requirements_
which are intended for the centre of the beam for example EIRP accuracy. The
_OTA peak directions set_ must always be within the _OTA coverage range_.
There may be more than one _OTA peak directions set_ declared, the
declarations cover the range of directions which a beam may be steered. As the
BS may generate more than one type of beam with different beam widths and
different steering capabilities the declaration allows for multiple _OTA peak
direction sets_ to be declared. The minimum set of declarations covers the
beams with the narrowest and the widest beam widths.

## 7.1 General
All the measurement systems are described for measurement in Normal test
conditions, unless otherwise stated.
## 7.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
### 7.2.1 Measurement system description, Normal test conditions
This method measures the EIRP in an anechoic chamber with the separation
between the manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point of the BS
and the phase centre of the receiving antenna of no less than 2D^2^/λ, where D
is the largest dimension of the antenna of BS and λ is the wavelength. The
measurement system setup is as depicted in figure 7.2.1-1 for TX requirements,
and in figure 7.2.1-2 for RX requirements.

This method places the BS under test inside a RF transparent environmentally
sealed enclosure so that the BS temperature can be controlled whilst the
result of the OTA chamber facility is at nominal temperature.
The separation between the manufacturer declared coordinate system reference
point of the BS and the phase centre of the receiving antenna of no less than
2D^2^/λ, where D is the largest dimension of the antenna of BS and λ is the
wavelength. The measurement system setup is as depicted in figure 7.2.2-1.

conditions
### 7.2.3 Test method limitations
The maximum size of the BS is a chamber restriction that would affect the
quality of the quiet zone. For larger BS sizes larger size chambers should be
considered such that the uncertainty of the quiet zone is taken into account.
## 7.3 Compact Antenna Test Range
### 7.3.1 Measurement system description, Normal test conditions
In case of TX requirements measurement, the Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR)
uses the BS which radiates a wavefront to a range antenna reflector which will
then collimate the radiated spherical wavefront into a feed antenna. The
sufficient separation between the BS and the receiver (feed antenna shown in
figure 7.3.1-1) so that the emanating spherical wave reaches nearly plane
phase fronts from transmitter to receiver. The BS transmits a wavefront that
will illuminate the range antenna reflector, which will then reflect the
transmitted energy into the feed antenna. The range feed antenna is connected
to a vector network analyzer or other equivalent test equipment.
Figure 7.3.1-1: CATR measurement system setup, TX requirements
In case of RX requirements, the CATR uses the feed antenna which radiates a
spherical wavefront to a range reflector antenna which will then collimate the
radiated spherical wavefront to the BS. There is sufficient separation between
the BS and the transmitter (feed antenna shown in figure 7.3.1-2) so that the
emanating spherical wave reaches nearly plane phase fronts from transmitter to
receiver. The feed antenna transmits a wavefront that will illuminate the
range antenna reflector, which will then reflect the transmitted energy
towards the BS.

### 7.3.2 Measurement system description, Extreme test conditions
This method places the BS under test inside a RF transparent environmentally
sealed enclosure so that the BS temperature can be controlled whilst the
result of the OTA chamber facility is at nominal temperature.
The Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) uses the BS which radiates a wave front
to a range antenna reflector which will then collimate the radiated spherical
wave front into a feed antenna. The sufficient separation between the BS and
the receiver (feed antenna shown in figure 7.3.2-1) so that the emanating
spherical wave reaches nearly plane phase fronts from transmitter to receiver.
The BS transmits a wave front that will illuminate the range antenna
reflector, which will then reflect the transmitted energy into the feed
antenna. The range feed antenna is connected to a vector network analyzer or
other equivalent test equipment.
For the environmental control of the BS required to produce the extreme
temperature environment the BS under test is placed inside a RF transparent
environmentally sealed enclosure so that the BS temperature can be controlled
whilst the result of the OTA chamber facility is at nominal temperature.

Figure 7.3.2-1: CATR measurement system setup for EIRP accuracy in Extreme
test conditions
### 7.3.3 Test method limitations
The maximum size of the BS is a chamber restriction that would affect the
quality of the quiet zone. For larger BS sizes larger size chambers should be
considered such that the uncertainty of the quiet zone is taken into account.
The CATR is not suitable for low frequency measurements.
## 7.4 One Dimensional Compact Range
### 7.4.1 Measurement system description
The principle of the One Dimensional Compact Range measurement setup is shown
in figure 7.4.1-1. It closely resembles the standard compact range chamber.
But for the generation of the plane wave in the quiet zone the proposed method
uses a special one dimensional probe instead of the standard set up comprising
a concave mirror and a feed horn. The main advantage is a reduced chamber size
and a simplified probe system replacing the standard mirror feed horn set up.
{width="6.53125in" height="2.8229166666666665in"}

EIRP accuracy

Figure 7.4.1-2: One Dimensional Compact Range measurement\ system setup for
OTA sensitivity
The probe antenna is set up of a one dimensional array of antenna modules,
connected by a special feed system. Optimized amplitude and phase settings in
the feed system result in a plane wave in vertical direction. As no near field
to far field transformation has to be carried out, it is not required to
measure a whole set of azimuth and elevation angles.
### 7.4.2 Test method limitations
One Dimensional Compact Range test method is only suitable for BS whose
_antenna array_ consists of a single column _antenna array_. For a BS equipped
with multi-column _antenna array_ , this method would not be suitable due to
the high amplitude uncertainty of edge column elements. High amplitude
uncertainty makes testing of the declared steering angles not possible to meet
EIRP accuracy requirements.
## 7.5 Near Field Test Range
### 7.5.1 Measurement system description
The Near Field Test Range (NFTR) measurement techniques consist in measuring
amplitude and phase of the modulated signal at the BS under test, on some
specific surfaces such as planar, cylindrical, and spherical. Each of the near
field test methods can be implemented by one or more mechanical rotations of
the probe and/or BS under test as shown in figure 7.5.1-1. One or more
mechanical movement can be substitute by a probe array. All the scanning
methods will need an RF transmit and receive system equipped with an automated
scanning, a data collection and control system, and computerized analysis
ability.
{width="4.404166666666667in" height="1.507638888888889in"}
Figure 7.5.1-1: Probe/scanner near field systems: spherical, cylindrical and
planar
NOTE: Although there are three methods available for obtaining the near field
data, the spherical method is used as a working example.
In case the radiated field is sampled on a sphere surrounding completely the
BS under test, the 3D full sphere value of the measured parameter can be
measured in near field when the BS is:
\- transmitting (for TX requirements) a defined modulated signals in a
declared beam, or
\- receiving (for RX requirements) a defined modulated signals.
The near field measurement technique would imply the use of mathematical
artefact, NF to FF transform in order to have the measured parameter\'s value
the in far field. The near field to far field transform is based on the well-
known Huygens-Fresnel principle. The spherical modal wave expansion is the
implicit application of the Huygens principle. A direct solution of the
Helmholtz equations is found by applying boundary conditions on the surface S
at infinity. From the tangential fields over the surface, the modal
coefficients can be determined using the orthogonality of the modal expansion.
Based on this formulation, the near field sampling criteria does play an
important role.
### 7.5.2 Test method limitations
#### 7.5.2.1 OTA EVM measurement
For BS implementations that point a beam in the EVM conformance direction
during testing, the near field technique may report too high, but will never
report too low EVM. In case the BS does not point a beam centre in the test
direction, there is a risk of the near field technique report too low EVM.
#### 7.5.2.2 OTA RX directional requirements
There are some limitations on the use of that the BS must not have any BB beam
forming. Considering that BS must have at least 8 TRX the probability of it
meeting the restrictive conditions is small. In addition there are some issues
surrounding the interference requirements when testing in the near field as
the wanted and interfering signal may experience different beam forming.
#### 7.5.2.3 OTA sensitivity measurement
The near field test method is suitable for OTA sensitivity measurement of BS
implementations where the beam forming is done on in a fixed or pre-set manner
for the measured OSDD declaration, i.e. there is only one interface to
digital/baseband processing. The near field test method is not suitable if for
the measured OSDD declaration any combining is not fixed or preset. Some
examples of architectures for which near field test method is possible and for
which it is not possible are depicted on figure 7.5.2.3-2. The BS under test
should not have any other non-linear behaviour that would cause the near field
to far field transformation to fail or cause increased OTA sensitivity
measurement uncertainty (for example, Automatic Gain Control if applicable
must be disabled and the receiver dynamic range must be sufficient to prevent
any increased measurement uncertainty due to the range of the near field
values.

## 7.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer
### 7.6.1 Measurement system description
This method is an extension of a CATR measurement method as captured in clause
7.3, where the reflector is replaced by an _antenna array_ , or Plane Wave
Synthesizer (PWS), capable of approximating a plane wave within a specified
quiet zone in front of the antenna in a similar manner as the reflector in a
CATR system.
The principle of the Plane Wave Synthesizer is shown in figure 7.6.1-1:
{width="5.278075240594926in" height="2.3622047244094486in"}

Figure 7.6.1-2: PWS measurement setup, Rx requirements
Figure 7.6.1-3: PWS measurement setup, OTA dynamic range, ACS, blocking and
ICS
Figure 7.6.1-4: PWS measurement setup, Receiver intermodulation
The PWS typically consists of two main components: the _radiating elements_
arranged in the structure of an array and the feeding system. The architecture
of the later depends on the adopted technology, e.g. it could be fed by a
standard Beam Forming Network (BFN) or by an active system.
Using similar technique of setting the phase and amplitude of the array
signals, a quiet zone containing planar waves as a linear superposition of the
_array elements_ \' spherical radiation waves can be created within the near
field of the array.
The PWS can achieve far-field testing conditions in a Quiet Zone (QZ) as in
the case of CATRs it enables direct measurements of far-field BS performance
in a controlled indoor environment as an alternative to CATR.
### 7.6.2 Test method limitations
The maximum rated Power Density (PD) per section of the PWS area (e.g.
dBm/cm^2^) might be restricted depending on the implementation. This Power
Density at a specific reference plane can be calculated for each BS as a
function of the _total radiated power_ , the test distance and the _radiation
pattern_ of the BS.
## 7.7 General Chamber
### 7.7.0 General
The term general chamber has been used in 2 different ways during the analysis
of the MU budgets the meaning of the term general chamber differs for the
following requirement types:
\- Co-location requirements, as described in clause 7.7.1 and 7.7.2,
\- Out-of-band TRP requirements, as described in clause 7.7.3 and 7.7.4.
For co-location requirements, the MU calculation focuses on the uncertainties
between the test equipment, the CLTA and the DUT as such the precise chamber
type is not relevant as such when calculation the MU it was referred to as a
General Chamber meaning any of the available chamber types which are capable
of performing the appropriate OTA measurement associated with the co-location
requirements.
For out-of-band spurious emissions and out-of-band blocking requirements the
frequency range specified is very great (1 MHz to 12.75 GHz) as such many of
the constraints on the band-specific chambers cannot be met, it is possible
that multiple chambers may be required to cover the whole frequency range for
example, so in this case the term General Chamber was used to imply a non-
specific chamber that was capable of meeting the MU values specified.
### 7.7.1 Measurement system description (co-location requirements)
This section provides description of the chambers for the purpose of the co-
location requirements measurements, i.e.
\- OTA transmitter OFF power,
\- OTA co-location spurious emissions,
\- OTA transmitter intermodulation, and
\- OTA co-location blocking.
For more details on the co-location measurements, refer to clause 6.4.
The General Chamber represents any suitable OTA chamber which shields the BS
and CLTA form external interference and prevents reflections within the
chamber from altering the coupling between the BS and the CLTA, i.e. any of
the OTA measurement systems described in clauses 7.2 to 7.6 may be considered
as example of the General Chamber.

Figure 7.7.1-1: General chamber test system set up diagram for co-location TX
OFF and co-location emissions
The OTA measurement receiver must be capable of conforming that the BS is
radiating the wanted signal at the required power level, however the
measurement is made at the output of the CLTA. The diagram shows a
switch/limiter or filter which is used to reduce the level of the wanted
signal before the requirement is measured in the measurement device.

Figure 7.7.1-2: General chamber test system set up diagram for co-location TX
IMD
The General Chamber represents any chamber capable of performing the OTA
transmitter spurious emissions requirements, the OTA operating band unwanted
emissions requirements and the OTA ACLR requirements to the specified
accuracy.
### 7.7.2 Test method limitations (co-location requirements)
This method may be limited by the availability of suitable CLTA antenna.
### 7.7.3 Measurement system description (out-of-band TRP requirements)
This section provides description of the chambers for the purpose of the
following Out-of-band TRP requirements:
\- Transmitter mandatory spurious emissions, see clause 12.2.2,
\- Receiver spurious emissions, see clause 12.3.2.
\- Out-of-band blocking, see clause 14.2.
The General Chamber represents any suitable OTA chamber capable of performing
the out-of-band TRP requirements. Any OTA measurement systems may be
considered as example of the General Chamber as long as the MU is within the
specified value (or the test requirement is offset appropriately) and they are
suitable for the frequencies being tested.
### 7.7.4 Test method limitations (out-of-band TRP requirements)
Test method limitations of the specific OTA chamber used apply, see clause
7.2.3, 7.3.3, 7.4.2, 7.5.2, 7.6.2, where applicable.
## 7.8 Reverberation chamber
### 7.8.1 Measurement system description
A reverberation chamber (RC) is an electrically large shielded metal enclosure
that employs one or several \"stirring\" methods to randomize the fields, such
as moving paddles, turntables, etc. In this way, a large number of
uncorrelated samples is obtained. The volume in the room where the field is
well-stirred is the working volume. Here the E-field, averaged over an entire
stirring cycle, is independent of the location in the room, i.e. the field is
spatially uniform.
For a proper analysis of the measured data a sufficient number of uncorrelated
samples is required. The auto-correlation function is used to calculate the
offset between statistically uncorrelated samples using the following
expression as in IEC 61000-4-21 [11]:
where the modulus operator mod(x,y) is the remainder of x/y, here performing a
circular shift of the measurement samples over a distance k. The symbols ⟨x⟩
and σ = \"std\" (x) denote the average value and standard deviation. The
threshold value for uncorrelated samples, r~lim~, is defined as in IEC
61000-4-21 [11]:
$r_{\lim} \leq 0.37(1 - 7.22/N^{0.64})$
The distance $k_{\lim}\ $$k_{\text{lim}}$between uncorrelated samples is
calculated as the minimum k-value satisfying $r(k) \leq r_{\lim}$$r\left( k
\right) \leq r_{\text{lim}}$. The number of uncorrelated samples is calculated
as:
When properly designed, this facility can be used for non-directional antenna
measurements, such as TRP. In fact, a well-stirred RC is capable of measuring
TRP in a reliable way, regardless of the directivity pattern of the emission
or frequency range. When measuring TRP of sources with a directive pattern,
special care must be taken to characterize the working volume of the chamber.
The purpose of the chamber characterization is to ensure that the effect of a
non-uniform field distribution in the chamber has a negligible influence on
the measurement result when the BS is placed in the working volume. Lack of
chamber uniformity is a major contributor to measurement uncertainty in
reverberation chambers and should be handled with care.
The uniformity test can be quite time consuming and the test can be performed
separate from the BS measurement. Due to the non-negligible size of BS
equipment the BS can have a significant influence on the uniformity. To take
this effect into account, either the BS itself must be present in the room
during characterization or an absorber with dimensions equal or larger than
the BS must be placed at the BS\'s location in the room.
The characterization procedure consists of placing a reference transmitter
antenna (REF TX ant) at different locations and with different orientations in
the room and measuring the Power Transfer Function (PTF) between the REF TX
and chamber\'s RX antenna, see figure 7.8.1-1. The actual mode of RC operation
shall be used, including stirrer movement, BS movement, diversity antenna
usage, etc. The directivity of the REF TX ant will influence the spatial
uniformity of the room, a more directive REF TX ant is better at detecting
parts of the room that are less-well stirred. Therefore, the REF TX ant chosen
for the uniformity test should excite the chamber in a similar way as the BS.
{width="5.0in" height="4.4631944444444445in"}
Figure 7.8.1-1: Setup for characterization of a reverberation chamber
The working volume shall be at least half a wavelength from the chamber walls
and other electromagnetic reflective objects according to [12]. According to
IEC 61000-4-21 [11] this distance may be restricted to 0.75 m below 100 MHz.
The number of positions and orientations to use depends on the chamber size
and the directivity of the REF TX ant. Measurements made at positions and
orientations at the edges of the working volume are used to characterize the
chamber and derive certain components of uncertainty.
The exact number of positions and orientations remain for further study, but
at least (3) uncorrelated locations should be used and (6) uncorrelated
orientations per position when directive spurs are to be detected.
Different test equipment set ups can be used for the acquisition of the PTF
between REF TX and RX. Such as devices capable of directly extracting the PTF,
like a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) or a set up with separate transmitter and
receiver test equipment, such as a Signal Generator (SG) and Spectrum/signal
Analyzer (SA) configuration. In the latter case the operator should account
for the losses in the set up originating from cables, mismatch, etc.
When using a VNA, the REF TX ant and the measurement receive antenna (RX) are
connected to the test equipment. For each location/orientation _n_ of the REF
TX ant, RC sample, and desired frequency _f_ $f$, the power transfer function
$P_{n} = \left\langle \left| S_{21} \right|^{2} \right\rangle$
is measured. The explicit dependence on RC sample and frequency is not written
out here.
In case of using a SG and SA the PTF is calculated as follows:
$P_{n}\ = \ \frac{\left\langle \left| {U_{r}}^{2} \right| \right\rangle}{50\
P_{t}M_{t}L_{s}}$
with U~r~ the received voltage, 50 Ω being the reference impedance of the SA,
P~t~ the transmit power of the signal source, L~s~ the losses in in the
cables, Mt the mismatch efficiency at the TX antenna calculated as $M_{t} = \
1 - \left| S_{11} \right|^{2}$.
At least 250 uncorrelated samples shall be used per position/orientation.
Using a lower number is not compatible with the underlying analysis on
measurement uncertainty, see IEC 61000-4-21 [11] and publication in [13].
The following tests are performed and shall be verified for each frequency:
a) Uniformity of transfer function: For each location/orientation evaluate
$P_{n}$_P~n~_. The standard deviation of these average values shall be below
the assumed measurement uncertainty level for A6-7 uncertainty contributor, as
described in annex A.6.
b) Dynamic range: The dynamic range of each $P_{n}$_P~n~_ shall be at least 20
dB.
c) Uncorrelated samples: At least 250 uncorrelated samples shall be used.
It is important to note that spatial uniformity (and number of uncorrelated
samples) in an RC is harder to achieve for more directive antenna patterns. As
such, the measurement uncertainty of a sub-optimally configured room will be
higher and additional measures to randomize the fields should be considered.
Optimization of the BS position in the chamber and positional stirring are
good starting points.
### 7.8.2 Test method limitations
The reverberation chamber test method is not suitable for testing spurious
emissions at very low frequencies. The MU evaluation is applicable for the
frequency above 380 MHz.
# 8 Measurement system calibration
## 8.1 General
Calibration of the OTA measurement systems is assumed to be the same for FR1
and FR2 frequencies, unless otherwise stated.
## 8.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration
Calibration shall be done to ensure that the SNR at the measurement equipment
input is appropriate and the reception signal level at the measurement
equipment is within the dynamic range of measurement equipment.
1) Calibration system configuration
For TX requirements: connect the reference antenna and the receiving antenna
to the measurement RF out port and RF in port of the network analyzer,
respectively, as shown in figure 8.2-1. The amplifier may be installed between
C and D if required.

Figure 8.2-1: Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration system setup for TX
requirements
For RX requirements: Connect the reference antenna and the transmitting
antenna to RF in port and RF out port of the network analyzer, respectively,
as shown in figure 8.2-2.
{width="5.510416666666667in" height="5.166666666666667in"}
Figure 8.2-2: Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration system setup for RX
requirements
2) Install the reference antenna with its _beam peak direction_ and the height
of its phase centre aligned with the receiving antenna, or transmitting
antenna (in case of transmitter or receiver requirement, respectively).
3) Set the centre frequency of the network analyzer to the carrier centre
frequency of the tested signal and measure LF~E→D~, which is equivalent to
20log\|S21\| (dB) obtained by the network analyzer:
\- LF~E→D~: Pathloss between E and D in figure 8.2-1 (for Tx requirements) and
8.2-2 (for Rx requirements).
4) Measure the cable loss, LF~E→F~ between the reference antenna connector and
the network analyzer connector:
\- LF~E→F~: Cable loss between E and F in figure 8.2-1 (for Tx requirements)
and 8.2-2 (for Rx requirements).
5) Calculate the calibration value between A and D with the following
formulas:
\- L~cal,\ A→D~ = LF~E→D~ + G~REF_ANT,\ F→A~ - LF~E→F~.
\- L~cal,\ A→D~: Calibration value between A and D in figure 8.2-1 (for Tx
requirements) and 8.2-2 (for Rx requirements).
\- G~REF_ANT,\ A→F~: _Antenna gain_ of the reference antenna.
## 8.3 Compact Antenna Test Range calibration
The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna (SGH used in
figure 8.3-1 or 8.3-2) with known efficiency or gain values. In the
calibration measurement the reference antenna is measured in the same place as
the BS, and the attenuation of the complete transmission path (C↔A, as in
figure 8.3-1 or 8.3-2) from the BS to the measurement receiver is calibrated
out. Figures 8.3-1 and 8.3-2 presents a setup of a typical compact antenna
test range for TX and RX requirements, respectively.
Figure 8.3-1: CATR calibration system setup, TX requirements
Figure 8.3-2: CATR calibration system setup, RX requirements
1) Path loss calibration C→A:
a) Measure SGH (or other calibrated reference antenna) reflection coefficient
separately at the antenna\'s connector with a network analyser (or equivalent
measurement equipment) to obtain Γ~SGH~.
b) Measure cable loss from point C to input of SGH, call this L~C↔SGH~ which
is the equivalent of 20log\|S~21~\| from the use of a network analyser.
c) Calculate the combined total path loss from C→A by using the following
expression:
L~SGHcal~ = L~C,SGH~ + 10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) - G~SGH~,
where$10\log\left( 1 - \left| \Gamma_{\text{SGH}} \right|^{2} \right)$ 10log(1
- \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) is the compensation for SGH connector return loss, G~SGH~ is
the known gain of the reference SGH.
2) Connect SGH and C↔A cable.
3) To remove polarization(s) mismatch between range antenna (labelled as
feeder antenna in diagram) and SGH use positions to position the SGH in the
boresight of range antenna.
4) Measure path loss C→B with network analyzer L~C~→~B~ = 20log\|S~21~\|.
5) Calculate the test path loss compensation factor. This is the total path
loss between A↔B using the results from step 1c and 4. L = $L_{\text{SGHcal}}$
L~SGHcal~ _-_ L~C~→~B~.
Where Γ~SGH~ is the reflection coefficient (or mismatch) seen at the SGH
connector (S~11~ with a network analyzer).
The CATR test setup and calibration for FR2 are expected to be similar to
those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and associated MU values
will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and larger relative array apertures.
However, it is noted that in order to achieve the test instrument
uncertainties that were assumed, calibration of the spectrum analyzer may be
needed.
## 8.4 One Dimensional Test Range calibration
## 8.5 Near Field Test Range calibration
Calibration accounts for the various factors affecting the measurements. These
factors include components such as range length path loss, cable losses, gain
of the receiving antenna, etc. Each measured data point for both radiated
power and radiated sensitivity is transformed from a relative value in dB to
an absolute value in dBm. For doing that the total path loss from the BS to
the measurement receiver, named L path loss is calibrated out. The calibration
measurement is usually done by using a reference antenna with known gain. This
approach is based on the so called gain-comparison method as in IEEE Standard
Test Procedures for Antennas [7]. Figure 8.5-1 shows the typical configuration
for measuring path loss.
{width="6.294444444444444in" height="3.1909722222222223in"}
Figure 8.5-1: Typical L~path~ loss measurement configuration
The L~path~ pathloss can be determined from the power into the reference
antenna by adding the gain of the reference antenna:
P~iso~ = P~ref~ + G~ref~$P_{\text{Isotropic\ Radiator}} = P_{\text{reference\
antenna}} + G_{\text{reference\ antenna}}$
so that:
L~path~ = P~ref~ + G~ref~ - P~test~$L_{\text{path\ loss}} =
P_{\text{reference\ antenna}} + \ G_{reference\ antenna - \ }P_{\text{test\
equipment}}$
In order to determine P~ref~, a cable reference measurement is performed in
order to calibrate out the A, and B paths$L_{test\ equipment - receiver}$.
Assuming that the power at the source is fixed, it can be showed that:
P~ref~ -- P~test~$L_{\text{path\ loss}} = P_{\text{reference\ antenna}} + \
G_{reference\ antenna - \ }P_{\text{test\ equipment}}$ = P~rec~\' - P~rec~
Where P~rec~ $P_{\text{receiver\ }}$and P~rec~\' are the power measured at the
receiver during the calibration measurement with the reference antenna and the
power measured at the receiver during the cable reference measurement
respectively. L~path~ loss $L_{\text{path\ loss\ }}$is then given by:
L~path~ = G~ref~ + P~rec~\' -- P~rec~
## 8.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer calibration
The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna with known
efficiency or gain values (e.g. SGH). In the calibration measurement the
reference antenna is measured in the same place as the BS, and the attenuation
of the complete transmission path (C↔A, see figure 8.6-1) from the BS to the
measurement receiver is calibrated out.

Figure 8.6-2: Path loss calibration in PWS, RX requirements
1) Path loss calibration E→A:
a) Measure SGH (or other calibrated reference antenna) reflection coefficient
separately at the antenna\'s connector with a network analyzer (or equivalent
measurement equipment) to obtain Γ~SGH~.
b) Measure cable loss from point E to input of SGH, call this L~E↔SGH~ which
is the equivalent of 20log\|S~21~\| from the use of a network analyzer.
c) Calculate the combined total path loss from E→A by using the following
expression:
L~SGHcal~ = L~E,SGH~ + 10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) - G~SGH~, where$10\log\left( 1
- \left| \Gamma_{\text{SGH}} \right|^{2} \right)$ 10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) is
the compensation for SGH connector return loss, G~SGH~ is the known gain of
the reference SGH.
2) Connect SGH and D↔E cable.
3) Measure path loss C→E with network analyzer L~C~→~E~ = 20log\|S~21~\|.
4) Calculate the test path loss compensation factor. This is the total path
loss between C↔A using the results from step 1c and 3. L = $L_{\text{SGHcal}}$
L~SGHcal~ _-_ L~C~→~E~.
Where Γ~SGH~ is the reflection coefficient (or mismatch) seen at the SGH
connector (S~11~ with a network analyzer).
## 8.7 General Chamber calibration (co-location requirements)
The General Chamber here refers to the one described in clause 7.7.1.
The OTA path of the General Chamber is calibrated according to its chamber
type using the methodology in clause 8.2 to 8.6.
{width="5.5465277777777775in" height="4.697916666666667in"}

IMD
The CLTA path is calibrated as follows:
1) Cable and matching loss calibration for CLTA for each polarization
supported by the CLTA
a) Measure CLTA reflection coefficient separately at the antenna\'s connector
with a network analyser (or equivalent measurement equipment) to obtain
Γ~ANT~.
b) Measure cable loss from input of CLTA (A) to point B for TX OFF and co-
location spurious emissions and from point B to input of CLTA (A) for TX IMD,
call this L ~ANT↔F~ which is the equivalent of 20log\|S~21~\| from the use of
a network analyser.
c) Calculate the combined total path loss from F to CLTA using the following
equation:
Lcal = L ~ANT↔F~ + 10log(1 - \|Γ~ANT~\|^2^)
## 8.7A General Chamber calibration (out-of-band TRP requirements)
The General Chamber here refers to the one described in clause 7.7.3.
The OTA path of the General Chamber is calibrated according to its chamber
type using the methodology in clause 8.2 to 8.6.
## 8.8 Reverberation chamber calibration
To correctly determine the TRP by the BS a calibration step to account for
losses in cables, antennas, etc. is required. A reference PTF is determined at
each frequency of interest by using a relevant reference TX antenna (REF TX
ant). The chamber should be set up identically to the actual set up of the TRP
measurement, which means the BS has to be in the room, the same stirring
procedure has to be used, etc.
A minimum N~ref~ = 1 reference measurement is required, but it is noted that
more measurements can be used to estimate the reference PTF and that this will
lead to a reduction of the uncertainty by a factor $1/\sqrt{N_{\text{ref}}}$.
The radiation efficiency, η, of the reference antenna can be assumed to be the
value declared by the manufacturer or can be determined in a separate antenna
efficiency measurement.

Figure 8.8-1: The procedure for TRP measurements uses three consecutive
setups: (a) Reference measurement, (b) ambient noise measurement (b), and (c)
TRP measurement. The blue dots indicate the measurement planes
Calibration procedure:
1) Place the BS and the REF TX ant in the working volume of the RC. Turn off
BS power and BS controls. See figure 8.8-1 (a). If more positions are used to
determine the reference PTF the REF TX ant should be placed at uncorrelated
positions within the test volume.
2) Set the stirrers and turntables in the mode of operation used in the
chamber characterization.
3) Set the sampling rate as in the chamber characterization.
4) Connect the REF TX ant and the RX antenna with a calibrated Network
analyser (NA).
5) Measure the scattering parameters or received power over a complete
stirring cycle for each frequency of interest and for each position and
orientation.
6) Calculate the reference transfer function, P^(r)^$P^{\left( r \right)} =
\left\langle \left| S_{21}^{\left( r \right)} \right|^{2} \right\rangle\ $.
7) Calculate the mis-match efficiency, M~1~^(r)^.
# 9 TX directional requirements
## 9.1 General
Most TX directional requirements require demodulation of the transmitted
signal using the \"global in-channel TX test\" as described e.g. in annex L of
TS 38.141-2 [6] for NR.
For simplicity since L~path~ requirements do not all use the same RAT-specific
test models, the OTA test procedures have been kept general by using
\"applicable test signal\" where the RAT-specific test models can be found in
AAS BS or NR BS test specifications TS 37.145-2 [4] and TS 38.141-2 [6],
respectively.
Some requirements are differential and hence many of the calibration and OTA
measurement uncertainties may cancel. These are investigated on a case by case
basis.
NOTE 1: All the calibration and test procedures are valid for FR1 as well as
FR2, unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 2: All the MU and TT values derivations are valid for Normal test
conditions, unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 3: The FR2 MU assessment was carried out using a CATR chamber only
however other chamber types are not precluded if suitable MU assessment is
done.
## 9.2 EIRP accuracy, Normal test conditions
### 9.2.1 General
Clause 9.2 captures MU and TT values derivation for the EIRP accuracy
directional requirement in Normal test conditions.
For the MU and TT values derivation for the EIRP accuracy in Extreme test
conditions, refer to clause 9.3. Specification of Normal and Extreme test
conditions is captured in TS 38.141-2 [6] for NR BS (i.e. _BS type 1-O_ and
_BS type 2-O_), and in TS 37.145‑2 [4] for OTA AAS BS.

##### 9.2.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement
The IAC testing procedure consists of the following steps:
1) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as the phase
centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer declared coordinate system
orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with the testing system.
2) Set the BS to generate the tested beam with the _beam peak direction_
intended to be the same as the testing direction.
3) Rotate the BS to make the testing direction aligned with the direction of
the receiving antenna.
4) Set the BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power according to
applicable test model.
5) Measure the mean power for each carrier arriving at the measurement
equipment connector, denoted by P~R_EIRP, D~, which is defined as measured
mean power for each carrier at the measurement equipment connector at the
reference point D in figure 7.2.1-1.
6) Calculate the EIRP with the following formula:
EIRP = P~R_EIRP,\ D~ + L~EIRP_cal,\ A→D~
7) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~ where the declared beam is the
measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2).
8) Repeat the above steps 2 - 7 per conformance test _beam direction pair_.

As the requirement is done for the wanted beam at full power, even for low
power BS it is not anticipated the received test signal will be lower than -10
dBm.
There may be a tiny impact to signal fidelity due to scattering in the
chamber, however this will be insignificant and is not expected to impact TAE.
As the OTA test system does not affect the measurement accuracy for TAE the
existing conducted MU can be used.

configuration and corresponding power setting specified in TS 37.145-2 [4] for
AAS BS, or in TS 38.141-2 [6] for NR BS.
3) Measure the TAE between the reference signals with signal/spectrum analyser
or equivalent equipment.

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in clause
8.6.
##### 9.8.4A.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement
Reference PWS measurement procedure in clause 9.2.6.2.2 where in steps 3 \- 5
the appropriate measurement parameter is TAE. In this case, however testing
should be carried out in the OTA conformance reference direction, not the
_beam peak direction_ of the _OTA peak directions set_ reference direction.
The testing procedure consists of the following steps:
1) Align BS with boresight of the range antenna.
2) Configure BS to transmit signals carrying reference signals. All beams must
be pointed at the same direction.
NOTE: The transmitted signals should represent the beam configuration with the
lowest number of beams. Each beam should be identifiable using a reference
signal.
\- For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set BS to
transmit according to rated beam EIRP level.
\- If the BS supports intra band contiguous or non-contiguous Carrier
Aggregation, set BS to transmit using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in TS 37.145-2 [4] for AAS BS, or in TS
38.141-2 [6] for NR BS.
\- If the BS supports inter band carrier aggregation, set BS to transmit, for
each band, a single carrier or all carriers, using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in TS 37.145-2 [4] for
AAS BS, or in TS 38.141-2 [6] for NR BS.
3) Measure TAE between the reference signals with signal/spectrum analyser or
equivalent equipment.
#### 9.8.4A.3 MU value derivation
The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not affect
the TAE measurement uncertainty.
Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal BW is
not significant to affect the TAE measurement uncertainty.
The conducted MU value is adopted for the OTA MU.
### 9.8.5 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty
The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not affect
the TAE measurement uncertainty.
Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal BW is
not significant to affect the TAE measurement uncertainty.
The conducted MU value is adopted for the OTA MU, and is ±25 ns.
The MU for FR1 for TAE up to 4.2 GHz was agreed to be the same as for eAAS WI.
It is expected that the measurement chamber setup, calibration and measurement
procedures and the MU budget will be identical for E-UTRA and NR.
Furthermore, for the frequency range 4.2 -- 6 GHz, the chamber and instrument
uncertainties are the same as those for the frequency range 3 \-- 4.2 GHz,
assuming testing of a BS designed for operation in licensed spectrum.
For FR2, similarly to FR1, as long as the link budget is sufficient to provide
a signal at the test equipment that is within its operating range, then the
signal quality requirements MU depends only on the test equipment MU. In the
beam center, for a CATR, there is sufficient link budget and thus the MU was
decided based on expected test equipment performance.
The MU values are 25 ns for time alignment error.
An overview of the MU values for all the requirements is captured in clause
17.
### 9.8.6 Test Tolerance for TAE
Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance values for
TAE were derived based on values captured in clause 9.8.5.
The TT values were agreed to be the same as the MU values.
Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the TAE test are defined in
table 9.8.6-1 and 9.8.6-2.

The MU is 3 to 4 time larger than the distance between the measurement points.
Which allows the estimation of the 3dB point to be 1.5 to 2 steps out on each
side of the modulated band width.
As the OTA system will not introduce any additional frequency error and it
will not introduce any additional differential amplitude error, the MU for the
OTA measurement should be the same as for the conducted requirement.
It should be noted that the signal power level at the bandwidth edge required
for meeting the OBW requirement is in general at least 20dB higher than the
level that is required to meet unwanted emissions requirements. Thus there is
very substantial room to accommodate measurement uncertainty for the OBW
requirement.

3) Set the BS to transmit the test signal according to the applicable test

5) Repeat steps 3 - 4 for other applicable test models.

#### 9.9.5.3 MU value derivation
The MU value is the same as the conducted value given in table 9.9.1-1.
### 9.9.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty
For E-UTRA, the OTA occupied BW MU is the same as the conducted MU and is as
follows:
\- 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz Channel BW: 30 kHz
\- 5 MHz, 10 MHz Channel BW: 100 kHz
\- 15 MHz, ≥20 MHz: Channel BW: 300 kHz
For NR in FR1, the MU for the OTA occupied bandwidth depends on the roll-off
of the transmitted signal and the instrument MU, not on the OTA chamber
related MU. In principle, the occupied bandwidth MU was agreed to be the same
as for E-UTRA. However NR covers larger BS channel bandwidths than E-UTRA, and
thus additional MU relating to larger channel bandwidths were estimated. The
MU was decided based on the density of power measurements within the channel
bandwidth and the expected test instrument performance.
For NR in FR1, the MU was agreed to be:
± 100 kHz for BS channel bandwidths up to 10 MHz,
± 300 kHz for 10 MHz \10 MHz from the carrier.
FR2: The TT value was agreed to be the same as the MU (i.e. 2.7 dB) for 0 -
10% of the BS channel bandwidth away from the carrier, and 0 dB for >10% of BS
channel bandwidth from the carrier.
Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA OBUE and OTA SEM
test in FR1 are defined in table 11.4.8-1.
Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA OBUE test in FR2
are defined in table 11.4.8-2.
Table 11.4.8-1: Test Tolerance values for the OTA OBUE and OTA SEM, Normal
test conditions, FR1
                        f ≦ 3 GHz   3 GHz \ -60 dBm (where there is a break point for conducted power
measurement accuracy), so this is reasonable.
For the OTA receiver emissions requirements however the lower power level of
the requirement reduces the dynamic range of the TRP measurement and reduces
measurement accuracy.
Considering that the loss in the chamber is based on the wanted signal being
in the far field the per point noise floor is assumed to be approx. -100 dBm
and the receiver emissions level translated to the test equipment is approx.
-90 dBm. Hence the TRP calculation has only a 10 dB dynamic range.
An uncertainty of 1 dB is added to the TRP uncertainty budget to account for
this additional uncertainty.
### 12.3.2 General Chamber
#### 12.3.2.1 Measurement system description
As the BS antenna radiating dimensions are fixed then the far field distance
increases (FF ≈ 2d^2^/λ). At 12.75 GHz the far field distance for a 1.5 m BS
_antenna array_ is almost 200 m, this is clearly impractical in an indoor
chamber (and the path loss would also make measurement difficult), so spurious
emission testing will not always be in the far field. This is acceptable as
the requirement is TRP and hence it is not necessary to measure in the far
field however it needs to be considered when looking at MU.
Considerations of the large frequency range must also be considered, including
the chamber performance (quiet zone), the calibration effectiveness and the
available reference and test antennas over the frequency range.
Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.3.
#### 12.3.2.2 Test procedure
##### 12.3.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration
Calibration procedure for the General Chamber is captured in clause 8.7A.

etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
In other cases a technical study should be done.
A1-15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the receiving antenna
The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered systematic
and constant 0.00 dB value.
A1-16 Frequency flatness of test system
This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation error
caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration stage.
A1-17 Quality of quiet zone (extreme test conditions)
This contribution is related to the ambient quality of the quiet zone for
normal test conditions (i.e. A1-3) which originates from a reflectivity level
of an anechoic chamber. The reflectivity level is determined from the average
standard deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone. As the
environmental enclosure is larger than the BS and the material of the
environmental chamber may cause some reflection and refraction the quite zone
flatness will be effected. The quality of the quiet zone for the extreme test
is therefore larger that for the ambient due to the environmental enclosures
effect.
NOTE: This MU contributor is defined for extreme test conditions. MU
contributor for the quality of QZ in normal test conditions is defined in
A1-3.
A1-18 Wet radome loss variation
The environmental chamber radome will be an ineffective thermal isolator and
will have extreme temperatures on the inside and the OTA chamber ambient
temperature on the outside. In such conditions condensation is inevitable.
This uncertainty is due to the variation in the radome loss due to
condensation on the environmental chamber radome.
A1-19 Radome loss variation
The environmental chamber radome will affect the path between the BS and the
test antenna due to both its insertion loss and also reflection and refraction
from the materials surface. The loss is dependent on the material as well as
its proximity to the BS. The uncertainty is the residual uncertainly of the
total loss after calibration.
A1-20 Change in absorber behaviour
The environmental chamber will contain RF absorptive material to prevent
reflections within the chamber. This RF absorptive material will be subjected
to the extreme temperatures inside the environmental chamber and hence its
properties will change. This uncertainty accounts for the effect of that
change in behavior.
A1-21 Uncertainty of the LNA (FR2 only)
To maintain a low noise figure for the measurement system (possibly
considering the addition of a down conversion mixer for high frequencies) and
LNA may be required. The variation in the gain of the LNA after the
calibration procedure is accounted for in this uncertainty contribution.
A1-22 Uncertainty of the Mixer (FR2 only)
Higher frequency emissions beyond the upper frequency range of the measurement
equipment require down converting prior to measurement. The uncertainty
introduced by the down conversion is accounted for in this uncertainty
contribution.
# A.2 Compact Antenna Test Range
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX measurements
in Compact Antenna Test Range.
NOTE 1: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for
polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b
for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving
antenna.
A2-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) (for
EIRP)
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna alignment and
BS/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement the BS/calibration
antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero contribution for
polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums to align, this
contribution can be a small contribution. The calibration antenna\'s phase
centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to the frequency.
Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that
the point error is at a minimal, this contribution should be captured using
the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS this would
most likely be in the azimuth domain).
NOTE 2: This MU contributor used different values for the EIRP measurement and
for TRP measurement. Therefore, those two were explicitly differentiated in
the MU derivation tables, i.e. A2-1 for EIRP, A2-18 for TRP.
A2-2 Standing wave between BS (a) / calibration antenna (b) and test range
antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
A2-3 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated & test range antenna connector cable
terminated)
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
A2-4 QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) (normal test
conditions)
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/calibration antenna
during the measurement or calibration phase. The purpose of this component is
to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and
floor that will add to the EIRP measurement. The sum of all these reflections
from the walls, range reflector (if applicable), roof and floor will give the
overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component
from the wall will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose of
this uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from the
chamber walls experienced by the BS/calibration antenna. To capture the full
effect of the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ should be measured from each of the
BS/calibration antenna physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance =
physical aperture length +2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured
in the uncertainty measurement.
NOTE 3: This MU contributor is defined for normal test conditions. MU
contributor for the quality of QZ in extreme test conditions is defined in
A2-13.
A2-5 Mismatch of receiver chain (i.e. between receiving antenna and
measurement receiver (a) / low power receiver (b))
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver equipment.
This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the S~11~ towards
the receive antenna and also towards the test receiver. The mismatch between
the antenna reflection and the receiver reflection can also be calculated. If
the same cable is used for calibration Stage 1, this can be considered
systematic and negligible.
A2-6 Insertion loss of receiver chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement
stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the
measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the
BS or calibration antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
A2-7 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable, i.e. flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector repeatability
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This
is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
A2-8 Misalignment positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
A2-9 Rotary joints
If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
A2-10 Miscellaneous uncertainty
The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP measurements. This
term should include truly random effects as well as systematic uncertainties,
such as that arising from dissimilarity between the patterns of the reference
antenna (SGH) and the BS.
A2-11 Switching uncertainty
The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically different
RF path to different measurement instruments of different measurement modes.
The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the errors arising from manual
switching work. Switching is also used to measure the path loss values of each
polarization component. Even though the electromechanical switching is
preferable during path loss and antenna performance measurements, some minor
uncertainties can occur when the switch states are programmed to change their
polarity.
A2-12 Frequency flatness of test system
This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation error
caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration stage.
A2-13 Quality of quiet zone (extreme test conditions)
This contribution is related to the ambient quality of the quiet zone for
normal test conditions (A2-4) which originates from a reflectivity level of an
anechoic chamber. The reflectivity level is determined from the average
standard deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone. As the
environmental enclosure is larger than the BS and the material of the
environmental chamber may cause some reflection and refraction the quite zone
flatness will be effected. The quality of the quiet zone for the extreme test
is therefore larger that for the ambient due to the environmental enclosures
effect.
A2-14 Wet radome loss variation
The environmental chamber radome will be an ineffective thermal isolator and
will have extreme temperatures on the inside and the OTA chamber ambient
temperature on the outside. In such conditions condensation is inevitable.
This uncertainty is due to the variation in the radome loss due to
condensation on the environmental chamber radome.
A2-15 Radome loss variation
The environmental chamber radome will affect the path between the BS and the
test antenna due to both its insertion loss and also reflection and refraction
from the materials surface. The loss is dependent on the material as well as
its proximity to the BS. The uncertainty is the residual uncertainly of the
total loss after calibration.
A2-16 Change in absorber behaviour
The environmental chamber will contain RF absorptive material to prevent
reflections within the chamber. This RF absorptive material will be subjected
to the extreme temperatures inside the environmental chamber and hence its
properties will change. This uncertainty accounts for the effect of that
change in behavior.
A2-17 Measurement system dynamic range uncertainty
Uncertainty associated with the addition of each of the directional power
measurements to calculate the TRP due to the limited dynamic range of the OTA
test system causing an overestimation.
A2-18 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) (for
TRP)
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna alignment and
BS/calibration antenna pointing error and its effect on the TRP calculation.
The pointing error for TRP emissions measurement is larger than for EIRP
(A2-1).
NOTE 4: This MU contributor used different values for the EIRP measurement and
for TRP measurement. Therefore, those two were explicitly differentiated in
the MU derivation tables, i.e. A2-1 for EIRP, A2-18 for TRP.
A2-19 Uncertainty of the LNA (FR2 only)
To maintain a low noise figure for the measurement system (possibly
considering the addition of a down conversion mixer for high frequencies) and
LNA may be required. The variation in the gain of the LNA after the
calibration procedure is accounted for in this uncertainty contribution
A2-20 Uncertainty of the mixer (FR2 only)
Higher frequency emissions beyond the upper frequency range of the measurement
equipment require down converting prior to measurement. The uncertainty
introduced by the down conversion is accounted for in this uncertainty
contribution.
# A.3 Near Field Test Range
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX measurements
in Near Field Test Range.
A3-1 Axes intersection
This is a mechanical uncertainty term and aim to find the uncertainty related
with the lateral displacement between the horizontal and vertical axes of the
BS positioner. This can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-2 Axes orthogonality
The difference from 90° of the angle between the horizontal and vertical axes
also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-3 Horizontal pointing
The horizontal mispointing of the horizontal axis to the probe reference point
for Theta = 0° also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-4 Probe vertical position
The vertical displacement of the probe reference point from the horizontal
axis results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-5 Probe horizontal/vertical pointing
The horizontal or vertical mispointing of the probe z-axis from the
intersection point of the horizontal/vertical axis. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-6 Measurement distance
This is the knowledge of the distance between the intersection point of the
horizontal and vertical axis and probe reference point. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-7 Amplitude and phase drift
The system drift due to temperature variations the signal at BS location to
drift in amplitude and phase. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.
A3-8 Amplitude and phase noise
This uncertainty is due to the noise level of the test range so that the S/N
ratio should be determined or measured at the BS location. The noise level is
usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a Gaussian distribution.
A3-9 Leakage and crosstalk
This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system setup.
The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random amplitude and
phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-10 Amplitude non-linearity
This uncertainty is the linearity of the receiver used for the measurement. It
can be taken from the data sheet of the receiver.
A3-11 Amplitude and phase shift in rotary joint
This uncertainty is due to the variation of the rotary joint. It can be
measured and is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-12 Channel balance amplitude and phase
This uncertainty is relevant for systems which are using dual polarized probes
and polarization switches. The amplitude and phase difference between two
signal channels of the receiver includes the difference between the probe
ports, difference between the channels of the polarization switch, connecting
cables and reflection coefficients. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
A3-13 Probe polarization amplitude and phase
The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-14 Probe pattern knowledge
The probe(s) pattern(s) is assumed to be known so that the BS measurement in
near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. There is no direct dependence between the BS pattern and the probe
pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
A3-15 Multiple reflections
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the BS when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
A3-16 Room scattering
As for the multiple reflections, a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected by either the absorbers or other structures in the measurement
anechoic chamber before being received by the receiving antenna. This effect
can be isolated from the multiple reflections by testing the BS in different
positions, separated by λ/4 with respect to the anechoic chamber and comparing
these measurements with the reference. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
A3-17 BS support scattering
This is the uncertainty due to the BS supporting structure on the signal
level. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-18 Scan area truncation
This uncertainty does affect this near field measurement. It can be addressed
by comparing the measurement result when scanning the full area. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-19 Sampling point offset
This uncertainty has an influence in near field and far field. It is assumed
to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-20 Spherical mode truncation
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the BS. Care should be taken in
order to make sure the removed signals are not from the BS itself. This
uncertainty is usually negligible.
A3-21 Positioning
The relative position of the probe array is not ideal. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a rectangular distribution.
A3-22 Probe array uniformity
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different _radiation pattern_ s.
Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the uniformity of the probes
is achieved.
A3-23 Mismatch of receiver chain
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in TR
25.914 [24]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.
A3-24 Insertion loss of receiver chain
It is composed of the following:
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used).
\- Insertion loss of RF relays (if used).
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-25 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the probe antenna
This uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
A3-26 Measurement repeatability - positioning repeatability
This uncertainty is due to the repositioning of the BS in the test setup. It
can be addressed by repeating the corresponding measurement 5 times. Calculate
the standard deviation of the metric obtained and use that as the measurement
uncertainty. For tests that require multiple setups, the worst-case standard
deviation is used. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.
A3-27 Mismatch of receiver chain
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, each uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined and then taking the total of all
non-zero mismatch uncertainty contribution from all parts by root-sum-squares
(RSS) method. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-28 Insertion loss of receiver chain
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-29 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna
This is the uncertainty from the mismatch in the connection between the system
coax cable and the calibration antenna. This uncertainty is from the mismatch
between the cable and the reference antenna that is used for calibration. It
is determined by the S~11~ of the reference antenna and the S~11~ of the cable
to which the antenna is connected i.e. if using an SGH antenna for calibration
and 10 dB pad is inserted on the cable connecting to the antenna this
uncertainty contribution can be considered negligible. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.
A3-30 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable
This uncertainty is due to the impact of the feeding cable on the radiation
properties of the calibration antenna. In case of using either a standard horn
or standard gain horn, the impact of the cable is to be considered negligible
thus the uncertainty 0.00 dB value. In case of using a dipole-like antenna,
the uncertainty should be addressed by measuring this impact. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-31 Influence of the probe antenna cable
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-32 Short term repeatability
It can be addressed by performing a repeatability test of the calibration
antenna. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
A3-33 Frequency flatness of test system
This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation error
caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration stage.
# A.4 One Dimensional Compact Range
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX measurements
in One Dimensional Compact Range.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
A4-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS alignment and BS pointing error.
In this measurement the BS is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero
contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums
to align, this contribution can be a small contribution. The reference
antenna´s phase centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to
the frequency. Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this.
To ensure that the pointing error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the
BS this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).
A4-2 Standing wave between BS (a) / reference antenna (b) and test range
antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
A4-3 Quiet zone ripple experienced by BS (a) / reference antenna (b)
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/reference antenna
during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture the
contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that will
add to the EIRP measurement. The sum of all these reflections from the walls,
range reflector (if applicable), roof and floor will give the overall value
for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component from the wall
will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose of this
uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from the chamber
walls experienced by the BS/reference antenna. To capture the full effect of
the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ must be measured from each of the BS/reference
antenna physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture
length + 2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the
uncertainty measurement.
A4-4 Phase curvature across the BS antenna (a) / reference antenna (b)
This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of BS (a) / reference antenna
(b).
A4-5 Polarization mismatch between BS (a) / reference antenna (b) and
receiving antenna
This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the
BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
A4-6 Mutual coupling between BS (a) / reference antenna (b) and receiving
antenna
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the BS/reference
antenna and the receiving antenna. Mutual coupling degrades not just the
antenna efficiency, i.e. the EIRP value, but it can alter the antenna\'s
_radiation pattern_ as well. For compact range chamber, usually the spacing
between the BS/reference antenna and the receiving antennas is large enough so
that the level of mutual coupling might be negligible.
A4-7 Impedance mismatch in receiving chain
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the measurement equipment. The multiple reflections can produce an
overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual reflections of
each part but their reflective interactions as well. The combination loss by
the overall reflection can be higher or lower than individual loss by multiple
reflections. The combination loss is called the mismatch error and leads to
the measurement uncertainty.
A4-8 RF leakage (BS (a) / SGH (b) connector terminated and test range antenna
connector cable terminated)
This contribution denotes noise leaking into connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
A4-9 Misalignment positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
A4-10 Pointing error between reference antenna and test range antenna
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the receiving antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
A4-11 Impedance mismatch in path to reference antenna
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate calibration, the
measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the
error still happens between the reference antenna feed cable and the reference
antenna.
A4-12 Impedance mismatch in path to compact probe
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate calibration, the
measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the
error still happens between the receiving antenna feed cable and the receiving
antenna.
A4-13 Influence of reference antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators, connector repeatability)
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the reference antenna
and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This is
assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary joints.
The largest difference between the results is recorded as the uncertainty.
A4-14 Mismatch of receiver chain (i.e. between receiving antenna and
measurement equipment)
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver equipment.
This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the S~11~ towards
the receive antenna and also towards the test receiver. The mismatch between
the antenna reflection and the receiver reflection can also be calculated. If
the same cable is used for calibration stage, this can be considered
systematic and negligible.
A4-15 Insertion loss of receiver chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration and the measurement stage, the uncertainty
is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement stage.
Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the
measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the
BS or reference antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
# A.5 General Chamber
This clause describes the measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in General Chamber.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
A5-1 Positioning misalignment between the BS and the reference antenna
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point of the BS and the phase centre of
the reference antenna. The uncertainty makes the space propagation loss
between the BS and the receiving antenna at the BS measurement stage (i.e.
Stage 2) different from the space propagation loss between the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna at the calibration stage (i.e. Stage 1).
A5-2 Pointing misalignment between the BS and the receiving antenna
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the receiving antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
A5-3 Quality of quiet zone
This contribution originates from a reflectivity level of an anechoic chamber.
The reflectivity level is determined from the average standard deviation of
the electric field in the quiet zone. By repeating a free space VSWR
measurement in 15° grid in elevation and azimuth, 264 standard deviation
values in both polarizations are determined. From these values an average
standard deviation of electric field in the quiet zone can be calculated from
the equation:
Where:
is the number of angular intervals in elevation,
is the number of angular intervals in azimuth, and
is elevation of single measurement .
If an efficiency calibration with omni-directional calibration antenna is
performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 1 (i.e.
calibration measurement) and may be divided by factor 2. This is due to
correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration. Efficiency
calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be considered to have at least
four independent samples. may be divided by factor 2 also in Stage 2 (i.e. BS
measurement) for the same reason.
It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small impact
on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper bound to probe
symmetry should be considered.
A5-4 Polarization mismatch between the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the
receiving antenna
This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the
BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
A5-5 Mutual coupling between the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the
receiving antenna
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the BS/reference
antenna and the receiving antenna. Mutual coupling degrades not just the
antenna efficiency, i.e. the EIRP value, but it can alter the antenna\'s
_radiation pattern_ as well. For indoor anechoic chamber, usually the spacing
between the BS/reference antenna and the receiving antennas is large enough so
that the level of mutual coupling might be negligible.
A5-6 Phase curvature across the BS antenna (a) /reference antenna (b)
This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of BS (a) /reference antenna
(b).
A5-7 Impedance mismatch in the receiving chain
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the power measurement equipment. The multiple reflections can
produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual
reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as well. The
combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or lower than
individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss is called the
mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.
A5-8 Random uncertainty
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
BS without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
A5-9 Impedance mismatch between the receiving antenna and the network analyzer
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate calibration, the network
analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the error still
happens between the receiving antenna feed cable and the receiving antenna.
A5-10 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and
the receiving antenna
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each other, this contribution
can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
A5-11 Impedance mismatch between the reference antenna and the network
analyzer
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate calibration, the network
analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the error still
happens between the reference antenna feed cable and the reference antenna.
A5-12 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable
In the calibration Stage 1, the influence of the calibration antenna feed
cable is assessed by measurements. A measurement for calibration may be
repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable. Largest
difference among the results is entered to the uncertainty budget with a
rectangular distribution.
A5-13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss have
to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer to measure
its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.
A5-14 Influence of the receiving antenna feed cable
If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain >+5 dBi, e.g. horn, LPDA,
etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
In other cases a technical study should be done.
A5-15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the receiving antenna
The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered systematic
and constant 0.00 dB value.
A5-16 Frequency flatness of test system
This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation error
caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration stage.
A5-17 Measurement antenna frequency variation
For wide band measurement the measurement antenna gain will vary considerably
over frequency. The gain can be calibrated however variation may still remain
between calibration frequency steps. This uncertainty accounts for the
variation between the calibrated steps.
A5-18 FSPL estimation error
For wide band measurement the measurement free space path loss in the chamber
will vary with frequency. The loss can be calibrated however this uncertainty
accounts for the variation between the calibrated steps.
A5-19 Measurement system dynamic range uncertainty
Uncertainty associated with the addition of each of the directional power
measurements to calculate the TRP due to the limited dynamic range of the OTA
test system causing an overestimation.
A5-20 Reflections in anechoic chamber
Uncertainty associated with the reflections in the chamber changing the
coupling between the BS and the CLTA.
# A.6 Reverberation Chamber
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX measurements
in Reverberation Chamber.
A6-1 Impedance mismatch in the receiving chain
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the power measurement equipment. The multiple reflections can
produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual
reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as well. The
combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or lower than
individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss is called the
mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.
A6-2 Random uncertainty
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
BS without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
A6-3 Reference antenna radiation efficiency
This contribution is a residue of uncertainty of reference antenna radiation
efficiency after calibration.
A6-4 Mean value estimation of reference antenna mismatch efficiency
This contribution originates from the error of the estimated mean related to
the use of a finite number $\text{N\ }$of samples in the measurement of the
reference antenna mismatch efficiency. The mean value estimation is calculated
as $\sigma\text{/}\sqrt{N}$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the
series of measured values.
A6-5 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable
Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss has
to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer to measure
its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.
A6-6 Mean value estimation of transfer function
This contribution originates from the error of the estimated mean related to
the use of a finite number $N$ of samples in the measurement of the transfer
function. The mean value estimation is calculated as $\sigma\text{/}\sqrt{N}$
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the series of measured values.
A6-7 Uniformity of transfer function
Standard deviation over BS positions and rotations of the transfer function
$\left\langle \left| S_{21} \right|^{2} \right\rangle$. This uncertainty
expresses the variations of measured TRP values with respect to translations
and rotations of the BS. Ideally, the TRP does neither depend on translations
nor rotations of the BS.
# A.7 Plane Wave Synthesizer
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX measurements
in Plane Wave Synthesizer.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
A7-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna alignment and
BS/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement the BS/calibration
antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero contribution for
polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums to align, this
contribution can be a small contribution. The calibration antenna\'s phase
centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to the frequency.
Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that
the point error is at a minimal, this contribution should be captured using
the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS this would
most likely be in the azimuth domain).
A7-2 Longitudinal position uncertainty (i.e. standing wave and imperfect field
synthesis) for BS antenna (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This value covers the effect of standing wave between BS or calibration
antenna and the test range antenna, but also counts for the PWS imperfect
field synthesis over distance. This value can be captured by moving the BS or
calibration antenna towards the test range antenna.
A7-3 RF leakage (calibration antenna connector terminated)
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between reference antenna and
transmitting equipment.
A7-4 QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/reference antenna
during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture the
contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that will
add to measurements. The sum of all these reflections from the walls, roof and
floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the
uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated from the roof or the
floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall
reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the BS/reference antenna.
A7-5 Miscellaneous uncertainty
The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP measurements. This
term should include truly random effects as well as systematic uncertainties,
such as that arising from dissimilarity between the patterns of the reference
antenna and the BS.
A7-6 Mismatch (i.e. reference antenna, network analyser and reference cable)
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver equipment.
This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the S~11~ towards
the receive antenna and also towards the test receiver. The mismatch between
the antenna reflection and the receiver reflection can also be calculated. If
the same cable is used for calibration Stage 1, this can be considered
systematic and negligible.
A7-7 Insertion loss of receiver chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement
stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the
measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the
BS or calibration antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
A7-8 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector repeatability)
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This
is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
A7-9 Misalignment of positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
A7-10 Rotary joints
If applicable, this uncertainty term corresponds to the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
A7-11 Switching uncertainty
The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically different
RF path to different measurement instruments of different measurement modes.
The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the errors arising from manual
switching work. Switching is also used to measure the path loss values of each
polarization component. Even though the electromechanical switching is
preferable during path loss and antenna performance measurements, some minor
uncertainties can occur when the switch states are programmed to change their
polarity.
A7-12 Field repeatability
Each execution of field calibration of the measurement _antenna array_ to find
the PWS settings provides a slightly different set of settings for the RF
components for each antenna path. This results in variation of the synthesized
plane wave in the QZ and variation of PWS antenna to reference antenna
coupling. This variation is described by field repeatability term.
A7-13 Frequency flatness of test system
This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation error
caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration stage.
A7-14 System non-linearity
This uncertainty term is calculated as RSS of the following items, assuming a
rectangular distribution:
\- System non-linearity in time. This is assessed by repeated measurements
over a period of time (e.g. 60 minutes) for the same reference power
transmitted by the reference antenna. The largest difference between the
results is recorded as the uncertainty.
\- System non-linearity in power. This is assessed by repeated measurements
over a range of transmitted powers. The largest delta between the increments
on the receiving side versus the transmitting side is recorded as the
uncertainty.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Radiated RX measurement error contribution
descriptions
# B.1 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX measurements
in Indoor Anechoic Chamber.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
B1-1 Positioning misalignment between the BS and the reference antenna
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point of the BS and the phase centre of
the reference antenna. The uncertainty makes the space propagation loss
between the BS and the transmitting antenna at the BS measurement stage (i.e.
Stage 2) different from the space propagation loss between the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna at the calibration stage (i.e. Stage 1).
B1-2 Pointing misalignment between the BS and the transmitting antenna
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the transmitting antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
B1-3 Quality of quiet zone
This contribution originates from a reflectivity level of an anechoic chamber.
The reflectivity level is determined from the average standard deviation of
the electric field in the quiet zone. By repeating a free space VSWR
measurement in 15 ° grid in elevation and azimuth, 264 standard deviation
values in both polarizations are determined. From these values an average
standard deviation of electric field in the quiet zone can be calculated from
the equation:
where:
is the number of angular intervals in elevation,
is the number of angular intervals in azimuth, and
is elevation of single measurement .
If an efficiency calibration with omni-directional calibration antenna is
performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 1 (i.e.
calibration measurement) and may be divided by factor 2. This is due to
correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration. Efficiency
calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be considered to have at least
four independent samples. may be divided by factor 2 also in stage 2 (i.e. BS
measurement) for the same reason.
It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small impact
on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper bound to probe
symmetry should be considered.

This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the BS
(a) /reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna.
B1-5 Mutual coupling between the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the
transmitting antenna
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the BS (a)
/reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna. Mutual coupling degrades
not just the antenna efficiency, but it can alter the antenna\'s _radiation
pattern_ as well. For indoor anechoic chamber, usually the spacing between the
transmitting antenna and the BS/reference antenna is large enough so that the
level of mutual coupling might be negligible.
B1-6 Phase curvature
This contribution originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of the BS/reference antenna.
B1-7 Impedance mismatch in the transmitting chain
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the signal generator. The multiple reflections can
produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual
reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as well. The
combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or lower than
individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss is called the
mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.
B1-8 Random uncertainty
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
BS without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
B1-9 Impedance mismatch between the transmitting antenna and the network
analyzer
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate calibration,
the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the error
still happens between the transmitting antenna feed cable and the transmitting
antenna.
B1-10 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and
the transmitting antenna
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
B1-11 Impedance mismatch between the reference antenna and the network
analyzer
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate calibration, the network
analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the error still
happens between the transmitting antenna feed cable and the transmitting
antenna.
B1-12 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable
In the calibration Stage 1, the influence of the calibration antenna feed
cable is assessed by measurements. A measurement for calibration may be
repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable. Largest
difference among the results is entered to the uncertainty budget with a
rectangular distribution.
B1-13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss have
to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer to measure
its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.
B1-14 Influence of the transmitting antenna feed cable

etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
B1-15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the transmitting antenna
The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered systematic
and constant 0.00 dB value.
# B.2 Compact Antenna Test Range
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX measurements
in Compact Antenna Test Range.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
B2-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
alignment and BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) pointing error. In this
measurement the BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) is aligned to maximum, also
allowing for a zero contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By
adjusting for maximums to align, this contribution can be a small
contribution. The calibration antenna\'s phase centre and polarization purity
changes slightly according to the frequency. Therefore, there should be some
uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that the point error is at a minimal,
this contribution should be captured using the antenna pattern cut which is
broadest (in the case of the BS this would most likely be in the azimuth
domain).
B2-2 Standing wave between BS and test range antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
B2-3 RF leakage & dynamic range, test range antenna cable connector terminated
This contribute denotes noise leaking in to connectors and cables between test
range antenna and receiving equipment.
B2-4 QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This is the quiet zone ripple experienced by the BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b) during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture
the contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that
will add to the EIS measurement. The sum of all these reflections from the
walls, roof and floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other
words, the uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated from the
roof or the floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture the
overall reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the BS (a)
/calibration antenna (b). To capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a
distance of 1λ should be measured from each of the BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b) physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture length
+ 2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the uncertainty
measurement.
B2-5 Mismatch of transmit chain (i.e. between transmitting measurement antenna
and BS)
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the transmitting antenna and the signal generation
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the
S~11~ towards the transmit antenna and also towards the test signal generator
equipment. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the transmit
reflection can also be calculated.
B2-6 Insertion loss of transmit chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the BS measurement Stage 2,
the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic. Alternatively, the insertion loss
can also be calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is
the end of the cable connected to the measurement antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
B2-7 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated & test range antenna connector
terminated)
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
B2-8 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators & connector repeatability)
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This
is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
B2-9 Miscellaneous uncertainty
The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP measurements. This
term should include truly random effects as well as systematic uncertainties,
such as that arising from dissimilarity between the patterns of the reference
antenna (SGH) and the BS.
B2-10 Rotary joints
If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty is the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
B2-11 Misalignment positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to the maximum
then this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
B2-12 Standing wave between SGH and test range antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
B2-13 Switching uncertainty
The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically different
RF path to different measurement instruments of different measurement modes.
The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the errors arising from manual
switching work. Switching is also used to measure the path loss values of each
polarization component. Even though the electromechanical switching is
preferable during path loss and antenna performance measurements, some minor
uncertainties can occur when the switch states are programmed to change their
polarity.
# B.3 Near Field Test Range
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX measurements
in Near Field Test Range.
B3-1 Axes intersection
This is a mechanical uncertainty term and aim to find the uncertainty related
with the lateral displacement between the horizontal and vertical axes of the
BS positioner. This can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-2 Axes orthogonality
The difference from 90 ° of the angle between the horizontal and vertical axes
also results in sampling the field on a non ideal sphere. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-3 Horizontal pointing
The horizontal mispointing of the horizontal axis to the probe reference point
for Theta = 0 ° also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

axis results in sampling the field on a non ideal sphere. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-5 Probe horizontal/vertical pointing
The horizontal or vertical mispointing of the probe z-axis from the
intersection point of the horizontal/vertical axis. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-6 Measurement distance
This is the knowledge of the distance between the intersection point of the
horizontal and vertical axis and probe reference point. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-7 Amplitude and phase drift
The system drift due to temperature variations causes the signal at BS
location to drift in amplitude and phase. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a Gaussian distribution.
B3-8 Amplitude and phase noise
This uncertainty is due to the noise level of the test range so that the S/N
ratio should be determined or measured at the BS location. The noise level is
usually measured with a spectrum analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a Gaussian distribution.
B3-9 Leakage and crosstalk
This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system setup.
The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random amplitude and
phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-10 Amplitude non-linearity
This uncertainty is the linearity of the receiver used for the measurement. It
can be taken from the data sheet of the receiver.
B3-11 Amplitude and phase shift in rotary joint
This uncertainty is due to the variation of the rotary joint. It can be
measured and is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-12 Channel balance amplitude and phase
This uncertainty is relevant for systems which are using dual polarized probes
and polarization switches. The amplitude and phase difference between two
signal channels of the receiver includes the difference between the probe
ports, difference between the channels of the polarization switch, connecting
cables and reflection coefficients. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
B3-13 Probe polarization amplitude and phase
The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-14 Probe pattern knowledge
The probe(s) pattern(s) is assumed to be known so that the BS measurement in
near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. There is no direct dependence between the BS pattern and the probe
pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
B3-15 Multiple reflections
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the BS when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
B3-16 Room scattering
As for the multiple reflections, a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected by either the absorbers or other structures in the measurement
anechoic chamber before being received by the receiving antenna. This effect
can be isolated from the multiple reflections by testing the BS in different
positions, separated by λ/4 with respect to the anechoic chamber and comparing
these measurements with the reference. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
B3-17 BS support scattering
This is the uncertainty due to the BS supporting structure on the signal
level. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-18 Scan area truncation
This uncertainty does affect the near field measurement. It can be addressed
by comparing the measurement result when scanning the full area. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-19 Sampling point offset
This uncertainty has an influence in near field and far field. It is assumed
to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-20 Mode truncation
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the BS. Care should be taken in
order to make sure the removed signals are not from the BS itself. This
uncertainty is usually negligible.
B3-21 Positioning
The relative position of the probe array is not ideal. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a rectangular distribution.
B3-22 Probe array uniformity
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different _radiation pattern_ s.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-23 Mismatch of transmitter chain
If the same chain configuration (including the vector signal generator; the
probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in TR
25.914 [24]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.
B3-24 Insertion loss of transmitter chain
It is composed of the following:
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used).
\- Insertion loss of RF relays (if used).
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-25 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the probe antenna
This uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
B3-26 Measurement repeatability - positioning repeatability
This uncertainty is due to the repositioning of the BS in the test setup. It
can be addressed by repeating the corresponding measurement 10 times.
Calculate the standard deviation of the metric obtained and use that as the
measurement uncertainty. For tests that require multiple setups, the worst-
case standard deviation is used. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
B3-27 Mismatch of transmitter chain
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in TR
25.914 [24]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-28 Insertion loss of transmitter chain
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-29 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna
This is the uncertainty from the mismatch in the connection between the system
coax cable and the calibration antenna. It should be measured or determined by
the method described in TR 25.914 [24]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
U-shaped distribution.
B3-30 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable
This uncertainty is due to the impact of the feeding cable on the radiation
properties of the calibration antenna. In case of using either a standard horn
or standard gain horn, the impact of the cable is to be considered negligible
thus the uncertainty 0.00 dB value. In case of using a dipole-like antenna,
the uncertainty should be addressed by measuring this impact. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-31 Influence of the probe antenna cable
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
B3-32 Short term repeatability
It can be addressed by performing a repeatability test of the calibration
antenna. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
# B.4 One Dimensional Compact Range
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX measurements
in One Dimensional Compact Range.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
B4-1 Misalignment BS and pointing error
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS alignment and BS pointing error.
In this measurement the BS is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero
contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums
to align, this contribution can be a small contribution. The reference
antenna´s phase centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to
the frequency. Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this.
To ensure that the pointing error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the
BS this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).
B4-2 Standing wave between BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and test range
antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between BS/reference antenna and test range
antenna. This value can be captured by moving the BS (a) /reference antenna
(b) towards the test range antenna as the standing waves go in and out of
phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
B4-3 Quiet zone ripple experienced by BS (a) /reference antenna (b)
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS (a) / reference
antenna (b) during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to
capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor
that will add to the EIS measurement. The sum of all these reflections from
the walls, roof and floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In
other words, the uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated
from the roof or the floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to
capture the overall reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the BS
(a) / reference antenna (b). To capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a
distance of 1λ must be measured from each of the BS (a) / reference antenna
(b) physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture length
+ 2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the uncertainty
measurement.
B4-4 Phase curvature
This contribution originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of the BS/reference antenna.
B4-5 Polarization mismatch between BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and
transmitting antenna
This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the BS
(a) /reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna.
B4-6 Mutual coupling between BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and transmitting
antenna
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the BS (a)
/reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna. Mutual coupling degrades
not just the antenna efficiency, but it can alter the antenna\'s _radiation
pattern_ as well. For compact range chamber, usually the spacing between the
transmitting antenna and the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) is large enough so
that the level of mutual coupling might be negligible.
B4-7 Impedance mismatch in transmitting chain
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the signal generator. The multiple reflections can
produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual
reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as well. The
combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or lower than
individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss is called the
mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.
B4-8 RF leakage and dynamic range
This contribute denotes noise leaking into connectors and cables between test
range antenna and receiving equipment.
B4-9 Misalignment positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the reference antenna is aligned to the maximum then
this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
B4-10 Pointing error between reference antenna and test range antenna
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the transmitting antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
B4-11 Impedance mismatch in path to reference antenna
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate calibration, the
measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the
error still happens between the reference antenna feed cable and the reference
antenna.
B4-12 Impedance mismatch in path to compact probe
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate
calibration, the measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the transmitting antenna feed cable
and the transmitting antenna.
B4-13 Influence of reference antenna feed cable (flexing cables, adapters,
attenuators and connector repeatability)
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the reference antenna
and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This is
assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary joints.
The largest difference between the results is recorded as the uncertainty.
B4-14 Mismatch of transmitter chain (i.e. between transmitting measurement
antenna and BS)
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the transmitting antenna and the signal generation
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the
S~11~ towards the transmit antenna and also towards the test signal generator
equipment. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the transmit
reflection can also be calculated.
B4-15 Insertion loss of transmitter chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration and the BS measurement stage, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic. Alternatively, the insertion loss can
be calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end
of the cable connected to the measurement antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
B4-16 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated and test range antenna connector
terminated)
This contribution denotes noise leaking into connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
# B.5 Plane Wave Synthesizer
This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX measurements
in Plane Wave Synthesizer.
NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining both
BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for calibration
stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a for polarization
mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for
polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
B5-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna alignment and
BS/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement the BS/calibration
antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero contribution for
polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums to align, this
contribution can be a small contribution. The calibration antenna\'s phase
centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to the frequency.
Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that
the point error is at a minimal, this contribution should be captured using
the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS this would
most likely be in the azimuth domain).
B5-2 Longitudinal position uncertainty (i.e. standing wave and imperfect field
synthesis) for BS antenna (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This value covers the effect of standing wave between BS or calibration
antenna and the test range antenna, but also counts for the PWS imperfect
field synthesis over distance. This value can be captured by moving the BS or
calibration antenna towards the test range antenna.
B5-3 RF leakage (calibration antenna connector terminated)
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between reference antenna and
transmitting equipment.
B5-4 QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/reference antenna
during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture the
contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that will
add to measurements. The sum of all these reflections from the walls, roof and
floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the
uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated from the roof or the
floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall
reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the BS/reference antenna.
B5-5 Miscellaneous uncertainty
The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP measurements. This
term should include truly random effects as well as systematic uncertainties,
such as that arising from dissimilarity between the patterns of the reference
antenna and the BS.
B5-6 Mismatch (i.e. reference antenna, network analyser and reference cable)
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver equipment.
This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the S~11~ towards
the receive antenna and also towards the test receiver. The mismatch between
the antenna reflection and the receiver reflection can also be calculated. If
the same cable is used for calibration Stage 1, this can be considered
systematic and negligible.
B5-7 Insertion loss of transmit chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement
stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the
measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the
BS or calibration antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
B5-8 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable , i.e. flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector repeatability
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This
is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
B5-9 Misalignment of positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
B5-10 Rotary joints
If applicable, this uncertainty term corresponds to the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
B5-11 Switching uncertainty
The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically different
RF path to different measurement instruments of different measurement modes.
The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the errors arising from manual
switching work. Switching is also used to measure the path loss values of each
polarization component. Even though the electromechanical switching is
preferable during path loss and antenna performance measurements, some minor
uncertainties can occur when the switch states are programmed to change their
polarity.
B5-12 Field repeatability
Each execution of field calibration of the measurement _antenna array_ to find
the PWS settings provides a slightly different set of settings for the RF
components for each antenna path. This results in variation of the synthesized
plane wave in the QZ and variation of PWS antenna to reference antenna
coupling. This variation is described by field repeatability term.
B5-13 Frequency flatness of test system
This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation error
caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration stage.
B5-14 System non-linearity
This uncertainty term is calculated as RSS of the following items, assuming a
rectangular distribution:
\- System non-linearity in time. This is assessed by repeated measurements
over a period of time (e.g. 60 minutes) for the same reference power
transmitted by the reference antenna. The largest difference between the
results is recorded as the uncertainty.
\- System non-linearity in power. This is assessed by repeated measurements
over a range of transmitted powers. The largest delta between the increments
on the receiving side versus the transmitting side is recorded as the
uncertainty.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test equipment uncertainty values

analyzer, power meter)
The receiving device used to measure the received signal level in the EIRP
tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. These receiving
devices to name a few are spectrum analyzers, network analyzers or power
meter. These devices will have an uncertainty contribution of their own; this
value declared by the test gear vendor should be recorded as this uncertainty
contribution. If a power meter is used then both measurement uncertainty and
out of band noise is considered as part of the contribution. This uncertainty
value can be found in table C2-1 and was a result of compromised value in
order to align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.

harmonic in figure D.2-2 the reference step is 5.8 °. The full sphere average
of the EIRP is the TRP. For simplicity, only sweeping in the horizontal plane
is employed. In the case where a fixed beam is used the average EIRP is not
correct when the sampling angular step is larger than the reference angular
step $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$. However, when the EIRP pattern is first
averaged over all beams (blue curves) the average EIRP is virtually constant
for any angular step up to 36 °, see figure D.2-3.

# D.3 Measurement results
The effect of beam sweeping measured on an BS employing a 4x16 array, is
depicted in figures D.3-2 and D.3-3. Measurements were performed in a CATR, in
far-field conditions, with an BS that transmits one single beam that can be
moved across a number of pre-defined directions. For the results using beam
sweeping, see right figure in figure D.3-2, the following beam settings were
used:
\- 48 pre-defined beam directions (see fig. D.3-1) were swept, changing the
beam direction every 15 us
\- the range of beam directions is ± 60 and ± 15 ° in azimuth and elevation,
respectively.
\- The BS is making a full rotation (i.e. 360 °) mechanically into the
horizontal plane, with a step of 1 °. Each position was held for about 1 s,
while the spectrum analyser recorded a time averaged value of the received
power (at least 1000 samples for each angular position were considered enough
for good statistical average).

Compared to the broadside beam (the middle one) the maximum supported steering
is ± 60 ° in azimuth and ± 15 ° in elevation. The extreme directions are

# D.4 Design of beam sweeping test signal
The following design criteria have been identified:
1\. Full transmit power is used for all beams.
2\. Horizontal beam separation shall be the HPBW in the azimuth direction and
the vertical beam separation shall be the HPBW in the vertical direction,
evaluated for a broadside beam.
3\. Lobes with high loss compared to the broadside beam are avoided. By loss
we mean the reduction in beamforming gain between different positions of the
beam).
The motivation for the third criterion is to have a fairly constant TRP for
the used beams. The loss can be due to both loss in element pattern gain, but
also due to adverse mutual coupling effects. Removing lobes with high loss
gives a beam average TRP that is close to the TRP for any individual beam.
###### ## Annex E (informative): Sparse sampling for spurious emissions
In the case of spurious emissions for large BSs, such as the BS, the emissions
do not necessarily radiate through the antenna elements. For this reason, to
be on the conservative side, the entire BS dimensions should be considered
when calculating the reference angular steps on the spherical grid.
The emission lobes will be narrow and hard to locate for some emissions,
especially in the higher part of the spurious emissions domain. Instead of
searching for the direction of the emission lobes, it is proposed to perform
the measurement on a grid without alignment considerations and add a
correction factor to the TRP obtained from the grid, to ensure overestimation.
This correction factor is obtained through the study of random rotations of
the BS.
In practice, the emissions are likely to have a low degree of correlation,
except for harmonic emissions. For harmonic emissions a beam sweeping test
signal is proposed in annex D and the description of such signal is not
covered by the present release of this technical report.
For non-harmonic emissions, a correlation factor distributed uniformly in a
given interval from 0 to {width="0.2791666666666667in"
height="8.819444444444445e-2in"} is assumed when calculating the correction
factor ΔTRP for the TRP~estimate~. The angular variation of the emissions
coming from low correlated sources is dominated by the _array factor_ , i.e.,
the spatial distribution of the sources. Hence, emissions can be modelled by
the _array factor_ of a set of point sources, i.e., for simplicity the element
pattern is isotropic. To quantify the degree of sparse sampling relative to
the reference angular steps a Sparsity Factor (SF) is introduced. For a
spherical equal angles grid
{width="1.5881944444444445in" height="0.33055555555555555in"}
Where
{width="1.0444444444444445in" height="0.41944444444444445in"}
The TRP~estimate~ values are then calculated by using a given angular grid
defined by $\Delta\phi$and $\Delta\theta$ which are larger than the reference
angular steps $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. The
CDF of these TRP values are then created and the CDF is shifted so that the
5th percentile corresponds to 0 dB TRP error. This shift is introduced as
ΔTRP, see figure E-1.
In the followings we propose a method to estimate ΔTRP for large antennas (D >
4λ), based on generating a set of statistical samples of TRP values calculated
on a set of randomly generated emission sources of a given size _D_.
In this investigation each statistical sample is generated as follows:
1\. Set up a quadratic uniform linear NxN array in the yz-plane, with
horizontal and vertical element separation
N is randomly chosen such that the element separation is larger or equal to a
half wave length.
2\. Rotate the source points by an Euler zyz-rotation with angles a, b, and c
which are uniformly chosen in the intervals [0,360], [0,90] and [0,360]
degrees, respectively. The rotated position of source _n_ is denoted
{width="0.1326388888888889in" height="0.15416666666666667in"}
3\. Pick a random correlation value ρ from the uniform distribution between 0
and {width="0.2791666666666667in" height="8.819444444444445e-2in"}, and
generate source weights as
{width="2.0in" height="0.33055555555555555in"}
Where {width="0.9555555555555556in" height="0.1326388888888889in"} are picked
from a normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation.
4\. Normalize the weights to TRP = 1 by using a full sphere grid with sparsity
factor 0.25.
5\. Generate EIRP values on the desired grid by using an _array factor_
{width="2.0076388888888888in" height="0.46319444444444446in"}
6\. Calculate the TRP value as an appropriate mean value of the EIRP values
for two/three cut grids and using full sphere numerical integration for the
full sphere case.
There is publicly available Matlab code for sparse sampling analysis in [22]
and more results can be found in publication in [10].
The resulting 5^th^ percentile values of the empirical CDFs are used as a
practical lower bound on the TRP calculated directly from the points in the
actual grid. If the 5^th^ percentile value is positive, there is no need for a
systematic correction, that means ΔTRP = 0. On the other hand, if the 5^th^
percentile value is negative, a systematic correction is needed to guarantee
TRP overestimation with 95% confidence. For this purpose, the absolute value
of the 5^th^ percentile is used as systematic correction factor, denoted ΔTRP
(see figure E-1). Some simulation results are found in figures E-2 (a) -- (c)
for two different choices of max correlation and the three grid types: full-
sphere, three-cut, and two-cuts.

The following systematic correction factors are proposed be used in the test
procedure, given the results obtained for $\rho_{\text{max\ }} = 0.5$, which
is considered to be acceptable at this point.

###### ## Annex F (informative): Power density measurements close to BS
This annex contains guidelines for measurement of power density flux on a
sphere surrounding the BS. The rationale for using a small test distance
(compared to the far-field of BS) is that any amount of power that radiates
from the BS also will radiate through any sphere enclosing the BS, i.e.,
energy conservation.
Power flux density based on measurement of tangential electric field
components can be used for correct TRP assessment [31]. For accurate power
density assessment, the following conditions need to be met:
1\. The test distance shall be at least the far-field distance of the
measurement antenna, i.e. $r_{0} \geq 2D_{\text{MA}}^{2}/\lambda$
2\. The measurement antenna shall sample an approximately constant field.
3\. The test distance must be at least two wavelengths from the smallest
sphere enclosing the BS.
The second criterion is quantified as:
, (F-1)
where R~sph~ is the radius of the smallest sphere enclosing the BS.
Furthermore, equstion (F-1) sets a minimum test distance for a given
measurement antenna size _w [31]_.

EXAMPLE: For assessing TRP using power density data close to BS, consider the
patterns in Figure G-2, which are sampled at (a) 0.75 m, (b) 2.5 m and (c) 30
m from the same BS. The far-field distance of the BS is 30 m. The angular
patterns vary with distance, but the full-sphere integration for TRP deviates
less than 0.065 dB. The lower power density levels in the lower figure are
balanced by the larger total area of the measurement sphere.
