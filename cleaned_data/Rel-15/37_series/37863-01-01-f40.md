# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for Dual connectivity (DC) band
combinations of LTE 1DL/1UL + one NR band under Rel-15 time frame. It covers
both the UE and BS side. The document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 DC band combination of LTE 1DL/1UL + one NR band: General Part
## 5.1 UE RF General
## 5.1.1 Basic DC UE RF architectures at range 1
In a few previous RAN4 meeting, some key features in NR UE 3.5GHz were agreed
to support at 3.5GHz NR new bands as below.
\- Specify both PC2 and PC3 UE for 3.5GHz NR frequency range in Rel-15
\- Shall support 4Rx requirements
\- UL 256QAM supporting (w/ QPSK,16QAM, 64QAM)
\- Specify 2Tx (for diversity and UL-MIMO) requirements
Also, current 5G NR UE should be support some general features as below.
\- Wideband operation in NR band
\- NSA UE support LTE (xDL/1UL) + NR (1CC)
From the above observations, we designed a example RF architecture for NSA DC
UE.
Figure 5.1.1-1. NR UE RF architecture w/ sharing antennas at Range 1
Figure 5.1.1-1 shows the common antenna sharing NR UE RF architectures for LTE
and 5G NR system to support UL-MIMO and 4Rx diversity. In this figure, the
main Tx/Rx antenna can use for both LTE and NR system.
The Figure 5.1.1-1 is used for NSA UE to support LTE and NR new bands except
some overlapped frequency range at 3.3\~4.2 GHz.
The following Figure 5.1.1-2 described the NR UE RF architecture considering
separate antenna between LTE system and NR bands at sub-6GHz.
Figure 5.1.1-2. NR UE RF architecture w/ separate antennas at Range 1
The separate antenna RF architecture in figure 5.1.1-2 can be used for NR NSA
UE to support LTE and 3.5GHz NR new bands since the LTE band 22, band 42 and
43 is overlapped with 3.5GHz NR new bands. In case, it is quite difficult to
divide NR signal and LTE signal in UE side when we consider antenna sharing RF
architecture.
Hence this architecture in Figure 5.1.1-2 also used some specific band
combinations for NR DC UE.
### 5.1.2 Basic DC UE RF architectures at range 2
Based on the current assumptions at mmWave UE, we designed the RF
architectures
\- At least 4Tx antenna to guarantee spherical coverage
\- Use multiple ant. elements with beamforming to get more directive gain
\- Consider both single polarization and dual polarization gain
\- Consider 2Rx or 4Rx diversity at mmWave
Also, current 5G NR UE should be support some general features as below.
\- Wideband operation in NR band
\- NSA UE support LTE (xDL/1UL) + NR (1CC)
From the above observations, we designed a example DC UE RF architecture
between LTE band and NR new band at mmWave.
Figure 5.1.2-1. NR UE RF architecture w/ separate antennas at Range 2
Figure 5.1.2-1 shows the NR UE RF architectures with separate antenna
structure for NSA DC UE between LTE bands and NR new bands at mmWave.
When NR UE support dual polarization antennas, we need twice antennas and RFIC
at mmWave in a example RF architecture.
## 5.2 Single Tx Switched UL
In some LTE-NR inter-band combinations, as indicated in the "Difficult for
simultaneous UL" column in Table 1-1, it is difficult for UE to perform
simultaneous LTE+NR UL transmission. The band combinations in which the 2^nd^
order IMD of the simultaneous UL bands fall into its own Rx band are
categorized as difficult. And the band combinations for L-L (\ NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the
> lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should
> be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2. The highest
> frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be set
> at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the
> measurement bandwidth defined for the protected band.

Based on Table 6.33.3-1,
\- The 2th order harmonic of Band 39 may fall into Band n78. However, this
band combination will only be used in China and the impacted frequency range
3760-3840MHz will not be allocated to IMT in China. So the 2nd harmonic issue
will not be a problem for this combination.
\- The 3rd 4th and 5th order IMD product may also fall into Band n78. However
IMD will not be an issue for Band n78 (no self-interference for the TDD band)
even through the IMD products may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.33.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.33.5 MSD
According to the interference analysis, only harmonic issue in asynchronous
operation may be a problem for this band combination. However, the harmonic
issue only impacts the frequency range 3760-3800MHz in Band n78. According to
the spectrum situation in China where this combination is applicable, only the
frequency below 3600Mz is allocated to IMT and it is far from the impacted
frequency range. So there is no harmonic problem for this combination. No MSD
needs to be specified for this combination. While reduced frequency range need
to be reflected for the combination in TS 38.101-3 [5] Table 5.2B.3.1-1 by a
note "The frequency range above 3600MHz in Band n78 is not used in this
combination."
### 6.33.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.33.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.33.6-1.

Equations (6.33.6.1) and (6.33.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.33.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.33.6.1)
(6.33.6.2)
Formula (6.33.6.3-1) and (6.33.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.34.3-1, 3^rd^ IMD product may fall in to Band 39. 2^nd^ 3^rd^
order IMD product may also fall into Band n258. It should be noted that IMD
will not be an issue (no self-interference for the TDD band) even through the
IMD products may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.34.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

of bands n258 and n259
\- 5^th^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands n258 and n259
The 2^nd^, 3^rd^ and 4^th^ IMD will be impact to the own received band n257.
However, the NR TDD band has no impact from dual uplink transmission since
there was no simultaneous Tx/Rx transmission in the band n257.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.38.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.39.3-1;
\- There was no harmonic issues at legacy E-UTRA bands and NR new band
3.3\~3.8 GHz
\- 2^nd^ order IMD may also fall into B5, B8, B12, B13, B14, B17, B18, B19,
B20, B26, B27, B28, B67, B68 and TDD B44, B46 and B47.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into B3, B11, B21, B24, B32 and TDD B45, n77
\- 4^th^ order IMD may also fall into B1, B2, B3, B4, B9, B10, B11, B21, B23,
B24, B25, B30, B32, B65, B66, TDD B33, B34, B35, B36, B37, B38, B39, B40, B41,
B43, B45, n77, n78, n79
\- 5^th^ order IMD may also fall into B5, B8, B12, B13, B14, B17, B18, B19,
B20, B26, B27, B28, B29, B31, B67, B68, TDD B44, B46, B47 and n79.
The 4^th^ IMD will be impact to the own received band n78. However, the NR TDD
band is not any impacts from dual uplink transmission since there was no
simultaneous Tx/Rx transmission in the n78 NR band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.39.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics

Based on Table 6.40.3-1;
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 7, 10, 23, 30,
38, 40, 41, 65, 66, 69 and n257.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.40.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics

### 6.41.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.41.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.41.6-1.

Equations (6.41.6.1) and (6.41.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.41.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.41.6.1)
(6.41.6.2)
Formula (6.41.6.3-1) and (6.41.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.42.3-1;
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 3
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 7 and 41
\- 2^nd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of band 22, 42, 43, 46,

\- 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5\~8, 18\~20,
26\~28, 38, 41, 68, 69 and n79. However, TDD band does not transmit and
receive simultaneously in a single band, thus the own band of n79 would not be
interfered
\- 4^th^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1\~4, 9, 10, 23,
25, 30, 33\~37, 39, 40, 65, 66 and 70

17\~20, 26\~28, 32, 44, 45, 67 and 68
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have

### 6.42.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.42.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.42.6-1.

Equations (6.42.6.1) and (6.42.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.42.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.42.6.1)
(6.42.6.2)
Formula (6.42.6.3-1) and (6.42.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

frequencies of band n257. However, TDD band does not transmit and receive

The MSD level for Band n78 by 4^th^ harmonic from Band 20 can reuse the value
from LTE CA_20A-42A. Table 6.45.5-2 shows the MSD level for DC_20A-n78A. The
MSD for 40MHz was calculated based on 20MHz, since the interference are same.

NOTE 1: These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission bandwidth of a low band for which the 4th transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of a high band. NOTE 2: The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN of a low band (superscript LB) such that in MHz and with the carrier frequency of a high band in MHz and the channel bandwidth configured in the low band. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Regarding the uplink configuration, 40MHz for n78 should be considered
additionally. Therefore, 20MHz with 100RB allocation for Band 20 should be
added.

### 6.45.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.45.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.45.6-1.

Equations (6.45.6.1) and (6.45.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.45.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.45.6.1)
(6.45.6.2)
Formula (6.45.6.3-1) and (6.45.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.50.3-1, the 3^rd^ 4^th^ order IMD product may also fall into
Band 39. However it should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for TDD
bands (no self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products
may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.50.3-2 lists if up to 7^th^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.51.3-1, the 3^rd^ and 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Band 41
and Band n77. However, it should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for
TDD bands (no self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD
products may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.51.3-2 lists if up to 7^th^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.51.5 MSD
B41 and n77 are both TDD and close in frequency and lack of isolation in the
band filters will result in Rx bands noise from the Tx path of one band de-
sensing the Rx of the other band. Three scenarios of desensitization are
identified for this combination.
Firstly, B41 Rx is also affected due to n77 Tx leakage (4.5dB). This MSD is
capatured in Table 6.51.5-1 with uplink configuration shown in Table 6.51.5-2.
Secondly, n77 Rx is affected by B41 Tx wideband noise leakage that causes MSD
=8.3 dB when 2x n77 Tx = 3x B41 Rx is satisfied.
Thirdly, 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing at B41 Rx would be caused by the leakage
of 2^nd^ harmonics of n77 Tx, which happens when 2x n77 Tx = 3x B41 Rx is
satisfied..
Two MSDs for harmonic mixing are captured in Table 6.51.5-3 with uplink
configuration in Table 6.51.5-4.
Note that these MSDs only happen when two bands are operated in asynchronous
manner.

### 6.51.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.

Based on Table 6.52.3-1, the 3^rd^ and 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Band 41
and Band n78. However, it should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for
TDD bands (no self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD
products may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.52.3-2 lists if up to 7^th^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.52.5 MSD
Band 41 and n78 are both TDD bands and are close in frequency. For
unsynchronized operation, Rx de-sensing in one band will be caused by another
band due to lack of isolation in the band filters. Three scenarios of
desensitization are identified for this combination as below.
\- Firstly, B41 Rx is also affected due to n78 Tx leakage (4.5dB). This MSD is
capatured in Table 6.52.5-1 with uplink configuration shown in Table
6.52.5-2..
\- Secondly, n78 Rx is affected by B41 Tx wideband noise leakage that causes
MSD =8.3 dB when 2x n78 Tx = 3x B41 Rx is satisfied..
\- Thirdly, 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing at B41 Rx would be caused by the
leakage of 2^nd^ harmonics of n77 Tx, which happens when 2x n77 Tx = 3x B41 Rx
is satisfied..
Two MSDs for harmonic mixing are captured in Table 6.52.5-3 with uplink
configuration in Table 6.52.5-4.
Note that these MSDs only happen when two bands are operated in asynchronous
manner.

### 6.52.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.52.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.52.6-1.

Based on Table 6.53.3-1,
\- The 2nd harmonic of Band 41 may fall into Band n79 due to UE transmitting
in the lower part of the Band 41. However, the lower part of Band 41 is only
used in US where there is no plan on using n79. So the harmonic issue will not
be a problem for this combination.
\- The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order IMD may fall into Band 41 and the 3rd, 4th,
5th order IMD product may fall into Band n79. However it should be not _e_ d
that IMD will not be an issue for TDD bands (no self-interference for the TDD
band) even through the IMD products may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.53.3-2 lists if up to 7^th^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.53.5 MSD
For DC 41A-n79, there are two operation modes, synchronous operation and
asynchronous operation.
\- In synchronous operation, there is no MSD issue as TX and RX slots between
B41 and n79 are aligned.
\- In asynchronous operation, there are small frequency ranges where large MSD
occurs as shown in Table 6.53.5-1.
Table 6.53.5-1: MSD frequency range
MSD Issue Band Frequency Low MHz Frequency high Mhz comments
* * *
2^nd^ harmonic B41 TX on n79 RX B41 2496 2506 Small range of problematic
frequencies but very large MSD (35.4 dB) n79 4992 5000  
n79 TX on 2^nd^ harmonic mixing B41 RX B41 2496 2506 Small range of
problematic frequencies and significant MSD (13 dB) n79 4992 5000
However, considering the current spectrum situation for n79 (China, Japan),
the lowest edges of Band 41 actually used are far away from the range creating
MSD issue.
\- The lowest usable frequency is 2545MHz in Japan,
\- The lowest usable frequency may go down to 2515 MHz in China (Note that
2500 - 2515 MHz may be considered as guard band for protection of services
below 2500MHz.)
So the harmonic issue is not a problem for this combination considering the
spectrum situation clarified above. No MSD needs to be specified for this
combination. A note is proposed for TS38.101 Table 5.2B.3.1-1 "The frequency
range below 2506 MHz for Band 41 is not used in this combination."
### 6.53.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.53.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.53.6-1.
Table 6.53.6-1: Band 41 and Band n79 interference mixing coefficients
* * *

* * *
Equations (6.53.6.1) and (6.53.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.53.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.53.6.1)
(6.53.6.2)
Formula (6.53.6.3-1) and (6.53.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.54.3-1, the 2nd and 3rd order IMD may fall into Band n258 and
3rd order IMD product may fall into Band 41. However it should be noted that
IMD will not be an issue for TDD bands (no self-interference for the TDD band)
even through the IMD products may fall into the concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.54.3-2 lists if up to 7^th^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Tables 6.56.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.61.3-1;
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 7, 10, 23, 30,
34, 40, 41, 65, 66, 69, n257, n258 and n259.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.61.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 42, 48, 49,
77 and 78.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD may fall into own Rx frequencies of band n257 (which can be
disregarded, since no self-interference in TDD) as well as Rx frequencies of
band n258.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n258.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.62.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

6.63.5 MSD
Table 6.63.5-1 lists the MSD required for the dual connectivity configuration.
As mentioned above, between Band 8 and n77, the 4^th^ order harmonic of Band 8
Tx falls down to n77 Rx and IMD4 falls down to Band 8. (Note that IMDs falling
down to n77 do not affect n77 Rx since n77 is TDD.) The results are as
follows:

### 6.63.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.63.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.63.6-1.

* * *
Equations (6.63.6.1) and (6.63.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.63.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.63.6.1)
(6.63.6.2)
Formula (3-1) and (3-2) below are then used to indicate when the interference
is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

### 6.64.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For DC_8A-n257A, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ are proposed as follows, assuming
separate RF chains are employed for these bands.

### 6.64.5 MSD
As mentioned above, between Band 8 and n257, there is no harmonic relation and
IMD2-4 fall down to Band n257. But these IMDs do not affect n257 Rx since n257
is TDD. Thus, there is no need to address MSD due to IMDs.

When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.65.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics

Based on Table 6.66.3-1;
\- 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 46, n79
\- 3^rd^ order harmonics may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 41
\- 2^nd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 3,9, 22, 35, 42, n77
and n78
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20,
26, 27, 28, 44, 46, 47, n77 and n79
\- 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band 22, 42, 43, 46, n77,
n78, n79
\- 5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14,
17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 38, 41, 44, 46, 48, 67. 68, 69, 71
There is a third order harmonic of the Band 26 uplink in n41. However, if the
allocation for Band 26 is limited to the lowest 10 MHz of Band 26
(814-824/859-869 MHz) the harmonic no longer falls in n41. There is a third
order IMD in the downlink frequencies of Band 26. However, if the Band 26
allocation is limited to the low 10 MHz of Band 26 (814-824/859-869 MHz) and
the allocation for n41 is limited to the high 170 MHz of the band (2520 --
2690 MHz) the IM3 does not fall into the 10 MHz allocation for Band 26. There
is also a 5^th^ order IMD into n41, but since n41 is a TDD band, the UE wont't
be transmitting and receiving on n41 simultaneously.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.66.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.66.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.66.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.66.6-1.

Equations (6.66.6.1) and (6.66.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.66.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.66.6.1)
(6.66.6.2)
Formula (6.66.6.3-1) and (6.66.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the

6.67.5 MSD
Since Band 41 and n41 are both TDD bands, no MSD is required for the dual
connectivity configuration.
### 6.67.6 SEM for DC_41A_n41A
The spectral emission mask for DC_41A_n41 is a composite of the emission mask
for each CC with the level set to the maximum value from each mask for each
frequency outside of the transmission bandwidth of either carrier. A composite
spectrum emission mask is a combination of individual CC spectrum emissions
masks. Where two masks overlap the most relaxed limit is used. When NS_04 is
signalled the emissions must also meet the additional requirements. Also, when
NS_04 is signalled, the general spurious emission mask is -25 dBm/MHz, not -30
dBm/MHz..
### 6.67.6a SEM for DC_(n)41AA
The SEM for DC_(n)41AA will be based on the aggregated emisission bandwidth.
The aggregated emission bandwidth determines the frequency where the emission
mask drops from -13 dBm/MHz to -25 dBm/MHz. When NS_04 is signalled the
emissions must also meet the additional requirements. Also, when NS_04 is
signalled, the general spurious emission mask is -25 dBm/MHz, not -30 dBm/MHz.

6.67.7 A-MPR
Band 41 and n41 will need to meet the emission mask for ns_04. The
requirements are TBD.

### 6.68.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.68.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.68.6-1.

* * *
Equations (6.68.6.1) and (6.68.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.68.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.68.6.1)
(6.68.6.2)
Formula (6.68.6.3-1) and (6.68.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

### 6.69.3 Co-existence studies
DC_(n)71B is a contiguous allocation thus only uplink harmonic analysis is
needed.
Table 6.69.3-1: DC_(n)71B UL harmonics
Uplink band 2^nd^ Harmonic 3^rd^ Harmonic
* * *
Band UL Low Band Edge UL High Band Edge UL Low Band Edge UL High Band Edge UL
Low Band Edge UL High Band Edge 71 663 698 1326 1396 1989 2094
From Table 6.69.3-1 it can be seen that uplink harmonics 3rd harmonic overlaps
with bands 3, 25, 34 and 70.
### 6.69.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
No dTib or dRib is required for DC_(n)71B as it is intraband DC.

### 6.70.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.70.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.70.6-1.

Equations (6.70.6.1) and (6.70.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.70.6-1
and CBW stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.70.6.1)
(6.70.6.2)
Formula (6.70.6.3-1) and (6.70.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.73.3-1
\- 2^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 42, n77 and n78.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 26,
32, 33, 39, 41, 45, 46, 50, 75 and n79
\- 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 30, 40 and n79
\- 5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 43, n77 and n78.
It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n51 (no self-
interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may fall into the
concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.73.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

The uplink of Band n71 is 663 - 698 MHz for which third harmonic products fall
within 1989 -- 2094 MHz, while the downlink of Band 2 is 1930 - 1990 MHz.
Thus, it can be seen that there is potential for third harmonic interference
from uplink in Band 71 to downlink in Band 2. However, the potential is
limited to edge channels since the overlap is only 1 MHz from 1989 -- 1990
MHz. Only an uplink allocation in the lowest edge of Band 71 paired with
simultaneous downlink in the uppermost edge of Band 2 could be impacted.
Moreover, due to the guard bands inherent in the definition of the
transmission bandwidth configuration for LTE and NR, there may not be any
direct overlap at all. However, there may still be some effect due to spectral
spreading of the third harmonic even if direct overlap is averted.
Another potential mechanism for harmonic interference is mixing of the uplink
in Band 2 with the third harmonic of the Rx LO. In this case, the frequency
range impacted is much larger. The third harmonic of Rx extends from 1851 to
1956 MHz while the uplink in Band 2 ranges from 1850 to 1910 MHz. Therefore,
there is nearly complete overlap between these two ranges. Depending upon the
particular frequency assignments and allocation of PRB's for uplink within
Band 2 and downlink within Band n71, there may be interference from this
mechanism.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.74.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics

operation
### 6.74.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

### 6.74.5 MSD
MSD due to harmonics affects both Band 2 and Band n71. When there is uplink on
low frequency channels of Band n71, its third harmonic and regrowth reach the
uppermost downlink channel in Band 2. When there is uplink on Band 2, the
third harmonic of Rx LO in Band n71 mixes with the uplink and generates
harmonic interference in Band n71 Rx.
#### 6.74.5.1 Band 2 MSD
The MSD from LTE CA_2A-71A is reused for this DC combination. Although the NR
spectrum utilization in Band n71 is larger than the LTE spectrum utilization
in Band 71, the worst case interference mechanism is expected to be single RB
transmissions. The harmonic noise from single RB transmissions in Band n71 is
not expected to increase due to the higher spectrum utilization.
Table 6.74.5.1-1. Summary of MSD for all aggressor and victim bandwidths

The reference sensitivity can be defined as follows where the maximum MSD for
a given Band 2 channel bandwidth is applied. The 5 MHz channel bandwidth
requires an amendment when the Band n71 Tx bandwidth is also 5 MHz since the
MSD is significantly larger for this case. Also, it is noted that the MSD only
applies when the channels are located in proximity of the lower edge of Band
n71 and the upper edge of Band 2.

#### 6.74.5.2 Band n71 MSD
The reference sensitivity of Band n71 is reused from Band 71 in LTE CA_2A-71A.
Although the NR spectrum utilization in Band n71 is larger than the LTE
spectrum utilization in Band 71, the reference sensitivity of Band n71 is
dominated by the harmonic mixing noise greater than . Therefore, the slight
increase in thermal noise and Tx noise due to higher spectrum utilization in
Band n71 is insignificant in comparison.

### 6.74.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.74.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.74.6-1.

Equations (6.74.6.1) and (6.74.6.2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.74.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.

Formula (6.74.6.3-1) and (6.74.6.3-2) below are then used to indicate when the
interference is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.76.3-1
\- 2^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 42, n77 and
n78.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 21, 32, 34, 36,
45, 50, 65, 66, 70, 75, and n79.
\- 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 38, 41, 43, 44, 69,
71, n77 and n78
\- 5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5, 6, 19, 26, 30, 40,
41, 46 and n77.
It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n51 (no self-
interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may fall into the
concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.76.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.77.3-1
3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n79.
2^nd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 24, 31, 38, 42, 43,
46, 69, 72, n77 and n78,
4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23,
25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 65, 66 and 70.
5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 22,
28, 29, 31, 42, 44, 67, 68, 71, 72, n77, n78 and n79.
It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n50 (no self-
interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may fall into the
concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.77.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.78.3-1
2^nd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 21, 22, 32, 38, 42, 43,
45, 46, 50, 69, 75, n77 and n78.
4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10, 23, 65 and 66
5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 27,
28, 29, 44, 67, 68 and n79.
It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n51 (no self-
interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may fall into the
concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.78.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.81.3-1
3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 1, 4, 10, 23, 65, 66
and n79.
2^nd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10, 20, 23, 28,
65, 66 and 67.
3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10, 20, 22, 23,
24, 28, 40, 42, 43, 65, 66, 67, 71, n77, and n78.
4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 20, 22, 24, 28, 42, 43,
46, 67, 71, n77, n78, and n79
5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5, 6,, 18, 19, 20, 24,
26, 27, 28, 46, 67, 71, and n79
It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n50 (no self-
interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may fall into the
concerning band.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.81.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.104.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 50, 51, 75 and
76.
\- 3^3d^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10, 41, 65
and 66.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 24.
\- 3^3d^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 8, 30 and
40.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 3 and 9.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 2, 7 25, 31,
34, 36, 38, 41, 43, 48, 49, 69, 70, 72, 77 and 78.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.104.3-2 lists up to 7^th^ order harmonics and

Based on Table 6.105.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 42, 48, 49,
50, 51, 75, 76, 77, 78 and 79.
\- 3^3d^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10, 46 and
65 or its own RX frequency in band 66.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 41.
\- 3^3d^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 77.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 2, 4, 10,
25, 34, 36, 46, 47, 65, 70, 77 and 79 or its own RX frequency in band 66.

### 6.105.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.105.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.105.6-1.
Table 6.105.6-1: Band 12 and Band n66 interference mixing coefficients
* * *
EUTRA-NR DC\ EUTRA/NR\ UL\ DL\ Harmonic/IMD\ Victim\ Interference\

* * *
Equations (6.105.6-1) and (6.105.6-2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.105.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.105.6-1)
(6.105.6-2)
Formula (3-1) and (3-2) below are then used to indicate when the interference
is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

Based on Table 6.106.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 50, 51, n75 and
n76.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 1, 4, 10, 65 or
66.
\- 2^nd^ 3^rd^ 4^th^ and 5th order IMD may fall into own Rx frequencies of
band n260 (which can be disregarded, since no self-interference in TDD).
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.106.3-2 lists up to 7^th^ order harmonics and
IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on the table 6.107.3-1, the 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD products may fall
into the own Rx of Band 20, and 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD may fall into the
own RX of band n77. It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for n77
(no self-interference) even through the IMD products may fall into the
concerning band.
In addition, 3^rd^ order harmonic and 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ IMD
products may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1-14, 17-21, 23-31, 33-41,
44-70 and n77.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.107.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

The MSD level for Band n77 by 4^th^ harmonic from Band 20 can reuse the value
from LTE CA_20A-42A. Table 6.45.5-2 shows the MSD level for DC_20A-n77A. The
MSD for 40MHz was calculated based on 20MHz, since the interference are same.

NOTE 1: These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission bandwidth of a low band for which the 4th transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of a high band. NOTE 2: The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN of a low band (superscript LB) such that in MHz and with the carrier frequency of a high band in MHz and the channel bandwidth configured in the low band. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Regarding the uplink configuration, 40MHz for n77 should be considered
additionally. Therefore, 20MHz with 100RB allocation for Band 20 should be
added.

### 6.107.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.107.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.107.6-1.

Equations (6.107.6-1) and (6.107.6-2) below are used to calculate the
interference center frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth
(_BW~INT~_) where coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.107.6-1
and _CBW_ stands for channel bandwidth.
(6.107.6-1)
(6.107.6-2)
Formula (3-1) and (3-2) below are then used to indicate when the interference
is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

### 6.108.3 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^, 3^rd^ and 4^th^ IMD will be impact to the own received band n258.
However, the NR TDD band has no impact from dual uplink transmission since
there was no simultaneous Tx/Rx transmission in the band n258.
When 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.108.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.109.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 79.
\- 3^3d^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 41.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 11, 32, 45,
50, 74 and 75.
\- 3^3d^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 43, 46, 71,
77 and 78.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 79.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10,
46, 65 and 66.
It is concluded that there is no harmonic interference and IMD product falling
into their own Rx bands.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.109.3-2 lists up to 7^th^ order harmonics and
IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.110.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 42, 48, 49,
77, 78 or 79.
\- 3^3d^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 77
\- 3^3d^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 46 or 47
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 12, 22, 29,
42, 44, 71, 77, 78 or 79.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.110.3-2 lists up to 7^th^ order harmonics and

Based on Table 6.111.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n79.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD may fall into own Rx frequencies of band n260 (which can be
disregarded, since no self-interference in TDD).
\- 4^th^ order IMD may fall into band n259.
\- 5^th^ order IMD may fall into band n257.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.111.3-2 lists up to 7^th^ order harmonics and
IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.113.3-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 42, 48, 49,
77 and 78.
\- 3^3d^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 41 and 46.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 6, 7, 8, 18,
19, 26, 27, 38, 41 and 69, or its own RX frequency in band 5.
\- 3^3d^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 7, 38, 41,
42, 69, 77, 78 and 79.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 3, 9, 12,
13, 17, 20, 28, 29, 33, 35, 37, 39, 44, 46, 67, 68, 77 and 79.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 6, 8, 18,
19, 22, 24, 26, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 74, 75, 77 and 78, or its own RX
frequency in band 5.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.113.3-2 lists up to 7^th^ order harmonics and
IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.113.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.113.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.113.6-1.

### 6.114.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL inter-modulation products (IMD), or DL
harmonic mixing with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations.
The potential self-interference mechanism has been identified in section
6.114.3 co-existence studies except for harmonic mixing which are used to
generate an interference mixing coefficient table for this DC combination, as
shown in Table 6.114.6-1.
