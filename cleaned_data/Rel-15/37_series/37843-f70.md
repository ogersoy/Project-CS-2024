# 1 Scope
The present document is the Technical Report for the Work Item on Base Station
(BS) radiated Radio Frequency (RF) requirements for Active Antenna System
(AAS) [2]. The present document captures the background and the decisions on
the specification of radiated RF requirements that are applicable to AAS BS.
The AAS BS specification contains requirements for both single RAT UTRA FDD,
UTRA TDD and E-UTRA as well as MSR (including single RAT MSR requirements for
each of the RATS), it was agreed that it may not be necessary to support so
many variants for the OTA AAS BS hence a specification complexity reduction
investigation was carried out. It was found the following was not needed for
the OTA AAS BS requirements:
1\. Radiated requirements applicable for eAAS not support UTRA TDD.
2\. Radiated requirements applicable for eAAS not include UTRA pilot
requirements.
NOTE: In Rel-15, multiple clauses related to the OTA measurements of the BS
were shifted to the OTA BS testing TR 37.941 [36], which includes such aspects
as e.g., test tolerance and measurement uncertainty derivations, OTA test
chambers descriptions, calibration and test procedure descriptions, etc..

# 4 General
## 4.1 Work Item scope
Rel-15 AAS BS Work Item (WI) is to specify radiated Radio Frequency (RF), BS
demodulation and EMC requirements for Active Antenna System (AAS) Base Station
(BS) covering single Radio Access Technology (RAT) capable BS supporting UTRA
or E-UTRA, and multi-RAT capable BS operating in Band Category (BC) 1 and BC3,
for Wide Area (WA), Medium Range (MR), and Local Area (LA) coverage to ensure
necessary coexistence. Wide Area BS class will be prioritized.
## 4.2 Work Item objectives
The radiated AAS BS specification is based on translating the Rel-13 AAS BS
conducted requirements from TS 37.105 [3] to over the air requirements which
provide the same level of performance and protection as the Rel-13 AAS BS
requirements do.
It is composed of the following work tasks:
a) Core RF requirements
b) Conformance testing requirements, derived from the core RF requirements,
and demodulation testing requirements
Due to the necessary study required to arrive at requirement that does not
require excessive measurement and will be practical (i.e. easy to measure) and
robust, it is decided to include a study phase to identify the OTA core and
conformance concepts before writing the specification text.
Detailed WID texts are presented in [2].
## 4.3 General AAS BS RF architecture
An AAS BS may have 2 different types of RF interface at which the RF and
performance requirements are defined:
\- Conducted RF interface at the _transceiver array boundary_ (TAB) and a
_radiated interface boundary_ (RIB) in the far field for a _hybrid AAS BS_.
\- _Radiated interface boundary_ (RIB) only for an OTA AAS BS.
For both types of AAS BS the radio architecture is represented by three main
functional blocks:
\- the transceiver unit array (TRXUA),
\- the radio distribution network (RDN), and
\- the antenna array (AA).
The _transceiver units_ (TRXU) interface with the base band processing within
the AAS BS.
The TRXUA consists of multiple transmitter units (TXU) and receiver units
(RXUs). The TXU takes the baseband input from the AAS BS and provides the RF
TX outputs. The OTA AAS BS is restricted to architectures which have ≥8 TRXUs
for E_UTRA and ≥4 TRXUs for UTRA, restricting the minimum number of TRXUs in
the OTA AAS BS architecture allows the emissions scaling factor to be fixed
and avoids defining an OTA definition of an _active transceiver unit_ which is
difficult without the ability to count _TAB connectors_. AAS BS with small
numbers of TRXUs should retain a conducted interface and are classified as
_hybrid AAS BS_.
The RF TX outputs are distributed to the AA via a RDN. The RXU performs the
reverse of the TXU operations. The RDN performs the distribution of the TX
outputs into the corresponding antenna paths and antenna elements, and a
distribution of RX inputs from antenna paths in the reverse direction. The TXU
and RXU can be separated and can have different mapping through the RDN
towards the AA.
For the _hybrid AAS BS_ the _transceiver array boundary_ (TAB) is the point(s)
at which the TRXUA is connected to the RDN. The point where a TXU or RXU
connects with the RDN is equivalent to an \"antenna connector\" of a non-AAS
BS and is called _TAB connector_. The _TAB connector_ is defined as conducted
requirement reference point. The transmitted signal per carrier from one
Transmitter Unit appear at one or more _TAB connector(s)_ and the received
signals per carrier from one or more _TAB connector(s)_ appear at a single
RXU.
Figure 4.3-1 shows a general architecture of a _hybrid AAS BS_ radio
architecture, where M is the total number of _transceiver units_ and K is the
total number of _TAB connectors_ at the transceiver array boundary.
The OTA AAS BS has no _transceiver array boundary_ or _TAB connectors_ defined
as it has no conducted requirements. The OTA AAS BS radiated requirements are
defined at the _radiated interface boundary_ (RIB).
Figure 4.3-2 shows a general architecture of an OTA AAS BS radio architecture,
where P is the total number of _transceiver units_ and P ≥ 8 (E-UTRA) or P ≥ 4
(UTRA) for OTA AAS BS.
NOTE 1: The RDN may consist of a simple one to one mapping between the
TXU(s)/RXU(s) and the passive _antenna array_. In this case, the RDN would be
a logical entity but not necessarily a physical entity.
NOTE 2: The _antenna array_ includes various implementations and
configurations e.g. polarization, array geometry (including element factor and
element separation), etc.
**NOTE 3:** The physical location of the TRXUA, the RDN, and the AA may differ
from this logical representation and is implementation dependent.
NOTE 4: No specific mapping in the RDN between _TAB connectors_ and antenna
elements is assumed. Further the number of separate receiver and transmitter
units as well as the mapping in the RDN between _TAB connectors_ and
_radiating element_ s can differ between the transmit and receive directions.
Both AAS BS reference architectures allow for full asymmetry between receiver
path and transmit path.
NOTE 5: For AAS BS capable of supporting applications employing beamforming,
all or subgroups of _TAB connectors_ can be configured with designated
amplitude and phase weights such that one or more beams are radiated from the
_antenna array_.
NOTE 6: If text of this TR and figures 4.3-1, 4.3-2 contradict each other,
then the TR text applies.
> NOTE 7: In the case of the OTA AAS BS, _the fixed scaling factor (FSF)
> equals 8 for E-UTRA and 4 for UTRA and is based on the maximum number of
> layers/streams specified in Rel-12. The FSF value may be further
> reconsidered for future releases if the maximum number of layers/streams
> supported by RAT(s) supported by the AAS BS is changed._
NOTE 8: If an OTA AAS BS is declared to support more than 1 cell (_N~cells~_
>1) the total number of transceiver units is greater than FSF* _N~cells~_ ,
i.e. for 8* _N~cells~_ for E-UTRA or 4* _N~cells~_ for UTRA.

## 4.4 Specification organization
### 4.4.1 TS 37.105: RF and demodulation requirements
The existing AAS BS technical specification TS 37.105 [3] will be updated to
include both _hybrid requirements set(s)_ and _OTA requirements set_.
The full OTA set of RF requirements will be added as additional sub-clauses to
the existing radiated requirements in the Rel-15 version of the technical
specification TS 37.105.
The updated technical specification TS 37.105 will contain all the existing
conducted requirements as specified and the radiated requirements clause will
be modified to contain a full set of OTA requirements for OTA AAS BS.
The requirements in TS 37.105 can be used to describe either an _OTA
requirements set_ or a _hybrid requirements set(s)_. There will be at least
one _hybrid requirements set_ which is the same as the existing AAS BS Rel-13
set of conducted and radiated requirements.
The applicability of requirements clause in TS 37.105 can be modified to
define which sub-clauses are required to show compliance to either the _OTA
requirements set_ or the _hybrid requirements set(s)_.
### 4.4.2 TS 37.114: EMC requirements
The existing EMC requirements defined in TS 37.114 [13] for _hybrid AAS BS_
will be extended to also include EMC requirements for OTA AAS BS.
In the Rel-15 version of the TS 37.114 the set of EMC requirements for OTA AAS
BS will be added as additional sub-clauses to the already existing EMC
requirements defined for the _hybrid AAS BS_.
## 4.5 Coordinate system
For the description of the coordinate system for the OTA BS measurements,
refer to TR 37.941 [36].
## 4.6 AAS BS classifications
### 4.6.1 Minimum coupling loss and minimum distance
AAS BS is classified according to the deployment scenarios defined in sub-
clause 5.2.1 in TR 37.840 [6] and those scenarios are the same as for non-AAS
BS. One of the key parameters that characterise each of the deployment
scenarios is the MCL between BS and UE, which includes the path loss and the
_antenna gains_ of both UE and BS. For OTA AAS BS, without antenna connectors,
minimum distance along the ground is used to characterise the deployment
scenarios.
### 4.6.2 BS classifications
AAS BS classes for BS without antenna connectors are defined as indicated
below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 5 m.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to
2 m.
AAS BS classes for BS with antenna connectors are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
The deployment scenarios associated with BS classes and its definitions are
exactly the same for BS both with and without connectors. An MCL of 70dB
corresponds to a minimum distance of around 35m, 53dB to around 5m and 45dB to
around 2m respectively for BS with connectors.
## 4.7 Polarization
Polarization is a vital characteristic for antennas used for radio
communication. Both radio communication antennas and electromagnetic waves are
said to have a polarization. According to eastablished and accepted standard
definitions of terms for antennas [32], the viewpoint taken for polarization
is that this term can be used in three related meanings;
\- Polarization can refer to a field vector at some point in space.

\- Polarization can refer to an antenna.
Based on the geneal description above, polarization aspects for OTA
requirements can be summarized as listed in table 4.7-1 for transmitter

## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Spatial requirements
OTA requirements for the AAS BS are belonging to one of the three groups:
\- Directional requirements
> \- _TRP requirements_
_-_ Co-location requirements
For the requirements classification and descriptions of the above requirement
groups, refer to TR 37.941 [36].
All OTA requirements are met in either the _OTA coverage range_ or _OTA peak
direction set(s)_ as shown in the overview table of the radiated Tx
requirements in table 5.1-1.

The _OTA peak directions set(s)_ are the same as the _EIRP accuracy directions
set(s)_ used in the REL13 specification, the name has been changed as they are
now used for other requirements. Examples of _OTA peak directions sets_ remain
the same as related _EIRP accuracy directions set(s)_ in TR 37.842 [4].
Some further examples of the relationship between the _OTA peak direction
set(s)_ and the _OTA coverage range_ are as follows:
Example 1.
> This example shows the declarations that would be made for an OTA AAS BS
> with a passive antenna, the system hence has no beam steering capability
> (this is perhaps unlikely to be an OTA AAS BS however makes extreme
> example).
The declarations are: Vertical (θ) beam width = 10°, Horizontal (φ) beam width
= 65°
{width="4.426388888888889in" height="3.6173611111111112in"}
Figure 5.1.1-1: Example _OTA coverage range_ and _OTA peak directions set_ for
a passive antenna
Note as the beam cannot be steered the _OTA peak directions set_ is a single
point and the _OTA coverage range_ is the same as the 3dB beam pattern of the
passive antenna.
Example 2.
> This example shows the declarations that would be made for an OTA AAS BS
> with multiple beam widths and beam steering capability. The declarations are
> defined as including an _OTA peak directions set_ for both the widest beam
> width and the narrowest beam width in both dimensions. For simplicity it is
> assumed beam width in θ and ϕ are the same for this example.
\- For the minimum beam width case: beam width (θ and ϕ) =10°, maximum
steering (θ and ϕ) = ±32.5°
\- For the maximum beam width case: beam width (θ and ϕ) =35°, maximum
steering (θ and ϕ) = ±25°
\- Note the larger beam width has a smaller declared extreme steering
direction, but the potential coverage is greater.
The _OTA peak directions sets_ for the 2 cases are different, however they
require a common _OTA coverage range_ , this can be seen in figure 5.1.1-2.
{width="3.3090277777777777in"
height="2.8305555555555557in"}{width="3.2868055555555555in"
height="2.8305555555555557in"}
Figure 5.1.1-2: Example _OTA coverage range_ and _OTA peak directions set_ for
a beam steering system with multiple beam widths
Note the _OTA coverage range_ is the same for both cases as there is only a
single _OTA coverage range_ declared per OTA AAS BS, however there are
multiple _OTA peak directions sets_ allowed. In this case the _OTA peak
direction set_ for the minimum beam width case is the same as the _OTA
coverage range_ , for the maximum beam width case the _OTA peak directions
set_ is smaller than the _OTA coverage range_.
In both examples the _OTA peak directions sets_ are a sub set of the _OTA
coverage range_ as required.
In both examples the beam widths for each of the maximum steering directions
are shown for information, the beam width for each of the maximum steering
direction is declared but it does not form part of the _OTA coverage range_.
It can be seen in both examples that when the beam is steered to its maximum
steering direction a portion of the beam is outside of the _OTA coverage
range_. The maximum extent of the OTA coverage range on each axis is declared
and used as test directions for the EVM requirement. The directions covered by
this area on the _directions diagram_ are not part of the _OTA coverage range_
and hence are not part of the range of directions which are intended to meet
the RF requirements, this is acceptable as performance beyond the _OTA
coverage range_ is not specified.
### 5.1.2 Co-location requirements
#### 5.1.2.1 Core requirements
There are a number of requirements which are based on the assumption of a co-
located BS of the same specification as the BS under test.
These requirements include:
\- Transmitter spurious emissions- co-location with other base stations
\- Transmitter intermodulation
\- Tx OFF requirements
\- Co-location blocking
The non-AAS requirements at the antenna connector assume that the co-located
BS have a coupling factor between them of 30 dB. This coupling factor is used
to calculate the interferer level at a co-located victim in the case of the
spurious emissions requirement, and the interferer level at the antenna
connector from a co-located aggressor BS.
The figure of 30 dB is based on measurement of coupling levels between typical
BS antennas in the same frequency band and is documented in [26] for the
following scenarios:
I (90º) II(120º) III(180º) IV(Horizontal) V(Vertical)
Figure 5.1.2-1: The different scenarios used during the antenna coupling
measurements. _d_ denotes displacement
In most scenarios the reported coupling factor between antennas was greater
than 30 dB. The figure of 30 dB comes from scenario IV when d is 0.25 m.
This figure agrees with the calculation for horizontal isolation coupling in
[27].
There are a number of issues which make translating the existing conducted
requirement into an OTA requirement difficult.
\- The required level of RX band spurious emissions is too low to measure in
the far field.
\- The out-of-band antenna gain of the AAS BS is not known.
\- The interferer power level for the IMD requirement in the far field is very
high.
However, OTA requirements have the advantage that the original co-location
scenarios can be used to derive the requirements. The requirements can
therefore be derived by defining both the type of _co-located reference
antenna_ and also how close it is to the AAS BS. This is referred to as the
proximity method.
The _co-location reference antenna_ can be regarded as having 2 interfaces, a
proximity OTA interface which couples with the AAS BS and a conducted
interface where the AAS BS requirements are set (and measured). For each of
the co-location requirements the co-location power specified at the
transceiver array boundary can be specified at the conducted output/input of
the _co-location reference antenna_ offset by 30 dB.
Some co-location requirements involve co-located BS of different frequency
bands. As the coupling loss between antennas of different frequency ranges is
higher than between antennas of the same frequency range, assuming antennas of
the same frequency range can be considered worst case. This is consistent with
the approach for the conducted co-location requirements where 30dB coupling
loss was assumed for all antenna combinations.
For example, the co-located protection of other RX bands is based on the
interfering power being low enough to not degrade the victim BS receiver by
more than 0.5 dB, which equates to a power level in 100 kHz of -128 dBm. For
the conducted requirement this is translated to the transceiver array boundary
by adding the 30 dB isolation. So, the requirement at the output of the _co-
location reference antenna_ is -128 dBm (plus any scaling).
As the worst case is based on scenario IV in figure 5.1.2-1 the definition of
the _co-location reference antenna_ is based on this scenario. The simplest
method for defining the _co-location reference antenna_ is with a diagram as
shown in figure 5.1.2-2.
The _co-location reference antenna_ should be a single column passive antenna
which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency range and
polarization, as the composite antenna of AAS BS and nominal 65° horizontal
half power beamwidth (suitable for 3-sector deployments). It is placed at a
distance _d_ from the edge of the AAS BS, as shown in figure 5.1.2-2.
{width="5.4118055555555555in" height="3.7944444444444443in"}
Figure 5.1.2-2: Definition of the _co-location reference antenna_
Edge-to-edge separation _d_ , between the AAS BS and the _co-location
reference antenna_ is set to 0.1 m.
The AAS BS and the _co-location reference antenna_ are to be aligned in a
common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction, as shown in
figure 5.1.2-2.
The _co-location reference antenna_ and the AAS can have different width.
The vertical radiating regions of the _co-location reference antenna_ and the
AAS composite antenna are aligned.
For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at the
_co-location reference antenna_ is different from the AAS BS, a _co-location
reference antenna_ suitable for the frequency stated in the requirement is
assumed.
OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted interface
of a _co-location reference antenna_ ; depending on the requirement this
interface is either an input or an output.
For AAS BS with dual polarization, the _co-location reference antenna_ has two
conducted interfaces each representing one polarization.
The area and dimensions of the _radiating element_ s shown in figure 5.1.2-2
do not form part of the OTA core definition of the _co-location reference
antenna,_ they are included in the figure to demonstrate what is meant by the
radiating dimension in the definition.
Based on the minimum separation of antennas used in the original scenarios in
[26], the edge-to-edge separation _d_ between the _co-location reference
antenna_ and the AAS BS is 0.10 m (this is derived from a 0.25 m centre to
centre separation on 0.15 m wide antennas).
#### 5.1.2.2 Conformance requirements
##### 5.1.2.2.1 General
Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of each
conducted interface of the _co-location reference antenna_. For conformance
testing the requirements are translated to the input or output of either a co-
location test antenna (CLTA) or a standard test antenna (such as a dipole).
The CLTA is suitable for testing AAS BS implemented with a planar antenna
array. The method for testing AAS BS with other antenna array implementations
is FFS.
##### 5.1.2.2.2 Co-location test antenna
The co-location test antenna is a practical passive antenna based on the
definition of the _co-location reference antenna,_ and it is used for
conformance testing of the co-location requirements. Thus the CLTA should be
within a certain tolerance of the co-location reference antenna definition, so
that commonly available passive BS antennas can be used to test the co-
location requirements without having to use a large number of test antennas
and without having to design specialized co-location test antennas.
For example, where the co-location reference antenna definition specifies that
the _co-location reference antenna_ , should be a single column passive
antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h) as the composite
antenna of AAS, this would be very restrictive when selecting a test antenna.
Hence the CLTA should be within a certain tolerance for the vertical radiating
dimension (h) such, that a suitable practical BS antenna can be found for each
AAS BS.
The CLTA is hence defined as follows:
> The CLTA is a single column passive antenna which has a vertical radiating
> dimension (h) which is equal to the vertical radiating dimension of the AAS
> BS composite antenna ±30%.
>
> For in-band requirements, the CLTA supports the same frequency range and
> polarizations as the AAS BS composite antenna.
>
> For out-of-band co-location requirements, the half power vertical beamwidth
> of the CLTA equals the narrowest declared vertical beamwidth ±3°.
>
> The polarization should match the in-band CLTA polarization
>
> The CLTA has a horizontal half-power beamwidth of 65° ±10°.
>
> The front faces of the AAS BS and the CLTA need to be aligned in a common
> plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction, as shown in
> figure 5.1.2.2.2-1.
>
> The centre of the vertical radiating regions of the CLTA and the AAS
> composite antenna need to be aligned.
This is summarised as follows:

The alignment between the AAS BS under test and the co-location test antenna
is described in Table 5.1.2.2.2-2 and Figure 5.1.2.2.2-1.

##### 5.1.2.2.3 Standard test antenna
It is captured in subclause 5.6.6.2 that co-location requirements may also be
tested with a standardised test antenna such as a dipole. This has a number of
advantages:
\- Standard test antennas are easily available and easier to specify.
\- Repeatability between different conformance testing runs will be greater.
\- Using standard test antennas, fewer antennas will be required for
conformance testing.
\- A standard test antenna can have higher gain in the direction of the AAS BS
than a CLTA, so that signal levels can be higher relative to the noise floor
in emission measurements and lower test levels can be used in interference
measurements.
In order to test with a standard test antenna, the translation between
measured power levels in the standard test antenna and the _co-location
reference antenna_ must be shown. The method for translating the power levels
in the _co-location reference antenna_ to the standard test antenna and vice
versa is FFS.
### 5.1.3 Transmit loss factor assumption
The transmitter loss factor is used to translate conducted power levels to OTA
power levels
To align with the emissions requirements based on the recommendation in ITU-R
SM.329 [18] the same limits are applied to both conducted and OTA, assuming
the transmit loss factor accounting for antenna losses, distribution losses,
integration losses etc. in the transmitter path(s) **_for_** the in-band, out-
of-band and spurious region is assumed to be 0 dB.
## 5.2 Base station output power
### 5.2.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The conducted single RAT specifications TS 25.104 [19], TS 25.105 [20] and TS
36.104 [8] as well as the MSR specification TS 37.104 [7] and the Rel-13 AAS
BS specification TS 37.105 [3] all contain a set of manufacturer's
declarations and a requirement on conducted output power. The requirement is
placed upon the rated carrier output power per carrier and applies to each
antenna connector in non-AAS BS, and _TAB connector_ in AAS BS. The rated
carrier output power per carrier is declared, and the requirement is that the
measured value is within ± 2dB (±2.5 dB in extreme conditions) of the declared
value. In addition to the accuracy requirement on the carrier output power, a
limit on the maximum declarable total rated output power per carrier,
dependent on the BS class, is captured in the core specification TS 37.105
although not subject to any conformance test.
In the AAS BS conformance test specification TS 37.145-1 [23], the conducted
power accuracy test is not carried out with a single carrier active, but with
a set of carriers active such that the total output power at the _TAB
connector_ is at its maximum level and hence the power amplifier is operated
at its maximum output power. Operation at maximum output power is an essential
condition for a number of other transmitter tests, including in-band
emissions, TX spurious emissions and EVM.
In the AAS BS specification TS 37.105, a requirement on EIRP accuracy was
introduced. The requirement is based on a set of declarations that associate
declared beams, beam steering ranges and EIRP achieved at certain points
within the steering ranges. The declarations associated with the EIRP accuracy
requirement are described in more detail in TR 37.842 [4]. The requirement
itself states that the declared EIRP is achieved to within a ±2.2 dB accuracy
interval at a number of (declared) directions.
### 5.2.2 OTA requirement
For the _OTA requirements set_ , the possibility of complete OTA testing of
output power is needed. This implies that where OTA testing is used,
conformance to the conducted requirement cannot be verified. In order to
decide on a suitable OTA solution, it is useful to review the purposes and
uses of the radiated output power requirement.
\- Verifying the accuracy of the transmitter unit output power
\- The conducted output power requirement achieves this goal. The EIRP
accuracy requirement verifies the accuracy of the transmitter unit output
together with other factors relating to the _antenna array_. The EIRP accuracy
requirement is a sufficient means to capture the accuracy of the whole system
in delivering power.
\- A basis for the power limit for the BS classes
\- The BS class power limits have been derived based on co-existence
simulations between different layers in heterogeneous network deployments. Due
to the statistical nature of the co-existence simulations, it is to be
expected to be the total power that will impact the co-existence statistics,
independently of beamforming and the antenna pattern (as is the case for ACLR
in general). This implies that an OTA based BS class power limit should be
based on TRP.
\- A condition for other transmitter conformance requirements
During conformance testing, it is an important condition for other transmitter
requirements that the OTA AAS BS is configured to and operating at maximum
power.
### 5.2.3 Output power accuracy
#### 5.2.3.1 Core requirement
The existing EIRP accuracy requirements are adopted for the requirement in
normal conditions. The accuracy requirement is hence ±2.2 dB.
As there are now a number of transmitter requirements which are specified as
_directional requirements_ the existing directions set name and definition
over which the EIRP accuracy is met (i.e. _EIRP accuracy directions set_) is
no longer suitable. EIRP accuracy is now be defined over the more general _OTA
peak directions set(s)_ , the requirement is modified accordingly.
> For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific _beam peak
> direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within the _OTA peak
> directions set_ , a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the corresponding
> _beam peak direction_ shall be achievable to within +2.2 dB and -2.2 dB of
> the claimed value.
EIRP accuracy was derived based on 3 methods outlined in sub-clause 7.2.3, TR
37.842 [4]:
1\. Impacts of accuracy on network performance,
2\. Non-AAS BS EIRP accuracy, and
3\. An estimate of the achievable accuracy by AAS BS.
Whilst much of the effort focused on the last of these the achievable accuracy
of an AAS BS and the 3 error model used to estimate this, it was not the only
basis for the final agreement.
The impact on network performance throughput is related to the wanted link
between the AAS BS and the UE and hence is covered by the EIRP requirements so
need not be considered when looking at TRP.
However, the BS class upper power limits are derived based on the interference
the BS causes in co-existence scenarios. This was not considered when
examining EIRP accuracy network performance. The upper power limits for the
medium range and local area BS classes can be found in TR 25.951 [10] and are
based on co-existence simulations with wide area networks and the macro layer
downlink outage. From these simulations and the results it can be noted that:
\- The results for the medium range output power limit were between +20 to +30
dBm with +24 dBm agreed as a compromise.
\- The results for the local area output power limit were between +37 to +39
dBm with +38 dBm agreed as a compromise.
\- Simulations in all cases did not take into account the BS output power
variation, it can be assumed that this and the antenna network gain variation
are assumed to be included as the channel and hence part of the slow fading
(10 dB lognormal for the Macro layer and 6 dB for the micro/pico layers).
Considering the range of results found when deriving the power limit and the
large variation considered in the slow fading and that the TRP accuracy to be
a value between the conducted accuracy and the EIRP accuracy which are only
0.2 dB apart, it is unlikely that network simulation will provide a meaningful
result. Hence methods 2 and 3 above were considered.
Unlike EIRP, TRP is not subject to the additional steering error caused by
phase mismatch in between transceiver units when considering TRP. As there is
no steering error, the other errors in the non AAS base station EIRP accuracy
(method 2) and the estimate of the achievable accuracy by AAS BS (method 3)
still applicable to TRP. For the latter, the TRP accuracy is expressed as:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{accuracy}}\ \ = \sqrt{\sigma_{\text{tx}}^{2} + \
\sigma_{\text{array}}^{2}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \lbrack\text{dB}\rbrack$
Hence the TRP accuracy is bounded as follows:
${\text{conducted}\ \text{power}}_{\text{accuracy}} \leq
\text{TRP}_{\text{accuracy}} \leq \ \text{EIRP}_{\text{accuracy}}$
Finally RAN4 agreed to use ±2 dB as the TRP accuracy requirement with
compromises by some vendors.
#### 5.2.3.2 Conformance requirement
The core requirement applies to any claimed power, however as the conducted
requirement no longer exists it is important that the condition of all
transceiver units operating at maximum power is defined for the conformance
condition. The TRP accuracy requirement is valid for any operational
condition, however if the condition for conformance is that all transceiver
units are operating at full power, the TRP will not vary with beam steering.
Hence it is only necessary to show conformance in a single beam direction.
#### 5.2.3.3 Extreme conditions
The only conducted transmitter requirement with an extreme requirement is
conducted output power accuracy, in sub-clause 6.2.2.2.1 of TS 37.105 [3].
> _In normal conditions, P~max,c,TABC~ shall remain within +2 dB and -2 dB of
> the configured carrier power for each TAB connector as declared by the
> manufacturer._
>
> _In extreme conditions, P~max,c,TABC~ shall remain within +2.5 dB and -2.5
> dB of the configured carrier power for each TAB connector as declared by the
> manufacturer._
>
> _In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
> also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined as normal._
For the OTA requirement set there are two out power accuracy requirements, one
based on EIRP which is also in the hybrid requirement set, and one based on
TRP.
The EIRP requirement in sub-clause 9.2.2 is currently only valid for nominal
conditions:
> _For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific beam peak
> direction associated with a beam direction pair within the EIRP accuracy
> directions set , a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the corresponding beam
> peak direction shall be achievable to within +2.2 dB and -2.2 dB of the
> claimed value._
The TRP accuracy requirement described in sub-clause 5.2.3.1 is the natural
replacement of the conducted output power accuracy as they are directly
related to each other. However the difficulty in measuring OTA at extreme
temperatures means that practically extreme temperature measurements should be
directional. This way the effect of the thermal chamber on the OTA accuracy
and calibration can be limited to certain directions, this is not possible
with a TRP measurement.
In addition any variation in TRP is included in the EIRP requirement, hence an
extreme EIRP requirement will cover the _TRP requirement_.
The EIRP accuracy requirement will therefore have the extreme temperature
requirement added to it for OTA AAS BS only.
The conducted allowance for extreme temperature is 0.5 dB, the same figure is
added to the EIRP accuracy core and conformance requirements, for example:
{width="4.198611111111111in" height="2.198611111111111in"}
Figure 5.2.3.3-1 example of EIRP accuracy core and conformance requirement, in
nominal and extreme conditions
The core requirement for EIRP accuracy for an OTA AAS BS with therefore be
±2.7 dB. There is no extreme requirement for TRP accuracy.
The existing clarification stating that "In certain regions, the minimum
requirement for normal conditions may apply also for some conditions outside
the range of conditions defined as normal" also applies to the OTA
requirement.
The EIRP accuracy requirement does not apply to the _hybrid AAS BS_.
### 5.2.4 BS class power limits
The AAS BS output power limits in existing requirements are based on the
values derived for the non-AAS BS specifications [7][8][19][20] these power
levels are specified as the rated output power per carrier at the antenna
connector, i.e. per non-AAS transceiver. In the AAS BS specification for AAS
BS with a conducted interface TS 37.105 [3] the requirement is based on both:
\- The rated system output power per carrier, P~Rated,c,sys~
\- The rated output power per _TAB connector_ , P~Rated,c,TABC~
The limit per _TAB connector_ is the same as that used in the non-AAS
specifications, the system limit is the non-AAS limit scaled by the number of
_active transceiver units_ (capped at the appropriate number for E-UTRA or
UTRA), N~TXU,counted~.
This ensures that the AAS BS does not exceed the power limit per carrier
either for the system or per transceiver unit.
The equivalent output power limit for the OTA AAS BS specification is TRP. The
AAS BS TRP is equivalent to the system output power (i.e. not the transceiver
unit output power) by the following relationship:
P~Rated,c,TRP~ = P~Rated,c,sys~ -- L~TX~
The OTA AAS BS output power limit can therefore be defined as:
P~Rated,c,TRP~ ≤ Non-AAS Power limit -- L~TX~ + 10log(_N~TXU~_)
_Where N~TXU~ is the minimum number of active transceiver units, for an OTA
AAS BS has ≥8 TRXU's for E-UTRA or ≥4 TRXU's for UTRA this number is fixed. As
both LTX and NTXU have fixed values, the values in the power limit tables do
not need to include variables and the adjusted fixed umber can be used._
For example for medium range E-UTRA
P~Rated,c,TRP~ ≤ 38 dBm -- 0 +10log(8) ≤ 47 dBm
_Hence the power limits table is as follows:_
Table 5.2.4-1: UTRA OTA AAS BS rated output power limits for BS classes

Wide Area BS (Note) Medium Range BS ≤ 44 dBm Local Area BS ≤ 30 dBm NOTE:
There is no upper limit for the P~Rated,c,TRP~ for the Wide Area Base Station.

Wide Area BS (Note) Medium Range BS ≤ 47 dBm Local Area BS ≤ 33 dBm NOTE:
There is no upper limit for the P~Rated,c,TRP~ for the Wide Area Base Station.
### 5.2.5 Control channel accuracy
#### 5.2.5.1 Background
There are a number of control channel power requirements in TS 37.105 [3]. The
requirements are intended to confirm that power accuracy of the control
channels is acceptable.
For UTRA
\- UTRA FDD primary CPICH power
\- UTRA TDD primary CCPCH power
\- UTRA FDD additional CPICH power for MIMO mode
And for E-UTRA
\- E-UTRA DL RS power
The UTRA FDD primary CPICH power, UTRA TDD primary CPICH power and the E-UTRA
DL RS power are all very similar requirements. They all confirm the accuracy
of the specified control channel is within x dB of the power indicated on the
BCH (UTRA) or DL-SCH (E-UTRA), where x is different for each requirement and
can be found in TS 37.105.
For _hybrid AAS BS_ the possibility that these signals may be transmitted over
a number of transceiver units so that the control channels could be beam
formed was considered. The requirement was modified so that the control
channel power on a group of _TAB connectors_ (those responsible for
transmitting the control channel) was compared to the power indicted on the
BCH (UTRA) or DL-SCH (E-UTRA).
The option to have a requirement per connector was also provided by using a
declared set of beam forming weights for the _TAB connector group_ and
modifying the power indicated on the BCH (UTRA) or DL-SCH (E-UTRA) by the beam
forming weight for each _TAB connector_.
The UTRA FDD addition CPICH power requirement for MIMO is slightly more
complicated (both in AAS and non-AAS requirements) as it introduces the
concept of "antenna 1", "antenna 2", "antenna 3" and "antenna 4", P-CPICH is
transmitted on "antenna 1" and S-CPICH on "antenna 2 - 3". In non-AAS each
"antenna" refers to an antenna connector, in AAS as the signals can be beam
formed by a number of transceiver units the "antenna" applies to a declared
group of _TAB connectors_. The requirement in this case is the difference
between the P-CPICH power and the S-CPICH power.
As part of the specification simplification work, it was agreed that an UTRA
OTA AAS BS would by design be capable of meeting the control channel accuracy
requirements, these requirements are hence removed for UTRA OTA AAS BS.
#### 5.2.5.2 Core requirement
The E-UTRA DL RS power requirements is an accuracy requirements with respect
to an absolute power indicted on the DL-SCH (E-UTRA).
The indicated power is provided by the BS, and clearly this is related to the
BS rated output power. For non-AAS and _hybrid AAS BS_ this power is a
conducted power (P~Rated,c~), however the OTA AAS BS does not have a conducted
interface.
It is not clear if the power indicted on the DL_SCH for the OTA is related to
the conducted power or to the OTA power, however the power indicted on the DL-
SCH is controlled by the vendor and is effectively a declared parameter. In
addition the control signal _antenna gain_ may not be the same as the user
signal beam forming gain hence it is necessary to declare the control signal
_antenna gain_ for the requirement. As both bits of information are variable
depending on the AAS BS configuration and design the requirement is that the
control signal power is within the required accuracy compared to the power
level which is intended. The power level for the conformance test is declared.
As the core requirement E-UTRA DL RS power is an absolute requirement, the OTA
accuracy requirement can be derived using the same methodology as the EIRP
accuracy requirement. The EIRP accuracy requirement allows for an additional
(non-correlated) 0.9 dB error.
Hence the control channel absolute accuracy requirement is given by:
For example for DL-RS the conduced requirement is 2.1 dB so the OTA
requirement should be:
The core requirement for the E-UTRA DL RS power can hence be worded as:
> The control channel power of each carrier shall be within dB of the
> configured control channel power.
#### 5.2.5.3 Conformance requirement
The control channel power accuracy requirement is intended to ensure that
channels within the modulated signal maintain their power accuracy
(essentially conforming that sufficient quantization is provided). The test
condition for the almost all _single direction requirements_ such as this is
that the AAS BS is operating with the highest rated power, as such all the TRX
units are operating at maximum power. In such a condition beam forming (for
both steering and beam width) are done using phase manipulation and does not
vary the accuracy of the power allocated to the control channels. Hence it is
not necessary to show conformance in more than one direction.
Conformance testing of the control channel power accuracy is done at the
reference steering direction when the system is operating at maximum power
(P~Rated,c,TRP~).
## 5.3 Output power dynamics
### 5.3.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
There are a number of output power dynamics requirements defined for AAS BS in
TS 37.105 [3], in general they are RAT specific and are as follows:
UTRA FDD output power dynamics requirements are applicable to AAS BS in single
RAT UTRA operation (TDD 1.28Mcps, or FDD) and to AAS BS in MSR operation using
UTRA:
\- UTRA inner loop power control in the downlink: Inner loop power control in
the downlink is the ability of the AAS BS to adjust the transmitted output
power of a code channel in accordance with the corresponding TPC commands
received in the uplink.
\- Power control dynamic range : The power control dynamic range is the
difference between the maximum and the minimum code domain power of a code
channel for a specified reference condition
\- Total power dynamic range: Total power dynamic range is the difference
between the maximum and the minimum output power for a specified reference
condition. The minimum power condition is modeled by using TM4 test model with
fractional power allocation condition, while the maximum power condition is
for the case of full power allocation specified by TM1.
\- UTRA FDD IPDL time mask: To support IPDL location method in UTRA FDD
operation, the AAS BS interrupts all transmitted signals in the downlink (i.e.
common and dedicated channels). The IPDL time mask specifies the limits of the
_TAB connector_ output power during these idle periods.
E-UTRA UTRA output power dynamics requirements are applicable to AAS BS in
single RAT E-UTRA operation and to AAS BS in MSR operation using E-UTRA:
\- RE Power control dynamic range: The RE power control dynamic range is the
difference between the power of an RE and the average RE power for a BS at
maximum output power (P~Rated,c,TABC~) for a specified reference condition.
\- Total power dynamic range: Total power dynamic range is the difference
between the maximum and the minimum output power for a specified reference
condition. The minimum power condition is modeled by using E-TM2/2a test model
with only one RB allocation, while the maximum power condition is for the case
of all RB's allocation (as per considered E-UTRA channel bandwidth) specified
by E-TM3.1/3.1a.
All requirements are applied per each _TAB connector_ and are differential
between 2 measured powers.
### 5.3.2 Output power dynamics OTA: Core requirement
All the power dynamics requirements are in band and are concerned with
controlling the power of modulated signals. These wanted signals are of
interest between the BS and the UE. Such requirements should be applied as
_directional requirements_ and apply to the _beam peak directions_ associated
with the _beam direction pairs_.
As all the conducted output power dynamics requirements are differential they
can be translated to OTA output power dynamics requirements with no further
modification.
### 5.3.3 Output power dynamics OTA: Conformance requirement
As all output power dynamics requirements are relative between two measured
power levels, any variation due to beam steering or beam shaping OTA is the
same for both measured power values. The results are therefore unaffected by
beam steering or beam shaping in case of OTA output power dynamics.
Hence it is only necessary to show conformance of the OTA output power
dynamics requirements in a single direction, i.e. the reference steering
direction for the narrowest (i.e. highest EIRP) beam, in a similar set up to
the EIRP accuracy test in sub-clause 5.2.2 , i.e. to configure and operate at
maximum transmit power during test. The narrowest beam can be determined based
on the manufacturer declared beams as defined in declaration D9.3, in clause
9, where the narrowest intended BeW~θ~ and BeW~ϕ~ are to be defined at the
reference beam direction.
## 5.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
### 5.4.1 Background
The TDD TX OFF power ensures that receivers of other TDD system are not
desensitized by the noise from an aggressor BS.
The TX OFF level requirement was first derived for the UTRA TDD requirement,
the rationale for the UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps TX off level is given in TR 25.942
> _Assuming the Noise Figure(NF) of BS is 7dB and Minimum Couple Loss(MCL) is
> 30dB. For the victim receiver, the Tx OFF power should not exceed the
> thermal noise. If Tx OFF power is 6dB below thermal noise, it will introduce
> 1dB degradation. The proposal for Tx OFF power is as follows:_
>
> _NOTE: In 1.28 Mcps TDD option, The noise figure of BS is assumed to be 7dB,
> it is based on that this parameter has been approved by CWTS yet and it is
> easier for implementation of BS._
For E-UTRA the power level is in 1MHz (rather than 1.28MHz) and the assumed NR
is 5dB the requirement is hence:
And for E-UTRA (specified as -85dBm/MHz)
There are a number of different receivers which can be identified as being
victims to the Tx OFF power:
\- Own receiver -- this is possible but, it is unlikely a TDD system has
separate Tx and Rx antennas so is identified by the RX sensitivity requirement
even for a conducted system.
\- Co-located receivers -- the requirement is measured for the Tx channel --
however the same noise can be expected across the whole operational band.
Other co-located receivers using other channels in the band are hence
protected.
\- Same geographical area receivers -- most co-location requirements in the
same geographical area assume a reasonable separation between BS's, hence the
isolation is assumed to be greater.
For the release 13 AAS BS requirements the TX OFF level was applied to each
_TAB connector_ as the primary purpose of the requirement is to prevent
desensitization of your own receiver. With a conducted interface the receiver
sensitivity requirement alone is not sufficient to guarantee that, this is
further documented in TR 37.842 [4].
### 5.4.2 OTA AAS BS -- Core requirement
The OTA AAS BS has both radiated minimum sensitivity and radiated reference
sensitivity requirements, hence any interference to your own receiver is fully
covered by those requirements.
TX OFF level therefore ensures that co-located BS and BS co-existing in the
same geographical area are protected. As the very low TX OFF levels cannot be
measured accurately as a TRP the co-location method is used. The OTA TX OFF
requirement is therefore specified a co-location requirement.
It is not possible to separate OTA emissions from separate transceiver units
therefore OTA emissions requirements are specified as the sum of the emissions
from all transceiver units in the AAS BS. For spurious emissions this has been
the case for both conducted and OTA emissions. The sum of the total emissions
from the AAS BS is intended to be no greater than that of a non-AAS system
with equivalent number of MIMO branches and hence emission are capped at a
level consistent with the maximum MIMO capability of the appropriate RAT (8
for E-UTRA, 4 for UTRA), however conducted TX OFF level is specified per TAB
connector and as such is not subject to the same cap. However as the conducted
requirement is primarily concerned with protection of your own receiver and
OTA is concerned with co-location the parameters have somewhat changed, this
was noted in the TR 37.842 when the conducted requirements were derived.
As a co-located TDD receiver should be offered the same protection as any
other co-located receiver it is reasonable to apply the same cap on the TX OFF
level as is applied to other unwanted emissions.
The TX OFF power level, from both polarisations, is less than:
Note: there is no requirement for UTRA TDD OTA AAS BS.
## 5.5 Transmitted signal quality
### 5.5.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in sub-clause 5.5 apply during the
transmitter(s) ON period.
### 5.5.2 Frequency error
#### 5.5.2.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The frequency error requirement is defined to capture the maximum allowable
difference between an assigned frequency and the actual generated frequency.
The frequency error requirement is a regulatory requirement in some regions.
#### 5.5.2.2 Frequency error OTA: Core requirement
In order to meet the beam forming requirements of the AAS BS specifically EIRP
accuracy, it is necessary that the _transceiver units_ generating the beam
have a known phase relationship between each other. To do this they need to be
phase locked. There are two alternative ways to achieve this:
\- The RF LO originates from a common source and is distributed to each
transceiver unit, or
\- The RF LO originates locally in each of the TRX units, where individual
PLL's use the same frequency reference, i.e. each individual RF source is
locked to a common reference frequency.
In both cases, any frequency error is correlated among all TRX units forming
the beam, hence the frequency error is coherent, has a 'flat' response in the
spatial domain, i.e. OTA frequency error does not depend on the selection of
the measurement point within beam's compliance directions set.
As the intention of the eAAS WI is to provide the same performance and
protection as the Rel-13 conducted AAS BS specification, the core requirement
for the OTA frequency error requirement is reused from conducted frequency
error requirement from TS 37.105 [3] specification, i.e. for the OTA frequency
error requirement, the same frequency error values as defined for the
conducted frequency error requirement in Rel-13 AAS BS specification is used.
Table 5.5.2.2-1: Frequency error minimum requirement
* * *
BS class Accuracy Wide Area BS ±0.05 ppm Medium Range BS ±0.1 ppm Local Area
BS ±0.1 ppm
* * *
#### 5.5.2.3 Frequency error OTA: Conformance requirement
As the frequency error is flat in the spatial domain it is only necessary to
show conformance in a single direction. The requirement needs to be defined so
that all transmitter units are active and the system is operating at the
declared maximum rated total radiated power.
For the sake of minimising the number of spatial declarations and as frequency
error testing is generally done at the same time as EVM testing the 'reference
direction' of the _OTA peak directions se_ t is the most suitable direction to
define for the conformance testing. For conformance testing purposes, the
frequency error is tested at the maximum and minimum power settings (together
with the EVM test), in order to comply with the total power dynamic range
requirement (refer to the Total power dynamic range requirement for E-UTRA in
clause 5.3).
### 5.5.3 Time Alignment Error
5.5.3.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
Timing Alignment Error (TAE) is a signal quality requirement specified for
transmit diversity, MIMO transmission and CA. TAE is defined as the largest
timing difference (i.e. error) between two reference signals, and is only
applicable for base stations transmitting from multiple antennas via transmit
diversity, MIMO, CA, or some combinations of these three. In case of NR, there
is no TX diversity transmission mode defined. As a result, no TAE tests need
to be developed for TX diversity for NR operation.
In the conducted test setup, the differences between two antenna ports is
measured, depending of the functionality of the signal analyser, TAE between
the two or more signals can be measured simultaneously. To achieve precise
measurements, the RF cables being used during the conducted test should be
equal in electrical length.
For AAS BS the number of _TAB connectors_ could be large. Therefore, a concept
for reducing number of test combinations was introduced in TS 37.105, sub-
clause 6.5.3.4 [3]. In TAE requirement for AAS BS is designed as:
> _The TAE between any two TAB connectors from different transmitter groups
> shall not exceed the specified minimum requirements below._
, where transmitter groups are associated with the _TAB connectors_ in the
transceiver unit array corresponding to TX diversity, MIMO transmission, CA,
etc.
5.5.3.2 Time Alignment Error OTA: Core requirement
For OTA TAE, the DUT is placed in an OTA test environment and is configured to
generate beams carrying reference signals (e.g. CRS0 and CRS1 in case of
E-UTRA, DMRS ports in case of NR) associated to logical antenna ports and
different transmitter groups. The OTA TAE requirement is defined as a time
difference between two radiated signals.
5.5.3.3 Time Alignment Error OTA: Conformance requirement
The conformance testing of OTA TAE can be done in an OTA test environment
similar to the one defined for radiated transmit power. In terms of testing
effort it is beneficial, to coordinate testing of OTA TAE with testing of
other transmitter parameters such as OTA frequency error and radiated transmit
power.
### 5.5.4 Modulation Quality
#### 5.5.4.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
EVM captures a maximum allowed distortion allowed due to degradations in the
BS transmitter.
For UTRA, EVM is defined as:
Where P~e~ is the power of the error signal between a perfect RRC filtered
transmitted signal without distortion and the actual transmitted signal and
P~t~ is the power of the perfect transmitted signal without distortion.
For E-UTRA, EVM has been defined slightly differently the measurement device
contains a simple equalization algorithm and the EVM is assessed after
equalization (The simple equalization algorithm accounts for the fact that
some static amplitude and phase deviations incurred in the BS transmitter is
removed at the UE receiver). The EVM result is defined as the square root of
the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed
in percent.
EVM is calculated as a root mean square average over 10 sub-frames.
For AAS BS in Rel-13 TS 37.105 [3], the MSR, E-UTRA and UTRA, EVM requirements
are retained and applied per _TAB connector_.
The conducted EVM requirement applied per _TAB connector_ needs to be
translated to an OTA requirement.
Although EVM is expressed in terms of a percentage it is a ratio of 2 powers,
that of the error vector and the reference power. As with ACLR whilst the
reference (or wanted) signal may be subjected to beam forming the error vector
power has unknown correlation level between transmitter units and hence may be
beam formed or not.
If the error vector power is correlated then the EVM is constant over the OTA
angular range, however if it is not correlated then it varies, as shown in
figure 5.5.4.1-1.
{width="3.5in" height="2.625in"}{width="3.5in" height="2.625in"}
Figure 5.5.4.1-1. 10 Element array, beam pattern and non-correlated EVM
distribution (8% EVM)
#### 5.5.4.2 Modulation Quality OTA: Core requirement
The EVM requirement however is important only between the BS and its intended
UE. Hence the EVM is only of importance in directions where the BS intends to
communicate with the UE's. It is therefore in a set of specific directions
from the AAS BS which is of interest rather than the average or total EVM over
the entire sphere. In this respect the EVM requirement is different in nature
to the ACLR requirement.
The range of directions which the AAS BS meets the EVM requirement is declared
by the manufacturer as _OTA coverage range_.
{width="5.602777777777778in" height="2.926388888888889in"}
Figure 5.5.4.2-1. Example of _OTA coverage range_ and 5 conformance points
The EVM is required to be met across the _OTA coverage range_.
#### 5.5.4.3 Modulation Quality OTA: Conformance requirement
For conformance testing the centre direction and the 4 extreme directions in θ
and ϕ of the _OTA coverage range_ , as shown in figure 5.5.4.2-1 are declared
and tested.
For conformance testing purposes, the EVM is tested at the maximum and minimum
power settings, in order to comply with the total power dynamic range
requirement (refer to the Total power dynamic range requirement for E-UTRA in
clause 5.3).
### 5.5.5 Transmit pulse shape filter
#### 5.5.5.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The transmit pulse shape filter for UTRA is defined as root-raised cosine
(RRC) filter with the assumed roll-off factor. There is no minimum requirement
directly defined for the transmit pulse shape filter in RAN4 specifications.
Furthermore, there is no conformance requirement defined for the transmit
pulse shape filter.
Transmit pulse shape filter requirement is applicable only for the AAS BS in
single RAT UTRA operation (TDD, or FDD), or for AAS BS in MSR operation using
UTRA (TDD, or FDD).
There is no transmit pulse shape filter requirement for an E-UTRA AAS BS.
#### 5.5.5.2 Transmit pulse shape filter OTA: Core requirement
For the transmit pulse shape filter OTA requirement, use the same approach as
for the conducted transmit pulse shape filter requirement, by referring to the
TS 25.104 [19] and TS 25.105 [20] specifications for UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD,
respectively.
#### 5.5.5.3 Transmit pulse shape filter OTA: Conformance requirement
No conformance requirement to be defined for the transmit pulse shape filter
OTA requirement.
## 5.6 Unwanted emissions
### 5.6.1 General
#### 5.6.1.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
In non-AAS BS, the unwanted emissions are specified in TS 25.104 [19], TS
25.105 [20], TS 36.104 [8] and TS 37.104 [7] and apply per _antenna
connector_. The AAS BS has a TRXUA consisting of many _transceiver units_
which is equal to, or potentially much higher than the number of non-AAS BS
transmitter antenna connectors in a non-AAS BS with comparable functionality.
As there is no upper limit on the number of _transceiver units_ that an AAS BS
system has, it is important to set the total unwanted emissions limits to an
amount equivalent to Rel-13 non-AAS BS.
The total unwanted emissions from the AAS BS should be no higher than the
unwanted emissions from a non-AAS BS conforming to the Rel-13 specifications
with either the same number of transmitter units as the AAS BS or a maximum of
8 transmitter units (E-UTRA) or 4 transmitter units (UTRA).
#### 5.6.1.2 OTA unwanted emissions
The Rel-13 AAS BS specification which defined a _hybrid AAS BS_ with a
conducted interface applied a scaling factor which was based on the number of
active transmitter units as counted at the _transceiver array boundary_. As
the OTA AAS BS architecture is restricted to having a minimum number of
transceiver units (8 for E-UTRA, 4 for UTRA) there is no need for a scaling
variable as a fixed scaling factor (FSF) can be used based on the RAT-specific
unwanted emissions requirements.
_In Rel-13 requirements the emissions scaling was also multiplied by the
minimum number of cells the AAS BS was declared to support (N~cells~). This is
necessary as if the system supports multiple cells at the conducted interface
it is not always possible to directly map TAB connectors to cells. With an OTA
AAS BS there is no conducted interface and requirements are applied radiated
so no such mapping knowledge is required. The complication of scaling by the
minimum number of cells therefore can also be removed as the requirement
applies OTA per cell. It should be noted that the restriction on the minimum
number of transceiver units should also apply per cell._
_The OTA AAS BS emissions limits for E-UTRA therefore are applied per cell and
are based on the basic limits used in the Rel-13 AAS BS requirements
multiplied by the FSF equal to 8 (or plus 9dB)._
_The OTA AAS BS emissions limits for UTRA therefore are applied per cell and
are based on the basic limits used in the Rel-13 AAS BS requirements
multiplied by the FSF equal to 4 (or plus 6dB)._
_Some regional regulatory requirements for unwanted emissions are expressed as
EIRP in the regulations. They implicitly assume a passive antenna. Since the
gain between passive antenna systems does not vary significantly (i.e. only by
a few dB, not 10s of dB), EIRP correlates directly to TRP in these cases._
_For MSR, requirements are applied at an antenna connector. In order to
transform the EIRP level stated in the regulations to a conducted level,
vendors make a declaration of the passive antenna gain they assume._
_In Rel-13 AAS these emissions requirements remain conducted. A declaration of
the assumed passive antenna gain to relate the EIRP to a conducted level for
the AAS is needed. It is important to note that what should be declared is the
gain of an equivalent passive system._
_OTA unwanted emissions requirements are defined as TRP. A means is needed to
relate the EIRP values in the regulation to TRP. It is important to note that
the EIRP does not correspond to the instantaneous EIRP of any beamforming
scheme in the AAS, but was set based on the assumption of a passive antenna.
In order to relate the EIRP values to OTA, a fixed assumption is made of the
gain of a passive antenna system, in order that an OTA TRP requirement can be
provided for AAS BS._
_Since EIRP per antenna_ : P~EIRP~ = P~Tx~ + G~Ant~ _with_ G~Ant~ _equal to
[17] dBi for both E-UTRA and UTRA. To interpret existing EIRP regulations to
TRP would be the follow:_
> _UTRA: OTA AAS BS emissions limits = EIRP -- [17] dBi + 6 dB_
>
> _E-UTRA: OTA AAS BS emissions limits = EIRP -- [17] dBi + 9 dB_
In the above equations directivity value should be used in above equations,
however as all antenna losses are assumed zero effective _antenna gain_ can be
used.
_Since a fixed passive gain is assumed, the TRP limits can be stated directly
as dBm numbers in the specifications._
### 5.6.2 Occupied bandwidth
#### 5.6.2.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
For UTRA and E-UTRA, if the ACLR requirements are met, then usually it is not
possible for the system to fail the occupied bandwidth requirement, however
the requirement still applies since some regulatory authorities expect an
occupied bandwidth requirement for all systems.
According to SM.328 [9] occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band
such that, below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean
powers emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. It defines the spectral properties of emission in a simple
manner. The value of β/2 is taken as 0.5%. This results in a power bandwidth
of 99%, meaning that the occupied bandwidth is a measure of the bandwidth
containing 99% of the total integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum
on the assigned channel.
#### 5.6.2.2 Occupied bandwidth OTA: Core requirement
For occupied bandwidth, the beam characteristics are not important. The
requirement should however cover the fact that all transmitter is active and
the system is operating at the maximum declared rated total radiated power.
For the OTA requirement, the same occupied bandwidth value (i.e. β/2= 0.5%) as
for the conducted occupied bandwidth requirement for Rel-13 AAS BS is to be
used.
As the occupied bandwidth is a measure of the wanted signal its performance is
flat in space and can be completely characterized as a directional requirement
or a _TRP requirement_. As performance of the wanted signal is generally
characterized on the main beam as a directional requirement the same is done
for occupied bandwidth.
Occupied bandwidth is therefore specified as a directional requirement valid
over the _OTA coverage range_.
#### 5.6.2.3 Occupied bandwidth OTA: Conformance requirement
For conformance a beam should be identified which fulfils the core conditions.
### 5.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Radio
#### 5.6.3.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean
power centred on an adjacent channel frequency, expressed in dB. ACLR is
defined for both the first adjacent channel and the second adjacent channel.
The Wide Area BS ACLR was originally derived by means of co-existence
simulations as documented in the TR 36.942 [5]. The coexistence simulations
captured DL network throughput loss due to interference from an aggressor
network in the downlink vs. so-called ACIR. ACIR incorporates power in the UE
receive band due to the transmitter unwanted emissions (ACLR) and the receiver
(ACS), and is calculated as:
(assuming linear terms)
The coexistence simulation result for ACIR was split into ACLR and ACS,
resulting in for wide area BS ACLR of 45dB and a UE ACS of 33dB.
An AAS BS may consist of multiple transmitters that perform beamforming. If
the adjacent channel interference is not necessarily beam formed in the same
manner as the wanted channel, hence ACLR may vary in space. Before setting a
conducted requirement in the Release 13 AAS BS specification TS 37.105 [3],
further co-existence simulations were performed in the AAS SI TR 37.840 [6]
and AAS WI TR 37.842 [4]. These simulations revealed that it is the total
power and not the spatial distribution of unwanted emissions (i.e. the
correlation of adjacent channel noise between transmitter units) that impacts
co-existence KPIs. Hence an ACLR based on total wanted channel and adjacent
channel power was defined at _TAB connectors_.
In addition to the ACLR ratio of 45 dB, an absolute level of adjacent channel
emissions is defined. The base station fulfils whichever is the less stringent
of the ACLR ratio or the absolute level. The definition of an absolute level
avoids specifying unnecessarily low levels on any BS that operate with a low
wanted carrier transmit power. For wide area BS, the absolute level is defined
in TS 37.104 [7] as either -13 dBm/MHz for category A, or -15dBm/MHz for
category B emissions requirements, relating to regulatory frameworks.
In the AAS BS specification TS 37.105 [3] the ACLR requirement is set on the
ratio of the total wanted signal power at all _TAB connectors_ to the total
power at all connectors of adjacent channel power. For the absolute
requirement, the non-AAS requirement forms a _basic limit_ , which is scaled
up to an AAS BS requirement according to the number of _active transceiver
units,_ up to a maximum 8 times for E-UTRA (4 for UTRA), in the same manner as
the scaling applied to other unwanted emissions requirements.
For medium range BS and local area BS, the ACLR requirement of 45 dB was
retained in TS 37.104 [7] without any further simulation investigations. For
TS 37.105 [3], the 45 dB ACLR was also retained for the other base station
classes.
In the non-AAS specifications, the absolute limits for adjacent channel
emissions are adjusted for the medium range and local area BS classes. For the
local area BS class, the absolute limit are adjusted to -32 dBm/MHz. The limit
of ‑32 dBm/MHz corresponds to an ACLR of roughly 45 dB for a local area BS
with a 10 MHz carrier operating at the maximum permitted output power. For the
medium range BS, the absolute limit are also adjusted. The absolute limit is
set to -25 dBm/MHz. This again roughly corresponds to an ACLR of 45 dB for a
medium range BS transmitting a 10MHz carrier near to maximum allowable output
power, and also matches to the WCDMA SEM.
The absolute unwanted emissions requirements for medium range BS and local
area BS were also used as _basic limits_ in TS 37.105 [3], with the scaling
mechanism applying in the same way as for wide area BS.
In addition to ACLR, a requirement on so-called Cumulative ACLR (CACLR) is
applied for multicarrier and multiband BS. The CACLR requirement considers
adjacent channel emissions falling onto a carrier that is adjacent to 2 active
carriers; one at a lower frequency offset and one a higher frequency offset.
The CACLR requirement is also 45 dB.
The CACLR requirements also apply in TS 37.105 [3] in the same manner as ACLR.
#### 5.6.3.2 ACLR OTA: Core requirement
Based on the findings of the simulation work done in TR 37.842 [4] the effect
of adjacent channel interference on the throughput of adjacent networks is
dependent on the total radiated adjacent channel power rather than the power
in the main beam.
As the number of active transceiver units generating the beam and the
coherence level of the adjacent channel noise from each active transceiver
unit is unknown it is not possible to derive a relationship between the ACLR
of a single point in the centre of the main beam (i.e. as ratio of 2 EIRP
values) and the ACLR of the total radiated power.
The ACLR requirement is hence based on a ratio of the total radiated filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the total radiated
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency:
.
The OTA ACLR requirement can be derived as:
OTA ACLR limit = Conducted ACLR limit + 10*log~10~(FSF)
Where:
\- Conducted ACLR limit: the AAS limit as defined in TS 37.105 [3]
specification,
\- FSF: Fixed Scaling Factors for the OTA AAS BS. For UTRA the FSF = 4, for
E-UTRA the FSF = 8,
Therefore the resulting OTA ACLR limit can be derived as:
\- UTRA: OTA ACLR limit = Conducted ACLR limit + 6 dB
\- E-UTRA: OTA ACLR limit = Conducted ACLR limit + 9 dB
#### 5.6.3.3 ACLR OTA: Conformance requirement
In order that the requirement is measurable the total radiated power may be
defined as the sum of the EIRP on a grid of discrete directions around the
sphere.The ACLR is calculated as described in sub-clause 10.8.
To properly capture the EIRP, two orthogonal polarizations must be summed
together.
The points required for conformance of the ACLR OTA being defined as the _TRP
requirement_ is subject to the TRP sampling grid discussion in sub-clause
10.8.
### 5.6.4 Spectrum emission mask
#### 5.6.4.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
Based on the conducted spectrum emission mask (SEM) requirement specified in
TS 37.105 [3] for single RAT UTRA operation, the SEM limits are defined based
on the _basic limit_ definition over the frequency range starting with the
carrier frequency offset of 2.5 MHz up to the ∆f~max~ as defined in TS 37.105
[3].
There is no spectrum emission mask requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT
E-UTRA operation_ , nor for AAS BS in _MSR operation_ using E-UTRA.
#### 5.6.4.2 Spectrum emission mask OTA: Core requirement
The metric used to capture SEM OTA is TRP.
The spectrum emission mask level for the OTA requirement can be derived as:
OTA SEM limit = Conducted SEM limit ~­~ + 10*log~10~(FSF)
Where:
\- Conducted SEM limit: the AAS limit as defined in TS 37.105 [3]
specification,
\- FSF: Fixed Scaling Factors for the OTA AAS BS. For UTRA the FSF = 4,
Therefore the resulting OTA SEM limit can be derived as:
OTA SEM limit = Conducted SEM limit + 6 dB
#### 5.6.4.3 Spectrum emission mask OTA: Conformance requirement
Using TRP as a figure of merit to provide equivalent OTA SEM performance and
protection to that of the existing conducted requirement, the conducted
requirements can be adopted by translating the test procedure and requirement
from TS 37.145-1 [23], sub clause 6.6.4 into the spatial domain. The TRP
assessment grids and methods are described in sub-clause 10.8.
The points required for conformance of the SEM OTA being defined as the _TRP
requirement_ is subject to the TRP sampling grid discussion in sub-clause
10.8.
### 5.6.5 Operating band unwanted emission
#### 5.6.5.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
Based on the conducted operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) requirement
specified in TS 37.105 [3] for single RAT E-UTRA or for MSR operation, the
OBUE limits are defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of each
supported downlink operating band to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of each
supported downlink operating band.
There is no operating band unwanted emission requirement for a single RAT UTRA
FDD AAS BS, single RAT UTRA TDD AAS BS, nor MSR AAS BS operating in UTRA (FDD
or TDD).
#### 5.6.5.2 Operating band unwanted emission OTA: Core requirement
The operating band unwanted emissions level for the OTA requirement can be
derived as:
OTA OBUE limit = Conducted OBUE limit
, where conducted OBUE limit is the AAS limit as defined in TS 37.105 [3]
specification.
Based on the discussion on the boundary between in-band and out of band region
for NR FR1 operation, the Δf~UEM~ values for the boundary between OBUE and TX
spurious emissions were agreed for AAS BS as presented in table 5.6.5.2-1.
Those Δf~UEM~ values are applicable to conducted and radiated requirements for
AAS BS in single RAT E‑UTRA operation and to AAS BS in MSR operation using
E-UTRA, and are applicable for all E-UTRA operating bands defined in TS 36.104
[7].

##### 6.2.2.3.2 OTA reference sensitivity

following five directions.

The manufacturer declares the five directions for conformance testing.
The measured EIS should be less than or equal to the EIS~REFSENS~ + Test
Tolerance value.
#### 6.2.2.4 Extreme conditions
The exiting core conducted requirements in TS 37.105 [3] do not explicitly
identify an extreme conditions receiver requirement, however in the
conformance requirement TS 37.145 [24, 25] conducted reference sensitivity has
a conformance requirement over the extreme conditions. The same is true for
the 25, 36 and 37 series non-AAS requirements.
It is not cleat the reason why the core requirement is not captured, however
to keep the specifications as similar is possible the same approach is used in
the OTA part of the AAS specification.
Extreme temperature requirements for sensitivity could be applied to either
OTA sensitivity or to OTA REFSENS, however as OTA REFSENS is intended
primarily as the reference performance level for the interference requirements
and it is larger or equal to the OTA sensitivity level, the extreme
requirements are best applied to OTA sensitivity rather than OAT REFSENS. By
passing OTA sensitivity requirements the extreme performance of OTA REFSENS is
also demonstrated.
As there may be multiple OSDD's declared for OTA sensitivity (OTA REFSENS has
a single OTA EFSENS RoAoA) and hence a greater number of conformance
directions. Extreme condition conformance directions should be minimised and
restricted to reference directions only.
## 6.3 Dynamic range
### 6.3.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The dynamic range requirement is related to the maximum co-channel input power
than the receiver is expected to experience during operation. The receiver is
exposed to a wanted signal and an interfering signal. The interfering level is
set at around 20 dB above the receiver noise floor (assuming 5 dB NF in the
receiver) and represents an estimated inter-cell interference scenario in an
interference limited uplink (that was derived through simulations). The wanted
signal level is set to a level at which 95% throughput is obtainable for a
16QAM based FRC. In effect, the RF level is that expected when the receiver is
achieving a high SINR despite a large interference level.
Part of the design of the requirement involves deciding on an estimate for a
worst-case level of inter-cell interference that is experienced by the BS
receiver. The existing simulations of inter-cell interference performed for
the existing requirement are based on a fixed passive BS antenna.
### 6.3.2 Core requirement: Receiver dynamic range
Under the assumption that there is no spatial rejection of the interference,
in order to provide a reasonable conformance test, it was agreed that the
requirement assumes that the wanted signal and interfering signal come from
the same direction.
It is important to consider with this requirement that both wanted signal and
AWGN interferer is transmitted from the test equipment during the OTA test.
Since the AWGN interferer is much higher than the receiver noise floor, the
AWGN interferer dominates the SINR. Both RF and in baseband provides the same
combining gain for both the wanted signal and the AWGN, since both are co-
channel and come from the same direction.
Thus, there is no impact of combining gain to the requirement. For this
reason, a 2-level requirement, such as is discussed for the receiver in band
blocking requirement is not necessary for receiver dynamic range.
As the wanted signal and the AWGN interferer are both above the receiver noise
floor the core requirement is based on OTA REFSENS assumptions and both the
wanted and interferer conducted power levels are offset by Δ~REFSENS~.
### 6.3.3 Conformance requirement: Receiver dynamic range
Testing is defined in the _receiver target reference direction_. The wanted
signal and interfering signal are both aligned in space.
## 6.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
### 6.4.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The in band receiver blocking requirement captures minimum requirements on
several aspects of receiver behaviour. The conducted in band blocking
requirement is based upon placing a high power interferer within the band on
another carrier to a wanted signal. The Several types of interferer and
several frequency relationships are defined in different blocking tests.
{width="4.897222222222222in" height="2.9923611111111112in"}
Figure 6.4.1-1 Example of an RX blocking requirement
The basic principle of the blocking test is that when the blocker is applied,
a throughput target on the wanted signal should continue to be achieved. The
wanted signal is set at 6 dB above reference sensitivity with the same RMC as
for reference sensitivity. Thus in principle distortion arising from the
blocker is allowed to desensitize a receiver operating at exactly reference
sensitivity by around 6 dB.
It should be noted that the wanted signal level is set with respect to
reference sensitivity, which is a minimum requirement and not the actual
sensitivity level of the receiver, which may be lower.
Two signal levels are required for the blocking requirement; the blocker
interferer level and the wanted signal level. To derive the blocker interferer
level for wide area BS, uplink system level simulations were performed as
documented in the TR 36.942 [5]. The blocker interferer level was decided
partially by considering the 99.99^th^ percentile of RX power observed from a
non co-located aggressor LTE system on a victim system but mainly based on the
UE transmit power and MCL. Later on, the AAS SI in 37.840 [6] investigated the
dependency of the conducted blocker interferer level on antenna architecture
and concluded that for the investigated array types, the conducted blocker
interferer level was similar both for a receiver attached to a passive array
and one attached to an individual antenna element. Based on this, in 37.105
[3] a per _TAB connector_ conducted blocking interferer level is defined that
is the same as the blocker interferer level defined in 37.104 [7].
For UTRA single RAT, blocker interferer levels were derived using system level
simulations for the medium range and local area BS classes [10]. Higher
blocker interferer levels are defined that for the wide area scenario. The
wanted signal level is kept at 6dB above the reference sensitivity.
For E-UTRA single RAT, the blocker interferer level for the local area BS
class was derived from system level simulations [12], and the wanted signal
set at 6 dB above reference sensitivity. For the medium range BS class, the
wanted signal was set at 6 dB above reference sensitivity, whilst the blocker
interferer level was adjusted such that the difference between the blocker
interferer level and the wanted signal level is equalized between E-UTRA wide
area and medium range (The adjustment is needed because the reference
sensitivity level differs between the two classes) [11].
Comparing UTRA and E-UTRA single RAT blocking requirements, there are
differences in the blocker interferer levels (UTRA being larger). For MSR,
there is a need for a single set of in band blocking requirements. To achieve
this, the UTRA blocker interferer levels, which are more stringent than the
E-UTRA were used for the MSR blocking requirement. However the difference
between the blocker interferer level and the wanted signal level needed for
the wide area BS class to pass blocking is also maintained for the other BS
classes. To achieve this, the offset of the wanted signal from the reference
sensitivity is adjusted and different to 6 dB for E-UTRA. Also the UTRA wanted
signal levels are adjusted to keep a common difference between the blocker
interferer level and the wanted signal level.
### 6.4.2 In-band selectivity and blocking: Core requirement
The conducted blocking level simulations assumptions use 3 UE's in the
interfering network, the interferer level recorded for the statistical
analysis is the total of all 3 interfering UE's. When translating this to an
OTA requirement where the direction of the interferer also needs to be
specified this can cause an added complication.
Directional information is distorted within the existing coexistence
simulation framework due to the fact that multipath propagation is
approximated as lognormal shadow fading. Whereas in the real world, several
multipaths arrive from different directions in to the antenna, in the
simulation the signal arrives from the line of sight direction, but a random
fading margin is added. Nonetheless, coarse observations on likely locations
of blocking UEs can be considered. Thus, using the same simulation parameters
as the conducted blocking simulation but recording the data on the power level
and location of the UE's which defined the 99.99% point it was however found
that the total power is dominated by a single UE.
{width="5.2131944444444445in" height="3.9194444444444443in"}
Figure 6.4.2-1.Sample of 99.99% Blocking interference level and individual UE
power
Therefore only a single interference direction is required to represent the
99.99% blocking case.
The same 99.99% blocking UE's were investigated to see if they came from a
predictable direction.
{width="4.7131944444444445in" height="3.5368055555555555in"}
Figure 6.4.2-2 99.99% Blocking interfering UE location
The 99.99% UE's direction was found in both azimuth and elevation to be
approximately within the element beam width. Whether this is true when
multipath propagation is considered is not clear from this type of simulation.
The simulation does not take into account the wanted signal and so it is not
possible to find the direction of the wanted signal by the same analysis. It
was judged to be feasible however to make a worst case assumption that the
wanted UE and the aggressor UE are in the same direction. The assumption may
have caused some over dimensioning of the blocking requirement, since the
probability of the wanted signal and blocker arriving in the same direction is
not 100%, but the potential over dimensioning is seen as acceptable for
E-UTRA/UTRA requirements.
In sub-clause 6.2.2.2.2 the OTA reference sensitivity has been defined, this
is based on the OTA REFSENS RoAoA which represents the average element/sub-
array _radiation pattern_ beam width and is intended to be the OTA equivalent
of the conducted reference sensitivity. As such it provides a suitable basis
for the OTA wanted signal power level when considering the maximum
interference level at the input of each receiver unit.
As the wanted signal and the interferer are in the same location for the
purpose of the requirement, and the purpose of the OTA requirements is to
offer the same protection and performance as the conducted requirements the
difference between the wanted signal and the interfering signal should be
maintained. The conducted blocking interferer level can hence be translated to
an OTA level using the same method:
Where:
\- P~Conducted_blocker~ is the conducted blocking interferer level is rel13
\- P~REFSENS~, D~0\ ,~ D~off-peak~, and D~RX_OTA+MARGIN~ are the same as
defined in sub-clause 6.2.2.2.2.
Or more simply
So
As OTA reference sensitivity and the OTA blocker level are both translated to
OTA levels using the same method they retain the same difference and hence the
requirement on the receiver unit hardware is similar to the existing conducted
specification.
D~0~ is based on the OTA REFSENS RoAoA which is based on the element/sub array
pattern as such is the minimum possible _antenna gain_ for the AAS BS. The
blocker interfere level is hence the largest level possible. This ensures that
the linearity of the receiver for high signal levels at each of the receiver
unit inputs.
However as the conducted requirements are per receiver unit and the OTA level
is for the composite receive function the OTA REFSENS value does not include
all of the beam forming gain the composite antenna provides. As such the
receiver minimum sensitivity as not accuracy represented by the OTA REFSENS
value.
When considering the conducted blocking requirement the receiver noise
contributes to the receiver performance under blocking conditions as such the
interference contribution due to the blocking interferer is only 4.7 dB rather
than 6 dB. When only the element gain is considered the lower _antenna gain_
results in higher blocker and wanted signal levels and the noise floor does
not contribute significantly to the noise floor so the interference
contribution due to the blocking interferer may be the full 6 dB.
For example consider an element of 65° by 65°, in a 10x1 array (0.9λ spacing)
with the lowest declared EIS of -116 dBm.
For E-UTRA wide area
For the OTA REFSENS as a wanted power:
For the minSENS case:
As in both cases the system noise floor for the wanted signal is the same and
is based on the composite receiver gain (i.e. -117dBm in this example), for
the minimum gain case the interference contribution due to the blocking
interferer may be:
or a contribution of 4.7dB
For the OTA REFSENS case the interference contribution due to the blocking
interferer may be
or a contribution of 5.9dB
Although the OTA REFSENS case has a higher interferer level it may also
generate a higher contribution of interference, hence it is difficult to
define an absolute worst case as the 2 conditions cover 2 different cases:
\- OTA REFSENS covers the maximum interference level at the RX unit input
\- minSENS covers the case where the effect of the system noise figure is
considered.
It is important to bear in mind that the ratio of wanted signal level to
blocking level is related to the probability of users and RX power levels
occurring in adjacent networks. The probabilities of the signal levels do not
change as a result of BS architecture, and thus changing the blocking to
wanted signal level would lead to a change in the blocking probability
provided by the network.
As both these cases are important the OTA blocking requirement is set at 2
levels, in both cases the delta between the wanted signal and the blocking
interferer (Δ~wanted-blocker~) is the same as the difference between the two
in the conducted requirement (e.g. 52.5 dB for wide area E-UTRA). This delta
value is then applied at 2 OTA wanted signal EIS levels
1\. EIS~REFSENS~ + 6 dB
2\. minSENS + 6 dB
### 6.4.3 In-band selectivity and blocking: Conformance requirement
The OTA blocking requirement is tested as follows:
\- In the reference direction of the minSENS OSDD using the minSENS based
requirement level
\- In each of the 4 conformance directions at the extremities of the OTA
REFSENS RoAoA using the REFSENS based requirement level.
## 6.5 Out-of-band blocking
### 6.5.1 Background
The existing conducted out of band blocking requirement is based on a wanted
signal level at PREFSENS + 6 dB, and a CW interfere at -15 dBm. It is valid
from 1 MHz to 12.75 GHz excluding the operating band plus a guard (usually 20
MHz either side).
The original derivation of the -15 dBm level was done for the first release of
the UTRA specification. The level of -15 dBm is based on analysis done on
interference from a number of systems which are close in frequency to the 3GPP
bands, notable other 3GPP bands in particular the TDD band 2010 to 2025 MHz
and 2400 MHz ISM bands. In both cases the level of -15 dBm was derived by
considering the interferer power level, the MCL and assuming that the BS
antenna has the same gain for wanted and interfere signals. In some cases the
figures were calculated for the UE and then applied to the BS at the same
level.
The simple calculations were as follows:
TDD band 2010 to 2025 MHz: BS to UE case 43 dBm - 60 = -17 dBm
WLAN: max emitted power = 30 dBm, requirement approx. -15 dBm
Based on the available documented information, no consideration was taken for
systems operating at vastly different frequencies from the operating band. For
a conducted requirement for a single transceiver it is reasonable to apply the
same requirement level across the whole out of band spectrum as it likely the
requirement is toughest close to the operational band.
### 6.5.2 Out-of-band blocking OTA core requirement
#### 6.5.2.1 Interferer level
There are a number of considerations which make translating the conducted
requirement to an OTA requirement challenging:
\- The gain characteristics of an antenna is not known in the out-of-band
frequency region.
\- The free space path-loss at high frequencies (i.e. up to 12.75 GHz) means
that the radiated power levels required to provide -15 dBm at conducted point
are unfeasibly high.
Clearly the interferers are present irrespective of the victim _antenna gain_
, the original levels assumed that the victim _antenna gain_ was the same as
the in band gain, but no analysis was done at very high (or low) frequencies.
This was acceptable considering the conducted requirement in previous
specifications and the fact it is difficult to estimate out of band _antenna
gain_.
However, with the out-of-band blocking OTA requirement it is not necessary to
estimate out-of-band _antenna gain_ so instead another approach can be
considered.
For the purposes of the OTA requirement it is useful to consider that the
interferer power level is specified at a fixed distance from the AAS BS. This
distance does not have to be representative of either the actual minimum
distance of the interferer source or be at the same power level (of the
interferer). The distance and the level can be adjusted to ensure the
requirement presents a worst case requirement for the worst case interferer
levels.
For frequencies outside the operating band for which the antenna is designed
for the exact _antenna gain_ is unknown, however the victim antenna aperture
area is constant over the whole frequency range 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz.
In general, the power gain of an antenna is defined as:
, where A~eff~ is the effective antenna area in m^2^ and λ is the wavelength
in m.
Free space path loss for a given distance is calculated by
, where d is the distance in meters.
The resultant of the _antenna gain_ and the path loss is given by:
means that electromagnetic radiation does not depend on frequency. In practice
the antenna aperture A~eff~ is not constant over frequency, as antennas in
general antennas are frequency tuned devices. But here it is reasonable to
assume a worst-case scenario where the antenna aperture is constant. Hence it
can be noted that the wavelength dependency of the path loss and the _antenna
gain_ cancel each out so that the worst-case for a fixed interferer power at a
fixed distance results in a fixed equivalent conducted level.
Therefore the interferer power level (EIRP) can be determined at an arbitrary
distance of 30m.
The assumed distance however it does not indicate that the conformance testing
is done at 30m. The distance and power level may be adjusted considering the
variation in FSPL and characteristics of the test facility.
Analysis shows that the worst-case interferers are other 3GPP BS and WLAN
systems
For BS to BS the OTA interference power level is given by the co-existence
scenario at 288m as:
EIRP = P~tx~ + G~tx~ = 43 dBm + 13 dBi - 6dB = 50 dBm, assuming 6 dB due to
down-tilt.
The WLAN interference can be calculated based on BS to UE minimum distance and
the WLAN Tx power, WLAN is specified in EIRP rather than total power, the
value is 30 dB EIRP hence the interference power level can be calculated as 30
dBm (EIRP) at a distance of 42 m.
The historic analysis of the worst-case blocking does not provide the
conducted interferer level currently in the specification.
i.e.
P~rx~ = Pout + G~ant_agressor~ -- L~DT~ -- FSPL + G~ant_victim~ - L~DT~ =
43dBm + 13dBi - 3dB - 87.65dB + 13dBi -- 3dB = -24.65dBm
It could be argued that the existing conducted requirement is to high however,
the conducted interferer blocking level of -15dB is more reasonable when it is
considered that the _antenna gain_ assumptions are low. Assuming an antenna
again of 17dBi is a more reasonable antenna again assumption.
i.e.
P~rx~ = Pout + G~ant_agressor~ -- L~DT~ -- FSPL + G~ant_victim~ - L~DT~ =
43dBm + 17dBi - 3dB - 87.65dB + 17dBi -- 3dB = -16.65dBm
Using these assumptions as a basis for the OTA requirement gives:
EIRP(30m) = P~rx~ -- Gant + FSPL(30m) = -15dBm -- 17dBi + 68dB(frequency=2
GHz, FSPL 30m) = 36dBm
The interferer EIRP level is hence specified as EIRP = 36dBm at 30m.
Polarization between the interferer and the AAS BS need to be taken into
account. As a pragmatic approach, at frequencies at several gigahertz away
from the wanted signal polarization matching may be difficult to achieve.
However, polarization alignment where consideration of the physical AAS BS
orientation and the interferer antenna polarization aligned need to be
handled. One approach is the requirement and test should use polarization
matching in band and keep the same alignment even when performing the OOB
measurement, even though the antenna may become detuned at the out of band
frequency.
To take into account both polarizations of the AAS BS need to be excited
equally, as the interferer is CW only a single polarization can be radiated
hence the polarization of the interferer signal is split between the cross
polarized victim antennas and therefore the input power needs to be doubled.
The interferer signal level at the aggressor can be converted to a RMS field-
strength level at the victim base station as:
in V/m, where EIRP is in W and r is the distance in m.
The aggressor interferer level described as EIRP=36 dBm at a distance of 30m
corresponds to a RMS field-strength level of 0.36 V/m. Using field-strength
the interferer level the RF core requirement can be described at the base
station, without assumptions related to the aggressor.
#### 6.5.2.2 Wanted signal level and direction
As with the in-band blocking requirements whist during operational conditions
it is unlikely that the wanted signal and the interferer are in the same
direction for the purposes of defining the RF requirement they can be
considered to be in the same direction.
The impact of the blocking interfere on the system sensitivity is largest when
the wanted signal is at its lowest level. The wanted signal is therefore
defined at minSENS + 6 dB.
For practical purposes the OTA wanted signal level is only specified within
the declared RoAoA, the direction of the RoAoA coincides with the direction of
the antenna maximum gain, this can be assumed to apply for out of band
performance as well as in band performance. The out of band blocking
requirements are hence only specified over the receiver RoAoA associated with
minSENS.
The wanted signal levels apply to all supported polarizations, under the
assumption of polarization matching.
#### 6.5.2.3 Out of band region
The out of band requirement is applicable in the frequency range described in
clause 6.5.2.4, with the exception of the frequency range covered by the
operating band plus/minus an additional Δf~OBUE~ MHz on either side. Based on
the discussion on the boundary between in-band and out of band region for NR
FR1 operation, the Δf~OBUE~ values for the out of band blocking were agreed
for AAS BS as presented in table 6.5.2.3-1. Those Δf~OBUE~ values are
applicable to conducted and radiated requirements for AAS BS in single RAT
E‑UTRA operation and to AAS BS in MSR operation using E-UTRA, and are
applicable for all E‑UTRA operating bands defined in TS 36.104 [7].
Table 6.5.2.3-1: Δf~OBUE~ values the out of band blocking

* * *
Δf~OBUE~ Operating band \<100 MHz 20 MHz 100 MHz ≦ Operating band ≦ 200 MHz 60
MHz
#### 6.5.2.4 Frequency range
The frequency range for the OTA out of band blocking requirement is 30MHz to
12.75GHz (excluding the operating band plus/minus Δf~OBUE~ as described in
clause 6.5.2.3). The lower limit of the frequency range is adjusted from 1MHz
for the conducted requirement to 30MHz in order to be consistent with the out
of band spurious emissions requirement, and considering that measurement at
frequencies below 30MHz becomes unfeasible due to the large required chamber
size.
### 6.5.3 Out-of-band blocking OTA conformance requirement
Out of band blocking is a long test and hence it is optimum to minimize the
number of conformance test directions. Even though the _antenna gain_ is not
necessarily maximum at the reference direction above the 2^nd^ harmonic of the
designed antenna element center frequency, the practical measurement becomes
excessively complex if wanted and interferer signals would be applied from
different directions at different frequencies. Therefore it is considered
sufficient to show conformance at the reference direction only.
It has been recognized that above 2^nd^ harmonic frequency the antenna element
response may be stronger in some other direction than in the reference
direction. This means that there is a risk that testing in reference direction
does not necessarily test the worst case, at least for some antenna types.
Increasing the interferer level was considered to compensate for this effect.
However, defining the breakpoint frequency and change in interferer level in a
way which would treat different antenna implementations equally was not deemed
feasible. Therefore, it was decided to apply a constant interferer level
according to the core specification throughout the whole tested frequency
range.
## 6.6 Receiver spurious emissions
### 6.6.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
Referring to the TS 37.105 [3], the RX spurious emissions power is defined as
power of emissions generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at
the _TAB connector_. The RX spurious emissions test purpose is to verify the
ability of the AAS BS to limit the interference caused by receiver spurious
emissions to other systems. Number of constraints are applicable for the RX
spurious requirement depending on the _TAB connectors_ capabilities:
1\. The requirements apply to all AAS BS with separate RX and TX _TAB
connectors_. In this case for FDD AAS BS the test is performed when both TX
and RX are ON, with the TX _TAB connector_ terminated,
2\. For a _TAB connector_ supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements
apply during the _transmitter OFF period_ ,
3\. For a _TAB connector_ supporting both RX and TX in FDD, the receiver
spurious requirements are superseded by the TX spurious requirements.
Based on the above limitations, it can be observed that the conducted RX
spurious emissions requirement applicability is limited to the following
cases:
1\. TDD case: applicable for RX _TAB connectors_ and TX/RX _TAB connectors_ ,
during TX OFF period,
2\. FDD case: applicable for RX _TAB connectors_ , during TX ON period, when
TX _TAB connectors_ are terminated.
According to TS 37.105, the RX spurious emission limits for AAS BS apply in
the frequency range from 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, with consideration of the RAT-
specific frequency exclusions for the OBUE/SEM, as well as the spurious range
upper frequency limit extensions for selected operating bands, as defined in
sub-clause 5.6.6.1 for the TX spurious emissions requirement.
In terms of emission levels, the _basic limit_ s and its scaling was also
applied to the RX spurious emissions, similar to the TX spurious emissions.
### 6.6.2 Receiver spurious emissions OTA: Core requirement
The metric used to capture the receiver spurious emissions OTA is TRP, defined
in the same way as for the transmitter spurious emissions OTA, in sub-clause
5.6.6.2.
The receiver spurious emission requirement is subject to the following
limitations:
1\. For OTA AAS BS operating in FDD: OTA RX spurious emissions requirement do
not apply to FDD duplex as being superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions
requirement. This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions cannot
be distinguished in OTA domain.
NOTE: The OTA receiver spurious emission requirement applicability for the AAS
BS with the RX-only capabilities is FFS.
2\. For OTA AAS BS operating in TDD: the OTA receiver spurious emissions
requirement applies during the _transmitter OFF period_ only.
The core requirement for the RX spurious emissions OTA is applied over the
same spurious range as defined for the conducted RX spurious requirement in
sub-clause 6.6.1.
Derivation of the emission levels for the OTA RX spurious emissions
requirement is aligned with the methodology used for the derivation of TX
spurious emission levels with the emissions limit, as captured in sub-clause
5.6.6.2.
### 6.6.3 Receiver spurious emissions OTA: Conformance requirement
In general, derivation of the OTA conformance requirement for the RX spurious
emissions, uses the same principles as for the TX spurious emissions
requirement OTA, as in sub-clause 5.6.6.3.
Definition of the emissions measurements for the conformance requirement is be
based on the core requirement, subject to the TRP MU, where the MU definition
should capture the whole spurious frequency range.
NOTE: The OTA RX spurious emission requirement for the AAS BS with the RX-only
capabilities is FFS.
For OTA AAS BS operating in TDD: applicability the OTA RX spurious emissions
conformance requirement when all transmitters are OFF, is FFS.
{editors note: to be completed as part of conformance work}
## 6.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The receiver intermodulation requirement relates to the ability of the
receiver to avoid mixing (i.e. intermodulation) between 2 strong interferers
leading to a significant noise floor rise in the receiver.
A scenario in which IM would arise would be one in which two UEs/transmitters
from two interfering systems provide strong enough interference to the base
station simultaneously. The interferer levels have been set to be the same in
the EUTRA requirement for simplicity reasons; it is not necessarily the case
that the interferer levels would be the same in real conditions. Neither is
equal interferer levels necessarily the worst case.
### 6.7.2 Receiver intermodulation: Core requirement
Differing antenna architectures could have an impact to RX IM scenarios.
However, simulation based investigation would be a highly complex and
multidimensional problem for which there was insufficient time within the WI.
Fortunately, several factors can be considered which to some extent mitigate
the need for such an investigation:
\- It may be assumed that the two interfering systems are statistically
independent
\- If it is also assumed that the two interfering systems operate the same RAT
in the same deployment scenario (but on different frequencies), then their
interference characteristics would be identical
\- For the blocking requirement, an assumption has been made that the
conducted blocking level does not depend on the antenna element or module
pattern. If the same assumption should be true for each of the interfering
systems for RX intermodulation
\- The RX IM levels should be lower than the blocking level, since the
probability of two interferers both having a high level simultaneously is
lower than the probability of only one interferer having a high level
\- The justification in terms of simplification in assuming equal levels for
the conducted requirements can be re-applied for OTA requirements
Taking these factors into account, the OTA RX IM requirement is defined based
on the conducted RX IM requirement, with the conducted signal levels
translated to OTA levels. Considering in particular the reasoning that the
independent conducted levels should not depend on antenna element or module
pattern, then a similar approach is adopted for receiver intermodulation as
for receiver blocking; i.e. apply the requirement assuming all signals come
from the same direction.
Since RX intermodulation relates to receiver non-linearity's, it is important
that the correct absolute conducted level is achieved by the OTA requirement
for the receiver intermodulation. This is achieved by using the gain estimated
from the OTA REFSENS RoAoA.
For the receiver blocking test, the requirement is also applied at lower
absolute signal levels relating to the OTA minimum sensitivity. For RX IM, the
signal levels are reduced then the IM effects are likely to reduce due to the
LNA operating well within its linearity region. However in order to be
consistent with the in band blocking requirement, RX IM is also at both OTA
REFSENS and minSENS levels.
### 6.7.3 Receiver intermodulation: Conformance requirement
Since RX sensitivity and blocking already test at all conformance directions,
it is sufficient to test RX IM only in a single direction.
## 6.8 In-channel selectivity
### 6.8.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
The in-channel selectivity requirement relates to the ability of the receiver
to receive a low power signal whilst receiving a high-power signal in channel.
The selectivity is around 20 dB in 36.104 [8]; this happens to be roughly
equal to the SINR range of the demodulation requirements.
### 6.8.2 In-channel selectivity: Core requirement
For setting the requirement, the same ICS as for the conducted requirements is
assumed.
In regard to how to set the absolute levels it is worthwhile to consider that
aspects of the receiver design that impact the selectivity include linearity,
ADC range, phase noise, frequency error and others. The applicable aspects of
receiver design divides into those which become of significance at high
absolute power level and those that do not (e.g. phase noise). Other
requirements, such as receiver blocking and dynamic range already capture the
behavior of the receiver at high power level. It is important that the
selectivity is achieved after combining. Thus, the most important receiver
level to consider for this requirement is the level based on OTA minimum
sensitivity.
Thus the receiver ICS requirement is specified at minimum sensitivity level:
\- Wanted signal level = Conducted wanted signal level + Δ~minSENS~ Interferer
level = Conducted interferer level + Δ~minSENS~
### 6.8.3 In-channel selectivity: Conformance requirement
The in channel selectivity requirement is tested in a single direction.
## 6.9 ACS and NB blocking
### 6.9.1 Background information on the conducted requirement
Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.
ACS is derived by considering the results of coexistence system simulations
that examine the impact of an aggressor system on the throughput attainable in
a victim system. The ACIR, ACLR and ACS levels are set such that the average
and 5^th^ percentile throughput do not suffer a significant degradation in a
victim network (usually no more than 5%), when adjacent channel interference
from an aggressor network is modeled. The simulations are Monte Carlo
simulations in which in effect all possible combinations of receiver SINR and
interfering signal are modeled to find an ACIR requirement for the up-link and
then the ACIR is shared between the BS ACS and the UR ACLR. Both these figures
are relative.
It is worthwhile to note that the blocking requirement considers a particular
situation in which the interfering signal is received with a very high level,
whilst the wanted signal is low. However, the ACS may lead to degradation in
many other situations, quite often in situations in which the wanted signal
has high SINR and the interfering signal is received at a significantly lower
power level than the blocking level. If the selectivity against the
interfering signal is not sufficient, then high SINR wanted signals may suffer
significant degradation.
The relative ACS for the BS requirement is 45 dBc.
The ACS requirement is in the form of an absolute interferer level and an
absolute wanted signal level. The wanted signal level and the ACS relative
requirement is used to find the ACS absolute value as follows:
For UTRA wide area BS:
And For E-UTRA wide area BS, 10MHz channel BW:
Note: The actual E-UTRA requirement is -52 dBm the same as UTRA.
The wanted power is an offset from REFSENS, generally it is REFSENS +6 dB
however for E-UTRA as the REFSENS is different for different channel band
widths the wanted power the wanted signal is fixed based on the 5-20 MHz
channel band width requirement.
### 6.9.2 ACS and NB blocking: Core requirement
The ACS requirement is intended to specify the selectivity of the receiver,
not the ability of the receiver to process a large signal level.
The conducted ACS has been derived based on co-existence simulations that take
into account antenna selectivity considering a passive column. Thus, assuming
that the AAS has the same type of antenna as the simulated scenario, then the
task of the requirement definition and test is to re-create the conducted
requirement. This implies that the test can be carried out with the wanted and
interfering signals aligned in direction; there is no need to consider
different directions for the signals, since selectivity has already been taken
into account in the simulations used to derive the requirement.
For a beamforming system, the beamforming pattern is likely to provide
additional spatial selectivity. During the eAAS WI, the impact of this
additional spatial selectivity on ACS was not investigated. It is possible
that for beamforming systems, the required ACS may be lower than 45 dBc; not
higher.
The same 45 dBc is re-used for the OTA requirement.
It is agreed that the blocking requirements are tested using two OTA levels;
one based on the OTA REFSENS RoAoA declaration and the second based on the OTA
minimum sensitivity which is derived from the OSDD declarations. The purpose
of the second level is to avoid that digital combining leads to the blocking
being tested with the wanted signal at a large offset against the noise floor
in the receiver.
For the ACS requirement, if due to combining the wanted signal would be
significantly above the noise floor, then the selectivity would be relaxed
somewhat. Thus, testing ACS using a 6 dB degradation against the minimum
sensitivity level is a better requirement. On the other hand, testing of ACS
based on the OTA REFSENS is not needed, since the blocking requirements tests
the ability of the receiver to correctly manage absolute signal levels.
As the conducted absolute ACS level is an offset from REFSENS, the OTA ACS
absolute value can be easily found as an offset from OTA minimum sensitivity
value.
The requirement is valid over the OTA sensitivity OSDD.
The NB blocking requirement is defined using both the OTA REFSENS RoAoA and
the OTA minimum _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the same manner as the in band blocking
requirement.
### 6.9.3 ACS and NB blocking: Conformance requirement
Conformance of the ACS requirements can be shown in the reference direction.
Conformance of the NB blocking requirement is shown in the same directions as
OTA REFSENS.
# 7 Performance requirements
## 7.1 General
The objective of the performance part of the eAAS WID [2] for the AAS BS
demodulation requirements is to **clarify, which of the conducted BS
demodulation requirements could be applied as radiated requirements for the
OTA AAS BS and what methods could be used to perform conformance testing for
such requirements. For OTA AAS, no new demodulation requirements are expected
to be added beyond the set of AAS BS conducted demodulation requirements
referred from single RAT UTRA FDD and E-UTRA specifications in TS 25.104 [19]
and TS 36.104 [8] respectively.**
NOTE: UTRA TDD BS demodulation requirements are out of scope of the work for
OTA AAS BS.
## 7.2 Core requirements for OTA tests
In Rel-15 TS 37.105 [3], the AAS BS demodulation requirements for both _hybrid
AAS BS_ and OTA AAS BS have been specified, reusing the single RAT
specifications:
1\. For single RAT UTRA FDD, demodulation requirements specified in TS 25.104
[19] for DCH and RACH apply.
2\. For single RAT E-UTRA, demodulation requirements specified in TS 36.104
[8] for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH apply. , except the PUSCH requirements for FS3,
and except NPUSCH and NPRACH requirements.
Core requirements listed in the following clauses are subject for the
discussion on **which of the demodulation requirements could be applied as
radiated requirements for the OTA AAS BS.**
## 7.3 UTRA FDD requirements
In TS 25.104 [19], the following conducted BS demodulation requirements were
defined:

## 7.5 Propagation conditions
The following propagation conditions were used in the BS demodulation
requirements in TS 25.141 [21] and TS 36.141 [22]:
\- Static propagation conditions: static propagation consitions rely on AWGN
channel with no fading or multi-paths. In case of the OTA test setup no
channel emulators are required, and the test setup relies on test signal
source and AWGN noise generator
\- Multipath fading propagation conditions: number of multipath channels were
defined. In order to translate the fading profiles into OTA test setup,
consideration of channel emulators is required on the transmitter side. Use of
multiple instances of channel emulators over the same radio channel to model
the conducted test setup is not precluded.
\- High Speed Train: three different scenarios were considered for the HST
scenarios, using fading and non-fading profiles.
\- Moving propagation conditions: two UEs are modeled in this scenario, one
being static, the other moving.
## 7.6 Conformance requirements
The OTA related parts of the conformance testing test procedures for the
demodulation requirements are based upon the RX dynamic range requirement OTA
procedure, as described in subclause 10.3.4. The setup and operation of the
signal generator and measurement instruments are the same as for the
corresponding conducted requirements.
Measurement Uncertainties for the OTA requirements are the same as for the
conducted requirements, as described in subclause 10.11.
It is noted, that the possibility of OTA testing is considered also for those
BS demodulation requirements, which were declared as Optional in TS 25.141
[21] and TS 36.141 [22].
For OTA test setup for the BS demodulation requirements and for description of
the BS demodulation requirements feasible OTA, refer to TR 37.941 [36].

# 8 EMC requirements
## 8.1 General
The Rel-13 AAS EMC specification [13] was drafted with a simple principle of
applying the existing EMC requirements to the AAS BS architecture hence it was
possible to refer to the existing UTRA , E-UTRA and MSR EMC specifications
[16][15][14]. It was possible to use this approach since release 13 of AAS BS
specification [3] only allows for AAS BS architectures with a conducted
interface, which means that the _antenna array_ can be disconnected and _TAB
connectors_ can be terminated. Hence the system can be treated in the same way
as in the existing specifications and therefore the EMC requirements remained
applicable in exactly the same way.
The OTA AAS BS architecture does not have a conducted interface and so the
antennas cannot be disconnected. This means that the conducted methods where
the _EMC antenna port_ s are terminated are no longer be possible and hence
new methods for EMC testing are needed.
Figure 8.1-1 shows the prime difference in architecture from an EMC view point
when comparing the ports on a conventional non-AAS BS to the ports on an AAS
BS.

Figure 8.1-1: Comparison between BS architectures for EMC testing
Since the _antenna array_ for the OTA AAS BS is integrated within the EUT, the
transmissions from the EUT within the test chamber have _antenna gain_
included in them.
Figure 8.1-2 illustrates the status of _EMC antenna port_ s during EMC testing
where it is noted that the ports are connected to a terminating load and the
_hybrid AAS BS_ is then set to transmit at full power.

## 8.2 Regulatory EMC requirements
The following table provides a summary of the existing EMC regulatory
requirements in EU and US market. These requirements should serve as a
reference when specifying the EMC requirements for the AAS BS.
Table 8.2-1: Overview of the regulatory EMC requirements for EU and US markets
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | EU market | US market | +======================+======================+======================+ | RF Radiated Spurious | -36dBm/100kHz ERP | General requirement | | Emission (RSE) | below 1 GHz and | of -13 dBm/MHz ERP | | requirements | -30dBm/1MHz ERP | is applicable | | | above 1 GHz | | | | | Requirements | | | Requirements | specified in FCC | | | specified in ETSI EN | Part 2. | | | 301 908-1, and are | | | | tested with the | FCC does not define | | | antenna port | any TX exclusion | | | connected in a | bands for BS | | | terminating load. | equipment today. | | | | | | | No TX exclusion | | | | bands defined for BS | | | | equipment today. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | EMC Radiated | -50dBm/MHz ERP | -50dBm/MHz above 1 | | Emission (RE) | general requirement. | GHz mandatory | | requirements | Not applicable for | requirement. | | | BS equipment | | | | | Specified in FCC | | | Defined in ETSI EN | Part 15, §15.35. | | | 55032. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Radiated Immunity | Two type of | No requirements | | (RF electromagnetic | requirements | today | | field) requirements | defined: | | | | | | | | 3 V/m, 80 MHz -- 690 | | | | MHz, and | | | | | | | | 10 V/m 690 MHz -- 6 | | | | GHz. | | | | | | | | Defined in ETSI EN | | | | 301 489-1 and ENSI | | | | EN 301 489-50 | | | | | | | | RX Exclusion bands | | | | defined 20 MHz above | | | | and below the | | | | operating band | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
Note: From the above regulatory requirements, the radiated spurious emission
requirements (-36 dBm/100kHz and -30 dBm/1MHz) are reflected in the existing
EMC specifications for AAS BS [13] and non-AAS BS [14]. Similarly, the 3 V/m
immunity requirement is captured in the existing EMC specifications.

# 9 Manufacturer declarations
## 9.1 General
The Rel-15 AAS BS manufacturer's declarations are defined in TS 37.145-1 [23]
for the conducted testing of the hybrid AAS BS over its conducted RF
interface, and in TS 37.145-2 [24] for the radiated testing of the hybrid AAS
BS or OTA AAS BS over their radiated RF interfaces.
The following groups of the manufacturer's declarations were considered for
the hybrid AAS BS conformance requirements:
1\. For conducted requirements:
the already existingRel-13/14 manufacturers declarations as defined in the
conducted conformance testing specification TS 37.145-1 [23] are reused for
Rel-15 _hybrid AAS BS_. Those declaration were subject to multiple
corrections: some declarations were found redundant (e.g. CA related
declarations), additional missing declarations were introduced (e.g. BS
class), multiple corrections were implemented for consistence.
2\. For the OTA requirements:
the already existing Rel-13/14 manufacturers declarations as defined for the
radiated EIS and EIRP requirements in the radiated conformance testing
specification TS 37.145-2 [24] table 4.10-1, were reused for Rel-15 _hybrid
AAS BS_.
The following groups of the manufacturer's declarations were considered for
the OTA AAS BS conformance requirements:
1\. The Rel-13/14 set of OTA manufacturers declarations as defined for EIRP
and EIS requirements for the hybrid AAS BS (2a above) in the radiated
conformance testing specification TS 37.145-2 [24], table 4.10-1.
2\. Set of radiated testing declarations for OTA AAS BS, which were mirrored
from the conducted specifications in Rel-15, and captured in TS 37.145-2 [24],
table 4.10-2. Conducted declarations mirroring was performed in order to
obtain independent declaration sets for _hybrid AAS BS_ and the OTA AAS BS.
3\. Newly defined Rel-15 manufacturers declarations, for OTA REFSENS test
requirement, captured in TS 37.145-2 [24], table 4.10-2.
