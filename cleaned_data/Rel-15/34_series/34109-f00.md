# 1 Scope
The present document specifies for User Equipment (UE), in UMTS system, for
FDD and TDD modes, those UE functions that are required for conformance
testing purposes.
For conformance tests, functions are activated via the radio interface. These
functions shall be capable of being activated when a test USIM is present. Any
USIM related features such as subsidy-related UE features should also not
interfere with the functions. In the loopback state, the UE shall be able to
perform all functions specified in the present document except where otherwise
stated; in addition however, the conformance testing functions must be
operational.
USIM, in general, is described in TS 31.101 [7]. The ME recognises the test
USIM by the Administrative Data Field. Test USIM data fields are described in
TS 34.108 [10].
The present document applies to the unit that includes the hardware to
establish a connection across the radio interface.

# 4 UE conformance test functions
## 4.1 General description
The SS performs activation and deactivation of the conformance test functions
in the UE by sending standard NAS Layer 3 messages. A specific protocol
discriminator value has been defined in TS 24.007 [1], subclause 11.2.3.1.1
for the UE test command messages. Figure 4.1.1 illustrates the Layer 3
protocol entity Test Control (TC) where the UE test command messages
terminates.
NOTE: The protocol discriminator value used for the TC messages is the same as
used in GSM for the MS specific testing functions, see TS 44.014 [13].
Figure 4.1.1: TC protocol termination (TC =Test Control)
Apart from sending the appropriate deactivation command to the UE the
functions shall be deactivated by switching off the UE.
The following UE conformance testing functions can be activated (and
deactivated):
\- UE test loop function;
\- UE radio bearer test mode;
\- Electrical Man Machine Interface (EMMI).
In addition to the conformance testing functions listed above there is a set
of reference measurement channels that a UE need to support to enable RF
conformance testing. The reference measurement channels are defined in TS
34.121 [8], Annex C for FDD and in TS 34.122 [9], Annex C for TDD.
Example of reference measurement channels (RMC) essential to all UEs
supporting FDD or TDD are:
\- UL 12.2 kbps RMC (Reference Measurement Channel);
\- DL 12.2 kbps RMC.
Example of reference measurement channels associated with UE service
capabilities for FDD (DL and UL) and TDD (DL only) are:
\- DL 64 kbps RMC;
\- DL 144 kbps RMC;
\- DL 384 kbps RMC;
\- UL 64 kbps RMC;
\- UL 144 kbps RMC;
\- UL 384 kbps RMC.
## 4.2 UE radio bearer test mode
The UE radio bearer test mode is specified in subclause 5.2.
The following TC procedures are used to control the UE radio bearer test mode:
\- Activate UE radio bearer test mode;
\- Deactivate UE radio bearer test mode.
## 4.3 UE test loop
The UE test loop function is specified in subclause 5.3.
The following TC procedures are used to control the UE test loop function:
\- Close UE test loop;
\- Open UE test loop.
A prerequisite for the UE test loop function is that the UE radio bearer test
mode is active.
## 4.4 EMMI
The EMMI is specified in clause 7.
No specific TC procedures are associated with EMMI.
# 5 Test Control (TC) protocol procedures and test loop operation
## 5.1 General description
The UE test loop function provides access to isolated functions of the UE via
the radio interface without introducing new physical interfaces just for the
reason of conformance testing.
NOTE: It should be emphasised that the UE test loop function only describes
the functional behaviour of the UE with respect to its external interfaces;
physical implementation of the UE test loop function is completely left open
to the manufacturer.
The UE test loop function is activated by transmitting the appropriate Test
Control (TC) message to the UE, see clause 6.
For the purposes of this specification only, the following definitions are
used:
Bidirectional Radio Bearer:
> If the \"RB mapping info\" information element ([5] subclause 10.3.4.21) for
> the currently active configuration of a radio bearer includes mappings to
> both uplink and downlink transport channels then this radio bearer is
> defined to be a bidirectional radio bearer.
Unidirectional Radio Bearer:
> If the \"RB mapping info\" information element ([5] subclause 10.3.4.21) for
> the currently active configuration of a radio bearer includes mappings to
> only uplink or downlink transport channels then this radio bearer is defined
> to be a unidirectional radio bearer.
NOTE: This definition of unidirectional radio bearer is only applicable to RLC
Unacknowledged Mode, in this version of the specification.
The UE test loop function can be operated in four different loopback modes:
\- UE test loop mode 1;
\- UE test loop mode 2;
\- UE test loop mode 3; and
\- UE test loop mode 4.
UE test loop mode 1, 2 and 4 provide loopback of data for bidirectional radio
bearers. UE test loop mode 3 provides counting of successfully received RLC
SDUs on a given MTCH.
The UE test loop mode 1 and 2 are mandatory to all UEs. The UE test loop mode
3 is mandatory for UEs supporting MBMS. The UE test loop mode 4 is mandatory
for UEs supporting network initiated secondary PDP context.
Support of Update UE Location Information function is optional for the UE.
Figure 5.1.1 shows a functional block diagram of the UE test loop function for
UE test loop mode 1.
Figure 5.1.2 shows a functional block diagram of the UE test loop function for
UE test loop mode 3 applicable when testing reception of MBMS services not
operating in MBSFN mode.
Figure 5.1.3 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for UE
test loop mode 3 applicable when testing MBMS services operating in MBSFN
mode. Test loop command/response messages are sent on the unicast carrier
while the UE test loop mode 3 operates on the MTCH on the MBSFN carrier.
Figure 5.1.4 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for UE
test loop mode 4 applicable when testing network initiated secondary PDP
context and routing of UE uplink IP packets based on network signalled UL TFT.
For UE test loop mode 1 the loopback point is located above Layer 2. Depending
on the actual radio bearer setup loopback is performed of RLC SDUs or PDCP
SDUs according to the procedure specified in subclause 5.3.3.2.
For UE test loop mode 3 the UE counts each successfully received RLC SDU on
the MTCH configured for RLC SDU counting.
The loop back point for UE test loop mode 1 has been selected above Layer 2 to
separate the protocol configurations from the UE test loop function. By
configuration of RLC and MAC layers other loop back points may functional be
achieved. E.g. by transparent configuration of RLC and MAC layer functional
loop back point at Transport channel level can be achieved to implement the
reference measurement channels as specified by TS 34.121 [8], Annex C for FDD
and by TS 34.122 [9], Annex C for TDD.
For UE test loop mode 2 both data and CRC are looped back. UE test loop mode 2
is intended for Blind Transport Format Detection (BTFD) testing and BLER
testing of DL 12.2 kbps reference measurement channel for which loopback of
downlink CRC is required. UE test loop mode 2 can also be used for BLER
testing of DL 64, 144 and 384 kbps reference measurement channels if the UE
supports correspondent UL reference measurement channels. Both received data
and CRC bits for the DCH transport channel used for the BTFD test case is
returned according to the procedure specified in subclause 5.3.3.3.
The loop back point for UE test loop mode 4 has been selected above UE's
function for UL TFT handling. IP PDUs (=PDCP SDUs) received in downlink are
returned to the UL TFT handling SAP in the UE. The UE shall perform normal
operation of the UL TFT handling function while UE test loop mode 4 is active,
i.e. the UE shall perform routing of uplink IP packets to the uplink radio
bearers in accordance with the signalled UL TFT filters as specified in [20]
and [2].
A specific radio bearer test mode is specified to be used together with the UE
test loop function. The purpose of the radio bearer test mode is to put the UE
into a mode where: SS can set up radio bearers to be terminated in the UE test
loop function without having to involve CC or SM; and to disable any control
mechanisms in NAS protocols or in any UE applications that otherwise could
cause the RRC connection to be released.

## 5.2 UE radio bearer test mode procedures
### 5.2.1 Activate UE radio bearer test mode
Figure 5.2.1.1: Activate UE radio bearer test mode procedure
#### 5.2.1.1 General
The SS uses the activate UE radio bearer procedure to get the UE into a test
mode where: the SS can set up radio bearers to be terminated in the UE test
loop function without having to involve CC or SM; and to disable any control
mechanisms in NAS protocols (TC protocol excluded) or in any UE applications
that otherwise could cause the RRC connection to be released.
#### 5.2.1.2 Initiation
The SS can initiate the UE radio bearer test mode when an RRC connection is
established.
The SS requests the UE to activate the UE radio bearer test mode by
transmitting an ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE message. The SS then starts timer TT01.
#### 5.2.1.3 Reception of ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE message by UE
When the UE receives the ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE message then the radio bearer
test mode shall be activated.
When the radio bearer test mode is active the UE shall:
\- accept any requested radio bearer setup within the radio access
capabilities of the UE;
\- terminate all user plane radio bearer(s) in the UE test loop function;
\- discard all SDUs delivered by the RLC layer to the UE test loop function
for a radio bearer without a closed test loop if the configuration of that
radio bearer does not include the PDCP layer;
\- discard all SDUs delivered by the PDCP layer to the UE test loop function
for a radio bearer without a closed test loop if the configuration of that
radio bearer includes the PDCP layer (configured by \"PDCP info\" (see [5]);
\- disable any control mechanisms in NAS protocols or in any UE applications
that otherwise could cause the RRC connection to be released; and
\- optionally, if the UE supports CSG Proximity Indication, ignore any non
3GPP radio signals which are normally used in determining proximity to a CSG
(closed subscriber group) cell and delete any previously stored cell
information for proximity detection.
NOTE: The UE may provide other means which would guarantee that the UE ignores
any non 3GPP radio signals which are normally used in determining proximity to
a CSG (closed subscriber group) cell and deletes any previously stored cell
information for proximity detection. For such UEs the above mentioned CSG
requirements in UE test mode may not apply.
When the radio bearer test mode has been activated the UE shall transmit the
ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message.
NOTE: For UEs not supporting UE test loop mode 4 then the UE does not need to
provide any CC or SM functionality while the radio bearer test mode is active.
For testing of UE uplink packet filtering using UE test loop mode 4 then SM
procedures are used by the SS to configure uplink packet filters. Thus for UEs
supporting UE test loop mode 4 then the UE has to provide SM functionality
while the radio bearer test mode is active.
#### 5.2.1.4 Reception of ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message by SS
Upon reception of the ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message the SS stops
timer TT01.
The reception of the ACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message by SS confirms
that the UE radio bearer test mode has been activated in the UE.
#### 5.2.1.5 TT01 timeout
If TT01 expires, then the SS shall indicate this to the test case. The
procedure is then completed.
### 5.2.2 Deactivate UE radio bearer test mode
Figure 5.2.2.1: Deactivate UE radio bearer test mode procedure
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate the radio bearer test mode and
return UE to normal operation.
#### 5.2.2.2 Initiation
The SS can deactivate the UE radio bearer test mode when an RRC connection is
established and the UE radio bearer test mode is active.
The SS requests the UE to deactivate the UE radio bearer test mode by
transmitting a DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE message. The SS then starts timer TT01.
#### 5.2.2.3 Reception of DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE message by UE
When the UE receives DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE message then the radio bearer
test mode shall be deactivated and UE shall be returned to normal operation.
When the UE has deactivated the radio bearer test mode the UE shall transmit
the DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message using the RRC UPLINK DIRECT
TRANSFER message.
#### 5.2.2.4 Reception of DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message by SS
Upon reception of the DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message the SS stops
timer TT01.
The reception of DEACTIVATE RB TEST MODE COMPLETE message by SS confirms that
the UE radio bearer test mode has been deactivated in the UE.
#### 5.2.2.5 TT01 timeout
If TT01 expires, then the SS shall indicate this to the test case. The
procedure is then completed.
## 5.3 UE test loop procedures
### 5.3.1 General
The UE test loop function is intended for:
\- Testing of receiver characteristics based on BER (Bit Error Ratio)
measurement. The SS calculates BER from a bit-by-bit comparison of data sent
to and received from UE. BER measurement requires symmetric RAB bit-rates.
\- Testing of receiver performance based on BLER (BLock Error Ratio)
measurement. The SS calculates BLER based on the RLC STATUS SDU received from
the UE operating in RLC acknowledged mode; or the SS calculates BLER based on
checking returned downlink data and downlink CRC by UE operating in UE test
loop mode 2.
\- Testing of UE Blind Transport Format Detection.
\- Testing of UE transmitter characteristics.
\- Testing of UE transmitter DTX characteristics.
\- Testing of radio bearers (UE test loop function emulates terminal
equipment).
\- Counting received RLC SDUs on a given MTCH. This may be used for the
estimation of RLC SDU error rate for testing of MTCH performance.
\- Generating reliable data transmission flow on E-DPDCH for E-DCH testing (UE
test loop mode 1).
\- Testing of UE uplink packet filtering (UE test loop mode 4).
### 5.3.2 Close UE test loop
Figure 5.3.2.1: Close UE test loop procedure
#### 5.3.2.1 General
The SS uses the close UE test loop procedure to start the UE Test Loop
function in the UE. A prerequisite for UE test loop mode 1, UE test loop mode
2 and UE test loop mode 4 is that at least one bidirectional user plane radio
bearer has been established between SS and UE. A prerequisite for UE test loop
mode 3 is that at least one MTCH has been established. See TS 34.108 [10],
clause 7 for generic setup procedures.
The UE shall provide for normal Uu layer 1, layer 2 and RRC functionality
while the UE test loop function is active. This includes (but is not limited
to) handover procedures and normal disconnection of the radio bearer. The
loopback shall be maintained across handovers, but after radio bearer
disconnection, the loopback shall cease to exist.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
The SS can request the UE to close a test loop in mode 1, mode 2 or mode 4 if
at least one bidirectional user plane radio bearer is established and the UE
radio bearer test mode is active.
When testing reception of MBMS services not operating in MBSFN mode the SS can
request the UE to close the test loop in mode 3 if any MTCH is established and
the UE radio bearer test mode is active.
When testing reception of MBMS services operating in MBSFN mode the SS can
request the UE to close the test loop in mode 3 before or after any MTCH has
been established on the MBSFN carrier and the UE radio bearer test mode is
active.
The SS requests the UE to close its radio bearer test loop by transmitting a
CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message. The SS then starts timer TT01.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message by the UE
If UE test loop mode 1, mode 2 or mode 4 has been selected and no user plane
bidirectional radio bearers are established or the UE radio bearer test mode
is not active, then the UE shall ignore any CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
If UE test loop mode 1, mode 2 or mode 4 has been selected and one or more
user plane bidirectional radio bearers are established, the UE shall close the
test loop on all user plane bidirectional radio bearers and then send back to
the SS a CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message. The loopback shall be
operational prior to the sending of the acknowledgement. The UE shall not
close the UE test loop mode 1, mode 2 or mode 4 on any unidirectional user
plane radio bearers.
If UE test loop mode 3 has been selected and a MTCH corresponding to the
specified MBMS short transmission identity is established, the UE shall
commence counting of received RLC SDUs on this MTCH. The counter value shall
be reset to zero on reception of CLOSE UE TEST LOOP MODE 3 and the UE shall
send back a CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message to the SS.
If UE test loop mode 3 has been selected, no MTCH corresponding to the
specified MBMS short transmission identity is established and the UE supports
MBMS service operating in MBSFN mode, the UE shall wait until a MTCH is
established corresponding to this MBMS short transmission identity to close
the test loop and commence counting of received RLC SDUs. The counter value
shall be reset to zero when the MTCH is established, the test loop shall be
closed and the UE shall send back a CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message to the
SS.
If the test loop is already closed on one or more user plane radio bearers,
the UE shall still respond as if the loop had been open, i.e. the CLOSE UE
TEST LOOP COMPLETE message shall be sent.
NOTE: There is no requirement on the UE to read the content of the CLOSE UE
TEST LOOP message if it is received while the test loop is closed.
If UE test loop mode 1 has been selected then the loop back scheme according
to subclause 5.3.2.6 shall be performed by the UE.
If UE test loop mode 2 has been selected then the loop back scheme according
to subclause 5.3.2.7 shall be performed by the UE.
If UE test loop mode 3 has been selected then the RLC SDU counting scheme
according to subclause 5.3.2.8a shall be performed by the UE.
If UE test loop mode 4 has been selected then the loop back scheme according
to subclause 5.3.2.8b shall be performed by the UE.
#### 5.3.2.4 Reception of CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message by the SS
Upon reception of the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message the SS stops timer
TT01.
#### 5.3.2.5 TT01 timeout
If TT01 expires, then the SS shall indicate this to the test case. The
procedure is then completed.
#### 5.3.2.6 UE test loop mode 1 operation
If the configuration of a user plane radio bearer with a closed UE test loop
mode 1 includes the PDCP protocol layer, configured by \"PDCP info\" (see
[5]), then the loop back scheme according to subclause 5.3.2.6.1 shall be
performed by the UE for that radio bearer.
If the PDCP protocol layer is not used for a user plane radio bearer with a
closed UE test loop mode 1 then the loop back scheme according to subclause
5.3.2.6.2 shall be performed by the UE for that radio bearer.
##### 5.3.2.6.1 Loopback of PDCP SDUs
If UE test loop mode 1 has been closed on a user plane radio bearer and the
setup of that radio bearer includes configuration of PDCP protocol layer,
configured by \"PDCP info\" (see [5]), then the following loop back scheme
shall be performed by the UE.
After the UE has closed UE test loop mode 1 on a user plane radio bearer,
every PDCP SDU received by the UE on that radio bearer (downlink) shall be
taken from the output of the PDCP service access point (SAP) and be input to
the correspondent PDCP SAP and transmitted (uplink).
The UE shall provide for normal PDCP operation.
The PDCP loopback operation is illustrated in figure 5.3.2.6.1.1.
Figure 5.3.2.6.1.1: Loop back of PDCP SDU\ (DL RLC SDU size = UL RLC SDU size
= N)
##### 5.3.2.6.2 Loopback of RLC SDUs
If UE test loop mode 1 has been closed on a user plane radio bearer and the
setup of that radio bearer does not include configuration of the PDCP protocol
layer (\"PDCP info\" is not configured (see [5]) then the following loop back
scheme shall be performed by the UE.
After the UE has closed UE test loop mode 1 on a user plane radio bearer,
every user data block received by the UE on that radio bearer (downlink) shall
be taken from the output of the RLC service access point (SAP) and be input to
the correspondent RLC SAP and transmitted (uplink). The UE reads the UL RLC
SDU size parameter from the \"LB Setup RB IE#k\" parameter associated with
that radio bearer, see subclause 6.2.
If no \"LB Setup RB IE#k\" parameter is associated with that radio bearer then
the UE shall use the same UL RLC SDU size as the received DL RLC SDU.
For the case when the \"UL RLC SDU size\" parameter is set to \"0\" no data
shall be returned.
For the case when the \"UL RLC SDU size\" parameter is set to the same value
as the down link (DL) RLC SDU block size then the complete user data block
shall be returned, see figure 5.3.2.6.2.1.
Figure 5.3.2.6.2.1: DL and UL RLC SDU block size equal\ (DL RLC SDU size = UL
RLC SDU size = N)
For the case when the \"UL RLC SDU size\" parameter is set to a value less
than the down link (DL) RLC SDU block size then the UE shall return the first
K bits of the received block, where K is the UL block size, see figure
5.3.2.6.2.2.
Figure 5.3.2.6.2.2: DL > UL RLC SDU block size\ (DL RLC SDU size = N, UL RLC
SDU size = K)
For the case when the \"UL RLC SDU size\" parameter is set to a value bigger
than the down link (DL) RLC SDU block size then the UE shall pad the UL send
block by repeating the received data block until the UL send block has been
filled (truncating the last block if necessary), see figure 5.3.2.6.2.3.
Figure 5.3.2.6.2.3: DL \ NOTE 2: See TS 25.133 [12], subclause 7.1 for definition of the timing error
> for FDD mode.
Figure 5.3.2.9.1: Loopback delay requirement (TTI=10 ms)
##### 5.3.2.9.2 Loopback delay requirement for RLC and PDCP SDUs (UE Test loop
mode 1)
The maximum delay from receiving an RLC or PDCP SDU in a downlink SAP until
returning an SDU in the correspondent uplink SAP shall be within the delay
requirement specified in subclause 5.3.2.9.1.
The UE test loop function, operating in UE test loop mode 1, shall for every
radio bearer with a closed test loop be able to return at least 4 SDUs within
the time equal to the TTI of the actual radio bearer.
NOTE: To enable testing of the Conversational CS TM reference radio bearer
combinations as specified in 34.108 subclause 6.10 a UE must be able to loop
back 4 SDUs per TTI. E.g. for \"Conversational / unknown / UL:64 DL:64 kbps /
CS RAB\" operated in TM RLC mode 4 SDUs are needed to fill the transport
format existing of 4x640 bits.
NOTE: The loopback delay requirement in 5.3.2.9.2 does not impose any
synchronisation mechanisms between the uplink RLC entity and the UE test loop
function. Thus it could happen that a UE when having received 4 SDUs within
one and the same TTI may deliver the SDUs to the uplink RLC entity in two
subsequent TTIs. For a TM radio bearer requiring multiple SDUs to fill a
transport block set then \"Timer discard without explicit signalling\" needs
to be configured to secure that the TM RLC entity does not discard the SDUs in
case they are delivered in subsequent TTIs.
### 5.3.3 Open UE test loop
Figure 5.3.3.1: Open UE test loop procedure
#### 5.3.3.1 General
The SS uses the procedure open UE test loop to deactivate the UE test loop
function in the UE.
#### 5.3.3.2 Initiation
The SS requests the UE to open all closed radio bearer test loops by
transmitting an OPEN_UE_TEST _LOOP_CMD message. The SS then starts timer TT01.
#### 5.3.3.3 Reception of OPEN UE TEST LOOP message by the UE
If no bidirectional user plane radio bearers are established in UE Test loop
mode 1 or UE test loop mode 2, the UE shall ignore any OPEN UE TEST LOOP
message.
If one or more user plane radio bearer test loops are closed, the UE shall
open all test loops and send back to the SS an OPEN UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE
message.
If the test loops are already open, the UE shall still respond as if the loops
had been closed, i.e. the OPEN UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message should be sent
prior to TT01 expiring.
#### 5.3.3.4 Reception of OPEN UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE by the SS
Upon reception of the OPEN UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message the SS stops timer

###### ## Annex A (informative): UE test loop use scenarios
## A.1 Measurement of receiver characteristics (BER) using UE test loop mode 1
and RLC TM
SS can use the UE test loop mode 1 and RLC TM for measuring BER. For UE to be
able to return all data it receives form SS it is required that the DL and UL
transport block size are the same. It is also required that the UL RLC SDU
size parameter of the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message is set to the same value as
the DL and UL transport block size.
### A.1.1 Measurement of receiver characteristics (BER) - DL reference
measurement channel (12.2 kbps)
In FDD mode, for measuring BER for the DL and UL reference measurement channel
12.2 kbps according to TS 34.121 [8], Annex C the configuration should be:
\- DL and UL transport block size = 244 bits (RLC TM);
\- UE test loop mode 1 parameter UL RLC SDU size = 244 bits.
In TDD mode, for measuring BER for the DL and UL reference measurement channel
12.2 kbps according to TS 34.122 [9], Annex C.
## A.2 Measurement of receiver performance (BLER) using UE test loop mode 1
and RLC AM
To measure BLER UE test loop mode 1 can be used by having the DL RLC protocol
operating in acknowledged mode (AM). The SS can calculate BLER from the ratio
of number of UE retransmission requests and the total number of blocks sent by
the SS.
In AM the UE indicates missing protocol units (=transport blocks) in the
STATUS PDU message. There are different triggers for sending the STATUS PDU
message. For the purpose of SS BLER measurement a timer based trigger such as
receiver timer based STATUS PDU transfer can be used (see TS 25.322, subclause
9.7.2). The figure below illustrates the SS BLER measurement procedure. In the
example in the figure block errors are detected by the UE of a total of N
blocks. The BLER calculated by the SS is 4 / N.
Figure A.2.1: Measuring BLER using UE test loop mode 1 and DL RLC AM
### A.2.1 Measurement of receiver performance (BLER) - DL reference
measurement channel (64,144,384 kbps)
By having downlink transport block size set to size of user data part
according to the 64, 144 or 384 kbps reference measurement channels and using
RLC acknowledge mode the UE test loop mode 1 can be used to measure BLER.
## A.3 Measurement of receiver performance (BLER) using UE test loop mode 2
In addition to the method described in A.2 UE test loop mode 2 can be used to
measure BLER if the UL transport block size is bigger or equal to the sum of
DL transport block size and number of DL CRC bits.
The SS can calculate BLER by checking returned data and CRC and count number
of block errors and the total number of sent blocks.
### A.3.1 Measurement of receiver performance (BLER) - DL reference
measurement channel (12.2 kbps)
TS 34.121 [8], subclauses C.2.1 and C.3.1 defines the DL and UL reference
measurement channel 12.2 kbps for FDD mode.
TS 34.122 [9], subclauses C.2.1 and C.3.1 defines the DL and UL reference
measurement channel 12.2 kbps for TDD mode.
To be able to measure BLER using UE test loop mode 2 the SS needs to configure
the uplink transport block size to 260 bits to fit downlink transport block
size (244 bits) and downlink CRC bits (16 bits), see figure A.3.1.
Figure A.3.1: UE test loop mode 2 operation for the 12.2 kbps BLER measurement
case
### A.3.2 Measurement of receiver performance (BLER) - DL reference
measurement channel (64,144 and 384 kbps)
TS 34.121 [8], subclause C.2 defines the DL and UL reference measurement
channel for 64, 144 and 384 kbps for FDD mode.
TS 34.122 [9], subclause C.2 defines the DL reference measurement channel for
64, 144 and 384 kbps for TDD mode.
If a UE supports downlink reference measurement channels for 64,144 or 384
kbps and also the correspondent uplink reference measurement channel then it
is possible to use UE test loop mode 2 for measuring BLER for these reference
measurement channels.
## A.4 Measurement of transmitter characteristics
The SS sets up the radio bearer for DL and UL reference measurement channels
12.2 kbps using the generic setup procedure.
See TS 34.108 [10], clause 7 for specification of the generic setup procedure.
See TS 34.121 [8], subclauses C.2.1 and C.3.1 for definition of the DL and UL
reference measurement channel 12.2 kbps for FDD mode.
See TS 34.122 [9], subclauses C.2.1 and C.2.2 for definition of the DL and UL
reference measurement channel 12.2 kbps for TDD mode.
The SS orders the UE to close its UE test loop by transmitting a CLOSE UE TEST
LOOP CMD message.
When the SS receives the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message from the UE the
SS starts transmission of data to the UE.
Perform the transmitter test.
The SS sends the OPEN UE TEST LOOP message to the UE to open the UE test loop.
## A.5 Measurement of transmitter DTX characteristics
The SS requests the UE to enable DTX and sets up the radio bearer for DL and
UL reference measurement channels 12.2 kbps using the generic setup procedure.
See TS 34.108 [10], clause 7 for specification of the generic setup procedure.
See TS 34.121 [8], subclauses C.2.1 and C.3.1 for definition of the DL and UL
reference measurement channel 12.2 kbps for FDD mode.
See TS 34.122 [9], subclauses C.2.1 and C.2.2 for definition of the DL and UL
reference measurement channel 12.2 kbps for TDD mode.
The SS orders the UE to close its UE test loop using UE test mode 1 by
transmitting a CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
The UE confirms that the UE test loop is closed by sending the CLOSE UE TEST
LOOP COMPLETE message to the SS.
Perform the transmitter DTX testing.
The SS sends the OPEN UE TEST LOOP message to the UE to open the UE test loop.
## A.6 Using UE test loop mode 2 for testing of UE Blind Transport Format
Detection (FDD mode)
When a UE operates in UE test loop mode 2 then the received downlink transport
block and the downlink CRC data bits shall be returned in the uplink transport
block, see subclause 5.3.2.7. The UE shall select the uplink transport format
with the smallest transport block size, which fits both the received downlink
transport block and the downlink CRC bits. Table A.6.1 gives an example of an
uplink radio bearer configuration for variable rate having three transports
formats TF0, TF1 and TF2. Table A.6.2 gives some examples of UE selected
uplink transport format versus size of received downlink transport block and
downlink CRC bits.
The SS can use UE test loop mode 2 for testing UE blind transport format
detection by taken the possible downlink transport formats into consideration
when configuring the uplink transport formats. I.e. for every downlink
transport format there should be an uplink transport format for which the
transport block size is equal to the sum of the downlink transport block size
and the number of downlink CRC bits. Thus the SS can check the TFI of the UE
transmitted transport format to verify that the UE has detected the correct
downlink transport format. Table A.6.3 gives an example of a configuration for
testing blind transport format detection using 9 possible downlink transport
formats TF0 to TF8. The right hand column shows the minimum uplink transport
block sizes the SS has to set-up to be able to test the UE blind transport
format detection behaviour.

Examples of different configurations are shown in figures A.7.1 and A.7.2.
Figure A.7.1 illustrates a configuration for testing of RLC reassemble and
segmentation. SS sends DL RLC SDU block size > DL RLC PDU block size and have
configured UL RLC SDU block size = DL RLC SDU size > UL RLC PDU block size.
NOTE: For this type of configuration the UE receiver buffer limitations need
to be considered when designing the test.
Figure A.7.2 illustrates a configuration for BER measurements. SS sends DL RLC
SDU block size = DL RLC PDU block size and have configured UL RLC SDU block
size = UL RLC PDU block size = DL RLC PDU block size. RLC and MAC are
configured for transparent mode.
