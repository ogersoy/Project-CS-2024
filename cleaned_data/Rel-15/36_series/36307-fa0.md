# 1 Scope
The present document specifies requirements for Rel-15 UEs supporting release
independent features like:
\- additional E-UTRA operating frequency bands on top of Rel-15 of TS 36.101
[2] and TS 36.133 [3];
\- additional E-UTRA CA configurations (intra-band/inter-band) on top of
Rel-15 of TS 36.101 [2] and TS 36.133 [3];
\- additional operating bands and/or CA configurations for specific features
(like UE category 0, M1, NB1);
\- other release independent features (like 4Rx antenna port, high speed
scenario, 8Rx antenna port).

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**release independent** : applicable to some frozen releases, starting from a
certain release Rel-M
NOTE 1: Normally, a feature is introduced only in the latest open release
Rel-N and future releases are based on the previous one so that future
releases inherit the requirements of this feature. Introducing a feature \"in
a release independent way from Rel-M onwards\" (M\ 64, | | | | | Power Class 3 | | | | +-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Operating | FDD, TDD | Rel-10 | Table B.2.1-1, | | bands, NS-value | | | Table B.4.1-1 | | > 32 | | | | +-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Asymmetric | FDD | Rel-10 | Table B.2.1-1, | | operating | | | Table B.4.1-1 | | bands, Power | | | | | Class 3 | | | | +-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Operating | FDD | Rel-10 | Table B.2.1-1, | | bands, band | | | Table B.4.1-1 | | number \ \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-9 | | | > and below: clause 4.3 | | | > (Minimization of Drive Tests). | | | | | | NOTE 2: All requirements and the | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except: | | | | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-8: | | | > clauses 6.3 (RRC Connection | | | > Release with Redirection), 6.4 | | | > (CSG Proximity Indication for | | | > E-UTRAN and UTRAN). | | | | | | NOTE 3: All requirements and | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except those defined in | | | sections 7.4 and 7.5. | | | | | | NOTE 4: All requirements and | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except: | | | | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-8: | | | > clauses 8.1.2.5 (E-UTRAN OTDOA | | | > Intra-Frequency RSTD | | | > Measurements), 8.1.2.6 | | | > (E-UTRAN Inter-Frequency OTDOA | | | > Measurements), 8.1.2.7 | | | > (E-UTRAN E-CID Measurements). | | | | | | NOTE 5: All requirements and | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except: | | | | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-8: | | | > clauses 9.1.9 (UE Rx--Tx time | | | > difference), 9.1.10 (Reference | | | > Signal Time Difference). | | | > | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-11 | | | > or below: the RSRP absolute | | | > accuracy requirement under | | | > normal conditions in table | | | > 9.1.2.1-1, 9.1.2.3-1, | | | > 9.1.2.5-1 and 9.1.3.1-1 when | | | > Io≤-70dBm is ±6dB. | | | > | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-11 | | | > or below: the interfrequency | | | > RSRP relative accuracy | | | > requirement under normal | | | > conditions in table 9.1.3.2-1 | | | > is ±6dB. | | | | | | NOTE 6: In addition to the | | | exceptions above, all | | | requirements and test cases in | | | this table shall apply, except | | | those defined for: | | | | | | > \- carrier aggregation; | | | > | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-9 or | | | > below: measurements under | | | > time-domain measurement | | | > resource restriction without | | | > CRS assistance information; | | | > | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-10 | | | > or below: measurements under | | | > time-domain measurement | | | > resource restriction with CRS | | | > assistance information; | | | > | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-11 | | | > or below: requirements | | | > introduced in Rel-12. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
