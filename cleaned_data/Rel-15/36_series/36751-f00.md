# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for FDD operating band in the
L-band for LTE to:
\- Specify a new LTE FDD operating band to include band numbering and core
requirements with support of 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidths
to operate in at least Japan and possibly some other countries outside of
Japan by considering that
\- UE transmit: 1 427 -- 1 470 MHz, BS transmit: 1 475 -- 1 518 MHz
\- Both Bands 11 and 21 requirements shall be met in order to achieve
economies of scale considering the existing FDD-LTE deployment market in
Japan,
\- If not, the upper edges of the band (1 470 and 1 518 MHz) are reconsidered.
\- Specify relevant requirements for protection of the EESS below 1 427 MHz
based on the results of studies of the Study Item _"Feasibility study on
global application of LTE Band 11 and of LTE Band 21 UEs"_ ,
\- Specify relevant requirements for Category M1 and NB1 for the developed FDD
band,

# 4 Background
**Band 11 (UE transmit: 1 427.9-1 447.9MHz, BS transmit: 1 475.9-1 495.9MHz)
and Band 21 (UE transmit: 1 447.9-1 462.9MHz, BS transmit: 1 495.9-1 510.9MHz)
have been used for LTE operation in Japan.**
**At the ITU World Radiocommunication Conference in 2015 (WRC-15), the
frequency band 1 427-1 518 MHz (hereafter, L-band) was identified for
International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT). In accordance with this outcome
at WRC-15, ITU-R Working Party 5D (WP 5D) initiated to revise Recommendation
ITU-R M.1036-5 _"Frequency arrangements for implementation of the terrestrial
component of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) in the bands
identified for IMT in the Radio Regulations"_. For this revision, Japan
proposed to include a new FDD arrangement, which covers a wider frequency
range compared to the Bands 11 and 21 and enables to fully utilize the entire
identified L-band to the extent possible.**
**In the 20^th^ meeting of APT Wireless Group (AWG-20), Japan also proposed to
initiate a study on this new FDD arrangement for the Asia-Pacific countries.
Through the proposal, some administrations in the Asia-Pacific region
expressed interest in developing such an FDD arrangement in the L-band.**
**In 3GPP, the Study Item _"Feasibility study on global application of LTE
Band 11 and of LTE Band 21 UEs"_ (RP-161220) was approved in June 2016 and
plans to be finalized in December 2016. In the study, required transmission
restrictions of UE to meet the unwanted emission limit (-- 62dBW/27MHz with UE
transmit power of 15dBm.) for protection of the Earth Exploration-Satellite
Service (EESS) was investigated. According to results of the study, the
required restriction is not extended to force to use PUCCH overprovision
method, and thus, an implementation of an FDD arrangement in the L-band is a
realistic option while achieving the protection of the EESS. Furthermore,
these results also indicate that no UE transmission restriction is required
for IoT use cases, such as Category M1 and NB1. This is favourable
characteristics as the L-band may be used for IoT applications as well
considering the timeframe when the spectrum is assigned to the operators.**
# 5 List of band specific issues
## 5.1 Dual duplexer
This FDD band plan has small TX-RX gap of 5 MHz (=1475-1470) and its
fractional bandwidth of 0.34 % is quite challenging based on current duplexer
technologies. In order to obtain necessary Tx-Rx isolation over the passband,
dual duplexer will be required. Assuming that 20 MHz CBW can be placed over
the entire passband, namely at least 20 MHz overlap, possible dual duplexer
options are shown in Table 1. Note that options including passband equal or
larger than 34 MHz whose fractional bandwidth of the gap is 0.95 % are
preliminarily precluded considering practical SAW feasibility.

Figure 5.1-1: Dual duplexer in L-band
One of the key aspects to maintain current requirements of Band 11 and 21 is
Tx-Ant attenuation at the lower edge of Band 11 receiver (i.e. NS_09) for the
upper duplexer. Looking at some commercial datasheets of Band 21 duplexer,
some products have no requirement for the Band 11 Rx frequency range while
other components are required to have attenuation of a few dB like 5 dB at
ETC. In light of the situation, each duplexer performance from filter vendors
is shown in Table 2.

Based on Table 2, upper duplexer of 30 MHz x2 should be adopted to have lower
IL with attenuation of 3.5-5 dB at Band 11 Rx and Tx-Rx isolation around 55 dB
at Tx and 50 dB at Rx. Note that lower duplexer has less challenges compared
to the upper one since there is no specific and stringent requirement to
protect EESS and upper neighbourhood (such as Band 11 Rx of the upper one).
Thus, the lower duplexer is expected to have realistic duplexer performance
even with 33 MHz x2.
> **_Agreement: FDD requirements in L-band is to be specified based on dual
> duplexer of lower duplexer of 33MHz x2 and upper duplexer of 30MHz x2._**
## 5.2 Spurious emissions
### 5.2.1 Band 11 receiver protection
This additional spurious is a regional requirement for 5, 10, 15 MHz CBW of
Band 21 operated in Japan.

Since UE supporting the FDD new band shall also satisfy the same protection
level to guarantee the co-existence with Band 11 in Japan and the almost same
attenuation as that of existing Band 21 duplexers can be obtained, NS_09 and
the associated A-MPR can be reused. Note that there is no need to apply this
additional spurious requirement for 1.4, 3 and 20 MHz CBW which are not
operated in Japan. How to apply the current NS for a new band can follow the
NS_05 case of Band 65.

#### 5.2.2.2 For eMTC/NB-IoT
For eMTC and NB-IoT scenarios, it was concluded in the SI that no A-MPR is
needed based on the outcome that _"Up to 8RB can be transmitted without A-MPR
regardless of the RB position"_. One of the simulation results is shown as
below.
{width="4.084027777777778in" height="3.8229166666666665in"}
Figure 5.2.2.2-1: eMTC Power Class 3 uplink spectrum emissions at the lowest
Band 11 carrier position (extract from [R4-168453, "EESS protection study",
Nokia, Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell])
From this figure, it can be concluded that no A-MPR for eMTC is needed even
with the offset of 0.9 MHz. Moreover, it is obvious that NB-IoT which has
narrower transmission BW also need no A-MPR.
**_Agreement: No A-MPR is to be specified for eMTC and NB-IoT for the new FDD
band._**
### 5.2.3 MSS protection
In some regions, the BS spurious emission limit e.i.r.p. of -30 dBm/MHz above
1520 MHz needs to be satisfied for the MSS protection and the IMT upper edge
is 1517 MHz according to ECC Report 263. On the other hand, the upper edge of
the FDD band plan is 1518 MHz. The intention is to maximize frequency resource
in regions where the protection is not required and avoid unnecessary
restriction. So far, it is still unclear whether the spurious emission
requirement is required for the FDD band. Hence, the additional regional
requirement to protect the adjacent system will be stipulated when necessary.
> **_Agreement: For the MSS protection for BS Tx, whether the requirement is
> specified in TS or not will be the same treatment as TDD. If specified, the
> spec should not mandate the guard-band._**
### 5.2.4 Own receiver protection
The simulation assumptions are 25 dB IQ image and LO suppression, 60 dB CIM3
suppression, and PA calibration point so that ACLR is just met with full QPSK
allocation (worst of UTRA1, UTRA2, and E-UTRA), for each channel bandwidth
separately.
It is observed that the A-MPR is not required for the channel bandwidth 5MHz
or smaller. Figure 5.2.4-1, 5.2.4-2 and 5.2.4-3 shows the A-MPR for 10, 15 and
20 MHz channel bandwidth without filter attenuation. Each A-MPR requirement
table is derived taking at least 2 dB attenuation at 1475 MHz in Table 5.1-2
into account.

## 5.3 Maximum transmission power
In order to maintain existing requirements in Band 11/21, the same MOP of
23dBm +2/-2dB should be adopted for this FDD band. Note that switch impact can
be omitted since a UE supporting both Band 11 and 21 can satisfy 23 dBm
+2/-2dB even now. Furthermore, there was a similar discussion to eliminate
such a switch impact for CA_8A-28A by using the antenna switch.
**_Agreement: MOP of 23dBm +2/-2dB is to be adopted for the new FDD band._**
## 5.4 Reference sensitivity
### 5.4.1 For LTE
As described in the objective of the WI, existing requirements in Band 11/21
should be maintained for 5/10/15MHz CBW. From technical perspective, Dup1 in
Table 5.1-2 has IL of 2.3 dB at ETC for Rx which is almost the same as that of
existing commercial Band 21 duplexers. Therefore, for 5/10/15 MHz CBW, the
same REFSENS as Band 21 can be applied for the new FDD for at least Band 21
region. Switch impact should also be avoided as described in the same way to
MOP. Although there is no information on IL at Band 11 region of lower
duplexer so far, it is most likely that the REFSENS of Band 11 can be kept
thanks to frequency separation of at least 1.15 (=0.9+0.25) MHz between 1475
MHz and the lower edge of transmission bandwidth in Band 11.
For remaining parts of 5/10/15 MHz CBW, looking at Ant-Rx value of 30 MHx x2
in Table 1, there is a delta of IL of 0 to 0.7 dB between the Band 21 Rx range
and the worst at the pass-band edge. Since the agreement was to maintain the
same values in Band 21 regions, 0.5 dB higher sensitivity would be
appropriate. In a similar manner, the lower side should also be modified by
0.5 dB. Regarding UL configuration, the same number of up to 25 RB can also be
kept since sufficient Tx-Rx isolation (i.e., around 55 dB at Tx and 50 dB at
Rx) can be expected and the Tx-Rx frequency separation of 48 MHz is the same
as Band 11 and 21.
For 1.4/3 MHz CBW, although new simulations would be needed due to differences
of the noise spread, we propose to refer scaling in the below Band 5 and 8
specs who have 1.4 and 3 MHz CBW and a similar Tx-Rx frequency separation of
45 MHz.

For 20 MHz CBW, a simple scaling method (i.e., -6 dB from that of 5 MHz CBW)
was proposed.

### 5.4.2 For eMTC
In FDD (full-duplex) case, it would be natural to refer the existing
requirements of Band 11 and 21 (i.e., -102.2 dBm) with the same principle as
LTE above (i.e., NOTE 8 in Table 2) since the UE also has the dual duplexer.
On the other hand, in HD-FDD case, the existing requirements of Band 11 and 21
(i.e., -103 dBm) can be referred as is.

the same as that of other NB-IoT bands can be referred as is.
