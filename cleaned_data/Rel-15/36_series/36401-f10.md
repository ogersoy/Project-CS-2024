# 4 General principles
The general principles guiding the definition of E-UTRAN architecture as well
as the E-UTRAN interfaces are the following:
\- Logical separation of signalling and data transport networks.
\- E-UTRAN and EPC functions are fully separated from transport functions.
Addressing scheme used in\ E-UTRAN and EPC shall not be tied to the addressing
schemes of transport functions. The fact that some\ E-UTRAN or EPC functions
reside in the same equipment as some transport functions does not make the
transport functions part of the E-UTRAN or the EPC.
\- Mobility for RRC connection is fully controlled by the E-UTRAN.
\- When defining the E-UTRAN interfaces the following principles were
followed:
● The functional division across the interfaces shall have as few options as
possible;
● Interfaces should be based on a logical model of the entity controlled
through this interface;
● One physical network element can implement multiple logical nodes.
# 5 General architecture
## 5.1 General
The protocols over Uu and S1 interfaces are divided into two structures:
**\- User plane protocols\** These are the protocols implementing the actual
E-RAB service, i.e. carrying user data through the access stratum.
**\- Control plane protocols\** These are the protocols for controlling the
E-RABs and the connection between the UE and the network from different
aspects (including requesting the service, controlling different transmission
resources, handover etc.). Also a mechanism for transparent transfer of NAS
messages is included.
## 5.2 User plane
The E-RAB service is offered from SAP to SAP by the Access Stratum. Figure
5.2-1 shows the protocols on the Uu and S1 interfaces that linked together
provide this E-RAB service.
Note 1: The radio interface protocols are defined in 3GPP TS 36.2xx and TS
36.3xx.
Note 2: The S1 interface protocols are defined in 3GPP TS 36.41x.
Figure 5.2-1: S1 and Uu user plane
## 5.3 Control plane
Figure 5.3-1 shows the control plane (signalling) protocol stacks on S1 and Uu
interfaces.
Note 1: The radio interface protocols are defined in 3GPP TS 36.2xx and TS
36.3xx.
Note 2: The protocol is defined in 3GPP TS 36.41x. (Description of S1
interface).
Note 3: **EMM, ESM:** This exemplifies a set of NAS control protocols between
UE and EPC. The evolution of the protocol architecture for these protocols is
outside the scope of the present document.
Figure 5.3-1: S1 and Uu control plane
NOTE: Both the Radio protocols and the S1 protocols contain a mechanism to
transparently transfer NAS messages.
# 6 E-UTRAN architecture
## 6.1 Overview
Figure 6.1-1 Overall architecture
The LTE architecture can be further described as follows:
The E-UTRAN consists of a set of eNBs connected to the EPC through the S1.
An eNB can support FDD mode, TDD mode or dual mode operation.
eNBs can be interconnected through the X2.
S1 and X2 are logical interfaces.
The E-UTRAN is layered into a Radio Network Layer (RNL) and a Transport
Network Layer (TNL).
The E-UTRAN architecture, i.e. the E-UTRAN logical nodes and interfaces
between them, is defined as part of the RNL.
For each E-UTRAN interface (S1, X2) the related TNL protocol and the
functionality are specified. The TNL provides services for user plane
transport, signalling transport.
In S1-Flex configuration, each eNB is connected to all EPC nodes within a pool
area. The pool area is defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].
If security protection for control plane and user plane data on TNL of E-UTRAN
interfaces has to be supported, NDS/IP (3GPP TS 33.401 [16] shall be applied.
The eMBMS architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 36.440 [6].
## 6.2 E-UTRAN identifiers
This subclause shows those identifiers that are used in E-UTRAN.
### 6.2.1 Principle of handling Application Protocol Identities
An Application Protocol Identity (AP ID) is allocated when a new UE-associated
logical connection is created in an eNB, or an MME, or in a WT. An AP ID shall
uniquely identify a logical connection associated to a UE over the S1
interface, or X2 interface, or Xw interface within a node (eNB, or MME, or
WT). Upon receipt of a message that has a new AP ID from the sending node, the
receiving node shall store the AP ID of the sending node for the duration of
the logical connection. The receiving node shall assign the AP ID to be used
to identify the logical connection associated to the UE and include it as well
as the previously received new AP ID from the sending node, in the first
returned message to the sending node. In all subsequent messages to and from
sending node, both AP IDs of sending node and receiving node shall be
included.
The definitions of AP IDs as used on S1 interface, or X2 interface, or Xw
interface are shown below:
**eNB UE S1AP ID:**
An eNB UE S1AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over
the S1 interface within an eNB. When an MME receives an eNB UE S1AP ID it
shall store it for the duration of the UE-associated logical S1-connection for
this UE. Once known to an MME this is included in all UE associated S1-AP
signalling.\ The eNB UE S1AP ID shall be unique within the eNB logical node.
**MME UE S1AP ID:**
A MME UE S1AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over the
S1 interface within the MME. When an eNB receives MME UE S1AP ID it shall
store it for the duration of the UE-associated logical\ S1-connection for this
UE. Once known to an eNB this ID is included in all UE associated S1-AP
signalling.\ The MME UE S1AP ID shall be unique within the MME logical node.
**Old eNB UE X2AP ID:**
An Old eNB UE X2AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE
over the X2 interface within a source eNB. When a target eNB receives an Old
eNB UE X2AP ID it shall store it for the duration of the\ UE-associated
logical X2-connection for this UE. Once known to a target eNB this ID is
included in all UE associated X2-AP signalling. The Old eNB UE X2AP ID shall
be unique within the eNB logical node.
**New eNB UE X2AP ID:**
A New eNB UE X2AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over
the X2 interface within a target eNB. When a source eNB receives a New eNB UE
X2AP ID it shall store it for the duration of the\ UE-associated logical
X2-connection for this UE. Once known to source eNB this ID is included in all
UE associated X2-AP signalling. The New eNB UE X2AP ID shall be unique within
the eNB logical node.
**eNB1 Measurement ID:**
An eNB1 Measurement ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the
measurement configuration over the X2 interface within the eNB that requests
the measurement. The eNB1 Measurement ID shall be unique within the eNB
logical node.
**eNB2 Measurement ID:**
> An eNB2 Measurement ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the
> measurement configuration over the X2 interface within the eNB that performs
> the measurement. The eNB2 Measurement ID shall be unique within the eNB
> logical node.
**MeNB UE X2AP ID:**
> A MeNB UE X2AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over
> X2 interface within a MeNB for dual connectivity. When a SeNB receives a
> MeNB UE X2AP ID it shall store it for the duration of the UE-associated
> logical X2-connection for this UE. Once known to a SeNB this ID is included
> in all UE associated X2-AP signalling. The MeNB UE X2AP ID shall be unique
> within the eNB logical node.
**SeNB UE X2AP ID:**
> A SeNB UE X2AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over
> X2 interface within a SeNB for dual connectivity. When a MeNB receives a
> SeNB UE X2AP ID it shall store it for the duration of the UE-associated
> logical X2-connection for this UE. Once known to a MeNB this ID is included
> in all UE associated X2-AP signalling. The SeNB UE X2AP ID shall be unique
> within the eNB logical node.
**eNB UE XwAP ID:**
> An eNB UE XwAP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over
> Xw interface within an eNB for LWA. When a WT receives an eNB UE XwAP ID, it
> shall store it for the duration of the UE-associated logical Xw-connection
> for this UE. Once known to a WT, this ID is included in all UE associated
> Xw-AP signalling. The eNB UE XwAP ID shall be unique within the eNB logical
> node.
**WT UE XwAP ID:**
> A WT UE XwAP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over Xw
> interface within a WT for LWA. When an eNB receives a WT UE XwAP ID, it
> shall store it for the duration of the UE-associated logical Xw-connection
> for this UE. Once known to an eNB, this ID is included in all UE associated
> Xw-AP signalling. The WT UE XwAP ID shall be unique within the WT logical
> node.
**gNB UE X2AP ID:**
> A gNB UE X2AP ID shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify the UE over
> X2 interface within a SgNB for EN-DC. When a MeNB receives a gNB UE X2AP ID
> it shall store it for the duration of the UE-associated logical
> X2-connection for this UE. Once known to a MeNB, this ID is included in all
> UE associated X2-AP signalling. The gNB UE X2AP ID shall be unique within
> the gNB logical node.
### 6.2.2 PLMN Identity
A Public Land Mobile Network is uniquely identified by its PLMN Identity.
### 6.2.3 Globally Unique MME Identifier (GUMMEI)
The Globally Unique MME Identifier consists of a PLMN Identity, a MME Group
Identity and a MME Code, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [11].
An MME logical node may be associated with one or more GUMMEI, but each GUMMEI
uniquely identifies an MME logical node (3GPP TS 23.003 [11]).
### 6.2.4 Global eNB ID
The Global eNB ID, used to globally identify an eNB, is defined in 3GPP TS
36.300 [2].
### 6.2.5 E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI)
The ECGI, used to globally identify a cell, is defined in 3GPP TS 36.300 [2].
### 6.2.6 Tracking Area Identity
_The Tracking Area Identity, used to identify tracking areas, is defined in_
3GPP  _TS 36.300 [2]._
### 6.2.7 E-RAB ID
An E-RAB ID uniquely identifies an E-RAB for one UE accessing via E-UTRAN.
### 6.2.8 UE Identifiers
#### 6.2.8.1 Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTI)
Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTI) are used as UE identifiers within
E-UTRAN and in signalling messages between UE and E-UTRAN. Some types of RNTI
exist:
1) C-RNTI
The C-RNTI provides a unique UE identification at the cell level identifying
RRC connection.
2) RA-RNTI
The RA-RNTI is used during some transient states, the UE is temporarily
identified with a random value for contention resolution purposes.
#### 6.2.8.2 S-Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (S-TMSI)
The S-TMSI is a temporary UE identity in order to support the subscriber
identity confidentiality. This S-TMSI is allocated by MME.
## 6.3 Transport addresses
The transport layer address parameter is transported in the radio network
application signalling procedures that result in establishment of transport
bearer connections.
The transport layer address parameter shall not be interpreted in the radio
network application protocols and reveal the addressing format used in the
transport layer.
The formats of the transport layer addresses are further described in 3GPP TS
36.414 [4], 3GPP TS 36.424 [5].
## 6.4 UE associations in eNB
There are several types of UE associations needed in the eNB: the \"eNB UE
context\" used to store all information needed for a UE and the associations
between the UE and the logical S1 and X2 connections used for S1/X2-AP UE
associated messages. An \"eNB UE context\" exists for a UE in ECM_CONNECTED,
and may continue to exist after the UE transitions to ECM_IDLE if the UE was
enabled to use User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401 [3]).
**Definitions:**
**[eNB UE context:]{.underline}**
An eNB UE context is a block of information in an eNB associated to one UE.
The block of information contains the necessary information required to
maintain the E-UTRAN services towards the active UE. An eNB UE context is
established when the transition to active state for a UE is completed or in
target eNB after completion of handover resource allocation during handover
preparation, in which case at least UE state information, security
information, UE capability information and the identities of the UE-associated
logical S1-connection shall be included in the eNB UE context. If the UE is
enabled to use User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401 [3]) the UE-
associated logical S1-connection may be kept after the UE transitions to
ECM_IDLE.
For Dual Connectivity an eNB UE context is also established in the SeNB after
completion of SeNB Addition Preparation.
**[UE-associated logical S1-connection/ UE-associated logical
X2-connection:]{.underline}**
On the logical S1 or X2 connection, control plane messages (S1AP, X2AP)
associated with the UE are sent.\ This connection is established during the
first S1/X2AP message exchange between the S1/X2 peer nodes.\ The connection
is maintained as long as UE associated S1/X2AP messages need to be exchanged
over S1/X2.\ The UE-associated logical S1-connection uses the identities MME
UE S1AP ID and eNB UE S1AP ID.\ The UE-associated logical X2-connection uses
the identities Old eNB UE X2AP ID and New eNB UE X2AP ID, or MeNB UE X2AP ID
and SeNB UE X2AP ID.\ When a node (MME or eNB) receives a UE associated
S1/X2AP message the node retrieves the associated UE based on the S1/X2AP ID.
**[UE-associated signalling:]{.underline}**
UE-associated signalling is an exchange of S1/X2-AP messages associated with
one UE over the UE-associated logical S1/X2-connection.
NOTE: The UE-associated logical S1-connection may exist before the eNB UE
context is setup in eNB.\ The UE-associated logical X2-connection may exist
before the eNB UE context is setup in the target eNB.

## 7.2 Functions description
### 7.2.1 Transfer of user data
This function provides user data transfer capability across the E-UTRAN
between the S1 and Uu interfaces.
### 7.2.2 Radio channel ciphering and deciphering
This function is a pure computation function whereby the radio transmitted
data can be protected against a non-authorized third-party. Ciphering and
deciphering may be based on the usage of a session-dependent key, derived
through signalling and/or session dependent information.
### 7.2.3 Integrity protection
This function is a pure computation function whereby the transmitted data can
be protected against a non-authorized third-party from alteration.
### 7.2.4 Header compression
This function provides a header compression specifically to the particular
network layer, transport layer or upper layer protocol combination e.g. TCP/IP
and RTP/UDP/IP.
### 7.2.5 Mobility control functions
#### 7.2.5.1 Handover
This function manages the mobility of the radio interface. It is based on
radio measurements and it is used to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS)
requested by the EPC. It contains the function of transferring the context
data between source node and target node.
Handover may be directed to/from another system (e.g. LTE to UMTS handover).
The handover preparation is done in the target network side and final handover
decision is done in the source network side.
#### 7.2.5.2 void
#### 7.2.5.3 void
#### 7.2.5.4 Dual Connectivity
E-UTRAN supports Dual Connectivity operation whereby a UE with appropriate
capabilities is configured to utilise radio resources provided by two cells
(or cell groups) served by two eNBs (MeNB and SeNB) connected via a non-ideal
backhaul over the X2 interface.
### 7.2.6 Inter-cell interference coordination
This function is to manage radio resources (i.e. the radio resource blocks)
such that inter-cell interference is kept under control. This function is a
multi-cell RRM function that needs to take into account information (e.g. the
resource usage status and the traffic load situation) from multiple cells.
### 7.2.7 Connection set-up and release
This function is responsible for the control of connection element set-up and
release in the E-UTRAN. The purpose of this function is:
1) to participate in the processing of the end-to-end connection set-up and
release; and
2) to manage and maintain the element of the end-to-end connection which is
located in the E-UTRAN.
In the former case, this function is activated by request from other
functional entities at call set-up/release. In the latter case, i.e. when the
end-to-end connection has already been established, this function may also be
invoked to cater for in-call service modification, at handover execution or in
case of connection suspend and resume.
At suspend the UE is triggered to transition from active to idle state while
causing the UE/eNB/MME to retain context information, and at resume the
connection continues to use the previously stored context information.
### 7.2.8 Load balancing
Load balancing has the task of handling uneven distribution of the traffic
load over multiple cells. The purpose of load balancing is thus to influence
the load distribution in such a manner that radio resources over multiple
cells remain highly utilized and the QoS of in-progress sessions is maintained
to the greatest extent possible and call dropping probabilities are kept
sufficiently small. Load balancing algorithms may result in intra-LTE or
inter-RAT handover or cell reselection decisions with the purpose of
redistributing traffic from highly loaded cells to under-utilized cells.\ The
algorithms may also result in adaptation of mobility parameter settings via
exchanges over the X2 interface.
### 7.2.9 Distribution function for NAS messages
In the RRC protocol and the S1AP, messages from the NAS shall be transparently
transferred within the Access Stratum.
### 7.2.10 NAS node selection function
The interconnection of E-UTRAN to multiple MME / S-GWs is supported in the
E-UTRAN architecture. Therefore a NAS node selection function is located in
the E-UTRAN to determine the MME association of the UE, based on the UE\'s
temporary identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the MME.
### 7.2.11 Synchronization
The network synchronization is to maintain the synchronization of the timing
between different nodes within the network. As no single method can cover all
E-UTRAN applications a logical port at eNB may be used for reception of timing
input independent of synchronization method chosen.
### 7.2.12 Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing
This function is to enable multiple PLMNs to share a Radio Access Network
(RAN). This function has mechanisms to direct the UE to the appropriate PLMN
at the network sharing border and to restrict UE measurement and reselection
to cells that are entitled to access. The E-UTRAN can broadcast multiple PLMN-
IDs in the radio interface. The UE can choose one amongst the broadcasted
PLMN-IDs.
An eNB is allowed to handover a UE to a target cell with multiple PLMN
identities if at least one of the target cell PLMN identities is listed as
allowed in the roaming and access restriction information for the UE, i.e.
listed as serving PLMN or an equivalent PLMN.
This function is also to enable the SCG selection at the MeNB during Dual
Connectivity operation.
### 7.2.13 MBMS function
This function enables the E-UTRAN to transmit the same data to multiple
recipients and allows network and radio resources to be shared.
### 7.2.14 Subscriber and equipment trace
Support for subscriber and equipment trace for LTE and EPS shall be as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.421 [17], TS 32.422 [18], TS 32.423 [19] and TS 32.441
[20], TS 32.442 [21] and TS 32.446 [22].
All traces are initiated by the core network, even if the trace is to be
carried out in the radio network.
A trace set-up in the radio network is propagated on the X2 interface at
handover and on the S1 interface if the handover is carried out between MMEs.
### 7.2.15 RAN Information Management (RIM)
The RAN Information Management (RIM) function is a generic mechanism that
allows the request and the transfer of information (e.g. GERAN system
information) between two RAN nodes via the core network as described in 3GPP
TR 44.901 [12] and TS 48.018 [13]. The RIM function includes the request and
transfer of SON-related information between RATs.
### 7.2.16 Paging
This function provides the capability to request an UE to contact the E-UTRAN
when UE is in ECM_IDLE state or to be addressed of an incoming warning message
(PWS) when UE is in ECM_CONNECTED state.
### 7.2.17 Positioning
This function provides the capability to determine the E-UTRAN CGI of the
serving cell where a UE is currently located.
This function also provides the E-SMLC with uplink positioning measurements
for Enhanced Cell ID positioning, uplink assistance data for UTDOA
positioning, or other information needed by the E-SMLC which is sent as
assistance data to the UE for OTDOA positioning.
### 7.2.18 Delivery of warning messages
This function provides the capability to schedule and broadcast warning
notification messages to UEs related to alerts (earthquake, tsunami, etc..) to
meet regional regulatory requirements. ETWS, CMAS and the other warning
services which use the same AS mechanisms as CMAS as described in 3GPP TS
36.300 [2] are the E-UTRAN services related to warning deliveries.
In ETWS one warning message at a time is delivered over the radio. In CMAS and
the other warning services which use the same AS mechanisms as CMAS as
described in 3GPP TS 36.300 [2] multiple concurrent warning messages can be
broadcast over the radio.
ETWS includes the scheduling and transmission of a primary warning
notification subject to stringent delay that may be followed by a secondary
notification providing complementary information about the threat.
PWS is supported in RAN sharing configuration as described in 3GPP TS 23.251
[14] and TS 22.268 [15].
# 8 Mobility management
## 8.1 Signalling connection
A UE associated logical S1connection may either exist or not exist for a UE:
1) When a UE associated logical S1 connection exists and the UE is in
ECM_CONNECTED, the EPC can reach the UE by the UE associated logical S1
connection on the EPC side, and the E-UTRAN has a context with the UE and the
EPC for this particular connection. This context is erased when the connection
is released. The UE associated logical S1 connection can be initiated from the
UE only.
2) When a UE associated logical S1 connection does not exist, the EPC must
reach the UE via the common procedure. The message sent to the UE can be a
request to the UE to establish a UE associated logical S1 connection. The UE
is addressed with a user/terminal identity within a tracking area.
3) When a UE associated logical S1 connection exists and the UE is in ECM_IDLE
and was enabled to use User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401 [3]),
the UE may re-connect to the existing UE associated logical S1 connection and
the EPC must reach the UE via the common procedure.
## 8.2 Consequences for mobility handling
In general, the radio access specific procedures should be handled within
E-UTRAN. This means that all cell level mobility should be handled within
E-UTRAN.
When there exists a dedicated connection to the UE, the E-UTRAN handles the
radio interface mobility of the UE.\ This includes the Handover procedure in
the ECM_CONNECTED state.
When a dedicated connection between the E-UTRAN and the UE does not exist and
the UE is not enabled to use User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401
[3]), no UE context information is stored in E-UTRAN. When a dedicated
connection between the E-UTRAN and the UE does not exist and the UE is enabled
to use User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization UE context information is stored in
E-UTRAN. For UEs in ECM_IDLE, the mobility is handled directly between UE and
EPC outside access stratum (e.g. by means of registration procedures). When
paging the UE, the EPC indicates a \'geographical area\' that is translated
within\ E-UTRAN to the actual cells that shall be paged. A \'geographical
area\' could be a tracking area or a list of tracking areas.
Thus, the E-UTRAN does not contain any permanent \'location registers\' for
the UE, but only temporary UE contexts information.
# 9 Synchronization
## 9.1 eNB Synchronization
The eNB shall support a logical synchronization port for phase-, time- and/or
frequency synchronization.
Logical synchronization port for phase- and time-synchronization shall provide
1) accuracy that allows to meet the eNB requirements on maximum relative phase
difference for all eNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast area and FDD/TDD-multicast
MBSFN synchronization area;
2) continuous time without leap seconds traceable to common time reference for
all eNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast area and FDD/TDD-multicast MBSFN
synchronization area;
A logical synchronization port for phase- and time-synchronization may also be
provided for e.g., all eNBs in FDD time domain inter-cell interference
coordination synchronization area.
Furthermore common SFN initialization time shall be provided for all eNBs in
synchronized TDD-unicast area and FDD/TDD-multicast MBSFN synchronization
area.
Based on this information, the eNB may derive the SFN according to the
following formula
$\text{SFN} = \left{ \text{time} \right}\text{mod}\left{ \text{period}\left(
\text{SFN} \right) \right}$,
where
time time adjusted by the common SFN initialization time, in units of 10 ms to
match the length of radio frame and accuracy accordingly;
period(SFN) SFN period.
NOTE: When eNB is connected via TDM interfaces, these could be used to
synchronize frequency the eNB.\ The characteristics of these interfaces are
described in 3GPP TS 25.411 [23].
In case eNB is connected via TDM interface, it **may be used to synchronize
frequency the eNB.** The characteristics of the clock in the eNB shall be
designed taking into account that the jitter and wander performance
requirements on the interface are in accordance with network limits for output
wander at traffic interfaces of either ITU-T Rec. G.823 [7], ITU-T Rec. G.824
[8] or network limits for the maximum output jitter and wander at any
hierarchical interface of\ ITU-T Rec. G.825 [9], whichever is applicable.
In case eNB is connected via Ethernet interface and the network supports
Synchronous Ethernet, the eNB may use this interface to get frequency
synchronization. In this case the design of the eNB clock should be done
considering the jitter and wander performance requirements on the interface
are as specified for output jitter and wander at EEC interfaces of ITU-T Rec.
G.8261/Y.1361 [10], defined in clause 9.2.1. Further considerations on
Synchronous Ethernet recommendations and architectural aspects are defined in
clause 12.2.1 and Annex A of ITU-T Rec. G.8261/Y.1361 [10].
A configurable LTE TDD-offset of start frame shall be supported by all eNBs in
synchronized TDD-unicast areas and/or TDD-multicast MBSFN synchronization
areas in order to achieve interoperability in coexistence scenarios.
The logical synchronization port of the HeNB for the time/phase
synchronization may be connected to the surrounding E-UTRAN cells. However,
different surrounding E-UTRAN cells may have different SFN initialization
times and phase drift.
## 9.2 eNB and MME Synchronization
When paging in extended Idle mode DRX, Hyper SFN synchronization requirements
are specified in TS 23.682 [24].

# 11 E-UTRAN interfaces
## 11.1 General protocol model for E-UTRAN interfaces
The general protocol model for E-UTRAN interfaces is depicted in figure
11.1-1, and described in detail in the following subclauses. The structure is
based on the principle that the layers and planes are logically independent of
each other. Therefore, as and when required, the standardization body can
easily alter protocol stacks and planes to fit future requirements.
Figure 11.1-1: General protocol model for E-UTRAN interfaces
### 11.1.1 Radio Network Layer (RNL) and Transport Network Layer (TNL)
The protocol structure consists of two main layers, Radio Network Layer (RNL)
and Transport Network Layer (TNL).\ E-UTRAN functions are realized in the RNL
and the TNL represents standard transport technology that is selected to be
used for E-UTRAN.
### 11.1.2 Control plane
The control plane includes the Application Protocol (AP), i.e. S1AP and X2AP
and the Signalling Bearer for transporting the AP messages.
The AP is used e.g. for setting up bearers (i.e. E-RAB) in the RNL. The bearer
parameters in the AP are not directly tied to the user plane technology, but
are rather general bearer parameters.
### 11.1.3 User plane
The user plane includes the data bearer(s) for the data stream(s). The data
stream(s) is characterized by a tunnelling protocol in the TNL.
## 11.2 Iuant interface - general principles
The Iuant interface for the control of RET antennas or TMAs is a logical part
of the E-UTRAN.
The support of any standardised antenna interface technique shall not be
prevented; e.g. AISG (Antenna interface standards group) specifications may be
used.
