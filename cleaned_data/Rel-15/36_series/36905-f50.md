# 1 Scope
The present document specifies and contains the derivation of Test Points for
RF test cases, thereby 3GPP TSG RAN WG5 will have a way of storing the input
contributions provided. The test cases are described in TS36.521-1[2].
The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Points are included
as .zip files.
The present document is applicable from Release 10 up to the release indicated
on the front page of the present Terminal conformance specifications.
