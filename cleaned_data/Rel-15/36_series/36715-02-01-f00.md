The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 34 and Band 39 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 5.6.3-2 below:

It can be seen from table 5.6.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 34 and 39 may fall into BS
receive band 43
\- and 3^rd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 34 and 39 may fall into BS
receive band 46
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10,
23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 47, 65 and 66.
If the BS only transmits up to 15 MHz and 20 MHz DL in Band 34 and Band 39
respectively as stated in Table 5.6.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still fall
into the BS receive band of the Bands 1, 23, 34, 36 and 65 as shown in the
last row in table 5.6.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 9, 10, 23, 25, 33, 35, 36,
37, 46, 47, 65 and 66 are not intended for use in the same geographical area
as Bands 34 and 39. This leaves Bands 1, 3, 34, and 39 to consider for IMD
products.
It is recommended that Bands 34 and 39 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 1, 3, 34 and 39 BS receivers so that the antenna
PIM will not cause Bands 1, 3, 34, and 39 BS receiver desensitization.

It can be seen from table 5.7.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 34 and 39 may fall into BS

\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands 1, 2, 7, 11, 21, 23,
25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 45 and 65.
If the BS only transmits up to 15 MHz and 20 MHz DL in Band 34 and Band 41
respectively as stated in Table 5.7.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still fall
into the BS receive band of the Bands 7, 23, 34, 38, 41 and 65 as shown in the
last row in table 5.7.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 7, 11, 21, 23, 25, 33, 35, 36,
37, 38, 45 and 65 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as
Bands 34 and 41. This leaves Bands 1, 34, and 41 to consider for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 34 and 41 BS transmitters do not share the same

shown in table 5.9.4-1 and table 5.9.4-2, respectively. It is common
understanding that the single carrier for Band 42 and Band 43 share the same
RF chain and filter component, thus the inter-band CA for 42A-43A can be
operated as intra-band non-contiguous CA for the frequency range covering Band
42+43. Thus theΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ will be 0 which is same as single

### 5.10.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
The CA_8A-32A belongs to the Low-Mid band combination class, in which the dTib
=0.3/dRib =0 were defined for the low band. For the Mid band, due to the
extended high-low type of diplexers may be used, thus the dTib =0.4/dRib =0
may apply for the Mid band e.x. Band 11. However for the CA_8A-32A, Band 32 is
downlink only. So there is no need to define dTib for Band 32.
For two simultaneous DL and only one UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are
shown in table 5.10.4-1 and table 5.10.4-2, respectively.

Table 5.24.4.1.1.4.2-3 MSD contribution percentage of each individual path due
to B2 TX signal
Here are some observations from the MSD analysis:
**_Observation 1_** : PCB isolation (path number 2 and 6) is the dominant
factor of B71 MSD level for both primary RX and diversity RX paths.
**_Observation 2_** : On primary path (path number 4), LPF on B71 UL/DL common
path can also reduce its UL 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to high range of
B2 RX. However, since the MSD of B71 TX 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to B2
RX high range is relative small, the LPF can be put on B71 RX path only to
avoid degradation of B71 TX power due to LPF insertion loss.
**_Observation 3:_** On diversity path, (comparing path number 7 of
with/without LPF tables) whether LPF exists or not does not affect MSD a lot
on this path.
**_Observation 4:_** The worst bandwidth combination for RX 3^rd^ order mixing
of the CA combination will happen on Band 2 UL bandwidth at 5MHz, no matter
what B71 DL bandwidth is.
Based on assumption of LPF on B71 primary-RX path only, B71 REFSENS exceptions
in CA_2A-71A_1UL due to B71 Rx 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing

carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [3] when
operating in single carrier mode.
### 5.32.3 UE co-existence studies
The 2nd and 3rd order harmonics caused in the UE by transmitting of Band 3 and
Band 43 UL carriers can be calculated as shown in Table 5.32.3-1 below. None
of the products falls into the B3 or B43 UE receiving band. For UE coexistence
the single UL is already considered for these bands in TS 36.101 [3].

### 5.33.3 UE Co-existence studies
Table 5.33.3-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
25 and Band 46 CA with 1 UL.
Table 5.33.3-1: Band 25 and Band 46 UL harmonics
BS UL carriers f1_low f1_high f2_low f2_high

UL frequency (MHz) 1850 1915 5150 5925 2^nd^ order harmonics frequency range
(MHz) 3700 3830 10300 11850 3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5550
5745 15450 17775
It can be seen from Table 5.33.3-1 that there is harmonic interference for
CA_25A-46A towards own receive bands with the 3^rd^ harmonic of B25 being in
the B46 range.
### 5.33.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
Since the frequency range for B25 is similar to that of B2, ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c
values from CA_2A-46A can be used. For two simultaneous DLs and one UL of band
25 and Band 46 for 1UL/2DL CA_25A-46A, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are
shown in table 5.33.4-1 and table 5.33.4-2, respectively.
ΔTIB,c value for band 25 is taken from existing CA_2A-46A, and for band 46 are
taken from existing CA_12A-46A.

### 5.33.5 Reference sensitivity
Since 3^rd^ harmonic interference is potentially present in this CA
configuration, a reference sensitivity exception is necessary to avoid
desensitization. The REFSENS value for Band 46 is the same as for CA_2A-46A
since Band 2 and Band 25 are very similar. Due to the specifications for
CA_2A-46A but adjusting for a different single carrier reference sensitivity
in Band 25 compared to Band 2, the following is proposed.
Table 5.33.5-1: REFSENS requirements for CA_25A-46A

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 3 and Band 18 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 5.6.3-2 below

* * *
It can be seen from table 5.34.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 3 and 18 may fall into BS
receive band 3, 10, 43, 66
\- and 3^rd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 3 and 18 may fall into BS
receive band 38, 41
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands 2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14,
18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 39, 41, 42, 43 and 44
### 5.34.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For CA_3A-18A_BCS0, the same requirements on ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ of
CA_3A-19A_BCS0 case can apply. Therefore, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are
shown in table 5.34.4-1 and in table 5.34.4-2.

### 5.34.5 REFSENS requirements
No change in B3 or B18 REFSENS requirements are needed, as the 1UL does not
cause harmonic distortion to the own receiving bands.

Table 5.35.2-1 shows there are no harmonic issues for this combination.
So we can conclude that there is no issue on both DL/UL harmonic interference.
### 5.35.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports [CA_46A-48A]{.underline} the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~
is defined for applicable bands in Table 5.35.3-1 and 5.35.3-2 respectively
assuming separate antenna architecture without HTF as was assumed CA_42A-46A.
Hence the delta values are chosen by similar existing combination of
CA_42A-46A

Due to insufficient cross band isolation between Band 46 and Band 48, MSD
needs to be specified. The MSD analysis was conducted when CA_42A-46A was
discussed. Because of similarity of CA_46A-48A to CA_42_46A, we apply the MSD
specified for CA_42A-46A to that for CA_46A-48A.

that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

It can be seen from Table 5.37.3-2 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting
in Band 8 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35,37 and 39
and none of 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into the any E-UTRA operating BS receive
band. In addition 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 27 may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 10 and 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into BS
receive band of Bands 7, 38 and 41.
Meanwhile the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation
of Band 8 and Band 27 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 3, 9 and 3^rd^
IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Band 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 18,
19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 41 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table 5.37.3-2
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 35 MHz DL
frequency of Band 8 and the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band 27.
If the BS is only transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 8 and 10 MHz in Band
27 as stated in the WIDs, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of the Band 6, 8, or 18
It should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 25, 33, 35, 37, 38
and 39 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 8 and
27. Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into
Bands 3, 5, 7, 9, 26, 27, 28, 41 and 44. With the performances of the current
BS antenna system, transmit and receive path components, amplifiers, pre-
distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected that the IMD interference
generated within the Band 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 27, 28, 41 or 44 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 8 and 27 BS transmitters do not share the
same antenna with Band 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 27, 28, 41 or 44 BS receiver

### 5.42.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 5.42.4-1 and 5.42.4-2 respectively. This
configuration is very similar to CA_41A-42A and therefore the applicable
relaxations for that CA configuration are re-used.
Table 5.42.4-1: ∆Τ~IB,c~
