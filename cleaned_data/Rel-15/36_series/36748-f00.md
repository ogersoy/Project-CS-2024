# 4 Background
During its June 2016 meeting in Sweden, ECC Plenary approved ECC DEC(16)02
entitled "Harmonised technical conditions and frequency bands for the
implementation of Broadband Public Protection and Disaster Relief (BB-PPDR)
systems" (http://www.erodocdb.dk/Docs/doc98/official/pdf/ECCDEC1602.PDF).
In this decision, CEPT concluded on several harmonized frequency arrangements
for BB-PPDR at 450MHz:
\- 2x5,5MHz allocation: 450,5 -- 456 MHz (UL) /460,5 -- 466 MHz (DL)
\- 2x5,5MHz allocation: 452 -- 457,5 MHz (UL) /462 -- 467,5 MHz (DL)
For those frequency arrangements, the UE unwanted emissions levels above 470
MHz shall be -42 dBm / 8MHz.
CEPT has sent a Liaison Statement [4] to 3GPP in which CEPT kindly requests
3GPP to consider the inclusion of the technical requirements as described
above in the 3GPP specifications.
Input document [5] submitted at RAN4#80 meeting (August 2016) from European
administrations, PPDR organisations, manufacturers and operators indicated
their intention to support the standardization of 700 MHz and 450 MHz PPDR
bands for Europe, including the frequency bands above.
Many administrations in Europe plan to deploy LTE based PPDR services in this
harmonized frequency arrangement and therefore support the development of a
new E-UTRA band that includes this spectrum and taking into account the above
OOBE requirements.
In addition to future PPDR services there are a range of existing CDMA2000
networks working in the 451-456 / 461-466 MHz band in Europe. Operators in
Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands among others are
providing broadband or machine-type-communication services today and have the
plan to deploy LTE Private Mobile Radio (PMR) / Public Access Mobile Radio
(PAMR) services once this new E-UTRA band is introduced in 3GPP
specifications.
# 5 Band plan allocation and regulatory background
## 5.1 Regulatory background
ECC CEPT initiated the work on future BB-PPDR by addressing the user
requirements and the spectrum needs for future European broadband PPDR systems
(Wide Area Networks). The outcome is the ECC Report 199 [7] which was approved
in May 2013.
It was complemented by ECC report 218 [8] that addresses the possible
harmonisation options which support the implementation of the user
requirements and spectrum needs. It describes and evaluates proposed frequency
arrangement options for BB-PPDR. The evaluation was done assuming LTE and its
evolution as a common technical standard to support BB-PPDR.
Several candidate BB-PPDR frequency ranges for harmonisation were investigated
in ECC report 218 [8]:
\- 400 MHz (410-430 MHz and 450-470 MHz)
\- 700 MHz (694-791 MHz)
Conclusions on spectrum compatibility of the options included in ECC Report
218 [8] are derived from ECC Reports 239 (for the 700MHz option) and 240 [9]
(for the 400MHz option).
Based on the conclusions of ECC report 218 [8], ECC has approved for
publication in June 2016 ECC DEC(16)02 [6] on "Harmonised technical conditions
and frequency bands for the implementation of Broadband Public Protection and
Disaster Relief (BB-PPDR) systems".
CEPT ECC concluded, in particular, on the following for harmonisation:
1\. Frequency arrangements for BB-PPDR:
a) 450.5 - 456.0 MHz (Uplink) / 460.5 - 466.0 MHz (Downlink);
b) 452.0 - 457.5 MHz (Uplink) / 462.0 - 467.5 MHz (Downlink);
c) 698 - 703 MHz (Uplink) / 753 - 758 MHz (Downlink);
d) 703 - 733 MHz (Uplink) / 758 - 788 MHz (Downlink);
e) 733 - 736 MHz (Uplink) 788 - 791 MHz (Downlink);
2\. 700 MHz range:
The UE unwanted emissions levels below 694 MHz under normal environmental
conditions shall be -42dBm/8MHz noting that a different level can be
considered for such BB-PPDR UE operating in the 698-703 MHz block in extreme
environmental conditions (i.e. outside normal environmental conditions) for
equipment conformance tests but shall not exceed -30dBm/8MHz.
3\. 400 MHz ranges:
The maximum UE unwanted emissions above 470MHz shall be -42dBm/8MHz.
The band 410-430 MHz which was covered in ECC Report 218 [8] is not covered by
the ECC Decision (16)02 [6]. The band 410-430 MHz has been excluded due to:
\- the incompleteness of the technical studies in support of that band for BB-
PPDR
\- a lack of corresponding standardisation activities for BB-PPDR in this band
in 3GPP, ETSI and other international organisations
\- Spectrum sharing and coexistence difficulties identified in ECC Report 240
[9]
## 5.2 Frequency arrangement for the 400MHz option of the ECC Decision (16)02
This technical report addresses the inclusion of the technical requirements
for the 400MHz option that is included in the ECC Decision (16)02 [6]:
a) 450.5 - 456.0 MHz (Uplink) / 460.5 - 466.0 MHz (Downlink);
b) 452.0 - 457.5 MHz (Uplink) / 462.0 - 467.5 MHz (Downlink);
These frequency allocations and the adjacent services are depicted on the
Figure 5.2-1.

Figure 5.2-1: Frequency allocation for BB-PPDR in 450-470MHz band and adjacent
services
Coexistence issues with adjacent services were studied. Methodology, results
and conclusions of the coexistence studies can be found in ECC Report 240 [9]:
\- PPDR impact on existing systems within the 450-470 MHz sub-bands and
adjacent bands
\- Impact on TETRA system
\- Impact on ETS300-113-related systems (e.g. TETRAPOL)
\- Impact on CDMA-PAMR
\- Impact on analogue FM PMR
\- Impact on DTT reception
\- Impact on satellite services
\- Impact on Military Radars
\- Impact on Radio Astronomy at 406.1 - 410 MHz
\- Impact of existing systems within the 450-470 MHz sub-bands and adjacent
bands on BB-PPDR systems
\- TETRA impact on LTE 450 system
\- TETRAPOL impact on LTE 450 system
\- CDMA-PAMR impact on LTE 450 system
\- 25kHz analogue FM impact on LTE 450 system
\- DTT impact on LTE450 system
Conclusions on spectrum compatibility of the option 450-470MHz listed above
are summarised in section 9.2.1 of the ECC Report 218 [8]. It is stated that
"This band is suitable for the deployment of BB-PPDR services" under "certain
circumstances" such as RF performances and deployment guidelines. They are
detailed in sections 8.1.1.1 to 8.1.1.5 of ECC Report 218 [8] and shall be
taken into account while deriving the RF requirements applicable to UE and
eNodeB that operate into a sub-band of 450-470MHz.

# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Operating band and channel bandwidths
The initial study phase of the WI concentrated on agreeing on band(s)
arrangement focusing on the following options:
i. 2x5MHz within 450,5 -- 456 MHz (UL) / 460,5 -- 466 MHz (DL) and 2x5MHz
within 452 -- 457,5 MHz (UL) / 462 -- 467,5 MHz (DL)
ii. 2x7MHz: 450,5 -- 457,5 (UL) / 460,5 -- 467,5 (DL)
During the WI a duplex-filter study was done, see section 8.1 and the
conclusion was that from filter performace point of view 2x5 MHz band plans
are feasible but 2x5.5 MHz band plans are not suitable for full duplex
operation.
Based on the 2x5 MHz bandwidth limitation and current spectrum holdings in
Europe, see Table 7.1-1 it was concluded that exiting band 31 and a new band
of uplink = 451 - 456 MHz and downlink = 461 -- 466 MHz, see Figure 7.1-1
would have very good geographical coverage in Europe.

7.2 Coexistence with systems in adjacent spectrum
Compatibility studies have been performed in the ECC Report 240 [9] on
compatibility and sharing studies for the BB-PPDR systems operating in the
frequency bands 410-430MHz and 450-470MHz. The following scenarios have been
studied:
\- Section 3 of [9]: BB-PPDR impacts on existing systems within 410-430 /
450-470MHz sub-band and adjacent bands (scenarios where eNodeB and UE are
aggressors)
\- Section 4 of [9]: Impacts of existing systems within 410-430 / 450-470MHz
sub-band and adjacent bands on BB-PPDR (scenarios where eNodeB and UE are
victims)
The conclusions of these studies can be found in section 8.1.1 of [8].
Conclusions applicable to this work item (BB-PPDR operating in 450-470MHz
frequency band and UE output power and spectrum mask compliant with 3GPP
specifications) are detailed in the following sub-sections.
7.2.1 Coexistence with PMR/PAMR
Conclusions of coexistence studies with PMR/PAMR can be found in section
8.1.1.1 of [8].
For the OOBE of the LTE eNodeB, a level of -43dBm/100kHz is recommended to
protect the PMR/PAMR BS receiver.
Since the PMR/PAMR uplink band(s) are lower in frequency than the uplink of
the band 72 defined in section 7.1, the duplexer of the eNodeB provide the
necessary attenuation to meet the recommended level, as stated in section
8.1.1.1 of [8]. Thus there is no need for additional requirements to be
included in the TS36.104 for coexistence with PMR/PAMR.
7.2.2 Coexistence with satellite services
Conclusions of coexistence studies with satellite services can be found in
section 8.1.1.2 of [8]: no coexistence issues were identified.
7.2.3 Coexistence with the radiolocation service (including defence radar)
Conclusions of coexistence studies with radiolocation services and defence
radar can be found in section 8.1.1.3 of [8]: no coexistence issues were
identified when BB-PPDR is operating in the 450-470MHz range, as stated in the
last sentence. Thus, no issues are anticipated for Band 72 defined in section
7.1.
7.2.4 Coexistence with Digital Terrestrial Television
Conclusions of coexistence studies with radiolocation services and defence
radar can be found in section 8.1.1.4 of [8], where it is mentioned that the
risk of the eNodeB to interfere the DTT receivers is reduced when a guard band
up to 3MHz is applied between the BS transmission and the first channel used
for DTT. In case of Band 72 defined in 7.2.1, the guard band is at least
3.5MHz between the higher edge of the downlink band and 470MHz.
Other engineering solutions (such as external filters in vulnerable DTT areas)
may also be applied in a case-by-case basis to mitigate the interference.
7.2.5 Coexistence with radioastronomy
Conclusions of coexistence studies with radioastronomy can be found in section
8.1.1.5 of [8]. Coexistence issues shall be considered on a case-by-case
basis. They can be solved by an additional filtering of the OOBE of the eNodeB
depending on the geographical separation between the radioastronomy station
and the eNodeB.
# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 UE duplex-filter study
In the WID RP-162514 two options were listed for band plan.
1\. Initial study phase:
a. Agree on band(s) arrangement focusing on the following options:
i. 2x5MHz within 450,5 -- 456 MHz (UL) / 460,5 -- 466 MHz (DL) and 2x5MHz
within 452 -- 457,5 MHz (UL) / 462 -- 467,5 MHz (DL)
ii. 2x7MHz: 450,5 -- 457,5 (UL) / 460,5 -- 467,5 (DL)
Note: Other options are not precluded considering the filter performance
constrained by the small duplex gap of each option and capability to achieve
OOBE requirement.
Duplex-filter data was collected for 2x5.5 MHz band plan to see if it would be
feasible to create bands covering entire 450,5 -- 456 MHz (UL) / 460,5 -- 466
MHz (DL) and 452 -- 457,5 MHz (UL) / 462 -- 467,5 MHz (DL) ranges instead of
only 2x5 MHz band plans.
Filter data based on simulations from two vendors were received and is
presented in Table 8.1-1. Data in the Table 8.1-1 is worst case data including
temperature and manufacturing variations. Filter performance is quite similar
when comparing the data from the two vendors which increases the confidence
for the accuracy of the data. The achievable isolation for 2x5.5 MHz band
plans seems not to be good enough to support full duplex operation as the own
transmitter would interfere reception. Typically isolation values of 50 -- 55
dB are expected from the duplex-filters.
Table 8.1-1: Filter data for 2x5.5 MHz band plan.
* * *
Parameter Vendor A Vendor B Tx IL 4.0 dB (max) 4.7 dB (max) Rx IL 5.4 dB (max)
3.6 dB (max) Tx Iso 45 dB (min) 42 dB (min) Rx Iso 36 dB (min) 38 dB (min)
* * *
In addition to data presented in Table 8.1-1 band 31 duplex-filter data was
received and presented in Table 8.1-2. Band 31 frequency range is 452.5 --
457,5 MHz (UL) / 462.5 -- 467,5 MHz (DL) and aligns with one of the target 5
MHz band plans listed in WID objectives. It can be assumed that shifting the
filter downwards to cover the other 5 MHz band plan mentioned in the WID do
not impact the filter parameters shown in Table 8.1-2.
When comparing the data in Tables 8.1-1 and 8.1-2 it can be seen that
isolation values of 2x5 MHz filter compared to 2x5.5 MHz filter are much
higher and in a same time Tx and Rx insertion losses of 2x5 MHz filter are
smaller. These differences are of course beneficial for UE operation.
Table 8.1-2: Filter data for Band 31
* * *
Parameter Vendor B Tx IL 4.2 dB (max) Rx IL 3.1 dB (max) Tx Iso 50 dB (min) Rx
Iso 50 dB (min)
* * *
From filter performance point of view presented in Tables 8.1-1 and 8.1-2 it
can be concluded that 2x5 MHz band plans are feasible but 2x5.5 MHz band plans
are not suitable for full duplex operation.
## 8.2 UE transmitter requirements
Due to very similar band arrangement with band 31 the transmitter requirements
will be very similar for band 72 as those are for band 31.
### 8.2.1 Maximum output power:
Standard LTE Transmitter output power class will be specified as power class 3
with ± 2 dB tolerances.
UE category M1 Transmitter output power classes will be specified as power
classes 3 and 5 with ± 2 dB tolerances.
UE category NB1/NB2 Transmitter output power classes will be specified as
power classes 3 and 5 with ± 2 dB tolerances and power class 6 with ± 2.5 dB
tolerances.
### 8.2.2 Spurious emission band UE co-existence:
Spurious emissions towards other 3GPP bands were already agreed in R4-1704068
in RAN4#82bis and are captured below. For UE category M1 and NB1/NB2 standard
LTE requirements apply.

### 8.3.2 Inband blocking
Standard LTE inband blocking: Band 72 is added into Table 7.6.1.1-2
### 8.3.3 Out of band blocking:
Standard LTE Out of band blocking: Band 72 is added into Table 7.6.2.1-2
UE category NB1/NB2: Note 3 is modified in Table 7.6.2.1F-1 to take into
account that lower frequency limit of band 72 downlink is 461 MHz.
NOTE 3: For operating bands which downlink band frequency range is between 461
MHz \< f \< 467.5 MHz the power level of the interferer (P~Interferer~) for
Range 3 shall be modified to: -- 18 dBm for the frequency range which is
bounded by F~DL_low~ - 150 MHz of the lowest band that UE supports in
frequency range 461 MHz \< f \< 467.5 0 MHz and F~DL_high~ + 150 MHz of the
lowest band that UE supports supports in frequency range 461 MHz \< f \<
