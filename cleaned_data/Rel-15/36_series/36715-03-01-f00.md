Here are some observations from the MSD analysis:
**_Observation 1_** : PCB isolation (path number 2 and 6) is the dominant
factor of B71 MSD level for both primary RX and diversity RX paths.
**_Observation 2_** : On primary path (path number 4), LPF on B71 UL/DL common
path can also reduce its UL 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to high range of
B2 RX. However, since the MSD of B71 TX 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to B2
RX high range is relative small, the LPF can be put on B71 RX path only to
avoid degradation of B71 TX power due to LPF insertion loss.
**_Observation 3:_** On diversity path, (comparing path number 7 of
with/without LPF tables) whether LPF exists or not does not affect MSD a lot
on this path.
**_Observation 4:_** The worst bandwidth combination for RX 3^rd^ order mixing
of the CA combination will happen on Band 2 UL bandwidth at 5MHz, no matter
what B71 DL bandwidth is.
Based on assumption of LPF on B71 primary-RX path only, B71 REFSENS exceptions
in CA_2A-71A_1UL due to B71 Rx 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing

The uplink of Band 71 is 663 - 698 MHz for which third harmonic products fall
within 1989 -- 2094 MHz, while the downlink of Band 2 is 1930 - 1990 MHz.
Thus, it can be seen that there is potential for third harmonic interference
from uplink in Band 71 to downlink in Band 2. However, the potential is
limited to edge channels since the overlap is only 1 MHz from 1989 -- 1990
MHz. Only an uplink allocation in the lowest edge of Band 71 paired with
simultaneous downlink in the uppermost edge of Band 2 could be impacted.
Moreover, due the guard bands inherent in the definition of the transmission
bandwidth configuration for LTE, there may not be any direct overlap at all.
However, there may still be some effect due to spectral spreading of the third
harmonic even if direct overlap is averted.
Another potential mechanism for harmonic interference is mixing of the uplink
in Band 2 with the third harmonic of the Rx LO. In this case, the frequency
range impacted is much larger. The third harmonic of Rx extends from 1851 to
1956 MHz while the uplink in Band 2 ranges from 1850 to 1910 MHz. Therefore,
there is nearly complete overlap between these two ranges. Depending upon the
particular frequency assignments and allocation of PRB's for uplink within
Band 2 and downlink within Band 71, there may be interference from this
mechanism.
### 5.53.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
the overlap between the third harmonic of the uplink in Band 71 and the
downlink in Band 2 is small. Therefore, the number of deployment scenarios
that may be impacted are also small and may possibly be overcome by network
scheduling or some other means. Consequently, a harmonic trap filter is not
assumed to be present and therefore not accounted for in the ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~
values. The combination of Band 2 and Band 4 are a high/high combination for
which the ∆T~IB~ is 0.5 dB and ∆R~IB~ is 0.3 dB. Band 71 is a low band
combined by duplexing and therefore is specified with ∆T~IB~ of 0.3 dB.

### 5.53.4 REFSENS requirements
It is expected that MSD will be specified for the two types of harmonic
interference described above. MSD is captured by means of the refsens
exception table for harmonics.
##### 5.53.4.1 Band 2 MSD
For the case of 3^rd^ harmonic of uplink in Band 71 interfering with downlink
in Band 2, the harmonic interference level at Tx antenna port over the
frequency range of the Band 2 receive channel was measured. The measurement
was conducted for both full allocation and single RB and is summarized below.
Given that the output is referenced to the antenna port, the obtain a value at
the PA output, the Band 71 Tx front-end insertion loss assumed to be 5 dB
should be added.

20 5 -46.7 -49.1 20 10 -46.9 -47.9 20 15 -46.5 -47.7 20 20 -44.5 -47.7
* * *
Based on these noise measurements, the MSD can be computed. It was agreed that
a harmonic trap filter would not be assumed at the output of the Band 71 PA.
Therefore, the filtering of the 3^rd^ harmonic comes primarily from the Band
71 duplexer and the low/high diplexer. Other contributions to harmonic, such
as switch, harmonic generation within Band 71 and Band 2 duplexers, etc., are
not included in the calculation for simplicity. Lastly, the assumption of 67
dB PCB isolation is adopted in this analysis.
A Band 71 filter datasheet indicates that the duplexer Tx attenuation in the
frequency range of the 3^rd^ harmonic is 40 dB and is used here. The low/high
diplexer provides an additional attenuation of 25 dB. The front-end loss in
Band 2 Rx is assumed to be 5.5 dB due to the high insertion loss of the B2+B4
quadplexer. With these assumptions, the following results are obtained using
the 5 MHz + 5 MHz as an example. The MSD analysis is based on an MRC combining
algorithm assuming that the interference is correlated across primary and
diversity receivers.

Following the same procedure and assumptions, the other bandwidth combinations
were analyzed with a MSD summary provided in the table below
Table 5.53.4.1-3: Summary of MSD for all aggressor and victim bandwidths

The reference sensitivity can be defined as follows where the maximum MSD for
a given Band 2 channel bandwidth is applied. The 5 MHz channel bandwidth
requires an amendment when the Band 71 Tx bandwidth is also 5 MHz since the
MSD is significantly larger for this case. Also, it is noted that the MSD only
applies when the channels are located in proximity of the lower edge of Band
71 and the upper edge of Band 2.

2: B2 PA output to B71 primary RX LNA input
3: B2 UL signal coupling due to TXM mid-band port to low-band port

B71 duplexer RX 3^rd^ harmonic rejection data from two component vendors are
also shown in Figure 6.x.4.1.1.4.2-2. The RX 3^rd^ harmonic rejection can vary
from 23 to 42 dB. We propose 37 dB as the calculation assumption.

**Figure** 5.53.4.2**-2 B71 Duplexer RX 3^rd^ harmonic rejection data**
Considering that discrete front-end components are still widely used on
phones, and that numerous bands/CAs with relatively dense component placement
could introduce lots of coupling paths, we propose 67dB PCB isolation as B71
MSD calculation assumption. On the other hand, Thanks to the continual
advancement in integrated circuit design, the transceiver's low-band RX front-
end 3^rd^ order harmonic rejection can be improved to 30 dB.

TX signal
{width="6.6875in" height="1.0055555555555555in"}
Here are some observations from the MSD analysis:
**_Observation 1_** : PCB isolation (path number 2 and 6) is the dominant
factor of B71 MSD level for both primary RX and diversity RX paths.
**_Observation 2_** : On primary path (path number 4), LPF on B71 UL/DL common
path can also reduce its UL 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to high range of
B2 RX. However, since the MSD of B71 TX 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to B2
RX high range is relative small, the LPF can be put on B71 RX path only to
avoid degradation of B71 TX power due to LPF insertion loss.
**_Observation 3:_** On diversity path, (comparing path number 7 of
with/without LPF tables) whether LPF exists or not does not affect MSD a lot
on this path.
**_Observation 4:_** The worst bandwidth combination for RX 3^rd^ order mixing
of the CA combination will happen on Band 2 UL bandwidth at 5MHz, no matter
what B71 DL bandwidth is.
Based on assumption of LPF on B71 primary-RX path only, B71 REFSENS exceptions

The uplink of Band 71 is 663 - 698 MHz for which third harmonic products fall
within 1989 -- 2094 MHz, while the downlink of Band 2 is 1930 - 1990 MHz.
Thus, it can be seen that there is potential for third harmonic interference
from uplink in Band 71 to downlink in Band 2. However, the potential is
limited to edge channels since the overlap is only 1 MHz from 1989 -- 1990
MHz. Only an uplink allocation in the lowest edge of Band 71 paired with
simultaneous downlink in the uppermost edge of Band 2 could be impacted.
Moreover, due the guard bands inherent in the definition of the transmission
bandwidth configuration for LTE, there may not be any direct overlap at all.
However, there may still be some effect due to spectral spreading of the third
harmonic even if direct overlap is averted.
Another potential mechanism for harmonic interference is mixing of the uplink
in Band 2 with the third harmonic of the Rx LO. In this case, the frequency
range impacted is much larger. The third harmonic of Rx extends from 1851 to
1956 MHz while the uplink in Band 2 ranges from 1850 to 1910 MHz. Therefore,
there is nearly complete overlap between these two ranges. Depending upon the
particular frequency assignments and allocation of PRB's for uplink within
Band 2 and downlink within Band 71, there may be interference from this
mechanism.
### 5.54.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
the overlap between the third harmonic of the uplink in Band 71 and the
downlink in Band 2 is small. Therefore, the number of deployment scenarios
that may be impacted are also small and may possibly be overcome by network
scheduling or some other means. Consequently, a harmonic trap filter is not
assumed to be present and therefore not accounted for in the ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~
values. The combination of Band 2 and Band 66 are a high/high combination for
which the ∆T~IB~ is 0.5 dB and ∆R~IB~ is 0.3 dB. Band 71 is a low band
combined by duplexing and therefore is specified with ∆T~IB~ of 0.3 dB.

### 5.54.4 REFSENS requirements
It is expected that MSD will be specified for the two types of harmonic
interference described above. MSD is captured by means of the refsens
exception table for harmonics.
##### 5.54.4.1 Band 2 MSD
For the case of 3^rd^ harmonic of uplink in Band 71 interfering with downlink
in Band 2, the harmonic interference level at Tx antenna port over the
frequency range of the Band 2 receive channel was measured. The measurement
was conducted for both full allocation and single RB and is summarized below.
Given that the output is referenced to the antenna port, the obtain a value at
the PA output, the Band 71 Tx front-end insertion loss assumed to be 5 dB
should be added.

20 5 -46.7 -49.1 20 10 -46.9 -47.9 20 15 -46.5 -47.7 20 20 -44.5 -47.7
* * *
Based on these noise measurements, the MSD can be computed. It was agreed that
a harmonic trap filter would not be assumed at the output of the Band 71 PA.
Therefore, the filtering of the 3^rd^ harmonic comes primarily from the Band
71 duplexer and the low/high diplexer. Other contributions to harmonic, such
as switch, harmonic generation within Band 71 and Band 2 duplexers, etc., are
not included in the calculation for simplicity. Lastly, the assumption of 67
dB PCB isolation is adopted in this analysis.
A Band 71 filter datasheet indicates that the duplexer Tx attenuation in the
frequency range of the 3^rd^ harmonic is 40 dB and is used here. The low/high
diplexer provides an additional attenuation of 25 dB. The front-end loss in
Band 2 Rx is assumed to be 5.5 dB due to the high insertion loss of the B2+B4
quadplexer. With these assumptions, the following results are obtained using
the 5 MHz + 5 MHz as an example. The MSD analysis is based on an MRC combining
algorithm assuming that the interference is correlated across primary and
diversity receivers.

Following the same procedure and assumptions, the other bandwidth combinations
were analyzed with a MSD summary provided in the table below

The reference sensitivity can be defined as follows where the maximum MSD for
a given Band 2 channel bandwidth is applied. The 5 MHz channel bandwidth
requires an amendment when the Band 71 Tx bandwidth is also 5 MHz since the
MSD is significantly larger for this case. Also, it is noted that the MSD only
applies when the channels are located in proximity of the lower edge of Band
71 and the upper edge of Band 2.

The B2 UL signal propagation path numbering as shown in Figure 2-1 is detailed
as below:
1: UE transceiver B2 TX output to B71 primary RX LNA input
2: B2 PA output to B71 primary RX LNA input
3: B2 UL signal coupling due to TXM mid-band port to low-band port
4: Direct signal path from B2 UL to B71 primary-RX LNA input
5: UE transceiver B2 TX output to B71 diversity RX LNA input
6: B2 PA output to B71 diversity RX LNA input
7: Direct signal path from B2 UL to B71 diversity-RX LNA input
B71 duplexer RX 3^rd^ harmonic rejection data from two component vendors are
also shown in Figure 6.x.4.1.1.4.2-2. The RX 3^rd^ harmonic rejection can vary
from 23 to 42 dB. We propose 37 dB as the calculation assumption.

**Figure** 5.54.4.2**-2 B71 Duplexer RX 3^rd^ harmonic rejection data**
Considering that discrete front-end components are still widely used on
phones, and that numerous bands/CAs with relatively dense component placement
could introduce lots of coupling paths, we propose 67dB PCB isolation as B71
MSD calculation assumption. On the other hand, Thanks to the continual
advancement in integrated circuit design, the transceiver's low-band RX front-
end 3^rd^ order harmonic rejection can be improved to 30 dB.
Table 5.54.4.2-1 summarizes a set of typical receiver performance parameters
for MSD analysis. Table 5.54.4.2-2 presents the link analysis to calculate the
interference level in both main and diversity Rx paths as well as the combined
REFSENS level based on uncorrelated MRC. Table 5.54.4.2-3 shows the MSD

Here are some observations from the MSD analysis:
**_Observation 1_** : PCB isolation (path number 2 and 6) is the dominant
factor of B71 MSD level for both primary RX and diversity RX paths.
**_Observation 2_** : On primary path (path number 4), LPF on B71 UL/DL common
path can also reduce its UL 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to high range of
B2 RX. However, since the MSD of B71 TX 3^rd^ harmonic side lobe falling to B2
RX high range is relative small, the LPF can be put on B71 RX path only to
avoid degradation of B71 TX power due to LPF insertion loss.
**_Observation 3:_** On diversity path, (comparing path number 7 of
with/without LPF tables) whether LPF exists or not does not affect MSD a lot
on this path.
**_Observation 4:_** The worst bandwidth combination for RX 3^rd^ order mixing
of the CA combination will happen on Band 2 UL bandwidth at 5MHz, no matter
what B71 DL bandwidth is.
Based on assumption of LPF on B71 primary-RX path only, B71 REFSENS exceptions
in CA_2A-71A_1UL due to B71 Rx 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing

It can be seen from Table 5.67.2-1 for CA_8A-20A-28A that there is no harmonic
interference from uplink bands towards downlink bands.
### 5.67.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Examples of possible reference architectures using 2 antennas are shown below.
Insertion loss values are applied to all bands to give freedom when choosing
which bands to combine in a quadplexer or a triplexer. 1-antenna solutions
have also been investigated, but to avoid high insertion loss values with
current technologies, a 2-antenna solution seems like the best approach for
the time being.

It can be seen from Table 5.75.2-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonic of Band 8 UL falls
into the Band 3 DL.
### 5.75.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
The ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in Table 5.75.3-1 and Table
5.75.3-2, respectively. The combination of Band 3 and Band 38 are a high/high
combination for which the ∆T~IB~ is 0.5 dB and ∆R~IB~ is 0 dB. The framework
can be with triplexer. Band 8 is a low band combined by this triplexer and
therefore is specified with ∆T~IB~ of 0.3 dB.

It can be seen from Table 5.97.2-1 that the 3^rd^ harmonic of Band 28 falls
into the Band 4 DL.
### 5.97.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
The ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in Table 5.97.3-1 and Table
5.97.3-2, respectively. The combination of Band 4 and Band 7 are a high/high
combination for which the ∆T~IB~ is 0.5 dB and ∆R~IB~ is 0 dB. The framework
can be with triplexer. Band 28 is a low band combined by this triplexer and a
harmonic trap filter is assumed, therefore it is specified with ∆T~IB~ of 0.6
dB.

It can be seen from Table 5.100.2-1 that the third harmonic of Band 26 falls
into the UE's own receive bands in Band 41, however it was concluded in
previous similar combinations that whether the harmonic interference issue
exist or not still depends on the actual spectrum allocation. In this 3CA, the
same can be applied. Other than that, it is found that none of the products
falls into any of the UE receiving bands.
### 5.100.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
The co-existence studies for this band combination are the same as
CA_8A-39A-41A with single UL, which can be found in TR36.715-03-01.
