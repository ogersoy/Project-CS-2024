# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Carrier aggregation** : Aggregation of two or more component carriers in
order to support wider transmission bandwidths.
**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier
with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a
cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for
transmitter and receiver RF requirements.
**Inter-band carrier aggregation: Carrier aggregation of component carriers in
different operating bands.**
**Mixed Intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation: Carrier aggregation of
component carriers in same operating band and different operating bands.**
NOTE: Carriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or non-contiguous.
## 3.2 Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:
F~DL_low~ The lowest frequency of the downlink operating band
F~DL_high~ The highest frequency of the downlink operating band
F~UL_low~ The lowest frequency of the uplink operating band
F~UL_high~ The highest frequency of the uplink operating band
ΔR~IB,c~ Allowed reference sensitivity relaxation due to support for inter-
band CA operation, for serving cell _c_.
ΔT~IB,c~ Allowed maximum configured output power relaxation due to support for
inter-band CA operation, for serving cell _c_.
## 3.3 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for LTE Advanced 2UL and xDL
Carrier Aggregation under Rel-15 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS
side. The document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs
# 5 xDLs/2UL Carrier Aggregation: General part
## 5.1 UE RF specific
### 5.1.1 UE general architecture
To derive MSD (Maximum Sensitivity Degradation), RAN4 consider xDL/1UL CA UE
RF architectures including TDD-FDD CA based on the each CA band combinations
in rel-15 for LTE only UE. For the NSA UE CA operation with NR band and LTE
band, it is not scope of this xDL/2UL CA WI in rel-15.
Figure 5.1.1-1 UE example RF architecture using cascaded-Diplexer
Figure 5.1.1-1 is an example UE RF architecture using cascaded diplexer for
xDL/2UL inter-band CA. RAN4 do not preclude dual Antenna architecture for
xDL/2UL CA UE. However, the UE RF requirements could be derived in the single
antenna UE RF architecture.
### 5.1.2 General treatment of ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Following Table 5.1.2-1 is proposed the additional insertion loss for xDL/2UL
CA band combinations. RAN4 should consider reuse the agreed additional
insersion loss in xDL/1UL CA UE when the new RF components are not introduce
for the xDL/2UL CA band combination. If else, the detail description will be
captured in each CA band combination in specific part

### 5.1.3 Fallback CA mode and mandatory support of all paired 2UL CA
configurations
RAN4 define the Fallback CA mode by agreed Way-forward (R4-168853) in rel-14.
### 5.1.4 General TX/RX requirements
#### 5.1.4.1 Transmitter requirements
Dual uplink Transmitter requirements already analysed in TR36.860 for dual
uplink inter-band CA. The xDL/2UL CA UE follow the legacy UE transmitter
requirements in Table 5.1.4.1-1.

#### 5.1.4.2 Receiver requirements
Dual uplink receiver requirements already analysed in TR36.860 for dual uplink
inter-band CA according to the self-interference or not.
Additional UE RF receiver requirements for xDL/2UL CA UE are listed in the
Table 5.1.4.2-1.
The xDL/2UL CA band combinations without self-interference issues can follow
the legacy UE Rx requirements in xDL/1UL CA RF Rx requirements. Since RAN4
already concluded that test coverage of Out-of-band blocking and spurious
response for 2DL/2UL are covered by 1UL test (i.e. single carrier LTE and
1UL/2DL CA) [5]. Hence only REFSENS test for xDL/2UL CA UE perform with all
downlink component carriers active and both of the uplink carriers active.
Furthermore, RAN4 should define the new maximum sensitivity degradation (MSD)
for REFSENS requirements of each CA band combinations when the xDL/2UL CA band
combinations has self-interference problems.

Based on Table 6.1.1.2-1, the 4^th^ order IMD products by Band 3 and Band 7
fall into the own Rx frequency of Band 32; the related MSD study will be
covered in clause 6.1.1.3.
#### 6.1.1.3 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_3A-7A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-7A-32A there are self-interference problems from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of the Band 32.
Based on the agreed self-desense analysis paper and related proposed
contributions in R4-1710486, R4-1710627 and R4-1710736, the merged MSD level
was provided from interested companies as below Table 6.1.1.3-1.

Since DL bands included are the same as in 2DL/2UL of 3A-41A, the result
obtained for the 2DL/2UL CA can be reused. According to the result, 4^th^
order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 3 and band 41. However the IMD problem
is already covered in 2DL/2UL CA_3A-41A in Table 7.3.1A-0f in TS 36.101 [3].
In addition, 2^nd^ harmonics and 2^nd^, 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx
frequencies of bands 5-6, 8, 12-14, 17-20, 22, 26-29, 42-44, 46, 48 and 67-68,
including bands defined in Rel-14 time frame.
#### 6.4.1.3 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-41C there is no interference components from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of the third band.

According to the result, 4^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 3 and
band 41. However the IMD problem is already covered in 2DL/2UL CA_3A-41A in
Table 7.3.1A-0f in TS 36.101 [3]. For band 42, the 2^nd^ harmonics from band 3
Tx to Band 42 Rx has already been studied in Table 7.3.1A-0a in TS 36.101 [3].
Also 3^rd^ order IMD (2*B41-B3) will fall down to band 42 Rx. However, MSD due
to the 3^rd^ IMD could be excluded since band 41 and band 42 are assumed to be
synchronized.
#### 6.5.1.3 MSD
For band 42, MSD due to the 3^rd^ IMD could be excluded since band 41 and band
42 are assumed to be synchronized. Then 2^nd^ harmonic falldown of band 3 Tx
should only be addressed but this MSD was already studied in 2DL/1UL CA_3A-42A
which has been captured in 36.101 [3].
Hence, when uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-41A-42A there is no interference components from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of the third band.

#### 6.6.1.3 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-28A-41A there are self-interference problems from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of the Band 28.

The 4^th^ IMD falls into the own Rx of Band 1 and Band 41. As already reported
in release 14 version of TR36.714-00-02, the 4^th^ IMD never impacts Band 1 Rx
because Tx-Rx separation is always kept in 190MHz. Therefore, specifying MSD
requirement is not necessary. For 4^th^ IMD impact on Band 41 Rx, it analysis
is captured in the next section.
#### 6.7.1.3 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-42A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_1A-41A-42A, RAN4 needs to consider 4^th^ IMD impact on Band
41. However, when simultaneous Tx/Rx is not considered for this CA
configuration (namely, Band 41 and Band 42 are synchronized), 4^th^ IMD never
causes desensitization in Band 41 Rx. Since CA_1A-41A-42A was specified with
the assumption that simultaneous Tx/Rx is not occurred among TDD bands 41 and
42, it is reasonable to apply same assumption for this combination.
#### 6.7.1.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Comparing 1UL-3DL CA_1A-41A-42A, no difference is expected from UE
architecture point of view for this combination, same values for ∆T~IB~ and
∆R~IB~ as 1UL-3DL CA_1A-41A-42A shall apply.

configuration CA_1A-7A-26A there are self-interference problems from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of the bands 7 and 26\. However,
these MSD issues were already covered in 2DL/2UL CA_7A-26A.
Based on the agreed self-desense analysis paper and related proposed
contributions, the merged MSD level was provided from interested companies as

#### 6.20.1.3 Co-existence studies for LTE-A UL CA_7C and DL CA_1A-7C
The 2UL / 3DL own receiver desensitization by 2UL_CA_7C study for 2^nd^ and
3^rd^ order harmonics were calculated and presented in Table 6.20.1.3-1

From the harmonics table, there was no harmonics from Band 7 uplinks which
would desensitize the 3^rd^ own Rx frequency of band 1.
Frequency separation of Band 1 downlink and B7 uplink is 330 MHz, therefore
there is no impact from Band 7 uplink CA to the band 1 reception.
#### 6.20.1.4 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-7A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_1A-7C there is no interference components from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere downlink of the Band 7, no further MSD studies
for this combination.
When uplink CA configurations CA_7C is paired with downlink CA configuration
CA_1A-7C there is no interference components from 2 uplink operation which
would interfere downlink of the Band 1, no further MSD studies for this

The 4^th^ IMD falls into the own Rx of Band 1 and Band 41. As already reported
in release 14 version of TR36.714-00-02, the 4^th^ IMD never impacts Band 1 Rx
because Tx-Rx separation is always kept in 190MHz. Therefore, specifying MSD
requirement is not necessary. For 4^th^ IMD impact on Band 41 Rx, it analysis
is captured in the MSD section.
#### 7.2.1.3 Co-existence studies for LTE-A UL CA_42C and DL CA_1A-41A-42C
For 2UL / 4DL own receiver desensitization study 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order
harmonics and 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ order intermodulation products
were calculated and presented in Table 7.2.1.3-1

From the harmonics analysis table, there was no harmonics from Band 42 uplinks
which would desensitize the 3^rd^ own Rx frequency of bands 1 and 41.
#### 7.2.1.4 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-42A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_1A-41A-42C, RAN4 needs to consider 4^th^ IMD impact on Band
41. However, when simultaneous Tx/Rx is not considered for this CA
configuration (namely, Band 41 and Band 42 are synchronized), 4^th^ IMD never
causes desensitization in Band 41 Rx. Since CA_1A-41A-42C was specified with
the assumption that simultaneous Tx/Rx is not occurred among TDD bands 41 and
42, it is reasonable to apply same assumption for this combination.
#### 7.2.1.5 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Comparing 1UL-4DL CA_1A-41A-42C, no difference is expected from UE
architecture point of view for this combination, same values for ∆T~IB~ and
∆R~IB~ as 1UL-4DL CA_1A-41A-42C shall apply.

The 4^th^ IMD fall into the own Rx band 7. But this impact is already covered
in 2UL/2DL CA_3A-7A. So there is no further self-interference issue.
#### 7.7.1.3 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_3A-7A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-3A-7A-7A there are interference components from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of the Band 7. However, this
impact is already covered in the fallback combination as mentioned in the
previous section; no further MSD analysis is needed.

According to the result, 4^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 3 and
band 41. However the IMD problem is already covered in 2DL/2UL CA_3A-41A in
Table 7.3.1A-0f in TS 36.101 [3]. For band 42, the 2^nd^ harmonics from band 3
Tx to Band 42 Rx has already been studied in Table 7.3.1A-0a in TS 36.101 [3].
Also 3^rd^ order IMD (2*B41-B3) will fall down to band 42 Rx. However, MSD due
to the 3^rd^ IMD could be excluded since band 41 and band 42 are assumed to be
synchronized.
##### 7.8.1.2.2 Co-existence studies for LTE-A UL CA_3A-42A and DL
CA_3A-41C-42A
Co-existence studies of this 4DL/2UL CA configuration are already covered by
those of the 2DL/2UL and 3DL/2UL captured in this TR. Therefore, no additional
study is needed.
##### 7.8.1.2.3 Co-existence studies for LTE-A UL CA_41C and DL CA_3A-41C-42A
Co-existence studies of this 4DL/2UL CA configuration are already covered by
those of the 2DL/2UL and 3DL/2UL captured in this TR. Therefore, no additional
study is needed.
#### 7.8.1.3 MSD
For band 42, MSD due to the 3^rd^ IMD could be excluded since band 41 and band
42 are assumed to be synchronized. Then 2^nd^ harmonic falldown of band 3 Tx
should only be addressed but this MSD was already studied in 2DL/1UL CA_3A-42A
which has been captured in 36.101 [3].
Hence, when uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-41C-42A there is no interference components from 2 uplink
operation which would interfere the downlink of Band 41 and Band 42.
As with 7.8.1.2.2, the MSD of this 4DL/2UL CA configuration are already
covered by those of the 2DL/2UL and 3DL/2UL captured in this TR. Therefore, no
additional MSD requirement is needed for LTE-A UL CA_3A-42A and DL
CA_3A-41C-42A.
As with 7.8.1.2.3, the MSD of this 4DL/2UL CA configuration are already
covered by those of the 2DL/2UL and 3DL/2UL captured in this TR. Therefore, no
additional MSD requirement is needed for LTE-A UL CA_41C and DL CA_3A-41C-42A.
#### 7.8.1.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Comparing 1UL-4DL CA_3A-41C-42A, no difference is expected from UE
architecture point of view for this combination, same values for ∆T~IB~ and
∆R~IB~ as 1UL-4DL CA_3A-41C-42A shall apply.

Also 3^rd^ order IMD (2*B41-B3) will fall down to band 42 Rx. However, MSD due
to the 3^rd^ IMD could be excluded since band 41 and band 42 are assumed to be

##### 7.9.1.2.2 Co-existence studies for LTE-A UL CA_3A-42A and DL

Co-existence studies of this 4DL/2UL CA configuration are already covered by
those of the 2DL/2UL and 3DL/2UL captured in this TR. Therefore, no additional

#### 7.9.1.3 MSD
For band 42, MSD due to the 3^rd^ IMD could be excluded since band 41 and band

should only be addressed but this MSD was already studied in 2DL/1UL CA_3A-42A

Hence, when uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA

As with 7.9.1.2.2, the MSD of this 4DL/2UL CA configuration are already

According to the result, 4^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 3 and

#### 7.10.1.3 MSD
For band 28, both IMD2 and IMD3 effects should be studied. But it is conducted
for CA_3DL_3A-28A-41A_2UL_3A-41A_BCS0 and the results can be reused for this

Hence, when uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA

According to the result,
\- 4^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 3 and band 41 but the IMD
problem is already covered in 2DL/2UL CA_3A-41A in Table 7.3.1A-0f in TS
36.101 [3].
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics from band 3 Tx to Band 42 Rx has already been studied
in Table 7.3.1A-0a in TS 36.101 [3].
\- 3^rd^ order IMD (2*B41-B3) will fall down to band 42 Rx but this is already
covered in 2UL/3DL 3A-41A/3A-41A-42A.
\- For band 28, the 2^nd^ order IMD (B41-B3) and 3^rd^ order IMD (2*B3-B41)
will fall down to band 28 Rx.
#### 7.11.1.3 MSD
For band 28, both IMD2 and IMD3 effects should be studied. But it is conducted
for CA_3DL_3A-28A-41A_2UL_3A-41A_BCS0 and the results can be reused for this
4DL/2UL CA.
Hence, when uplink CA configurations CA_3A-41A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-28A-41-42A there is no new interference components from 2
uplink operation which would interfere the downlink of Band 28 and Band 41.
#### 7.11.1.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Comparing 1UL-4DL CA_3A-28A-41A-42A, no difference is expected from UE
architecture point of view for this combination, same values for ∆T~IB~ and
∆R~IB~ as 1UL-4DL CA_3A-28A-41A-42A shall apply.

When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-7A, 3A-7A, 3A-26A and CA_7A-26A are paired
with downlink CA configuration CA_1A-3A-7A-26A there are self-interference
problems from 2 uplink operation which would interfere the downlink of the

For CA_1A-7A we analyse the impact of the receiving band with the harmonics
and IMD products from the dual uplink transmission. Based on the results from
Table 7.28.1.2-1, the 5^th^ order IMD products by Band 1 and Band 7 fall into
the own Rx frequency of Band 28. However, the IMD problem already covered in
3DL_CA_1A-7A-28A with 2UL_CA_1A-7A.

For CA_1A-28A we analyse the impact of the receiving band with the harmonics
and IMD products from the dual uplink transmission. From the table above, we
see that there is self-interference on the 2nd order IMD on Band 7. However,
the IMD problem will be covered in 3DL_1A-7A-28A with 2UL_CA_1A-28A.
#### 7.28.1.6 MSD
When uplink 2CA configurations CA_1A-7A is paired with downlink 4CA_1A-7C-28A
there are 5^th^ order IMD self-interference issues from concurrently
supporting uplink 2CA which could interfere with downlink Band 28. This case
is already covered in 3DL/2UL CA_1A-7A-28A, therefore the related MSD study
will be covered in 3DL/2UL CA_1A-7A-28A.
When uplink 2CA configurations CA_7C is paired with downlink 4CA_1A-7C-28A
there are no self-interference issues from concurrently supporting uplink 2CA.
When uplink 2CA configurations CA_7A-28A is paired with downlink 4CA_1A-7C-28A
there are 3^rd^ harmonic self-interference issues from Band 28uplink which
could interfere with downlink Band 1. This case is already covered in
2DL_CA_1A-28A.
When uplink 2CA configurations CA_1A-28A is paired with downlink 4CA_1A-7C-28A
there are 2^nd^ order IMD self-interference issues from concurrently
supporting uplink 2CA which could interfere with downlink Band 7. This case is
already covered in 3DL/2UL CA_1A-7A-28A, therefore no further MSD study
required.

The 4^th^ IMD falls into the own Rx of Band 1 and Band 41. As already reported
in release 14 version of TR36.714-00-02, the 4^th^ IMD never impacts Band 1 Rx
because Tx-Rx separation is always kept in 190MHz. Therefore, specifying MSD
requirement is not necessary. For 4^th^ IMD impact on Band 41 Rx, it analysis
is captured in the MSD section.
#### 8.1.1.3 Co-existence studies for LTE-A UL CA_42C and DL CA_1A-41C-42C
For 2UL / 5DL own receiver desensitization study 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order
harmonics and 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ order intermodulation products
were calculated and presented in Table 8.1.1.3-1

From the harmonics analysis table, there was no harmonics from Band 42 uplinks
which would desensitize the 3^rd^ own Rx frequency of bands 1 and 41.
#### 8.1.1.4 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-42A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_1A-41C-42C, RAN4 needs to consider 4^th^ IMD impact on Band
41. However, when simultaneous Tx/Rx is not considered for this CA
configuration (namely, Band 41 and Band 42 are synchronized), 4^th^ IMD never
causes desensitization in Band 41 Rx. Since CA_1A-41C-42C was specified with
the assumption that simultaneous Tx/Rx is not occurred among TDD bands 41 and
42, it is reasonable to apply same assumption for this combination.
#### 8.1.1.5 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Comparing 1UL-5DL CA_1A-41C-42C, no difference is expected from UE
architecture point of view for this combination, same values for ∆T~IB~ and
∆R~IB~ as 1UL-5DL CA_1A-41C-42C shall apply.

When uplink CA configurations CA_3A-7A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A there are interference components from 2
uplink operation which would interfere the downlink of the Band 8 and Band 7.
When uplink CA configurations CA_3A-8A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A there are interference components from 2
uplink operation which would interfere the downlink of the Band 3, Band 7 and
Band 8.
And also when uplink CA configurations CA_7A-8A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A there are interference components from 2
uplink operation which would interfere the downlink of the Band 8.
However, these impacts are already covered in the fallback combinations as
mentioned in the previous section; no further MSD analysis is needed.

IMD3 and IMD5 of CA_7A-26A may fall into band 26 receiving band and IMD5 of
CA_7A-26A may fall into band 7 receiving band. . However, this impact is
already covered in 2DL/2UL CA_7A-26A. Hence there is no further self-
interference issue.
#### 8.13.1.6 MSD
When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-7A, CA_3A-7A, CA_3A-26A and CA_7A-26A are
paired with downlink CA configuration CA_1A-3A-7A-7A-26A there are self-
interference problems from 2 uplink operation which would interfere the
downlink of the bands 7 and 26. In addition, uplink CA configuration CA_1A-3A
was already captured in Table 7.3.1A-0bA in TS 36.101 [3].
However, these impacts are already covered in the fallback combinations as
mentioned in previous section; no futher MSD analysis is needed.

From the harmonics analysis table, there was no harmonics from Band 3 uplinks
which would desensitize the 3^rd^ own Rx frequency of band 1 or band 3 or band
7.
The close proximity issues between B3 uplink and B1 reception already captured
in Table 7.3.1A-0bA in TS 36.101 [3]
Frequency separation of Band 7 downlink and B3 uplink is 835 MHz, therefore
there is no impact from Band 3 uplink CA to the Band 7 reception.
