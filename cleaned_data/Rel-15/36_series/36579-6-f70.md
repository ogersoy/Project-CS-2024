# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# Introduction
The present document is part 6 of a multi-part deliverable covering
conformance test specification for Mission Critical Services over LTE
consisting of:
3GPP TS 36.579-1 [2]: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE protocol
conformance testing; Part 1: Common test environment\";
3GPP TS 36.579-2 [24]: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE; Part 2:
Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) User Equipment (UE) Protocol conformance
specification\";
3GPP TS 36.579-3 [3]: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE; Part 3:
Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) Server Application test specification\";
3GPP TS 36.579-4 [4]: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE; Part 4: Test
Applicability and Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS)\";
3GPP TS 36.579-5 [5]: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE; Part 5:
Abstract test suite (ATS)\";
**3GPP** **TS** **36.579-6: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE; Part 6:
Mission Critical Video (MCVideo) User Equipment (UE) Protocol conformance
specification\" (the present document);**
3GPP TS 36.579-7 [25]: \"Mission Critical (MC) services over LTE; Part 7:
Mission Critical Data (MCData) User Equipment (UE) Protocol conformance
specification\".
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the protocol conformance testing for testing a
MCVideo Client for compliance to the Mission Critical Video (MCVideo) over LTE
protocol requirements defined by 3GPP.
In particular the present document contains:
\- the overall test structure;
\- the test configurations;
\- the conformance requirement and reference to the core specifications;
\- the test purposes; and
\- a brief description of the test procedure, the specific test requirements
and short message exchange table.
The present document is valid for MCVideo Clients implemented according to
3GPP releases starting from Release 13 up to the Release indicated on the
cover page of the present document.
The following information relevant to testing specified in the present
document could be found in accompanying specifications:
\- default setting of the test parameters TS 36.579-1 [2];
\- Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS) TS 36.579-4 [4] and
Implementation eXtra Information for Testing (IXIT) TS 36.579-5 [5];
\- the applicability of each test case TS 36.579-4 [4].
The test cases are expected to be executed through the 3GPP radio interface.
The present document does not specify the protocol conformance testing for the
EPS (LTE) bearers which carry the MCVideo data sent or received by the MCVideo
Client and which are required to be supported by the UE in which the MCVideo
Client is installed. This is defined in TS 36.523-1 [6].
# 2 References {#references-1}
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.
