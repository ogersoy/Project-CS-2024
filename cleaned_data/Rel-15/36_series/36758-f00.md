# 6 Band plan allocation and regulatory background
## 6.1 Current regulatory background
**\- ITU-R allocation & identification**
According to international regulation, WRC-15 have allocated the 3300-3400MHz
band to mobile service and WRC-15 has identified the 3300-3400MHz band for IMT
in a large number of Africa countries. Below, the allocation of the
3300-3400MHz band:

**\- ATU Questionnaire**
According to the ATU questionnaire made at the end of 2016, a majority of
African countries will NOT have radar deployed in the future in 3300-3400 MHz
band and IMT deployment in 3100-3300 MHz band. Few Africa countries would like
to share 3300-3400MHz band between IMT and Radar.
Below, this is the summary of the administration's responses about the future
plan to use 3100-3300MHz band and 3300-3400MHz band. The following maps show:
\- The countries that, according to the ATU questionnaire, will have radar
deployed in the future in the 3100-3300 MHz band ^NOTE\ 1^ and the countries
that have signed footnote 5.429B in the Radio Regulations (identification of
3300-3400 MHz for IMT). This provides an indication of likely issues of
adjacent channel coexistence
\- The countries that, according to the ATU questionnaire, will have radar
deployed in the future in the 3300-3400 MHz band ^NOTE\ 2^ and the countries
that have signed footnote 5.429B in the Radio Regulations (identification of
3300-3400 MHz for IMT). This provides an indication of likely issues of co-
channel coexistence
NOTE 1: Countries that say they have identified the band for radar or have
these systems already deployed today and do not plan to change use, plus
countries that do not have radar today but plan to deploy it in the future

## 6.2 In-band services & adjacent band services in Africa
Based on the ITU-R allocation (see paragraph 5.1), find the summary of the
main other services than IMT in the band and in adjacent bands:
\- In-band => Radiolocation.
\- Adjacent-band =>
\- Below 3300MHz => Radiolocation
\- Above 3400MHz => Fixed; Fixed Satellite; Mobile
# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Frequency band arrangement
Taking into account that in the 3300-3400 MHz band there is only TDD
arrangement in the current draft Recommendation M1036 [3], it is proposed to
take into account in only the TDD arrangement as described just below:

# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 For BS & UE (unwanted regional emission level) in the band(s) 3300-3400
MHz
3GPP RAN4 questioned ATU about the necessity to take into account the
regulation in the 3GPP specifications for the 3300-3400MHz band for Africa
countries. ATU responded and the ATU's conclusion was:
_\- In conclusion, ATU is of the view that it is not necessary to introduce
further requirements in the 3GPP specification of the new band to protect
incumbent radar services._
Thus, the 3300-3400MHz band for Africa countries will not taking into account
any specific constraints to protect incumbent users.
## 8.2 UE sensitivity for E-UTRA
The reference sensitivity is specified in Table 8.2-1 for Band 52 for general
case:

For specific case, UE(s) equipped with 4 antenna ports, the following
additional requirements described in the table 8.2-2 is applied:
