# Introduction
In the 3GPP TSG RAN #75 meeting, a new SI "Study on Enhanced Support for
Aerial Vehicles" was agreed for Release 15 [2]. The study is to investigate
the ability for aerial vehicles to be served using LTE network deployments
with Base Station antennas targeting terrestrial coverage, supporting Release
14 functionality (i.e. including active antennas and FD-MIMO). The objectives
of the study are as captured in [2].
# 1 Scope
The present document contains the results and findings from the study item
"Study on Enhanced Support for Aerial Vehicles" [2]. The purpose of this TR is
to capture TSG RAN WG1 and WG2 understanding of the performance of Release-14
LTE networks when used to serve aerial vehicles like drones and to document
the identified further performance enhancing solutions to optimize the LTE
connectivity for aerial vehicles.
This activity involves the Radio Access work area of the 3GPP studies and has
impacts both on the Mobile Equipment and Access Network of the 3GPP systems.
This document is a 'living' document, i.e. it is permanently updated and
presented to TSG-RAN meetings.

# 6 Identified problem
## 6.1 General observations on UL/DL interference problem involving aerial UEs
The following are general observations on UL/DL interference problem in
scenarios involving aerial UEs:
1) In the DL, the percentage of aerial UEs experiencing cell-edge like radio
conditions (i.e., poor DL SINR) is much higher as compared to terrestrial UEs.
This is because aerial UEs, due to their high line-of-sight propagation
probability, receive DL interference from a larger number of cells than a
typical terrestrial UE does. In the DL, there is higher probability that the
number of neighbouring cells causing high level of DL interference at the
aerial UEs is higher than in the case of terrestrial UEs. For example, RSRP
statistics presented in Annex C.3 show that up to 16 cells causing high level
of DL interference can be observed by an aerial UE at heights of 50m or above.
2) If the eNB antennas are down tilted, an aerial UE whose height is above eNB
antenna boresight is likely to be served by side lobes of the antennas. Due to
the presence of possible nulls in the sidelobes, an aerial UE may possibly see
a stronger signal from a faraway eNB than the one that is geographically
closest. Hence, an aerial UE may be served by a faraway base station instead
of the closest one. DL pathloss and UL pathloss for an aerial UE may differ in
some scenarios where reciprocity does not hold e.g., due to different side
lobe orientations in UL and DL, or different channel characteristics in an FDD
deployment.
3) Measurement report as defined in the existing LTE specification may not
contain measurement results (e.g., RSRP) for all cells significantly
interfered by aerial UEs due to limit on the number of reported cells. When
the measurement results are ranked at the aerial UE by RSRP without
considering eNB transmission power, the aerial UE may report the results
corresponding to the cells with the highest RSRP.
4) The RSRP and RSSI characteristics of aerial UEs in the air are different
from those associated with terrestrial UEs.
## 6.2 Downlink interference on aerial UEs
Based on results from four sources presented in Table C.2-1 and results from
three sources presented in Table C.2-2, it is observed that for aerial UEs
uniformly distributed between 1.5 m and 300 m AGL in UMa-AV and RMa-AV, the
five percentile downlink geometry experienced by the aerial UEs is
statistically worse than the five percentile downlink geometry experienced by
the terrestrial UEs. Since the aerial UEs experience line-of-sight propagation
conditions to more cells with higher probability than terrestrial UEs, the
aerial UEs will receive interference from more cells in the downlink than a
typical terrestrial UE could. Hence, the degraded five percentile downlink
geometry experienced by the aerial UEs with respect to terrestrial UEs is due
to aerial UEs receiving downlink inter-cell interference from multiple cells.
Due to downlink interference from multiple cells received at aerial UEs,
increasing the ratio of aerial UEs requires higher resource utilization level
to deliver the same offered cell data traffic. The increase in resource
utilization level further decreases the spectral efficiency in the network,
which in turn degrades downlink throughput performance of both aerial UEs and
terrestrial UEs. This degradation in downlink throughput performance of both
aerial and terrestrial UEs is evident from results based on five sources
presented in Annexes D.1.1 and D.1.2. These results demonstrate that the
degradation of downlink throughputs is more at higher offered traffic loads.
Furthermore, it is also concluded from these results that the downlink
throughput degradation for aerial UEs is more significant than the downlink
throughput degradation for terrestrial UEs.
## 6.3 Uplink interference caused by aerial UEs
Based on results from three sources presented in Annex D.3, it is observed
that for aerial UEs uniformly distributed between 1.5 m and 300 m AGL in UMa-
AV, the presence of aerial UEs increases the UL IoT of both aerial and
terrestrial UEs. Since the aerial UEs experience line-of-sight propagation
conditions to more cells with higher probability than terrestrial UEs, the
aerial UEs would cause more interference to more cells in the uplink than a
typical terrestrial UE could. Hence, the increase in UL IoT with increasing
ratio of aerial UEs is due to aerial UEs causing more uplink interference to
multiple cells.
Due to uplink interference caused by aerial UEs, increasing the ratio of
aerial UEs requires higher resource utilization level to deliver the same
offered cell data traffic. The uplink interference caused by aerial UEs
degrades throughput performance of terrestrial UEs. The increase in resource
utilization level further increases interference in the network, which in turn
degrades uplink throughput performance of both aerial UEs and terrestrial UEs.
This degradation in uplink throughput performance of both aerial and
terrestrial UEs is evident from results based on five sources presented in
Annexes D.2.1 and D.2.2. These results demonstrate that the degradation of
uplink throughput is more at higher offered traffic loads.
Increased uplink interference may also cause performance degradation on UL
channels other than PUSCH. Under strong interference on PRACH resources,
successful detection rate of PRACH can be degraded and UE may transmit with
maximum transmission power as a result of power ramping. It may cause further
increase in terms of uplink interference and potential risk for eNB to
experience too strong reception power. However, no evaluation is performed to
assess the impact.
# 7 Potential enhancements for supporting aerial vehicles
## 7.1 Potential enhancements for interference detection
### 7.1.1 General
In the following sub-sections, potential solutions for interference detection
are presented. These solutions allow for detection of potentially air-borne
UEs causing excessive interference, including UEs non-certified for aerial
usage and UEs not implementing Rel-15 UAV functions.
### 7.1.2 UE-based solutions
DL interference detection can be performed based on measurements reported by
the UE, including the following measurements:
UL interference detection can be performed based on measurements at the eNB or
estimated based on measurements reported by the UE. RSRP, CSI-RSRP, RSRQ,
power headroom, maximum output power and used PRBs may be used as the metrics
for UL interference estimation in certain scenarios.
Existing measurement reporting mechanism can be enhanced to better enable
interference detection, e.g., by defining new events, enhancing triggering
condition and including further measurement results in the report.
Other UE based information, e.g., mobility history report, speed estimation,
timing advance adjustment values and location information can be used by the
network to assist interference detection.
### 7.1.3 Network-based solutions
Detection or identification of an aerial UE causing interference in UL may be
performed by exchanging information between eNBs. Examples of information
exchanged between eNBs that can be used for interference detection are as
follows:
\- uplink scheduling information or uplink reference signal (e.g., SRS)
configuration of aerial UE;
\- target neighbour DL transmission power exchanged with serving eNB and the
serving eNB can use the difference between the aerial UE's transmission power
and the UL pathloss between the aerial UE and the specific neighbor eNB;
\- any quantities reported by the UE, like RSRP/CSI-RSRP/RSRQ/RS-SINR/CSI.
The feasibility of exchanging the above information depends on the type of
backhaul and on the feasibility of exchanging these information over a large
number of eNBs.
## 7.2 Potential enhancements for downlink interference mitigation
### 7.2.1 General
In this section, potential solutions for downlink interference mitigation are
presented along with key observations. The simulation results corresponding to
these solutions are provided in Annex E. Caution should be exercised when
drawing conclusions from those results that were obtained under one or more of
the following conditions:
\- Results obtained at load points that were significantly higher than the
load points in the baseline assumptions.
\- Results obtained with an assumption that PDCCH SINR in the system is the
same as the PDSCH SINR even though the reuse factors for PDCCH region in the
system are lower than the PDSCH region especially if fewer UEs are scheduled
per subframe.
### 7.2.2 FD-MIMO
In this solution, FD-MIMO with multiple antennas at the eNB transmitter are
used to mitigate the interference in the downlink to aerial UEs. Since FD-MIMO
is supported since LTE Rel-13, enhancements are not needed.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex E.1. From these
results, it is observed that when the aerial UE ratio is increased from 0% to
50% in UMa-AV scenario, FD-MIMO can limit the mean terrestrial UE packet
throughput loss to 6%. When FD-MIMO is not used, the corresponding mean
terrestrial UE packet throughput is 23%. It is also observed that with FD-MIMO
and a per-cell offered traffic of 6.8 Mbps, a five percentile aerial UE packet
throughput of 9.54 Mbps can be achieved when the aerial UE ratio is 50%.
### 7.2.3 Directional antenna at aerial UEs
In this solution, the aerial UEs are assumed to be equipped with directional
antenna instead of an omnidirectional antenna. The directional antenna is used
to mitigate the interference in the downlink to aerial UEs by decreasing the
interference power coming from a broad range of angles. The following types of
capabilities in terms of tracking the LOS direction between an aerial UE and
the serving cell are considered:
1) Direction of Travel (DoT): the aerial UE is not aware of the serving cell
LOS direction and the antenna direction of the aerial UE is aligned with DoT.
2) Ideal LOS: the aerial UE perfectly tracks the serving cell LOS direction
and steers the antenna boresight towards the serving cell.
3) Non-ideal LOS: the aerial UE tracks the serving cell LOS direction, but
with errors due to practical constraints.
Enhancements are not needed if the use of directional antenna is left to
implementation at aerial UEs.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex E.2. From these
results, it is observed that when the aerial UE ratio is increased from 0% to
50% in UMa-AV scenario, using directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and non-ideal
LOS tracking at the aerial UEs can limit the mean terrestrial UE packet
throughput loss to 9% at high offered traffic load. When omni-directional
antennas are used at the aerial UEs, the corresponding mean terrestrial UE
packet throughput loss is 49%. It is also observed that with directional
antennas at the aerial UEs, the mean aerial UE packet throughput can be
improved by over 62% at high offered traffic load. The results in Annex E.2
also show that the performance of the aerial UEs depends on the capability and
accuracy of LOS direction tracking.
### 7.2.4 Receive beamforming at aerial UEs
In this solution, the aerial UEs are assumed to be equipped with more than two
receive antennas which are used to mitigate the interference in the downlink
to aerial UEs. Downlink interference mitigation can be achieved in this case
by using receive beamforming at aerial UEs. Since receive beamforming is up to
the implementation at aerial UEs, enhancements are not needed.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex E.3. From these
results, it is observed that when the aerial UE ratio is increased from 0% to
50% in UMa-AV scenario, using receive beamforming with eight receive antennas
at the aerial UEs can improve the mean packet throughput of all UEs by 7.3% at
low offered traffic load. With the aerial UE ratio kept fixed at 50% in UMa-AV
scenario, applying receive beamforming with 8 receive antennas at the aerial
UEs can improve the mean packet throughput of all UEs by 27.5% at low offered
traffic load compared to the case where the aerial UEs are equipped with two
receive antennas.
### 7.2.5 Intra-site JT CoMP
In this solution, multiple cells belonging to the same site are coordinated
and data is jointly transmitted to the UEs. Since intra-site JT CoMP is
already supported in LTE, enhancements are not needed.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex E.4. From these
results, it is observed that when the aerial UE ratio is increased from 0% to
50% and when intra-site JT CoMP is employed in the case with 50% aerial UE
ratio, the mean packet throughput of all UEs can be improved by 33.4% at low
offered traffic load in UMa-AV scenario. With the aerial UE ratio kept fixed
at 50% in UMa-AV scenario, employing intra-site JT CoMP can improve the mean
packet throughput for all UEs by 58.5% at low offered traffic load compared to
the case where intra-site JT CoMP is not employed.
### 7.2.6 Coverage Extension
In this solution, LTE Rel-13 coverage extension techniques are used to enhance
synchronization and initial access (i.e., SCH, PBCH and PDSCH carrying system
information) for aerial UEs. Since coverage extension techniques are already
supported since Rel-13, enhancements are not needed for this solution.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex E.5. From these
results, it is observed that under baseline evaluation assumptions, a
noticeable fraction of the aerial UEs in RMa-AV and UMa-AV are not in coverage
for synchronization and initial access. With LTE Rel-13 coverage extension
techniques, the aerial UEs in RMa-AV and UMa-AV can achieve synchronization
and initial access with 100% coverage probability.
### 7.2.7 Coordinated data and control transmission
In this solution, multiple cells belonging to the same or different sites are
coordinated. Data, common signal/channels (e.g., synchronization signal and
PBCH), and control channels can be jointly transmitted to the UEs. The
coordinated cells could construct a larger cell for aerial UEs, and
terrestrial UEs are served by physical cells without coordination,
simultaneously. A dedicated DL resource within the PDSCH region of the
coordinated cells can be reserved for these coordinated transmissions.
There would be specification impact from this technique. The details would
depend on the potential solutions for further study. It could include
signaling for indicating the dedicated DL resource, procedure updates for cell
(re-)selection and acquisition to apply to the coordinated cell, and cell ID
for the coordinated cell. The capability and complexity of UE's measurement
may be increased due to more cells measured. RAN4 requirement on the
synchronization of time-frequency among coordinated transmissions will be
needed. Enhancements on X2 signaling including capacity and latency may be
needed to coordinate multiple cells from same or different sites.
The evaluation results for this solution, taking into account PDCCH error, are
given in Annex E.6. For the case of high resource utilization for PDSCH,
throughput for aerial UEs is improved. At 95.4% resource utilization (e.g.,
the worst case can refer to the geometry results as shown in Annex C.2), for
the five percentile UEs, the throughput of aerial UEs is improved by 42.3%
with data and control coordination compared to 15.4% with only data
coordination, and the impact on terrestrial UEs is reduced from 8.5% with only
data coordination to 1.1% with data and control coordination. In addition to
the system simulation assumptions in Annex A.1, additional simulation model of
PDCCH error is given in Annex E.6. Detailed simulation assumption for
modelling PDCCH error is also shown in Annex E.6, and the gain of network
coordination on PDCCH needs further evaluation.
## 7.3 Potential enhancements for uplink interference mitigation
### 7.3.1 General
In this section, potential solutions for uplink interference mitigation are
presented along with key observations. The simulation results corresponding to
these solutions are provided in Annex F. Caution should be exercised when
drawing conclusions from those results that were obtained at load points that
were significantly higher than the load points in the baseline assumptions.
### 7.3.2 Power control-based mechanisms
The following power control-based mechanisms were studied for uplink
interference mitigation:
#### 7.3.2.1 UE specific fractional pathloss compensation factor
In this solution, an enhancement to the existing open loop power control
mechanism is considered where a UE specific fractional pathloss compensation
factor $\alpha_{\text{UE}}$ is introduced. With the introduction of UE
specific fractional pathloss compensation factor $\alpha_{\text{UE}}$, it is
possible to configure the aerial UEs with a different $\alpha_{\text{UE}}$
compared to the fractional pathloss compensation factor configured to the
terrestrial UEs. This solution requires standard enhancement to the existing
open loop power control mechanism in order to introduce the possibility to
configure fractional pathloss compensation factor in a UE specific manner.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex F.1.1. From these
results, it is observed that with the aerial UE ratio fixed at 50% in UMa-AV
scenario,
\- applying different fractional path loss compensation factors for aerial UEs
and terrestrial UEs can result in significant UE packet throughput gains for
terrestrial UEs (46.87-93.96% five percentile throughput gain and 27.04-42.48%
fifty percentile throughput gain) and significant UE packet throughput losses
for aerial UEs (53.20% five percentile throughput loss and 42.48% fifty
percentile throughput loss).
\- applying height dependent fractional pathloss compensation factors for
aerial UEs can result in significant UE packet throughput gains for
terrestrial UEs (74.6% five percentile throughput gain and 54.1% fifty
percentile throughput gain) and notable UE packet throughput gains for aerial
UEs (17.7% five percentile uplink UE throughput gain and 38.3% fifty
percentile throughput gain).
#### 7.3.2.2 UE specific P~0~ parameter
In this solution, the aerial UEs are configured with a different $P_{0}$ when
compared to the $P_{0}$ configured to the terrestrial UEs. Since UE specific
$P_{0}$ is already supported in the existing open loop power control
mechanism, enhancements to the existing power control mechanism are not
needed.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex F.1.2. From these
results, it is shown that configuring a lower $P_{0}$ for aerial UEs improves
terrestrial uplink UE throughput performance at the cost of aerial uplink UE
throughput.
In addition, UE specific fractional pathloss compensation factor
$\alpha_{\text{UE}}$ and UE specific $P_{0}$ can be jointly used for uplink
interference mitigation. The evaluation results for this joint solution are
given in Annex F.1.2. From these results, it is shown that joint UE specific
fractional pathloss compensation factor $\alpha_{\text{UE}}$ and UE specific
$P_{0}$ can improve uplink throughput of terrestrial UEs at the cost of
degraded uplink throughput of aerial UEs.
#### 7.3.2.3 Closed loop power control
In this solution, the target received powers for the aerial UEs are adjusted
taking into account both serving and neighbour cell measurement reports. In
this solution, the closed loop power control for aerial UEs also needs to cope
with potential fast signal change in the sky since aerial UEs may be served by
the sidelobes of base station antennas. Hence, this solution may require
specification enhancements for increased step size of
{width="0.5666666666666667in" height="0.22291666666666668in"}.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex F.1.3. From these
results, it is observed that with the aerial UE ratio fixed at 50% in UMa-AV
scenario, applying closed loop power control can result in a mean terrestrial
UE uplink throughput improvement of 39.22% and a mean aerial UE uplink
throughput improvement of 6.33%.
Modification to the power control mechanism to take into account interference
from neighboring cells can be considered. However, no evaluations were
performed to assess the impact of such modifications.
### 7.3.3 FD-MIMO
In this solution, FD-MIMO with multiple antennas at the eNB receiver are used
to mitigate the interference in the uplink. Since FD-MIMO is supported in LTE
since Rel-13, enhancements are not needed for this solution.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex F.2. From these
results, it is observed that when the aerial UE ratio is increased from 0% to
50% in UMa-AV scenario, FD-MIMO can limit the mean terrestrial UE packet
throughput loss to 2%. When FD-MIMO is not used, the corresponding mean
terrestrial UE packet throughput loss is 12%. It is also observed that with
FD-MIMO and a per-cell offered traffic of 6.8 Mbps, a five percentile aerial
UE packet throughput of 19.04 Mbps can be achieved when the aerial UE ratio is
50%.
### 7.3.4 Directional antennas at UE
In this solution, directional UE antennas are used to reduce uplink
interference generated by the aerial UEs by decreasing the uplink signal power
from an aerial UE in broad range of angles. The following types of
capabilities in terms of tracking the LOS direction between an aerial UE and
the serving cell are considered:
1) Direction of Travel (DoT): the aerial UE is not aware of the serving cell
LOS direction and the antenna direction of the aerial UE is aligned with DoT.
2) Ideal LOS: the aerial UE perfectly tracks the serving cell LOS direction
and steers the antenna boresight towards the serving cell.
3) Non-ideal LOS: the aerial UE tracks the serving cell LOS direction, but
with errors due to practical constraints.
Since the use of directional antenna is up to the implementation at aerial
UEs, enhancements are not needed for this solution. Depending on the
capability of tracking the LOS direction between the aerial UE and the serving
cell, UE can align the antenna direction with the LOS direction and amplify
power of the useful signal.
The evaluation results for this solution are given in Annex F.3. From these
results, it is observed that when the aerial UE ratio is increased from 0% to
50% in UMa-AV scenario, using directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and with DoT
antenna alignment at the aerial UEs can limit the mean terrestrial UE packet
throughput loss to 6% at high offered traffic load. When omni-directional
antennas are used at the aerial UEs, the corresponding mean terrestrial UE
packet throughput loss is 53%. It is also observed that with directional
antennas at the aerial UEs, the mean aerial UE packet throughput can be
improved by over 61% at high offered traffic load. The results in Annex F.3
also show that the performance of the aerial UEs depends on the capability and
accuracy of LOS direction tracking.
Uplink beamforming can potentially be used to mitigate interference although
the throughput of specific uplink beamforming techniques were not evaluated
[41].
## 7.4 Potential enhancements for mobility performance
In this section, potential enhancements for mobility performance are
presented.
Existing mobility enhancement mechanisms (e.g., mobility history reporting,
mobility state estimation, UE assistance information, etc.) can be assessed
first if they work for aerial UEs and if they need further enhancements.
Handover procedure and related parameters for aerial UEs, based on UE's
airborne status and location information, may be enhanced.
Existing measurement reporting mechanisms may be enhanced, e.g., by defining
new events, enhancing triggering condition, controlling the amount of
measurement reporting, etc.
Flying path plan information, may be used for mobility enhancement.
## 7.5 Potential enhancements for aerial UE Identification
### 7.5.1 Airborne UE Identification
In this section, potential solutions to identify airborne UE (i.e., UE which
is in a condition of flying) are presented.
#### 7.5.1.1 UE-based solutions
The UE can indicate that it is airborne:
\- explicitly, e.g., by using an in-flight mode indication, altitude
information or location information, or
\- implicitly by utilizing enhanced measurement reporting mechanism, e.g.,
introduction of new events.
#### 7.5.1.2 Network-based solutions
Network may be able to detect an air-borne UE based on mobility history
report/pattern. A flying UE may have different handover characteristics, e.g.,
less frequent handover, faraway handover target cell, etc.
### 7.5.2 Aerial UE Identification based on certification/license
**A UE indicates support of UAV** related functions **using radio capability
indication to the eNB. The eNB may use** the related UE radio capability to
identify that a UE supports UAV related LTE functions.
**Permission for a UE to function as an aerial UE in the 3GPP network can be
identified via subscription information. This subscription information may be
passed to the eNB via S1 signalling from the MME.** The eNB may use this
information together with capability indication to identify an aerial UE, to
perform the necessary control and apply the relevant functions.
The actual "aerial usage" certification/license/limitation of a UE and how it
is reflected in the subscription information is outside of RAN2 scope, and may
be provided from (non)-3GPP node(s) to a 3GPP node.
# 8 Conclusions
During the study, use cases, deployment scenarios and performance requirements
for aerial UEs were identified. The conclusions of the study item are
summarized below:
1) On DL/UL interference detection
> For DL interference detection, measurements reported by the UE were found to
> be useful. UL interference detection can be performed based on measurements

> cell (re-)selection and acquisition to apply to the coordinated cell, and
> cell ID for the coordinated cell. The capability and complexity of UE's
> measurement may be increased due to more cells measured. RAN4 requirement on
> the synchronization of time-frequency among coordinated transmissions will
> be needed. Enhancements on X2 signalling including capacity and latency may
> be needed to coordinate multiple cells from same or different sites.
3) On UL interference mitigation
> To mitigate UL interference caused by Aerial UEs, enhanced power control
> mechanisms were evaluated by multiple sources. Even with high density of
> Aerial UEs, enhanced power control mechanisms were found to be beneficial in
> limiting the impact on UL terrestrial UE throughputs.
>
> It is concluded that power control based mechanisms have the following
> specification impact:
\- UE specific fractional pathloss compensation factor: this solution needs
new specification to configure this factor in a UE specific manner.
\- UE specific P0 parameter: this solution does not need new specification.
However, if it is jointly configured with UE specific fractional pathloss
compensation factor, this solution needs new specification.
\- Neighbor cell interference control parameter: this solution needs new
specification to configure a neighbour cell interference control parameter
\- Closed loop power control: this solution may require specification
enhancements.
> To mitigate UL interference caused by Aerial UEs, LTE Release-13 FD-MIMO was
> evaluated by one source. Even with high density of Aerial UEs, Release-13
> FD-MIMO was found to be beneficial in limiting the impact on UL Terrestrial

> needed.
>
> UL transmission beamforming can potentially be used to mitigate interference
> although the throughput of specific UL transmission beamforming techniques
> was not evaluated.
4) On mobility
> As shown by simulation and field trial results, in some scenarios the
> mobility performance (e.g., Handover Failure, RLF, handover interruption,
> time in Qout, etc.) of Aerial UE is worse compared to a Terrestrial UE. DL
> and UL interference mitigation techniques listed above are expected to
> improve the mobility performance for Aerial UEs. A better mobility
> performance is observed in rural area networks compared to urban area
> networks.
>
> Additionally, existing handover procedures can be enhanced to improve the
> mobility performance. Identified solutions are captured in Section 7.4 and
> include the following:
\- mobility enhancement of handover procedure and/or handover related
parameters for Aerial UEs, based on information such as location information,
UE's airborne status, flight path plan, etc.
\- enhancing measurement reporting mechanism, e.g., by defining new events,
enhancing triggering condition, controlling the amount of measurement
reporting, etc.
5) On UAV UE identification
> UE can indicate a radio capability to the network which may be used to
> identify a UE with the relevant functions to support the UAV related
> functions in LTE network. Permission for a UE to function as an Aerial UE in
> the 3GPP network can be known from subscription information which is passed

> certification/license/limitation of a UE and how it is reflected in the
> subscription information is outside of RAN2 scope, and may be provided from
> (non)-3GPP node(s) to a 3GPP node.
>
> A UE, which is flying may be identified from the UE-based reporting, e.g.,
> in-flight mode indication, altitude or location information, by utilizing
> enhanced measurement reporting mechanism (e.g., introduction of new events)
> or by the mobility history information available in the network.
Based on the study, it is concluded that LTE networks are capable of serving
Aerial UEs, but there may be challenges related to UL and DL interference as
well as mobility. The challenges become more visible when the density of the
Aerial UEs is high. Both implementation based solutions and solutions
requiring specification enhancements are identified to address these issues.
To serve Aerial UEs more efficiently and limit the impact on Terrestrial UEs,
solutions based on specification enhancements are beneficial.

# A.2 Mobility Evaluation
## A.2.1 Mobility Parameters
For mobility evaluations, the assumptions listed in A.1 and Annex B are
applicable unless stated otherwise in this section.
Following values are agreed as baseline for mobility evaluations. Other values
are not precluded if companies are interested to study and submit more
evaluation results.

NOTE 1: For mobility evaluations, UMa-AV scenario as described in Table A.1-1
is baseline and RMa is second priority.
NOTE 2: 0 m AGL corresponds to ground UEs.
NOTE 3: Aerial UE height is constant throughout the simulation.
NOTE 4: Total number of UEs and ratio of Aerial UEs are same as in Annex A.1.
However, for mobility evaluations, all UEs are assumed to be outdoor.
## A.2.2 UE Placement and Trajectories
For mobility evaluations, each modelled UE starts at a randomly selected
location in the network. The UE then moves at the assigned constant speed at
the constant height in a straight line for the entire duration of the
simulation. The initial horizontal direction (bearing angle) is selected
randomly and uniformly. When the UE hits the simulation border (the wrap-
around contour), it wraps around and enters the simulation area from a
different point on the wrap-around contour.
## A.2.3 LOS/NLOS modelling
LOS or NLOS for an Aerial UE is fixed throughout the simulation based on
initial determination of LOS/NLOS.
## A.2.4 Time varying shadow fading
Time varying shadow fading for a moving UE is modelled by recalculating shadow
fading value based on standard deviation given in Table B-3 after the UE has
travelled distance of 25 m (based on its speed).
###### ### Annex B: Channel modelling details
The line of sight (LOS) probability for aerial UEs is given by Table B-1.
Table B-2 shows a summary of the pathloss models for aerial UEs. Note that the
distribution of the shadow fading is log-normal, and its standard deviation
for each scenario is given in Table B-3. Fast fading models for aerial UEs in
each scenario is given by Table B-4. The distance definitions used in the
channel modelling of aerial UEs are given in Figure B-1.

# B.1 Fast fading models for Aerial UEs
For fast fading modeling for RMa-AV aerial UEs between 10m and 300m heights
and for UMa-AV/UMi-AV aerial UEs between 22.5m and 300m heights, one of the
three alternatives in Annexes B.1.1, B.1.2, and B.1.3 can be used for
evaluating the scenarios with 2Tx-2Rx at the base station and 1/2Tx-2Rx at the
user terminal.
## B.1.1 Alternative 1
For RMa-AV aerial UEs and for UMa-AV aerial UEs, the following procedures are
used when evaluating with a CDL-D based fast fading model:
**[Step 1:]{.underline}** Follow steps 1-3 in Section 7.5 of [4] for UE
dropping, LOS/NLOS assignment and pathloss calculation; for LOS/NLOS
assignment and pathloss, Tables B-1, B-2, and B-3 are used.
**[Step 2:]{.underline}** Continue with steps 1-4 in Section 7.7.1 of [4] with
parameters defined in Table 7.7.1-4 of [4] for channel coefficient generation.
**[Step 3:]{.underline}** The angle values are further scaled according to
Section 7.7.5.1 of [4] with the actual LOS AOA, LOS AOD, LOS ZOA and LOS ZOD
of a dropped aerial UE as the desired mean AOA, AOD, ZOA and ZOD,
respectively; the desired angular spreads (i.e., $\text{AS}_{\text{desired}}$
in Equation 7.7-5 of [4]) to be used for scaling for RMa-AV and UMa-AV are
given in Table B.1.1-1 and Table B.1.1-2, respectively. Note that angular
scaling is applied to ray angles (i.e., $\varphi_{n,m,\text{AOA}}$ etc.) as
indicated in Step 1 of Section 7.7.1 in [4].
**[Step 4:]{.underline}** The K-factor of the CDL-D model is scaled to a
desired K-factor according to Section 7.7.6 of [4]. The delay spread of the
CDL-D model is scaled according to Section 7.7.3 of [4] with a desired delay
spread value. The desired K-factor and the desired delay spread values for
RMa-AV and UMa-AV are given in Table B.1.1-1 and Table B.1.1-2, respectively.
**[Step 5:]{.underline}** For ZOD in LOS conditions, an offset angle is added
only to the non-direct paths (i.e., to all the Laplacian clusters in CDL-D)
after the scaling of the angle values. This offset angle is determined from
geometry assuming specular reflection on the ground for RMa-AV and assuming
specular reflection on the building roof for UMa-AV. The offset angle
determination for RMa-AV and UMa-AV are illustrated in Figure B1.1-1 and
Figure B.1.1-2, respectively. The determined offset angles for RMa-AV and UMa-
AV are given in (B.1.1-1) and (B.1.1-2), respectively.
$\mu_{\text{ZOD},\text{offset}} = \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} =
\text{arctan}\left( \frac{h_{\text{BS}} + h_{\text{UT}}}{d_{2D}} \right) +
\text{arctan}\left( \frac{h_{\text{UT}} - h_{\text{BS}}}{d_{2D}}
\right)\text{.}$ (B.1.1-1)
$\mu_{\text{ZOD},\text{offset}} = \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} =
\text{arctan}\left( \frac{h_{\text{BS}} + h_{\text{UT}} - 2h}{d_{2D}} \right)
+ \text{arctan}\left( \frac{h_{\text{UT}} - h_{\text{BS}}}{d_{2D}}
\right)\text{.}$ (B.1.1-2)
**[Step 6:]{.underline}** For ZOD in NLOS conditions,
$\mu_{\text{ZOD},\text{offset}} = 0$ for both RMa-AV and UMa-AV.

For UMi-AV aerial UEs, a fast fading model based on the 'reverse' UMa scenario
is used where the base station is below the average rooftop height and the UE
is well above rooftop. In this alternative, the fast fading model in Section
7.5 of [4] is reused with the angular spreads at the base station and UE
interchanged.
## B.1.2 Alternative 2
For RMa-AV aerial UEs and for UMa-AV aerial UEs, the fast fading model in
Section 7.5 of [4] is used with the DS, ASA, ASD, ZSA, ZSD, and K parameters
modified. The modified parameters for RMa-AV and UMa-AV are given in Table
B.1.2-1 and Table B.1.2-2, respectively. For UMi-AV aerial UEs, the fast
fading model in Section 7.5 of [4] is used with the DS, ASA, ASD, ZSA, ZSD,
and K parameters modified according to [9]. In this alternative, all the
remaining parameters are reused from [4], including the cross-correlations
among the LSPs, the delay scaling factor, the XPR, the number of clusters, the
cluster delay and angular spreads, the per-cluster shadowing, and the LSP
autocorrelation distances. The number of clusters is modelled as in [9].

In this alternative, for RMa-AV aerial UEs, UMa-AV aerial UEs, and UMi-AV
aerial UEs , the fast fading model in Section 7.5 of [4] is used with K=15 dB.
In this alternative, all the remaining parameters are reused from [4],
including the delay and angular spreads, the cross-correlations among the
LSPs, the delay scaling factor, the XPR, the number of clusters, the cluster
delay and angular spreads, the per-cluster shadowing, and the LSP

# C.3 RSRP statistics for interference detection
The simulation results for RSRP statistics relevant to interference detection
are available in the attached excel spreadsheet. In these results, RSRP gap is
used as the metric where RSRP gap corresponding to the $N^{\text{th}}$
neighbour cell is defined as the difference between the RSRP of the serving
cell and the RSRP of the $N^{\text{th}}$ neighbour cell.
When considering uniformly distributed UEs at fixed UE height and fixed 2D
distance to serving cell, the following are observed:
\- interference from 1-2 neighbour cells can be observed by aerial UEs on the
ground within an average RSRP gap of 10dB.
\- interference from at least 9 neighbour cells can be observed by aerial UEs
at a height above 50m AGL within an average RSRP gap of 10dB.
When considering uniformly distributed UEs at fixed height, the following are
observed:
\- interference from up to 8 neighbour cells can be observed by terrestrial
UEs on the ground within an RSRP gap of 10dB.
\- interference from up to 16 neighbour cells can be observed by aerial UEs at
a height above 50m AGL within an RSRP gap of 10dB.
###### ### Annex D: Evaluation results with baseline assumptions
# D.1 DL throughput results with baseline assumptions
## D.1.1 Throughput results for terrestrial UEs
In this section, the downlink throughput results with baseline assumptions for
terrestrial UEs are presented for UMa-AV and RMa-AV. The results are given in
Tables D.1.1-1 to D.1.1-5. From these results, the following can be observed
for UMa-AV:
\- Increasing the ratio of aerial UEs in general leads to decreased downlink
throughputs for terrestrial UEs:
\- At 20% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 1,
Sources 1-3 and 5-6 show the following terrestrial UE performance for aerial
UE ratio case 5:
\- Source 1 shows 6. 06% mean throughput loss, 6. 45% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 14. 92% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 23.5% fifty percentile throughput loss.
\- At 50% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 1,
Sources 1-3 and 6 show the following terrestrial UE performance for aerial UE
ratio case 5:
\- Source 1 shows 30. 91% mean throughput loss, 42.57% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 58. 27% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 28.9% fifty percentile throughput loss, and 36.0% five
percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 3 shows 49% mean throughput loss, 65% fifty percentile throughput
loss, and 71% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 6 shows 40.35% mean throughput loss, 47.77% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 56.27% five percentile throughput loss.
\- With increasing ratio of aerial UEs, the degradation of downlink
terrestrial UE throughput is more at higher resource utilization values.

## D.1.2 Throughput results for aerial UEs
In this section, the downlink throughput results with baseline assumptions for
aerial UEs are presented for UMa-AV and RMa-AV. The results are given in
Tables D.1.2-1 to D.1.2-4. From these results, the following can be observed
for UMa-AV:
\- Increasing the ratio of aerial UEs in general leads to decreased downlink
throughputs for aerial UEs:
\- At 20% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 3,
Sources 1-3 show the following aerial UE performance for aerial UE ratio case
5:
\- Source 1 shows 15. 65% mean throughput loss, 16.29% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 25% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 26.1% fifty percentile throughput loss, and 7.0% five
percentile throughput gain.
\- Source 3 shows 38.22% mean throughput loss, 50.12% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 66.90% five percentile throughput loss.
\- At 50% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 3,
Sources 1-3 show the following aerial UE performance for aerial UE ratio case
5:
\- Source 1 shows 33. 89% mean throughput loss, 50.45% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 74.29% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 16.3% fifty percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 3 shows 36.90% mean throughput loss, 57.92% fifty percentile
throughput loss.
\- With increasing ratio of aerial UEs, the degradation of downlink aerial UE
throughput is more at higher resource utilization values.

# D.2 UL throughput results with baseline assumptions
## D.2.1 Throughput results for terrestrial UEs
In this section, the uplink throughput results with baseline assumptions for
terrestrial UEs are presented for UMa-AV, RMa-AV, and UMi-AV. The results are
given in Tables D.2.1-1 to D.2.1-8. From these results, the following can be
observed for UMa-AV:
\- Increasing the ratio of aerial UEs in general leads to decreased uplink
throughputs for terrestrial UEs:
\- At 20% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 1,
Sources 1-4 and 6 show the following terrestrial UE performance for aerial UE
ratio case 5:
\- Source 1 shows 8.14% mean throughput loss, 10.55% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 15.09% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 35.24% fifty percentile throughput loss and 64% five
percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 3 shows 12% mean throughput loss, 15% fifty percentile throughput
loss, and 37% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 4 shows 27.93% mean throughput loss, 21.40% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 10.45% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 6 shows 20.1% mean throughput loss, 21.57% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 1.96% five percentile throughput loss.
\- At 50% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 1,
Sources 1-4 and 6 show the following terrestrial UE performance for aerial UE
ratio case 5:
\- Source 1 shows 22.25% mean throughput loss, 29.49% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 42.40% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 72.65% fifty percentile throughput loss, and 55.20% five
percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 3 shows 53% mean throughput loss, 63% fifty percentile throughput
loss, and 70% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 4 shows 75.21% mean throughput loss, 73.67% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 35.82% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 6 shows 42.82% mean throughput loss, 37.83% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 24.39% five percentile throughput loss.

## D.2.2 Throughput results for aerial UEs
In this section, the uplink throughput results with baseline assumptions for
aerial UEs are presented for UMa-AV, RMa-AV, and UMi-AV. The results are given
in Tables D.2.2-1 and D.2.2-8. From these results, the following can be
observed for UMa-AV:
\- Increasing the ratio of aerial UEs in general leads to decreased downlink
throughputs for aerial UEs:
\- At 20% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 3,
Sources 1-4 show the following aerial UE performance for aerial UE ratio case
5:
\- Source 1 shows 7.35% mean throughput loss, 6.18% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 24.28% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 34.98% fifty percentile throughput loss, and 67.97% five
percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 3 shows 16.94% mean throughput loss, 23.66% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 39.16% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 4 shows 32.23% mean throughput loss, 36.21% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 42.93% five percentile throughput loss.
\- At 50% resource utilization, when compared to aerial UE ratio case 3,
Sources 1-4 show the following aerial UE performance for aerial UE ratio case
5:
\- Source 1 shows 16.85% mean throughput loss, 20.23% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 38.13% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 2 shows 68.11% fifty percentile throughput loss, and 81.15% five
percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 3 shows 62.76% mean throughput loss, 70.24% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 74.35% five percentile throughput loss.
\- Source 4 shows 61.27% mean throughput loss, 63.64% fifty percentile
throughput loss, and 68.17% five percentile throughput loss.

###### ### Annex E: Evaluation results with potential enhancements in Downlink
In this section, simulation results corresponding to potential solutions for
downlink interference mitigation are provided. Caution should be exercised
when drawing conclusions from those results that were obtained under one or
more of the following conditions:
\- Results obtained at load points that were significantly higher than the
load points in the baseline assumptions
\- Results obtained with an assumption that PDCCH SINR in the system is the
same as the PDSCH SINR even though the reuse factors for PDCCH region in the
system are lower than the PDSCH region especially if fewer UEs are scheduled
per subframe
# E.1 Evaluation results for FD-MIMO
In this section, the downlink throughput results for all UEs with FD-MIMO are
presented for UMa-AV. The downlink throughput results for all UEs are given in
Table E.1-1. From these results, the following can be observed:
\- Source 1 in their corresponding baseline results presented in Table D.1.3-1
showed that with an offered traffic per cell of 2.4 Mbps, the mean throughput
for all UEs in aerial UE ratio case 5 is decreased by 45.47% when compared to
aerial UE ratio case 1.
\- With the FD-MIMO results in Table E.1-1, Source 1 shows that with an
offered traffic per cell of 5.1 Mbps, the mean throughput loss for all UEs in
aerial UE ratio case 5 can be limited to 11% when compared to aerial UE ratio
case 1.
The downlink throughput results with FD-MIMO for terrestrial UEs are given in
Table E.1-2. From these results, the following can be observed:
\- Source 1 in their corresponding baseline results presented in Table D.1.1-3
showed that with an offered traffic per cell of 3.6 Mbps, the mean throughput
for terrestrial UEs in aerial UE ratio case 5 is decreased by 23% when
compared to aerial UE ratio case 1.
\- With the FD-MIMO results in Table E.1-2, Source 1 shows that with an
offered traffic per cell of 6.8 Mbps, the mean throughput loss in aerial UE
ratio case 5 can be limited to 6% when compared to aerial UE ratio case 1.
The downlink throughput results with FD-MIMO for aerial UEs are given in Table

# E.2 Evaluation results for directional antenna at aerial UEs
In this section, the downlink throughput results with directional antenna at
the aerial UE are presented for UMa-AV. Performance of the three types of LOS
direction tracking capabilities defined in Section 7.2.3 are evaluated.
The downlink terrestrial UE throughput results are given in Table E.2-1 and
Table E.2-2 for the cases where the aerial UE directional antenna has
horizontal and vertical HPBWs of 65Ëš and 35Ëš, respectively. From these
results, the following can be observed:
\- If the aerial UEs are equipped with directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and
with DoT antenna alignment, the mean terrestrial UE throughput loss at high
offered traffic load in aerial UE ratio case 5 can be limited to 26% when
compared to aerial UE ratio case 1. When the aerial UEs are equipped with
omni-directional antennas, the corresponding loss is 49%.
\- If the aerial UEs are equipped with directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and
with non-ideal LOS tracking, the mean terrestrial UE throughput loss at high
offered traffic load in aerial UE ratio case 5 can be further limited to 9%
when compared to aerial UE ratio case 1.
The downlink aerial UE throughput results are given in Table E.2-3 and Table
E.2-4 for the cases where the aerial UE directional antenna has horizontal and
vertical HPBWs of 65Ëš and 35Ëš, respectively. From these results, the following
can be observed:
\- If the aerial UEs are equipped with directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and
with DoT antenna alignment, the mean aerial UE throughput in aerial UE ratio
case 5 can be improved by 62% when compared to the scenario where omni-
directional antennas are equipped at the aerial UEs.
\- If the aerial UEs are equipped with directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and
with non-ideal LOS tracking, the mean aerial UE throughput in aerial UE ratio
case 5 can be further improved by 150% when compared to the scenario where
omni-directional antennas are equipped at the aerial UEs.

# E.5 Evaluation results for Coverage Extension
In this section, the coverage and downlink throughput results for LTE
release-13 coverage extension are presented.
The coverage results for aerial UEs with coverage extension for
synchronization and initial access in RMa-AV and UMa-AV from Source 1 are
given in Table E.5-1. From these results, the following can be observed for
synchronization and initial access:
\- With baseline evaluation assumptions, a noticeable fraction of the aerial
UEs in RMa-AV and UMa-AV are not in coverage.
\- With LTE release-13 coverage extension, the aerial UEs in RMa-AV and UMa-AV
can achieve synchronization and initial access with 100% coverage probability.
The downlink throughput results for aerial UEs with coverage extension for
RMa-AV and UMa-AV from Source 1 are given in Table E.5-2. From these results,
the following can be observed for data channels:
\- The use of coverage extension does not reduce the throughputs of
terrestrial UEs and aerial UE.

# E.6 Evaluation results for coordinated data and control transmission
In this section, the downlink throughput results for all UEs with network
coordination are presented for UMa-AV. For ISD=500m, up to seven adjacent
sites can be considered for coordinated transmission, and ideal backhaul is
assumed. Synchronized (time and frequency) and coherent transmission are
assumed among coordinated cells. The results from Source 1 are given in Table
E.6-2 to Table E.6-7.
PDCCH error for the evaluation is modeled as follows:
\- If the channel of a certain UE is LOS, PDCCH link level performance in AWGN
channel is used for determining the PDCCH BLER.
\- If the channel of a certain UE is NLOS, PDCCH link level performance in
fading channel is used for determining the PDCCH BLER.
Resource occupation of PDCCH is not modeled in the system level evaluation.
PDCCH BLER is only considered in the system evaluation to investigate the
impact on PDSCH throughput. PDCCH BLER is applied to both aerial UEs and
terrestrial UEs. **The coordinated transmission is only considered for aerial
UEs with lower SINR, and other UE including terrestrial and rest of aerial UEs
are served by physical cells without coordination, simultaneously**. PDCCH
error is calculated at a SINR point of PDSCH in the system level simulation,
i.e., network coordination for PDCCH is not explicitly modeled but indirectly
reflected by the SINR improvement via network coordination for PDSCH. It is
noted that SINR of PDCCH and PDSCH can be different. PDCCH error at a SINR
point leads to corresponding PDSCH reception failure. Simulation parameters
used by Source 1 for PDCCH link level evaluation are given below.

The downlink throughput results for terrestrial UEs without network
coordination and without PDCCH error impact are given in Table E.6-2.
The downlink throughput results for aerial UEs without network coordination
and without PDCCH error impact are given in Table E.6-3.
The downlink throughput results for terrestrial UEs with network coordination
on data of aerial UEs and with PDCCH error impact are given in Table E.6-4.
The downlink throughput results for aerial UEs with network coordination on
data of aerial UEs and with PDCCH error impact are given in Table E.6-5.
The downlink throughput results for terrestrial UEs with network coordination
on both data and control of aerial UEs and with PDCCH error impact are given
in Table E.6-6.
The downlink throughput results for aerial UEs with network coordination on
both data and control of aerial UEs and with PDCCH error impact are given in
Table E.6-7.
The throughput results in Table E.6-2 and Table E.6-3 are the baseline results
for terrestrial UEs and aerial UEs, respectively.
Based on these results from Table E.6-2 to Table E.6-7, the followings can be
observed:
Â­ Network coordination on data channels only can improve aerial UE throughput,
but reduces the terrestrial UE throughput. Additional network coordination on
control further increases aerial UE throughput, and reduces the impact to
terrestrial UEs.
Â­ The gain in 5 percentile aerial UE throughput by additional network
coordination on control can be higher when resource utilization is higher.

###### ### Annex F: Evaluation results with potential enhancements in Uplink
# F.1 Evaluation results for power control based mechanisms
## F.1.1 Results on UE specific fractional pathloss compensation factor
In this section, the uplink throughput results with UE specific fractional
pathloss compensation factor are presented for UMa-AV. Two different types of
simulations were performed:
1) the same fractional path loss compensation factor is configured for all
aerial UEs independent of their height;
2) height dependent fractional pathloss compensation factor for aerial UEs.
The results for the first type are given in Tables F.1.1-1 to F.1.1-3. From
these results, the following can be observed when all aerial UEs are
configured with the same fractional pathloss compensation factor:
\- Source 1 shows that in the uplink of UMa-AV in aerial UE ratio case 5,
compared to the case where the same $\alpha$ ($\alpha = 0\text{.}8$) is used
for both aerial UEs and terrestrial UEs, the following throughput improvements
can observed in the case where $\alpha = 0\text{.}8$ is used for terrestrial
UEs and $\alpha = 0\text{.}6$ is used for aerial UEs
\- 93.96% five percentile uplink UE throughput gain for terrestrial UEs
\- 42.48% fifty percentile uplink UE throughput gain for terrestrial UE
\- Source 1 shows that ninety-five percentile aerial UE uplink throughput is
decreased by 82.51% and equals 3.74 Mbps, which is much lower than the ninety-
five percentile terrestrial UE uplink throughput of 19.88 Mbps
\- Source 2 shows that in the uplink of UMa-AV in aerial UE ratio case 5,
compared to the case where the same $\alpha$ ($\alpha = 0\text{.}8$) is used
for both aerial UEs and terrestrial UEs, the following throughput performance
can observed in the case where $\alpha = 0\text{.}8$ is used for terrestrial
UEs and $\alpha = 0\text{.}7$ is used for aerial UEs
\- 46.87% five percentile uplink UE throughput gain and 27.04% fifty
percentile uplink UE throughput gain for terrestrial UEs when the offered
traffic per cell is 3.77 Mbps.
\- g53.20% five percentile uplink UE throughput loss and 42.25% fifty
percentile uplink UE throughput loss for aerial UEs when the offered traffic
per cell is 3.77 Mbps.
The results with height dependent fractional pathloss compensation factors for
aerial UEs are given in Table F.1.1-4. From these results, the following can
be observed:
\- Source 1 shows that in the uplink of UMa-AV in aerial UE ratio case 5,
compared to the case where the same $\alpha$ ($\alpha = 0\text{.}8$) is used
for both aerial UEs and terrestrial UEs, the following throughput improvements
can observed in the case where $\alpha = 0\text{.}8$ is used for terrestrial
UEs and aerial UEs below 100m, and $\alpha = 0\text{.}7$ is used for aerial
UEs above 100m
\- 74.6% five percentile uplink UE throughput gain and 54.1% fifty percentile
uplink UE throughput gain for terrestrial UEs
\- 17.7% five percentile uplink UE throughput gain and 38.3% fifty percentile
uplink UE throughput gain for aerial UEs

## F.1.2 Results on UE specific P~0~ parameter
In this section, the uplink throughput results with UE specific P~0~ parameter
are presented for UMa-AV. The results are given in Tables F.1.2-1 and F.1.2-2.
From these results, the following can be observed:
\- Source 2 shows that configuring a lower P0 for aerial UEs improves
terrestrial uplink UE throughput performance at the cost of aerial uplink UE
throughput
\- In aerial UE ratio case 5, with $\alpha = 0\text{.}8$ and 50% RU, comparing
the case where the same $P_{0} = - \text{85}\text{dBm}$ is used for all UEs to
UE specific P0 combination 3 (where $P_{0} = - \text{85}\text{dBm}$ is used
for terrestrial UEs and $P_{0} = - \text{88}\text{dBm}$ is used for aerial
UEs), it is observed that
\- mean terrestrial UE uplink throughput is improved by 13.44%.
\- mean aerial UE uplink throughput is decreased by 18.11%
\- with UE specific P0 combination 3, mean aerial UE uplink throughput is
15.02 Mbps, which is still higher than the mean terrestrial UE uplink
throughput of 9.03 Mbps
The uplink throughput results with joint UE specific fractional pathloss
compensation factor $\alpha_{\text{UE}}$ and UE specific $P_{0}$ are presented
for UMa-AV, RMa-AV, and UMi-AV in Tables F.1.2-3 to F.1.2-8. From these
results, the following can be observed:
\- With the same P0 and fractional pathloss compensation factor for all aerial
UEs, Source 3 shows that both UE specific P0 and UE specific fractional
pathloss compensation factor can improve uplink throughput of terrestrial UEs
at the cost of degraded uplink throughput of aerial UEs
\- Source 3 shows that UE specific P0 and fractional pathloss compensation
factor provides a mechanism to handle UL interference from aerial UEs which is
more robust to various deployment scenarios and traffic loads.
\- Source 3 shows that the appropriate P0 adjustment range for UE specific P0
and fractional pathloss compensation factor may be beyond the supported range
in Rel-8 (-8 dB and +7 dB)

## F.1.3 Results on closed loop power control
In this section, the uplink throughput results with closed loop power control
are presented for UMa-AV. The results from 1 source are given in Table
F.1.3-1. From these results, the following can be observed:
\- Source 2 shows that using closed loop power control solution, the uplink UE
throughput performance can be further improved
\- In aerial UE ratio case 5, with $\alpha = 0\text{.}8$ and 50% RU, comparing
the case where the same $P_{0} = - \text{85}\text{dBm}$ is used for all UEs to
the case where closed loop power control (with a target received power of
-94dBm for terrestrial UEs), it is observed that
\- mean terrestrial UE uplink throughput is improved by 39.22% and the five
percentile terrestrial UE uplink throughput is decreased by 24%.
\- with closed loop power control, mean aerial UE uplink throughput is
increased by 6.33% and equals to 18.20Mbps.

# F.2 Evaluation results for FD-MIMO
In this section, the uplink throughput results for all UEs with FD-MIMO are
presented for UMa-AV. The results are given in Tables F.2-1 to F.2-3. From
these results, the following can be observed for uplink throughput of all UEs:
\- Source 1 in their corresponding baseline results presented in Table D.2.3-1
showed that with an offered traffic per cell of 1.5 Mbps, the mean UE
throughput in aerial UE ratio case 5 is decreased by 12.90% when compared to
aerial UE ratio case 1.
\- With the FD-MIMO results in Table F.2-1, Source 1 show that with an offered

# F.3 Evaluation results for directional antennas at UE
In this section, the uplink throughput results with directional antenna at the
aerial UE are presented for UMa-AV. Performance of the three types of LOS
direction tracking capabilities defined in Section 7.3.3 are evaluated.
The uplink terrestrial UE throughput results are given in Table F.3-1 and
Table F.3-2 for the cases where the aerial UE directional antenna has
horizontal and vertical HPBWs of 65Ëš and 35Ëš, respectively. From these
results, the following can be observed:
\- If the aerial UEs are equipped with directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and
with DoT antenna alignment, the mean terrestrial UE throughput loss at high
offered traffic load in aerial UE ratio case 5 can be limited to 6% when
compared to aerial UE ratio case 1. When the aerial UEs are equipped with
omni-directional antennas, the corresponding loss is 53%.
The uplink aerial UE throughput results are given in Table F.3-3 and Table
F.3-4 for the cases where the aerial UE directional antenna has horizontal and
vertical HPBWs of 65Ëš and 35Ëš, respectively. From these results, the following
can be observed:
\- If the aerial UEs are equipped with directional antennas with 65Ëš HPBW and
with DoT antenna alignment, the mean aerial UE throughput in aerial UE ratio
case 5 can be improved by 61% when compared to the scenario where omni-
directional antennas are equipped at the aerial UEs.

###### ### Annex G: Evaluation results on reliability
In this section, the reliability results for command and control traffic are
presented in UMa-AV. Caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from
those results that were obtained under one or more of the following
conditions:
\- Results obtained at load points that were significantly higher than the
load points in the baseline assumptions.
\- Results obtained with an assumption that PDCCH SINR in the system is the
same as the PDSCH SINR even though the reuse factors for PDCCH region in the
system are lower than the PDSCH region especially if fewer UEs are scheduled
per subframe.
The results from Sources 1-2 are given in Tables G-1 to G-2. From these
results, the following can be observed:
\- Under the same aerial command and control traffic load in the downlink and
without further interference mitigation techniques except using dedicated
radio resources,
\- Source 1 shows that in aerial UE ratio case 5m, 50 m, 100 m, or 300 m
\- Using 15 PRBs to serve the aerial traffic can provide [99%] reliability at
the height of 1.5 m, 30 m, 50 m, or 100 m
\- To achieve the same reliability performance with the same number of PRBs
for aerial command and control traffic, resource utilization is generally
higher at a higher height
\- In aerial UE ratio case 5, without further interference mitigation except
using dedicated radio resources, Source 1 shows that to achieve 99%
reliability requirement with 15 dedicated PRBs for aerial traffic, resource
utilization at 30 m height is 11.26% and at 100 m height is 29.77%
\- When the resource utilization is not high, aerial command and control
packets can be transmitted within 50 ms latency bound with high reliability.
This is because the interference is moderate when the resource utilization is
not high. In aerial UE ratio case 5,
\- Source 1 shows that when the resource utilization is below 30%, 99%
reliability can be achieved at the height of 30 m, 50 m, 100 m, or 300 m
\- Source 2 shows that when the resource utilization is below 22%, 99.9%
reliability can be achieved for aerial UEs uniformly distributed between 1.5 m
and 300 m. Source 2 also shows that when the resource utilization is below
38%, 99% reliability can be achieved for aerial UEs uniformly distributed
between 1.5 m and 300 m
\- Aerial command and control packets can be transmitted within 50 ms latency
bound with high reliability with the following techniques:
\- Dedicated radio resources to serve aerial traffic (used by Source 1)
\- Proportional fair scheduler to serve aerial traffic and terrestrial traffic
in the shared radio resources (used by Source 2)
From the evaluation results, the following observations can be drawn.
\- Techniques such as reserved radio resources and proportional fair
scheduling are effective interference control and mitigation techniques for
serving aerial command and control traffic in LTE network deployments with
base station antennas targeting terrestrial coverage.
\- With proper interference control and mitigation, using LTE network
deployments with base station antennas targeting terrestrial coverage can
support aerial command and control traffic with high reliability.

The results from Source 3 are given in Table G-3. The results assume PDCCH
error modeling which is described in Annex E.6. From these results, the
following can be observed:
\- Considering the impact of unsuccessful PDCCH detection, less than 99%
aerial command and control packets can be transmitted within 50 ms.
\- 97.27% and 92.13% of aerial command and control packets can be transmitted
within 50 ms.
\- With network coordination with enhanced PDCCH, more than 99% aerial command
and control packets can be transmitted within 50 ms.
\- With network coordination for both data channel and control channel, 99.93%
and 99.12% of aerial command and control packets can be transmitted within 50
ms at low and high traffic, respectively.
