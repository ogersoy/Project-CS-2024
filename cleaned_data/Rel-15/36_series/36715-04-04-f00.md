# 4 Working Assumption
## 4.1 General
**This technical report is issued for uplink carrier aggregation feature by
using up to 4 component carriers in Band 41 and Band 42. As general working
assumptions, following aspects shall be considered:**
\- Synchronized operation between Band 41 and Band 42 (e.g. no simultaneous
uplink and downlink occur).
\- Using intra-band contiguous CA in Band 41 and/or intra-band contiguous CA
in Band 42 (e.g. intra-band Non-contiguous pattern is out of scope of this
TR).
\- The maximum number of CCs in each band is up to two
Considering assumptions above, scope of this TR is limited in following three
configurations;
\- 2 contiguous CCs in Band 41 + 2 contiguous CCs in Band 42
\- 1CC in Band 41 + 2 contiguous CCs in Band 42
\- 2contiguous CCs in Band 41 + 1CC in Band 42
## 4.2 BS perspective
There is nothing noteworthy working assumption for BS RF aspect in this
technical report. Analogical RF assumption for dual uplink inter-band 2 CC CA
with Band 41 and Band 42 should apply. What is different from 2CC UL CA is
requirement for maximum aggregated bandwidth which can be captured in sub-
clause 5.1.2. BS receiver shall support up to 80MHz aggregated bandwidth to
support feature described in this technical report.
## 4.3 UE perspective
In current version of TS36.101, two types of requirements are specified for
inter-band dual uplink carrier aggregation of Band 41 and 42 as below;
Table 4.3-1: Subtracted from "Table 6.2.5-2: ΔT~IB,c~ (two bands)" in TS36.101

Background of these specifications is caused by different working assumptions
on UE architecture. Detailed information is available in TR36.714-02-02. Same
contents should be captured in this technical report to understand why
different requirements are specified in TS36.101. Figure 4.3-1, which is
depicted from TR36.714-02-02, shows UE architecture which is optimized for
only downlink carrier aggregation to minimize the values for insertion loss.
One can see that Rx RF components are bonded between Band A and Band B by
diplexer while Tx RF components are isolated between two bands. With this
architecture, TR36.714-02-02 says this architecture could not be reused to
support dual uplink carrier aggregation of Band A and Band B.

Figure 4.3-1: Subtracted from "Figure 6.7.4-1: Architecture for 1UL TDD-TDD
inter-band CA" in TR36.714-02-02
Then, other architectures are considered to support dual uplink carrier
aggregation as shown in Figure 4.3-2 and 4.3-3.
Figure 4.3-2: Subtracted from Figure 6.7.4-2: Architecture for 2UL using a
diplexer" in TR36.714-02-02
Figure 4.3-3: Subtracted from "Figure 6.7.4-3: Architecture for 2UL using a
common triplexer" in TR36.714-02-02
As a result of discussion to support dual uplink carrier aggregation in Band
41 and Band 42, UE architecture in Figure 4.3-3 was assumed to specify
requirements. By taking into account RAN4 discussion in the past, it is
straight-forward way for supporting features in sub-clause 4.1 to re-use same
working assumption on this UE architecture. By applying this assumption, it is
expected that features reported in this technical report can have same
requirements as dual uplink carrier aggregation.
## 4.4 Others
3GPP has not identified specific working assumption to be described in this
version of technical report for supporting features described in sub-clause
4.1.

## 5.2 BS characteristic
### 5.2.1 Co-existence studies
**Since both Band 41 and Band 42 are operating bands with unpaired spectra, it
is expected that results for co-existence studies of BS transmitter would be
completely identical with those of UE transmitter, which is described in sub-
clause 5.3.1 of this TR. Hence, it is recommended to refer the sub-clause.**
### 5.2.2 BS RF impact
**Since current version of TS36.104 has already specified requirements for
inter-band carrier aggregation of Band 41 and Band 42, it is possible to
interpret that 3UL or 4UL inter-band CA by operating E-UTRA bands 41 and 42 is
supported from the specification point of view. Hence, it is expected that no
modification is necessary into TS36.104 for supporting feature which is
reported in this technical report.**
## 5.3 UE characteristic
### 5.3.1 Co-existence studies
As listed in sub-clause 4.1, the scope of this technical report is as
following three combinations;
\- 2 contiguous CCs in Band 41 + 2 contiguous CCs in Band 42 (CA_41C-42C)
\- 1 CC in Band 41 + 2 contiguous CCs in Band 42 (CA_41A-42C)
\- 2 contiguous CCs in Band 41 + 1 CC in Band 42 (CA_41C-42C)
Table 5.3.1-1 lists co-existence studies of inter-band up to 4 uplink carrier
aggregation with Band 41 and Band 42. It should be noted that co-existence
studies for 3 uplink carrier aggregation combinations are omitted in this
technical report because difference between three component carriers and four
component carriers is minimal. Only difference could be found in some of 3^rd^
IMD components, which are calculated by equations of "(fx_low -- max BW fy) -
(fx_high + max BW fy)" and "(fy_low -- max BW fx) - (fy_high -- max BW fx)".
Even if results themselves are different between 3UL and 4UL, 3 components'
results are comprehensive in studies of 4 UL. Therefore, there is no need to
capture co-existence studies with 3 component carriers in this technical
report.

Based on Table above, 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 41 and band
42 but as long as self-desense is concerned, there would be no problem since
features in this technical report assumes non simultaneous Rx/Tx, i.e. Rx is
not operated while Tx is active.
In addition, there are many possible fall-down into UE receive frequencies as
below:
\- 2^nd^ harmonics: band 46,
\- 2^nd^ IMD: bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 44,
46, 67 and 68,
\- 3^rd^ IMD: bands 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 21, 22, 24, 25, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 50, 51, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75 and 76,
\- 4^th^ IMD: bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, 39, 45, 48, 50, 51, 65, 66 and 70, 74, 75 and 76,
\- 5^th^ IMD: bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31,
44, 46, 67, 68, 71, and 72.
When more than 2UL inter-band carrier aggregation UE in Band 41 and Band 42 is
operating with other systems such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GNSS system, the
harmonics and intermodulation products can have impact on these systems. Table
5.3.1-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls
into one of these receiving bands.

### 5.3.2 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Based on working assumption on UE perspective in sub-clause 4.3, same UE
architecture which supports dual uplink carrier aggregation in Band 41 and
Band 42 is applicable for features described in sub-clause 4.1. Hence,
completely same values for ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ shall apply for CA_41A-42C,
CA_41C-42A and CA_41C-42C as well.
Table 5.3.2-1: ∆T~IB,c~
Inter-band CA Configuration E-UTRA Band ΔT~IB,c~ [dB]

CA_41A-42C 41 0.3 42 0.8 CA_41C-42A 41 0.3 42 0.8 CA_41C-42C 41 0.3 42 0.8
Note: Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with
uplink in two E-UTRA bands and without simultaneous Rx/Tx.
Table 5.3.2-2: ∆R~IB,c~

CA_41A-42C 41 0 42 0.5 CA_41C-42A 41 0 42 0.5 CA_41C-42C 41 0 42 0.5 Note:
Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink
in two E-UTRA bands and without simultaneous Rx/Tx.
### 5.3.3 Maximum Sensitivity Degradation (MSD)
**As a general working assumption for features in this technical report, sub-
clause 4.1 describes that synchronized operation between Band 41 and Band 42
shall be assumed. Since both bands are operating bands with unpaired spectra,
degradation caused by inter-modulation or harmonic distortions never occurs.
Hence, there is no need to specify MSD requirements for CA_41A-42C, CA_41C-42A
or CA_41C-42C.**
### 5.3.4 Spurious emission band UE co-existence for CA_41A-42C, CA_41C-42A or
CA_41C-42C
This clause summarizes the requirements for the carrier aggregation
configurations in this technical report for coexistence with protected bands.
NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the
lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be
set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2. The highest
frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be set at
the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the
measurement bandwidth defined for the protected band.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink assigned to E-UTRA bands 41
and 42 with 3 or 4 component carriers, the requirements in Table 5.3.4-1 apply
on each component carrier with all component carriers are active.
NOTE: For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA
bands 41 and 42 the requirements in Table 5.3.4-1 could be verified by
measuring spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second and
third order intermodulation products generated by the two transmitted carriers
can occur; in that case, the requirements for remaining applicable frequencies
in Table 6.6.3.2A-0 would be considered to be verified by the measurements
verifying the one uplink inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence requirements.

41 and Band 42 (two bands with three or four carriers)

## 5.4 Applicability of release independent handling
**For UEs which support features included in this TR, release independent
manner as specified in TS36.307** [X] **can apply.**
**TSG-RAN has agreed for certain features (see the following clauses) to
introduce them in a \"release independent way\". This means for each
feature:**
\- it is \"introduced\" in a release N, i.e. TS 36.101 [X] and TS 36.133 [X]
of release N define certain UE requirements for this feature; the feature is
indicated in the tables of the following clauses;
\- it is \"release independent\" starting from a release M (M\ **_\ _**
**_\- In case when non-contiguous carrier aggregation is transmitted,
requirements for adjacent channel leakage power, out-of-band emission and
spurious emission shall be satisfied under when maximum number of component
carriers are transmitting together._**
**_\- For UE, technical requirements per CC shall be satisfied under when all
of component carriers for these CA combinations are transmitting. This applies
for frequency error, occupied bandwidth, maximum output power and its
tolerance, adjacent channel leakage power, spectrum mask, spurious emission,
transmitter inter modulation, transmit off power, antenna gain, Rx spurious
emission and out-of-band gain. If exceptional requirements are specified for
each item above, above statement may not apply._**
**_\- For non-contiguous carrier aggregation, applicable frequency range or
the number of component carriers is not specified as UE requirement. For
intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation transmission, the number of
component carrier is two as UE requirement. No requirement is specified for
BS._**
NOTE: Above Japanese regulatory aspect is described by editor with translating
Japanese language document into English as accurate as possible. Hence, some
wording may not be directly same as Japanese regulation.
**For 3.5GHz (frequency range of Band 42), document entitled as "technical
requirements for the upgrading of 4^th^ Generation mobile communications
system (LTE-Advanced)" is also appropriate one. In the document, similar
requirements for carrier aggregation can be found as follows;**
> **_\ _**
**_\- For UE, technical requirements per CC shall be satisfied under when all
of component carriers for these CA combinations are transmitting. This applies
for frequency error, spurious emission, adjacent channel leakage power,
spectrum mask, occupied bandwidth, maximum output power and its tolerance,
antenna gain, transmit off power and transmit inter modulation._**
**_\- For non-contiguous carrier aggregation or inter-band carrier
aggregation, applicable frequency range or the number of component carriers is
not specified as UE requirement. For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation
transmission, the number of component carrier is two as UE requirement._**
**_\- No BS requirement is specified for applicable frequency range or the
number of component carriers._**
NOTE: Above Japanese regulatory aspect is described by editor with translating
Japanese language document into English as accurate as possible. Hence, some
wording may not be directly same as Japanese regulation.
In summary, Japanese regulation can be interpreted as follows;
\- The maximum number of intra-band contiguous UL CA is specified as two from
UE transmitter perspective both for 2.5GHz (Band 41) and 3.5GHz (Band 42).
\- The maximum number of inter-band CA is not specified both for uplink and
downlink.
Therefore, 3GPP understands that scope of this work item is comprehensively
categorized as the inside of current Japanese regulation and does not violate
technical requirements which are specified in "**technical requirements for
the upgrading of advanced broadband wireless access (BWA) systems** " and
"**technical requirements for the upgrading of 4^th^ Generation mobile
communications system (LTE-Advanced)".**
# 6 Conclusion
This technical report presents several aspects to support up to 4CC UL CA in
Band 41 and Band 42 with contiguous component carriers for each band. As
documented in clause 4, necessary working assumptions are documented to
support 4CC UL CA. By taking into account such assumptions, it was revealed
that BS RF impacts can be minimized or even no impact can be expected in sub-
clause 5.2. After that, UE RF requirements and studies are documented in sub-
clause 5.3. Applicability of release independent manner was also confirmed in
sub-clause 5.4 and its aspect is reflected into TS36.307. One of possible
countries to operate features in this TR is Japan hence Japanese regulatory
aspects are also documented in sub-clause 5.5.1. All of necessary requirements
to support the features are reflected into 3GPP technical specifications
TS36.101 and TS36.307. It is recommended to refer this technical report to
find not only technical requirements but also background, motivation, working
assumptions and/or regulatory aspects.
