# Introduction
Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception was first introduced
in 3GPP Rel-11and enhanced during the following releases. It is considered as
a tool to improve the coverage of high data rates, the cell-edge throughput,
and also to increase system throughput.
Inter-eNB support for CoMP based on X2 signaling was introduced in 3GPP Rel-12
and Rel-13. The preceding studies [3, 4] dealt with operability of CoMP itself
based on the assumption that the CoMP cooperating sets (CoMP sets),
determining the coordination areas, are determined and established as such.
This study therefore addresses the question of creation of CoMP sets and
management of these sets based on user and network traffic (including
signalling) conditions.
# 1 Scope
This Technical Report covers the outcome of the study item "Study on SON for
eCoMP for LTE" [2].
The present document provides use-case descriptions, possible solutions
relative to the described use cases, and analysis of these solutions. The
document is intended to gather all information and draw a conclusion on way
forward.
This activity involves the Radio Access work area of the 3GPP studies and has
potential impact on the E-UTRAN.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Objectives of the study
The objective of this study item is to identify scenarios and requirements for
a dynamic and automated SON-based CoMP area generation and to study candidate
solutions. Thus, the following objectives should be part of this study item:
● Identify scenarios and implementation requirements on network side needed
for autonomous SON-based CoMP coordination sets generation and update.
● Identify information and centralized / distributed procedures that may need
to be exchanged on X2 to facilitate creation and update of optimal CoMP
coordination sets maximizing the average and cell edge User Packet Throughput
gain.
The output of this SI should be aligned with the existing specifications of
other SI/WIs.
## 4.2 Evaluation criteria
The solutions presented as part of this study shall be analysed with respect
to the following evaluation criteria:
**Relevance:** Is the solution designed able to completely or partially solve
the problem captured in section 5.1 for the corresponding use case? Does the
solution enable convergence of the CoMP function on an appropriate time-scale?
What information is available to base the decisions on?
**Impacts on eNB:** Is the eNB's complexity going to be impacted and how?
**Impacts on network:** Are interfaces going to be modified and how? What is
the signalling level for the solution?
**Impact on configuration:** Is the network configuration going to be impacted
and how?
# 5 Problem to be solved and related use-cases
## 5.1 Problem statement and analysis
The problem to be studied is to identify those CoMP transmission points that
maximize the average and cell edge User Packet Throughput gain when
cooperating, taking into account real operating conditions, including:
● connectivity aspects, in particular backhaul performances;
● cell layout taking into account deployment and propagation irregularities;
● spatio-temporal user traffic distribution;
● temporary or permanent changes in network topology.
## 5.2 SON for eCoMP use-cases
### 5.2.1 Use-case description: Monitoring X2 backhaul characteristics
This use-case is triggered by the CoMP controlling unit (CCU) (centralized
case) or involved eNBs (distributed case).
The purpose of this use-case is to maintain maximum average and cell edge User
Packet Throughput gain following changes in X2 capacity available for inter-
eNB CoMP.
Considering the high level of cooperation and the signalling load between
nodes needed for CoMP operation, X2 performances (i.e. X2 latency and X2
bandwidth) have an important impact on CoMP operations. Furthermore these
performances are variable in time. For example different X2 transport routes
can change the latency. And X2 bandwidth depends on the overall load of the
backhaul network, but also on UEs connectivity and traffic (e.g. Dual
Connectivity). It needs to be noted that CoMP can achieve the best possible
gains only if the worst interferers are taken into consideration when
coordinating radio resources. Namely, if interference from such nodes and
cells is not addressed, there is a high likelihood that CoMP may result in
negative gains. This is also the case if the CoMP benefits metrics are
received too late (due to transport latency for example). Therefore, when
selecting the nodes and cells which need to coordinate resources within a CoMP
cluster, the selection shall always be taken first on the basis of how much
interference that node is generating to the UEs in need of CoMP coordination.
### 5.2.2 Use-case description: Spatio-temporal traffic variation
This use-case is triggered by the CAMF, which may be located in the E-UTRAN or
in OAM.
The purpose of the use-case is to maintain maximum average and cell edge User
Packet Throughput gain following changes in the spatio-temporal UE
distribution.
# 6 Potential solutions
## 6.1 Solution #1: Coordination Area allocation taking into account X2 link
characteristics
### 6.1.1 Solution description
#### 6.1.1.1 Functional aspects
The solution aims at updating Coordination Areas (CAs) taking into account X2
backhaul characteristics like latency and bandwidth for involved eNBs.
#### 6.1.1.2 Analysis of protocol impacts
##### 6.1.1.2.1 Overview
The solution includes signaling enabling eNBs to inform about characteristics
of their X2 links towards their neighbour eNBs, as well as signaling for
Coordination Area allocation.
Information exchanged on the X2 interface for this solution:
● X2 link characteristics towards neighbour eNBs like transmission delay,
maximum transmission capacity (data rate), cost per megabyte, statistics of
the link usage (e.g. information from which can be derived the risk of
congestion): X2 enhancement required, as further detailed in clause 6.1.1.2.2.
● CA allocation decision: X2 enhancement required, as further detailed in
clause 6.1.1.2.3.
##### 6.1.1.2.2 Information about X2 links
Inter-eNB CoMP requires X2 control-plane signalling as per TS 36.300 ("_The
coordination of multiple eNBs is achieved by signalling between eNBs of
hypothetical resource allocation information, CoMP hypotheses, associated with
benefit metrics_."). TR 36.874 [1] has shown the impact of X2 backhaul delay
on the achievable CoMP benefit.
Suitability will require low latency but other characteristics are also
important. Even if limited to control-plane signalling only, CoMP information
includes some scheduling information and will therefore typically be
voluminous and frequently updated. A consequence of this is that on top of the
transmission delay, information about the maximum data rate, cost per data
unit and link usage statistics should be considered.
This information can be measured or collected by the eNB on IP level. The X2
characteristics are variable in time, and can hence be considered as a load-
related information which could be transferred by the Resource Status
Reporting procedure or by the Load Indication procedure, implying periodical
and event-triggered reporting respectively.
There are also several options on how to represent the X2 link characteristics
information. The main options are:
● detailed information (measured latency, max bit rate, ...)
● composed metric, with 2 (e.g. "unsuitable", "suitable") or more code-points.
If the X2 characteristics information is conveyed using the Load Indication
procedure, signalling could be as depicted in Figure 6.1.1.2.2-1:
Figure 6.1.1.2.2-1: Example of Load Indication procedure (LOAD INFORMATION
message) conveying characteristics of X2 links between the eNB1 and each of
its connected peer eNBs.
##### 6.1.1.2.3 Coordination area allocation decision
The coordination area allocation decision is taken by a CAMF instance. In this
solution, the CAMF is located within the E-UTRAN. Main signaling options are
to enhance the existing Load Indication procedure (class 2) for this purpose
or create a new procedure. A new class 1 procedure would have the advantage of
including response and failure messages, and hence better support error
handling.
Figure 6.1.1.2.3-1: Example of new procedure conveying information about CA
allocation decision (e.g. designation of central unit and cooperating eNBs /
TPs).
The Coordination Area Update procedure conveys information about the
coordination area allocation decision, and may enable implementations to
include other information needed for CCF e.g. by following the principles
employed on X2 for inter-eNB CoMP. The present study has not concluded on the
feasibility of this approach.
### 6.1.2 Solution evaluation
**Relevance:**
> This solution addresses the \"Monitoring X2 backhaul characteristics\" use

> metrics need to be received in time, otherwise CoMP may result in negative

> result negative.
>
> Solution 1 is based on X2 signalling and will permit full flexibility in

>
> Information exchanged from participating nodes in the managed area will be
> available. This area is limited by the capability of the node in charge of
> CA management and the number of supported X2 links.
**Impacts on eNB:**
> Enhancement of existing signalling can be done by re-using existing
> signalling (e.g. Load Information). Furthermore the information about
> network layers is already available at the eNB. New functionality needed in
> the nodes acting as CAMF and the support of X2 interface instances to
> connect to all nodes in the managed area. Whether legacy eNB platforms can
> support this role is not evaluated in the study item.
**Impacts on network:**
> In solution 1 signalling is per eNB, and the periodicity can be configured.
> Therefore the signalling impact is limited. Explicit master/slave
> functionality for CAMF, in contrast to the agreed principle of flat LTE
> architecture and peer to peer X2 communication adopted for Rel-12/13 inter-
> eNB CoMP.
**Impact on configuration:**
> No additional configuration is required for solution 1.
## 6.2 Solution #2: _Use of CoMP and_ Coordination Area allocation _taking
into account degraded X2 link_
### 6.2.1 Solution description
_eNBs could monitor the performance of the X2 link by means of transport
network monitoring tools. If the backhaul performance of the interface between
one eNB and eNBs constituting the main source of interference for UEs to be
handled via CoMP is not sufficient to guarantee optimal CoMP efficiency, the
CCFis turned off for such UEs or the periodicity of the CoMP measurement
reporting and/or CoMP information can be adjusted until conditions resume to
acceptable performance levels._
_If the problems persist, CAMF located in OAM could collect information about
the X2 link characteristics and any actions as described above from certain
eNBs, make a decision of_ coordination _area and configure the eNBs
accordingly._
### 6.2.2 Solution evaluation
> **Relevance:**
>
> This solution addresses the \"Monitoring X2 backhaul characteristics\" use
> case (section 5.2.1).
>
> In step 1 solution 2 will be able to quickly disable eCoMP if the X2 link

>
> At eNB level the information available will be self-measurement from the

## 6.3 Solution #3: Adaptive Coordination Areas
### 6.3.1 Solution description
#### 6.3.1.1 Functional aspects
This SON solution aims to determine and adapt the CoMP coordination areas
according to the spatio-temporal UE distribution in the network. The principle
of operation is illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.1-1. Information describing the
spatial UE distribution is exchanged on X2, and CAMF adapts the CA allocation
in order to avoid concentrations of UEs on inter-CA borders.
Figure 6.3.1.1-1: Principle of CA adaptation for solution 3.
#### 6.3.1.2 Analysis of protocol impacts
##### 6.3.1.2.1 Overview
Information exchanged on the X2 interface for this solution:
● Information that determines the cell border area, e.g. based on RSRP
thresholds with respect to serving and neighbouring cells.
● Number of UEs within the cell border area.
● CA allocation decision (designation of the coordinating node (eNB) and all
other cooperating eNBs / TPs): same as for solution 1
##### 6.3.1.2.2 Information about UEs
X2 Resource Status Reporting procedures currently supports RSRP measurements
per UE. Important is however not RSRP measurement itself but spatial
concentration of UEs at specific locations, which is proposed to be derived
from RSRP measurements as described below.
The location of the UEs in terms of the cell border may be derived from RSRP
measurements of neighbour cells, e.g. by means of event A3 as illustrated in
Figure 6.3.1.2.2-1. The number of UEs in RRC connected state fulfilling the
specific criterion that assigns them to a specific cell border are counted.
Figure 6.3.1.2.2-1: Use of event A3 to determine the UEs located in the edge
area of the serving cell.
As shown in Figure 6.3.1.2.2-1, the UE position itself is not required but
only information whether it belongs to a cell border area as defined by RSRP
thresholds for serving and neighbour cells (fixed by implementation). The cell
edge area used for simple UE distribution analysis accommodates UEs from both
adjacent cells due to hysteresis of about Off~A3_HO_cellA~ + Off~A3_HO_cellB~
given by the two A3~HO~ event criteria. However, each eNB receives reports
only from its served UEs. The CAMF therefore gathers information from adjacent
eNBs / cells in order to determine whether there is a need to update the CA.
Several options exist for the choice of signalling procedure for this
information, e.g. the Resource Status Reporting procedure as illustrated in
Figure 6.3.1.2.2-2.
Figure 6.3.1.2.2-2: Resource Status Reporting procedure conveying information
about UEs.

## 6.4 Solution #4: OAM based solution for spatio-temporal traffic variation
### 6.4.1 Solution description
Either eNBs or OAM could monitor the user distribution. OAM could do this with
MDT. Alternatively eNBs could use existing mobility measurement (cf. section
6.3.1.2.2) and report the distribution to OAM.
OAM could then make a decision of updating the cooperation area based on the
above information and configure the eNBs accordingly.

## 6.5 Solution #5: Layered Coordination Areas
### 6.5.1 Solution description
#### 6.5.1.1 Functional aspects
This solution is based on layered CA allocation as indicated in Figure
6.5.1.1-1, where several allocated CA layers assigned to orthogonal radio
resources are realized with shifted CA patterns so that borders between
adjacent CAs are covered by an overlaying CA. The layered CAs are either
allocated manually based on network planning tools or are allocated in an
automated way based on Solution 3. Layered CAs present the advantage of
reducing inter-CA interference by assigning UEs to the best fitting CA layer.
Overlapping of shifted CA layers combines the advantage of network- and user-
centric methods on the expense of resource separation. Indeed, a given CA will
use a subset of the available time/frequency resources resulting in a need for
partitioning of scheduler resources between the CAs. This might cause some
peak UE throughput limitations. Therefore, CA layers should be activated only
when needed. To decide about the activation / de-activation in a certain area,
the information about spatial user traffic distribution, as described for
solution 3, is also beneficial for solution 5. However, in contrast to
updating the CA pattern as a whole, the SON function simply decides to
activate/de-activate a given CA layer by allocating or deallocating radio
resources to that layer.
{width="4.166666666666667in" height="1.2916666666666667in"}
Figure 6.5.1.1-1: Edges of the triangles show cooperating transmission points
serving a given CA. From left to the right, figures show one, two, three and
five CA shifts.
#### 6.5.1.2 Analysis of protocol impacts
Information exchange for spatial user traffic analysis to identify critical
cell edge areas outside the CoMP area is the same as in solution 3. In case
such cell edge areas that are not covered by CoMP have been identified,
another shifted CA layer is activated. On the other side, if the spatial user
traffic analysis reveals that there are no critical cell edge areas, the radio
resources for the corresponding CA layer may be released.
Information exchange on the X2 interface is the following:
● Reporting per CA for the purpose of resource allocation/deallocation for CA
layers:
○ number of UEs / associated traffic load for which the CA is a suitable CA
● Resource allocation decision per CA
### 6.5.2 Solution evaluation
**Relevance:**
> Solution 5 addresses the \"Spatio-temporal traffic variation\" use case

# 7 Conclusion
The present technical report builds on previously standardized inter-eNB CoMP
and presents methods to group together CoMP transmission points that maximize
CoMP performance when cooperating in real operating conditions.
It has been shown that solution (1) and (2) facilitate the creation and update
of optimal CoMP coordination sets by taking connectivity aspects into account,
although for solution (2) this is depending on the signalling time-scales
supported by OAM.
It has been shown that solution (3), (4) and (5) facilitate the creation and
update of optimal CoMP coordination sets by taking user distribution into
account. The solutions have different time-scales. MDT-based variant of
solution (4) may not enable continuous monitoring of all connected UEs.
Solutions (1), (3) and (5) require normative work in RAN3 (X2 signalling).
Solution (2) assumes OAM functions related to reporting backhaul congestion.
Solution (4) assumes OAM functions related to the cell border area monitoring.
Role assignment over the X2 interface in solutions (1), (3) and (5) would
break the agreed principle of a flat LTE architecture and the peer to peer X2
communication adopted for Rel-12/13 inter-eNB CoMP.
