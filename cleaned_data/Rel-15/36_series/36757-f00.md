# Introduction
**Recently clear market needs are observed to further boost the downlink peak
data rate to 1.2Gbps and 1.6Gbps, which requires support of 8 layers on a
single carrier to increase the spectrum efficiency. To achieve that goal,
utilization of 8 receiving antenna (8Rx) in downlink is a must.
Correspondingly, the new UE DL category 18 and 19 were introduced in TS36.306
with square brackets. And RAN4 is expected to specify the new RF, RRM and
demodulation performance requirements for them.**
**Many benefits can be achieved by 8Rx UE. It can significantly improve the
downlink throughput for a single user across the cell, and also enhance the
coverage for the cell edge users. Considering that 256QAM and even higher
order modulation scheme was and will be introduced, 8Rx would be one of the
efficient and robust ways to make the use of them feasible in the practical
operating SINR range. Besides, 8Rx UE with IRC has the capability of
cancelling more inter-cell interferers.**
To study the performance benefits of **8Rx** , a new study item \" Study on
LTE DL 8Rx antenna ports \" was approved at RAN #76 [1], and the current
document summarizes the study done under this study item.

From the results in Table 4.1.1.3-1, for TM2, 8Rx can achieve average 2.9dB
performance gain compared to 4Rx with the assumptions in Table 4.1.1.1-1 and
Table 4.1.1.1-2.
From the results in Table 4.1.1.3-2, for TM3 with dual-layer transmission, 8Rx
can achieve average 3.6dB performance gain compared to 4Rx with the
assumptions in Table 4.1.1.1-3.
#### 4.1.1.3A Miscellaneous observations
The observation in this section is not based on common understanding from
RAN4, and reflects individual interested company's own view based on the
independent evaluation results.
From Figure A-1 in Annex B for the single-layer MU-MIMO scenario, some company
observes that:
a. The gain obtained from 8Rx reduces to about 1.5dB compared to 4Rx in low
correlation cases;
b. If the same Medium Correlation A (MedCorrA) is applied, 8Rx slightly
underperforms 4Rx;
c. 8Rx with MedCorrB obtains about 3dB gain against 4Rx with MedCorrA at 70%
of maximum configured throughput.
From Figure A-2 for the TM9 with dual-layer case, it is observed that, for SNR
greater than 30dB and Medium Correlation A case, 4×4 antenna configuration
obtains slightly higher throughput than 4×8 antenna configuration.
Some company views that the combination of medium correlation A and 8Rx ULA
antenna model considered in Figure A-1 is too pessimistic assumption, and XPOL
antenna model can better represent the practical 8Rx UE implementation.

Based on the reference channel R.31-7 FDD and R.68-4 FDD of existing SDR tests
for 4Rx, the achieved maximum TP are 126.6Mbps and 168.8Mbps for 64QAM and 256
QAM. The 8Rx can achieve 73% and 74% SDR gain compared to 4Rx for 64QAM and
256QAM respectively.
#### 4.1.2.3A Miscellaneous observation
The observation in this section is not based on common understanding from RAN4
and reflects individual interested company's own view based on the independent
simulation results. Good low antenna correlation can be maintained in the
practical implementation.
From Figure A-3 in Annex B, some company observes that the throughput
performance of rank=8 degrades dramatically with a slight increase in β from
zero to 10^-6^. Therefore, in order to achieve satisfactory performance by
using 8Rx for ranks higher than 4, good low antenna correlation has to be
maintained.
Some company views that the combination of larger β and 8Rx ULA antenna model
considered in Figure A-3 is too pessimistic assumption, and XPOL antenna model
can better represent the practical 8Rx UE implementation.

From the evaluation results in Table 4.2.3-1, with the same CCE aggregation
level for both 8Rx and 4Rx, 8Rx can achieve average 3dB performance gain
compared to 4Rx with 4CCE aggregation level. 8Rx with 2CCE aggregation level
has slight performance gain compared to 4Rx with 4CCE aggregation level. It is
also observed that Pm-dsg performance gain of 8Rx is realized at very low SNR
under -5dB where UE may have handed over to a new target cell, or achieved at
extremely low Pm-dsg regime under 0.1% which may not improve effective PDSCH
throughput.

### 5.1.2 WI scope and objectives
The objectives of the RF part are to define the RF requirements of 8Rx feature
including operating bands and the REFSENS in the WI scope.
Only single carrier requirements are in the scope of 8Rx, no new Tx
requirements are expected. For Rx requirements, only REFSENS is defined for
8Rx feature.
## 5.2 UE RRM requirements
### 5.2.1 WI scope and objectives
The objective w.r.t. RRM is to identify the scope and objective of RRM core
and performance requirements for 8Rx.
### 5.2.2 Identified RRM scope and objectives {#identified-rrm-scope-and-
objectives .list-paragraph}
The RRM scope was widely discussed in RAN4 #84 (R4-1707422 and R4-1708245).
The consensus was captured in the WF R4-1709087:
\- No new RRM requirement shall be defined for 8Rx
\- No new RLM requirement shall be defined for 8Rx
\- UE is only required to pass the legacy 2Rx or 4Rx RLM testing
Therefore, no new RRM core requirements and test cases shall be defined for
8Rx. In performance part, testing applicability rule will be defined for
enabling 8Rx UE to pass the legacy 2Rx or 4Rx RLM test cases.
## 5.3 UE demodulation/CSI requirements
### 5.3.1 WI scope and objectives
Based on the evaluation results of 8Rx PDSCH and taking workload into account,
the following aspects are recommended to be specified in the WI phase,
\- Define channel model for downlink 8Rx antennas.
\- Specify the antenna configuration and MIMO channel correlation matrices for
8Rx antennas;
\- Specify the static channel matrix;
\- Define test cases for the rank lower than or equal to 4.
\- Adopt the test cases studied in SI to define requirements.
\- Define test cases for the rank higher than 4 in fading channel.
\- Base on combinations of rank and MCS that can achieve the maximum
configured throughput.
\- Define SDR tests for 8Rx.
\- Define CSI tests for 8Rx.
Considering the test coverage of 8Rx, test applicability rule is needed to
define.
\- Define applicability rule of existing performance requirements for 8Rx
capable UEs.
Based on the observations from PCFICH/PDCCH evaluation results, no test case
for PCFICH/PDCCH with 8Rx will be introduced.
# 6 Conclusions
This technical report documents the RAN4 study on LTE DL 8Rx antenna ports.
The objectives of the SI include **evaluating of PDSCH demodulation
performance with 8Rx for the transmission with rank lower than or equal to 4
and rank higher than 4, evaluating of PCFICH/PDCCH demodulation performance
with 8Rx, and identifying the UE RF, RRM and UE performance requirements which
will be specified** in WI phase.
The evaluation results are summarised in the following,
\- For PDSCH demodulation performance with 8Rx for the transmission with rank
lower than or equal to 4
\- **For TM2, 8Rx can achieve** average 2.9dB performance gain compared to
4Rx**.**
\- **For** TM3 with dual-layer transmission, 8Rx can achieve average 3.6dB
performance gain compared to 4Rx**.**
\- For PDSCH demodulation performance with 8Rx for the transmission with rank
higher than 4
\- In EPA5 channel model with low correction, when Table 7.1.7.1-1 in TS36.213
(64QAM MCS table) is used, the average throughput gain of 8Rx with Rank>4 with
respect to 4Rx with rank=4 is as large as 47.4% and 55.6% at SNR of 36dB and
40dB respectively. And when Table 7.1.7.1-1A in TS36.213 (256QAM MCS table) is
used, the throughput gain of 8Rx with Rank> 4 with respect to 4Rx with rank=4
is as large as 28.3% at 40dB SNR where the highest gain is observed under
rank=7 transmission.
\- For SDR, the 8Rx can achieve 73% and 74% SDR gain compared to 4Rx for 64QAM
and 256QAM respectively.
\- PCFICH/PDCCH demodulation performance with 8Rx
\- With the same CCE aggregation level for both 8Rx and 4Rx, 8Rx can achieve
average 3dB performance gain compared to 4Rx with 4CCE aggregation level**.
8Rx with 2CCE aggregation level has slight performance gain compared to 4Rx
with 4CCE aggregation level.**
\- **It is observed that the PDCCH/PCFICH demodulation performance gain from
8Rx is either achieved at the SNR lower than -5dB where UE may have handed
over to a new cell, or at a Pm-dsg below 1% that brings little improvement on
the effective PDSCH throughput.**
Considering the performance evaluation results as well as the test coverage
and workload, for the requirements in the follow-up work item, it is
recommended to:
\- **For** UE RF requirements
\- Define the single carrier RF requirements of 8Rx feature
\- No new Tx requirements are expected.
\- Introduce the operating bands to support 8Rx antennas.
\- Define reference sensitivity for the bands supporting 8Rx antennas
\- For UE RRM requirements
\- No new RRM requirement shall be defined for 8Rx
\- No new RLM requirement shall be defined for 8Rx
\- UE is only required to pass the legacy 2Rx or 4Rx RLM testing
\- In performance part, testing applicability rule will be defined for
enabling 8Rx UE to pass the legacy 2Rx or 4Rx RLM test cases.
\- For UE demodulation/CSI requirements
\- Define channel model for downlink 8Rx antennas
\- Specify the antenna configuration and MIMO channel correlation matrices for
8Rx antennas;
\- Specify the static channel model;
\- Define test cases for the rank lower than or equal to 4.
\- Adopt the test cases studied in SI to define requirements.
\- Define test cases for the rank higher than 4 in fading channel.
\- Base on combinations of rank and MCS that can achieve the maximum
configured throughput.
\- Define SDR test for 8Rx in WI.
\- Define CSI test for 8Rx.
> Considering the test coverage of 8Rx, test applicability rule is needed to
> define.
\- Define applicability rule of existing performance requirements for 8Rx
capable UEs.
> Considering the observation from PCFICH/PDCCH evaluation results, no test
> cases for PCFICH/PDCCH with 8Rx will be introduced.
\- No PDCCH/PCFICH demodulation requirement shall be defined for 8Rx.
