# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
In this specification, (parts of) procedures and messages specified for the UE
equally apply to the RN for functionality necessary for the RN. There are also
(parts of) procedures and messages which are only applicable to the RN in its
communication with the E-UTRAN, in which case the specification denotes the RN
instead of the UE. Such RN‑specific aspects are not applicable to the UE.
This specification covers MR-DC i.e. the case in which the UE is configured
with resources belonging to another node using NR RAT. The NR related
configuration is performed using NR RRC as specified in TS 38.331 [82].
NB-IoT is a non backward compatible variant of E-UTRAN supporting a reduced
set of functionality. In this specification, (parts of) procedures and
messages specified for the UE equally apply to the UE in NB-IoT. There are
also some features and related procedures and messages that are not supported
by UEs in NB-IoT.
In particular, the following features are not supported in NB-IoT and
corresponding procedures and messages do not apply to the UE in NB-IoT:
\- Connected mode mobility (Handover and measurement reporting);
\- Inter-RAT cell reselection or inter-RAT mobility in connected mode;
\- E-UTRA connected to 5GC;
\- RRC_INACTIVE;
\- CSG;
\- Relay Node (RN);
\- Carrier Aggregation (CA);
\- Dual connectivity (DC);
\- Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC);
\- PDCP duplication;
\- GBR (QoS);
\- ACB, EAB, SSAC and ACDC;
\- MBMS, except for MBMS via SC-PTM in Idle mode;
\- Self-configuration and self-optimisation;
\- Measurement logging and reporting for network performance optimisation;
\- Public warning systems e.g. CMAS, ETWS and PWS;
\- Broadcast of positioning assistance data;
\- Real time services (including emergency call);
\- CS services and CS fallback;
\- In-device coexistence;
\- RAN assisted WLAN interworking;
\- Network-assisted interference cancellation/suppression;
\- Sidelink (including direct communication and direct discovery).
NOTE: In regard to mobility, NB-IoT is a separate RAT from E-UTRAN.
In this specification, there are also (parts of) procedures and messages which
are only applicable to UEs in NB-IoT, in which case this is stated explicitly.
This specification is organised as follows:
\- clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;
\- clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as the
services expected from lower layers;
\- clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;
\- clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
\- clause 6 specifies the RRC message in a mixed format (i.e. tabular & ASN.1
together);
\- clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants)
and counters to be used by the UE;
\- clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;
\- clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;
\- clause 10 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network nodes;
\- clause 11 specifies the UE capability related constraints and performance
requirements.
## 4.2 Architecture
### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is in RRC_CONNECTED when an RRC connection has been established or in
RRC_INACTIVE (if the UE is connected to 5GC) when RRC connection is suspended.
If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in
RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
\- **RRC_IDLE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers (not applicable for NB-
IoT);
\- UE controlled mobility;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors a Paging channel to detect incoming calls (by CN paging), system
information change, for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification, and for CMAS
capable UEs, CMAS notification;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Acquires system information;
\- Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time
for logged measurement configured UEs;
\- May perform EDT.
**\- RRC_INACTIVE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
\- A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
\- The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
\- The UE:
> \- Applies RRC_IDLE procedures unless specified otherwise;
>
> \- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging
> using fullI-RNTI;
>
> \- Performs periodic RAN-based notification area update;
>
> \- Performs RAN-based notification area update when moving out of the
> configured RAN-based notification area.
\- **RRC_CONNECTED** :
\- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
\- For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the
PCell, for increased bandwidth;
\- For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for
increased bandwidth;
\- For UEs supporting (NG)EN-DC, option to configure one NR SCG in conjunction
with the MCG for DRBs and SRBs, for improved performance (SRBs) and increased
bandwidth (DRBs);
> \- For UEs supporting NE-DC, option to configure one SCG in conjunction with
> the NR MCG for DRBs and SRBs, for improved performance (SRBs) and increased
> bandwidth (DRBs);
\- Network controlled mobility, i.e. handover and cell change order with
optional network assistance (NACC) to GERAN (not applicable for NB-IoT);
\- The UE:
\- Monitors a Paging channel and/ or System Information Block Type 1 contents
to detect system information change, for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification,
and for CMAS capable UEs, CMAS notification (not applicable for BL UEs, UEs in
CE and NB-IoT UEs);
\- Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to
determine if data is scheduled for it;
\- Provides channel quality and feedback information (not applicable for NB-
IoT);
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting (not
applicable for NB-IoT);
\- Acquires system information (not applicable for BL UEs, UEs in CE and NB-
IoT UEs).
NOTE: The term \"UE is connected to 5GC\" covers the scenarios that the UE is
connected to 5GC and the UE is requesting to connect with 5GC.
Figure 4.2.1-1 not only provides an overview of the RRC states in E-UTRA/EPC,
but also illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRA/EPC, UTRAN and GERAN.

E-UTRA/5GC, CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD. The details of the CDMA2000
state models are out of the scope of this specification.

The inter-RAT handover procedure(s) supports the case of signalling,
conversational services, non-conversational services and combinations of
these.
In addition to the state transitions shown in figures above, there is support
for connection release with redirection information from E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED
to GERAN, UTRAN, CDMA2000 (HRPD Idle/ 1xRTT Dormant mode) and NR. A UE in
RRC_INACTIVE enters RRC_IDLE when it enters another RAT or switches to another
CN type.
For NB-IoT, mobility between E-UTRA and UTRAN, GERAN and between E-UTRA and
CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD is not supported at AS level and hence only
the E-UTRA states depicted in Figure 4.2.1-1 are applicable.
### 4.2.2 Signalling radio bearers
\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RB) that are
used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the
following SRBs are defined:
\- SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
\- SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as
well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH
logical channel;
\- For NB-IoT, SRB1bis is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked
NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the activation of security,
all using DCCH logical channel;
\- SRB2 is for RRC messages which include logged measurement information as
well as for NAS messages, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-
priority than SRB1 and is always configured by E-UTRAN after security
activation. SRB2 is not applicable for NB-IoT;
\- SRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement
reporting information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB4 can only be
configured by E-UTRAN after security activation. SRB4 is not applicable for
NB-IoT.
In downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e.
with joint success/ failure) procedure: bearer establishment/ modification/
release. In uplink NAS message piggybacking is used only for transferring the
initial NAS message during connection setup.
NOTE 1: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC
messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB4, including
those containing NAS or non-3GPP messages, are integrity protected and
ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering
to the NAS messages.
For a UE configured with DC, all RRC messages, regardless of the SRB used and
both in downlink and uplink, are transferred via the MCG. In case of EN-DC,
after connection establishment NR PDCP may be configured for both SRB1 and
SRB2 and if so, these SRBs may be configured as split SRB. In case of NGEN-DC
and NE-DC, NR PDCP is always configured. For a split SRB, the UE receives RRC
messages via both MCG and NR SCG i.e. handles out of order and duplicate PDUs
as specified in TS 38.323 [83]. For a split SRB, the network configures via
which cell group(s) the UE sends uplink RRC messages.
NOTE 2: In case of (NG)EN-DC, SRB3 may be configured for the transfer of some
NR RRC messages between UE and SgNB via the NR radio interface, see TS 38.331
[82].
An SRB can be configured with PDCP duplication, either by two logical channels
within the same CG (CA duplication) or by two logical channels each within a
different CG (DC duplication).
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
\- Broadcast of common control information;
\- Broadcast of positioning assistance data;
\- Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE, e.g. about a terminating
call, for ETWS, for CMAS;
\- Transfer of dedicated control information, i.e. information for one
specific UE.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower
layers:
\- PDCP: integrity protection and ciphering;
\- RLC: reliable and in-sequence transfer of information, without introducing
duplicates and with support for segmentation and concatenation.

Resumption and RRC context information transfer are applicable.
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of RBs carrying user data (DRBs);
\- Radio configuration control including e.g. assignment/ modification of ARQ

\- the PDU if the SDU has been processed by RRC;
\- The data available for transmission in upper layers not submitted to the
RRC layer.
# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Introduction
The procedural requirements are structured according to the main functional
areas: system information (5.2), connection control (5.3), inter-RAT mobility
(5.4) and measurements (5.5). In addition, clause 5.6 covers other aspects
e.g. NAS dedicated information transfer, UE capability transfer, clause 5.7
specifies the generic error handling, clause 5.8 covers MBMS (i.e. MBMS
service reception via MRB), clause 5.8a covers SC-PTM (i.e. MBMS service
reception via SC-MRB), clause 5.9 covers RN-specific procedures and clause
5.10 covers sidelink.
For NB-IoT, only a subset of the above procedural requirements applies: system
information (5.2), connection control (5.3), some part of other aspects (5.6),
general error handling (5.7), and SC-PTM (5.8a). Clauses inter-RAT mobility
(5.4), measurements (5.5), MBMS (5.8), RN procedures (5.9) and Sidelink (5.10)
are not applicable in NB-IoT.
### 5.1.2 General requirements
The UE shall:
1> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a
subsequent message;
NOTE 1: E-UTRAN may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the
UE\'s response of a previously initiated procedure.
1> within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the
procedural description;
1> consider the term \'radio bearer\' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs but not MRBs
or SC-MRBs unless explicitly stated otherwise;
1> set the _rrc-TransactionIdentifier_ in the response message, if included,
to the same value as included in the received RRC message that triggered the
response message;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _setup_ :
2> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _release_ :
2> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;
NOTE 1a: Following receipt of choice value set to release, the UE considers
the field as if it was never configured.
1> upon handover to E-UTRA; or
1> upon receiving an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the
_fullConfig_ :
2> apply the Conditions in the ASN.1 for inclusion of the fields for the
DRB/PDCP/RLC setup during the reconfiguration of the DRBs included in the
_drb-ToAddModList_ ;
NOTE 2: At each point in time, the UE keeps a single value for each field
except for during handover when the UE temporarily stores the previous
configuration so it can revert back upon handover failure. In other words:
when the UE reconfigures a field, the existing value is released except for
during handover.
NOTE 3: Although not explicitly stated, the UE initially considers all
functionality to be deactivated/ released until it is explicitly stated that
the functionality is setup/ activated. Correspondingly, the UE initially
considers lists to be empty e.g. the list of radio bearers, the list of
measurements.
1> upon receiving an extension field comprising the entries in addition to the
ones carried by the original field (regardless of whether E-UTRAN may signal
more entries in total); apply the following generic behaviour if explicitly
stated to be applicable:
2> create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in
the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among
both the original and the additional entries;
2> for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same
behaviour as defined for the original field;
NOTE 4: A field comprising a list of entries normally includes \'list\' in the
field name. The typical way to extend (the size of) such a list is to
introduce a field comprising the additional entries, which should include
\'listExt\' in the name of the field/ IE. E.g. _field1List-RAT_ ,
_field1ListExt-RAT_.
1> consider the term DC to cover the case of an E-UTRA MCG and SCG; Likewise,
MCG covers the case of an E-UTRA MCG, SCG covers the case of an E-UTRA SCG,
serving cell covers the case of an E-UTRA serving cell, PDCP covers the case
of PDCP defined by E-UTRA specifications;
NOTE 5: In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters
configured by E-UTRA RRC unless stated otherwise. Likewise, when a procedure
is mentioned, this concerns the procedure defined by E-UTRA RRC unless stated
otherwise.
### 5.1.3 Requirements for UE in MR-DC
In this specification, the UE considers itself to be configured with;
\- EN-DC if and only if it is configured with _nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig_
and it is connected to EPC,
> \- NGEN-DC if and only if it is configured with _nr-
> SecondaryCellGroupConfig_ and it is connected to 5GC,
>
> \- NE-DC if and only if it is configured with _mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup_ set
> to _eutra-SCG_ according to TS 38.331[82],
>
> \- MR-DC if and only if it is configured with (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC.
NOTE 1: The above deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [81] (and some
other specifications) i.e. according to TS 37.340 [81] a UE that is not
configured with an SCG is in MR-DC when one or more bearers are terminated in
the secondary node (i.e. using NR PDCP).
NOTE 2: MR-DC includes NR-DC, but that option is not relevant for this
specification.
The UE configured with NE-DC only executes a subclause of clause 5 from this
specification when the concerned subclause:
\- is referrenced from a subclause, either in this specification or in TS
38.331 [82], that is executed by the UE; or
\- covers actions upon (re-)configuration of field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s)
or timer(s) applicable for NE-DC;
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE also
follows the related general requirements as defined in clause 5.1.2 and other
subclauses of this specification e.g. message processing delay requirements.
## 5.2 System information
### 5.2.1 Introduction
#### 5.2.1.1 General
System information is divided into the _MasterInformationBlock_ (MIB) and a
number of _SystemInformationBlocks_ (SIBs) and _SystemInformationBlockPos_
(posSIBs). The MIB includes a limited number of most essential and most
frequently transmitted parameters that are needed to acquire other information
from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs other than
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ and posSIBs are carried in _SystemInformation_
(SI) messages. The mapping of SIBs and posSIBs to SI messages is flexibly
configurable by _schedulingInfoList_ and _posSchedulingInfoList_ ,
respectively, included in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , with restrictions
that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message and each SIB and
posSIB is contained at most once in that SI message; only SIBs and posSIBs
having the same scheduling requirement (periodicity) can be mapped to the same
SI message; _SystemInformationBlockType2_ is always mapped to the SI message
that corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in
_schedulingInfoList_. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the
same periodicity. _SystemInformationBlockType1_ and all SI messages are
transmitted on DL-SCH.
The Bandwidth reduced Low Complexity (BL) UEs and UEs in Coverage Enhancement
(CE) apply Bandwidth Reduced (BR) version of the SIB, posSIB or SI messages. A
UE considers itself in enhanced coverage as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. In
this and subsequent clauses, anything applicable for a particular SIB, posSIB
or SI message equally applies to the corresponding BR version unless
explicitly stated otherwise.
For NB-IoT, a reduced set of system information block with similar
functionality but different content is defined; the UE applies the NB-IoT (NB)
version of the MIB and the SIBs. These are denoted _MasterInformationBlock-NB,
MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ _and SystemInformationBlockTypeX-NB_ in this
specification. All other system information blocks (without NB suffix) are not
applicable to NB-IoT; this is not further stated in the corresponding text.
NOTE 1: The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take.
When DCI format 1C is used the maximum allowed by the physical layer is 1736
bits (217 bytes) while for format 1A the limit is 2216 bits (277 bytes), see
TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23]. For BL UEs and UEs in CE, the maximum SIB
and SI message size is 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT, the maximum
SIB and SI message size is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].
In addition to broadcasting, E-UTRAN may provide _SystemInformationBlockType1_
and/or _SystemInformationBlockType2_ , including the same parameter values,
via dedicated signalling i.e., within an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_
message.
The UE applies the system information acquisition and change monitoring
procedures for the PCell, except when being a BL UE or a UE in CE or a NB-IoT
UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode while T311 is not running. For an SCell, E-UTRAN
provides, via dedicated signalling, all system information relevant for
operation in RRC_CONNECTED when adding the SCell. However, a UE that is
configured with DC shall aquire the _MasterInformationBlock_ of the PSCell but
use it only to determine the SFN timing of the SCG, which may be different
from the MCG. Upon change of the relevant system information of a configured
SCell, E-UTRAN releases and subsequently adds the concerned SCell, which may
be done with a single _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message. If the UE is
receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service in a cell, the UE shall
apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedure to
acquire parameters relevant for MBMS operation and apply the parameters
acquired from system information only for MBMS operation for this cell.
NOTE 2: E-UTRAN may configure via dedicated signalling different parameter
values than the ones broadcast in the concerned SCell.
In MBMS-dedicated cell, non-MBSFN subframes are used for providing
_MasterInformationBlock-MBMS_ (MIB-MBMS) and
_SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS_. SIBs other than
_SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS_ are carried in _SystemInformation-MBMS_
message which is also provided on non-MBSFN subframes.
An RN configured with an RN subframe configuration does not need to apply the
system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures. Upon change
of any system information relevant to an RN, E-UTRAN provides the system
information blocks containing the relevant system information to an RN
configured with an RN subframe configuration via dedicated signalling using
the _RNReconfiguration_ message. For RNs configured with an RN subframe
configuration, the system information contained in this dedicated signalling
replaces any corresponding stored system information and takes precedence over
any corresponding system information acquired through the system information
acquisition procedure. The dedicated system information remains valid until
overridden.
NOTE 3: E-UTRAN may configure an RN, via dedicated signalling, with different
parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned cell.
#### 5.2.1.2 Scheduling
The MIB uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms and repetitions made
within 40 ms. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframe #0 of
radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in
subframe #0 of all other radio frames. For TDD/FDD system with a bandwidth
larger than 1.4 MHz that supports BL UEs or UEs in CE, MIB transmission may
additionally be repeated in subframe#0 of the same radio frame, and in
subframe#9 of the previous radio frame for FDD and subframe #5 of the same
radio frame for TDD.
NOTE: The UE may assume the scheduling of MIB repetitions does not change.
E-UTRAN may indicate in _MobilityControlInfo_ whether optional MIB repetitions
are enabled or not.
The MIB-MBMS uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms and
repetitions made within 160 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-MBMS is
scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 16 = 0, and
repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames for which
the SFN mod 4 = 0.
The _SystemInformationBlockType1_ uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of
80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms. The first transmission of
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ is scheduled in subframe #5 of radio frames for
which the SFN mod 8 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #5 of all
other radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.
For BL UEs or UEs in CE, MIB is applied which may be provided with additional
repetitions, while for SIB1 and further SI messages, separate messages are
used which are scheduled independently and with content that may differ. The
separate instance of SIB1 is named as _SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_. The
_SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_ uses a schedule with a periodicity of 80ms.
TBS for _SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_ and the repetitions made within 80ms
are indicated _via schedulingInfoSIB1-BR_ in MIB or optionally in the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the _MobilityControlInfo_.
The _SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS_ uses fixed schedule with a periodicity
of 160 ms. The first transmission of _SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS_ is
scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 16 = 0, and
repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames for which
SFN mod 8 = 0. Additionally, the _SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS_ and other
system informations blocks may be scheduled in additional non-MBSFN subframes
indicated in _MasterInformationBlock-MBMS_.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain
windows (referred to as SI-windows) using dynamic scheduling. Each SI message
is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do
not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is
transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is
configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be
transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes,
uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 =
0. The UE acquires the detailed time-domain scheduling (and other information,
e.g. frequency-domain scheduling, used transport format) from decoding SI-RNTI
on PDCCH (see TS 36.321 [6]). For a BL UE or a UE in CE, the detailed
time/frequency domain scheduling information for the SI messages is provided
in _SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_.
For UEs other than BL UE or UEs in CE SI-RNTI is used to address
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ as well as all SI messages. On MBMS-dedicated
cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, SI-RNTI with value in accordance with
TS 36.321 [6] is used to address all SI messages whereas SI-RNTI with value in
accordance with TS 36.321 [6] is used to address
_SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS._
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ configures the SI-window length and the
transmission periodicity for the SI messages.
#### 5.2.1.2a Scheduling for NB-IoT
The _MasterInformationBlock-NB_ (MIB-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a
periodicity of 640 ms and repetitions made within 640 ms. The first
transmission of the MIB-NB is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for
which the SFN mod 64 = 0 and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all
other radio frames. The transmissions are arranged in 8 independently
decodable blocks of 80 ms duration.
The _MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ (MIB-TDD-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a
periodicity of 640 ms and repetitions made within 640 ms. The first
transmission of the MIB-TDD-NB is scheduled in subframe #9 of radio frames for
which the SFN mod 64 = 0 and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #9 of all
other radio frames. The transmissions are arranged in 8 independently
decodable blocks of 80 ms duration.
The _SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_ (SIB1-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a
periodicity of 2560 ms.
For FDD, SIB1-NB transmission occurs in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16
continuous frames. The starting frame for the first transmission of the
SIB1-NB is derived from the cell PCID and the number of repetitions within the
2560 ms period and repetitions are made, equally spaced, within the 2560 ms
period (see TS 36.213 [23]). TBS for _SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_ and the
repetitions made within the 2560 ms are indicated by _schedulingInfoSIB1_
field in the MIB-NB. If _additionalTransmissionSIB1_ is set to TRUE in the
MIB-NB, additional SIB1-NB transmission occurs in subframe #3 of the same
radio frames where SIB1-NB transmission occurs with the same number of
repetitions.
For TDD, SIB1-NB transmission on the anchor carrier occurs in either subframe
#0 or subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames and SIB1-NB
transmission on a non-anchor carrier occurs in subframe #0 and next in
subframe #5 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames. The starting frame
for the first transmission of the SIB1-NB is derived from the cell PCID and
the number of repetitions within the 2560 ms period and repetitions are made,
equally spaced, within the 2560 ms period (see TS 36.213 [23]). TBS for
_SystemInformationBlockType1-NB,_ the repetitions made within the 2560 ms, and
the subframe index (#0 or #4) are indicated by _schedulingInfoSIB1_ field in
the MIB-TDD-NB.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain
windows (referred to as SI-windows) using scheduling information provided in
_SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_. Each SI message is associated with a SI-
window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is,
within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of
the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable.
Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number
of times over 2 or 8 consecutive NB-IoT downlink subframes depending on
TBS.The UE acquires the detailed time/frequency domain scheduling information
and other information, e.g. used transport format for the SI messages from
_schedulingInfoList_ field in _SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_. The UE is not
required to accumulate several SI messages in parallel but may need to
accumulate a SI message across multiple SI windows, depending on coverage
condition.
_SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_ configures the SI-window length and the
transmission periodicity for all SI messages.
#### 5.2.1.3 System information validity and notification of changes
Change of system information (other than for ETWS, CMAS and EAB parameters and
other than for AB parameters for NB-IoT) only occurs at specific radio frames,
i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. System information may be
transmitted a number of times with the same content within a modification
period, as defined by its scheduling. The modification period boundaries are
defined by SFN values for which SFN mod _m_ = 0, where _m_ is the number of
radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is
configured by system information. If H-SFN is provided in
_SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_ , modification period boundaries for BL UEs
and UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod _m_
=0. For NB-IoT, H-SFN is always provided and the modification period
boundaries are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod _m_
=0.
To enable system information update notification for RRC_IDLE UEs configured
to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period, an eDRX acquisition
period is defined. The boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are
determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 256 =0. For NB-IoT, the
boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for
which H-SFN mod 1024 =0.
NOTE 1: If the UE in RRC_IDLE is configured to use extended DRX cycle, e.g.,
in the order of several minutes or longer, in case the eNB is reset the UE SFN
may not be synchronized to the new eNB SFN. The UE is expected to recover,
e.g., acquire MIB within a reasonable time, to avoid repeated paging failures.
When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies
the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification
period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated
system information. During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS
transmission is started or stopped, the SI messages carrying the SIBs
scheduled in _schedulingInfoListExt_ and/or SI messages carrying the posSIBs
scheduled in _posSchedulingInfoList_ may change, so the UE might not be able
to successfully receive those SIBs and/or posSIBs in the remainder of the
current modification period and next modification period according to the
scheduling information received prior to the change. These general principles
are illustrated in figure 5.2.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate
different system information. Upon receiving a change notification, the UE not
configured to use a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period
acquires the new system information immediately from the start of the next
modification period. Upon receiving a change notification applicable to eDRX,
a UE in RRC_IDLE configured to use a DRX cycle that is longer than the
modification period acquires the updated system information immediately from
the start of the next eDRX acquisition period. The UE applies the previously
acquired system information until the UE acquires the new system information.
The possible boundaries of modification for _SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_
are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod 512 = 0 except for notification of
ETWS/CMAS for which the eNB may change _SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_
content at any time. For NB-IoT, the possible boundaries of modification for
_SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_ are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN *
1024 + SFN) mod 4096 = 0.
Figure 5.2.1.3-1: Change of system Information
The _Paging_ message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. If the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED
or is not configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period in
RRC_IDLE, and receives a _Paging_ message including the
_systemInfoModification_ , it knows that the system information will change at
the next modification period boundary. A UE in RRC_IDLE that is configured to
use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period, and receives in an eDRX
acquisition period at least one _Paging_ message including the
_systemInfoModification-eDRX_ , shall acquire the updated system information
at the next eDRX acquisition period boundary. Although the UE may be informed
about changes in system information, no further details are provided e.g.
regarding which system information will change, except if
_systemInfoValueTagSI_ is received by BL UEs or UEs in CE.
In RRC_CONNECTED, BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs are not required to
acquire system information except when T311 is running or upon handover where
the UE is only required to acquire the _MasterInformationBlock in the target
PCell_. In RRC_IDLE, E-UTRAN may notify BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs
about SI update, and except for NB-IoT, ETWS and CMAS notification and EAB
modification, using Direct Indication information, as specified in 6.6 (or
6.7.5 in NB-IoT) and TS 36.212 [22].
NOTE 2: Upon system information change essential for BL UEs, UEs in CE, or NB-
IoT UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, E-UTRAN may initiate connection release.
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ (or _MasterInformationBlock-NB/
MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ in NB-IoT) includes a value tag
_systemInfoValueTag_ , that indicates if a change has occurred in the SI
messages. UEs may use _systemInfoValueTag_ , e.g. upon return from out of
coverage, to verify if the previously stored SI messages are still valid.
_MasterInformationBlock_ (using _systemInfoUnchanged-BR_) and RSS (if
transmitted) may indicate that a change has not occurred in the SIB1-BR and SI
messages of the current cell at least over the SI validity time, and the BL
UEs or UEs in CE may use _systemInfoUnchanged-BR_ or RSS, e.g. upon return
from out of coverage, to verify if the previously stored SIB1-BR and SI
messages are still valid. Additionally, for other than BL UEs or UEs in CE or
NB-IoT UEs, the UE considers stored system information to be invalid after 3
hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless specified
otherwise. BL UE or UE in CE considers stored system information to be invalid
after 24 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless
the UE is configured by parameter _si-ValidityTime_ to consider stored system
information to be invalid 3 hours after validity confirmation. NB-IoT UE
considers stored system information to be invalid after 24 hours from the
moment it was successfully confirmed as valid. If a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT
UE in RRC_CONNECTED state considers the stored system information invalid, the
UE shall continue using the stored system information while in RRC_CONNECTED
state in the serving cell.
For BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, the change of specific SI message can
additionally be indicated by a SI message specific value tag
_systemInfoValueTagSI._ If _systemInfoValueTag_ included in the
_SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_ (or _MasterInformationBlock-NB/
MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ in NB-IoT) is different from the one of the
stored system information and if _systemInfoValueTagSI_ is included in the
_SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_ (or _SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_ in NB-
IoT) for a specific SI message and is different from the stored one, the UE
shall consider this specific SI message to be invalid. If only
_systemInfoValueTag_ is included and is different from the stored one, the BL
UE or UE in CE should consider any stored system information except
_SystemInformationBlockType10_ , _SystemInformationBlockType11_ ,
_SystemInformationBlockType12_ and _SystemInformationBlockType14_ to be
invalid; the NB-IoT UE should consider any stored system information except
_SystemInformationBlockType14-NB_ to be invalid.
On MBMS-dedicated cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, the change of system
information and ETWS/CMAS notification is indicated by using Direct Indication
FeMBMS defined in 6.6a. The modification periodicity follows MCCH modification
periodicity as defined in 5.8.1.3.
E-UTRAN may not update _systemInfoValueTag_ upon change of some system
information e.g. ETWS information, CMAS information, regularly changing
parameters like time information (_SystemInformationBlockType8_ ,
_SystemInformationBlockType16,_ _hyperSFN-MSB_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_), EAB and AB parameters, or positioning
system information blocks. Similarly, E-UTRAN may not include the
_systemInfoModification_ within the _Paging_ message upon change of some
system information.
The UE that is not configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification
period verifies that stored system information remains valid by either
checking _systemInfoValueTag_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ (or
_MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ in NB-IoT) _after
the modification period boundary, or_ attempting to find the
_systemInfoModification indication at least modificationPeriodCoeff times
during the modification period in case no paging is received, in every
modification period._ If no paging message is received by the UE during a
modification period, the UE may assume that no change of system information
will occur at the next modification period boundary. If UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
during a modification period, receives one paging message, it may deduce from
the presence/ absence of _systemInfoModification whether a change of system
information other than ETWS information, CMAS information and EAB parameters
will occur in the next modification period or not._
When the RRC_IDLE UE is configured with a DRX cycle that is longer than the
modification period, and at least one modification period boundary has passed
since the UE last verified validity of stored system information, the UE
verifies that stored system information remains valid by checking the
_systemInfoValueTag_ before establishing or resuming an RRC connection.
ETWS and/or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, other than BL UEs and UEs in
CE, shall attempt to read paging at least once every _defaultPagingCycle_ to
check whether ETWS and/or CMAS notification is present or not.
#### 5.2.1.4 Indication of ETWS notification
ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification can occur at any
point in time. The _Paging_ message is used to inform ETWS capable UEs in
RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of an ETWS primary
notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. If the UE receives a
_Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ , it shall start receiving
the ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification according to
_schedulingInfoList_ contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_. If the UE
receives _Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ while it is
acquiring ETWS notification(s), the UE shall continue acquiring ETWS
notification(s) based on the previously acquired _schedulingInfoList_ until it
re-acquires _schedulingInfoList_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The UE is not required to periodically check _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , but _Paging_ message including
the _etws-Indication_ triggers the UE to re-acquire _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ for scheduling changes for
_SystemInformationBlockType10_ and _SystemInformationBlockType11_. The UE may
or may not receive a _Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ and/or
_systemInfoModification_ when ETWS is no longer scheduled.
ETWS primary notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType10_ and
ETWS secondary notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType11_.
Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a secondary notification. The
segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given secondary notification
within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same
_messageIdentifier_ , _serialNumber_ and _warningMessageSegmentNumber_). An
ETWS secondary notification corresponds to a single _CB data_ IE as defined
according to **TS 23.041** [37].
#### 5.2.1.5 Indication of CMAS notification
CMAS notification can occur at any point in time. The _Paging_ message is used
to inform CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about presence
of one or more CMAS notifications. If the UE receives a _Paging_ message
including the _cmas-Indication_ , it shall start receiving the CMAS
notifications according to _schedulingInfoList_ contained in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_. If the UE receives _Paging_ message including
the _cmas-Indication_ while it is acquiring CMAS notification(s), the UE shall
continue acquiring CMAS notification(s) based on the previously acquired
_schedulingInfoList_ until it re-acquires _schedulingInfoList_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The UE is not required to periodically check _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , but _Paging_ message including
the _cmas-Indication_ triggers the UE to re-acquire _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ for scheduling changes for
_SystemInformationBlockType12_. The UE may or may not receive a _Paging_
message including the _cmas-Indication_ and/or _systemInfoModification_ when
_SystemInformationBlockType12_ is no longer scheduled.
CMAS notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType12_. A CMAS
notification corresponds to a single _CB data_ IE as defined according to **TS
23.041** [37]. A CMAS notification may optionally have associated warning area
coordinates. Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a CMAS
notification and, if present, the associated warning area coordinates. The
segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given CMAS notification and, if
present, any associated warning area coordinates within a cell (i.e. the same
segment size for a given segment with the same _messageIdentifier_ ,
_serialNumber_ and _warningMessageSegmentNumber_). E-UTRAN does not interleave
transmissions of CMAS notifications, i.e. all segments of a given CMAS
notification transmission are transmitted prior to those of another CMAS
notification.
#### 5.2.1.6 Notification of EAB parameters change
Change of EAB parameters can occur at any point in time. The EAB parameters
are contained in _SystemInformationBlockType14_. The _Paging_ message is used
to inform EAB capable UEs in RRC_IDLE about a change of EAB parameters or that
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ is no longer scheduled. If the UE receives a
_Paging_ message including the _eab-ParamModification_ , it shall acquire
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ according to _schedulingInfoList_ contained in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_. If the UE receives a _Paging_ message including
the **_eab-ParamModification_** while it is acquiring
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ , the UE shall continue acquiring
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ based on the previously acquired
_schedulingInfoList_ until it re-acquires _schedulingInfoList_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The EAB capable UE is not expected to periodically check
_schedulingInfoList_ contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_.
#### 5.2.1.7 Access Barring parameters change in NB-IoT
Change of Access Barring (AB) parameters can occur at any point in time. The
AB parameters are contained in _SystemInformationBlockType14-NB_. Update of
the AB parameters does not impact the _systemInfoValueTag_ in the
_MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ or the
_systemInfoValueTagSI_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_.
If _SystemInformationBlockType14-NB_ is scheduled, a NB-IoT UE is required to
acquire _MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ before
initiating RRC connection establishment / resume for all access causes except
mobile terminating calls to check _ab-Enabled_ indication. If access barring
is enabled the UE shall not initiate the RRC connection establishment / resume
for all access causes except mobile terminating calls until the UE has
acquired the _SystemInformationBlockType14-NB_.
### 5.2.2 System information acquisition
#### 5.2.2.1 General
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition, normal
The UE applies the system information acquisition procedure to acquire the AS-
and NAS- and positioning-system information that is broadcasted by the
E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.
For BL UE, UE in CE and NB-IoT UE, specific conditions apply, as specified
below.
#### 5.2.2.2 Initiation
The UE shall apply the system information acquisition procedure upon selecting
(e.g. upon power on) and upon re-selecting a cell, after handover completion,
after entering E-UTRA from another RAT, upon return from out of coverage, upon
receiving a notification that the system information has changed, upon
receiving an indication about the presence of an ETWS notification, upon
receiving an indication about the presence of a CMAS notification, upon
receiving a notification that the EAB parameters have changed, upon receiving
a request from CDMA2000 upper layers, upon receiving a request from
positioning upper layers and upon exceeding the maximum validity duration.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the system
information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored system information,
i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for system information and the UE
discontinues using a field if it is absent in system information unless
explicitly specified otherwise.
In RRC_CONNECTED, BL UEs and UEs in CE are required to acquire system
information when T311 is running or upon handover where the UE is only
required to acquire the _MasterInformationBlock in the target PCell_.
NOTE: Upon handover, E-UTRAN provides system information required by the UE in
RRC_CONNECTED except MIB with RRC signalling, i.e.
_systemInformationBlockType1Dedicated_ and _mobilityControlInfo_.
#### 5.2.2.3 System information required by the UE
The UE shall:
1> ensure having a valid version, as defined below, of (at least) the
following system information, also referred to as the \'required\' system
information:

and for NB-IoT _SystemInformationBlockType22-NB_ ;
1> delete any stored system information after 3 hours or 24 hours from the
moment it was confirmed to be valid as defined in 5.2.1.3, unless specified
otherwise;
1> consider any stored system information except
_SystemInformationBlockType10,_ _SystemInformationBlockType11,_
_systemInformationBlockType12_ and _systemInformationBlockType14_
(_systemInformationBlockType14-NB_ in NB-IoT) to be invalid if
_systemInfoValueTag_ included in the _SystemInformationBlockType1_
(_MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB_ in NB-IoT) is
different from the one of the stored system information and in case of NB-IoT
UEs, BL UEs and UEs in CE, _systemInfoValueTagSI_ is not broadcasted.
Otherwise consider system information validity as defined in 5.2.1.3;
#### 5.2.2.4 System information acquisition by the UE
The UE shall:
1> apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1 or BR-BCCH
configuration defined in 9.1.1.8;

>
> 2> else
>
> 3> start acquiring the required system information, as defined in 5.2.2.3,
> from the beginning of the modification period following the one in which the
> change notification was received;
NOTE 1: The UE continues using the previously received system information
until the new system information has been acquired.

5.2.3, the system information required in RRC_CONNECTED, as defined in
5.2.2.3;

3> discard the corresponding radio resource configuration information included
in the _radioResourceConfigCommon_ previously received in a dedicated message,
if any;
1> following a request from CDMA2000 upper layers:
2> acquire _SystemInformationBlockType8_ , as defined in 5.2.3;

_SystemInformationBlockType1_ (_SystemInformationBlockType1-NB_ in NB-IoT)
messages as well as _SystemInformationBlockType2_
(_SystemInformationBlockType2-NB_ in NB-IoT), and for NB-IoT,
_SystemInformationBlockType22-NB_ ;
1> not initiate the RRC connection establishment/resume procedure subject to
EAB until the UE has a valid version of _SystemInformationBlockType14_ , if
broadcast;
1> if the UE is ETWS capable:
2> upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE, following successful handover or upon
connection re-establishment:
3> discard any previously buffered _warningMessageSegment_ ;

## 5.3 Connection control
### 5.3.1 Introduction
#### 5.3.1.1 RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. Except for
EDT, E-UTRAN completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the
establishment of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context
information from the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during
the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC
connection, the E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting,
but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful
security activation. However, the UE only accepts a handover message when
security has been activated.
NOTE 1: In case the serving frequency broadcasts multiple overlapping bands,
E-UTRAN can only configure measurements after having obtained the UE
capabilities, as the measurement configuration needs to be set according to
the band selected by the UE.
Upon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both
ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation
procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful
response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after
completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to
activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to
establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN
initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior
to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE.
In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for
the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs.
E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation
and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB
establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support
partial success).
For SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the
E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.
For some radio configuration fields, a critical extension has been defined. A
switch from the original version of the field to the critically extended
version is allowed using any connection reconfiguration. The UE reverts to the
original version of some critically extended fields upon handover and re-
establishment as specified elsewhere in this specification. Otherwise,
switching a field from the critically extended version to the original version
is only possible using the handover or re-establishment procedure with the
full configuration option. This also applies for fields that are critically
extended within a release (i.e. original and extended version defined in same
release).
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN may
configure a UE that supports CA, with one or more SCells in addition to the
PCell that was initially configured during connection establishment. The PCell
is used to provide the security inputs and upper layer system information
(i.e. the NAS mobility information e.g. TAI). SCells are used to provide
additional downlink and optionally uplink radio resources. When not configured
with any kind of DC, all SCells the UE is configured with, if any, are part of
the MCG.
When configured with DC, some of the SCells are part of a SCG. In this case,
user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG (i.e. MCG-DRB),
via SCG (SCG-DRB) or via both MCG and SCG in DL while E-UTRAN configures the
CG used in UL (split DRB). An RRC connection reconfiguration message may be
used to change the DRB type from MCG-DRB to SCG-DRB or to split DRB, as well
as from SCG-DRB or split DRB to MCG-DRB.
DC employs SCG change, which is a synchronous SCG reconfiguration procedure
(i.e. involving RA to the PSCell) including reset/ re-establishment of layer 2
and, if SCG DRBs are configured, refresh of security. The procedure is used in
a number of different scenarios e.g. SCG establishment, PSCell change, Key
refresh, change of DRB type. The UE performs the SCG change related actions
upon receiving an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including
_mobilityControlInfoSCG_ , see 5.3.10.10.
In case of MR-DC, the cells of one CG use another RAT, namely NR. The
configuration of an NR CG is specified in TS 38.331 [82]. When configured with
MR-DC, user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG, via NR
SCG or via both MCG and NR SCG. Also RRC signalling carried by a SRB may
either be transferred via MCG or via both MCG and NR SCG. When DRBs and SRBs
are configured with transmission via both MCG and SCG, duplication may be used
in both DL and UL.
Change to NR PDCP or vice versa, that in case of EN-DC may be done for both
SRBs and DRBs, can be performed using an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_
message including the _mobilityControlInfo_ (handover) by release and addition
of the concerned RB (for DRBs) or of the concerned PDCP entity (for SRBs). The
same _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message may be used to make changes
regarding the CG(s) used for transmission. For SRB1, change from E-UTRA PDCP
to NR PDCP type may, before initial security activation, also be performed
using an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message not including the
_mobilityControlInfo_.
In case of (NG)EN-DC, there are three types of NR SCG reconfigurations:
\- Reconfiguration with sync and key change i.e. a procedure involving RA to
the PSCell, including NR MAC reset, re-establishment of NR RLC and NR PDCP and
refresh of NR SCG security; and
\- Reconfiguration with sync but without key change i.e. a procedure involving
RA to the PSCell, including NR MAC reset and NR RLC re-establishment and PDCP
data recovery (for AM DRB); and
\- Regular NR SCG reconfiguration neither involving refresh of NR SCG
security, nor RA to the PSCell, NR MAC reset or NR RLC re-establishment;
The network is only required to use the NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and
key change in case the NR SCG security key changes (i.e. handover, change of
SNs, S-KgNB refresh). Further details are specified in NR RRC TS 38.331 [82].
NOTE 2: In case of MR-DC, E-UTRA RRC configuration parameters should only
affect E-UTRA operation. E.g., _s-Measure_ only affects measurements
configured by parameters defined in this specification. Should an E-UTRA RRC
configuration change require a change of NR RRC configuration, the network
should indicate such NR change by NR RRC signalling. E.g. a specific
indication is used to trigger RLC re-establishment upon reconfigurations
changing the CG(s) used for transmission (in DL or UL) that otherwise would
only involve NR RRC signalling.
In this release of the specification, change between DC and MR-DC as well as
change between DC and E-UTRA configured with SN terminated DRB without SCG are
not supported (i.e. neither the direct reconfiguration nor specific
measurement events). Likewise, the direct transition between (NG)EN-DC and NR
DC or NE-DC is not supported in this release of the specification.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by E-UTRAN. The
procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an E-UTRA frequency or an inter-
RAT carrier frequency. Only in exceptional cases, as specified within this
specification, TS 36.300 [9], TS 36.304 [4] or TS 24.301 [35], may the UE
abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying E-UTRAN.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by E-UTRAN. When the RRC
connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE AS context and the
_resumeIdentity_ , and transitions to RRC_IDLE state. The RRC message to
suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered. Suspension can
only be performed when at least 1 DRB is successfully established.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when
the UE has a stored UE AS context, RRC connection resume is permitted by
E-UTRAN and the UE needs to transit from RRC_IDLE state to RRC_CONNECTED
state. When the RRC connection is resumed, RRC configures the UE according to
the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE AS context and any
RRC configuration received from E-UTRAN. The RRC connection resume procedure
re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s). The request to
resume the RRC connection includes the _resumeIdentity_. The request is not
ciphered, but protected with a message authentication code.
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, E-UTRAN may resume the
suspended RRC connection, reject the request to resume and instruct the UE to
either keep or discard the stored context, or setup a new RRC connection.
In case of CP-EDT, the data are appended in the _RRCEarlyDataRequest_ and
_RRCEarlyDataComplete_ messages, if available, and sent over SRB0. In case of
UP-EDT, security is re-activated prior to transmission of RRC message using
the _nextHopChainingCount_ provided in the _RRCConnectionRelease_ message with
suspend indication during the preceding suspend procedure and the radio
bearers are re-established. The uplink data are transmitted ciphered on DTCH
multiplexed with the _RRCConnectionResumeRequest_ message on CCCH. In the
downlink, the data, if available, are transmitted on DTCH multiplexed with the
_RRCConnectionRelease_ message on DCCH. In response to a request for EDT,
E-UTRAN may also choose to establish or resume the RRC connection.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED enters RRC_INACTIVE when the network indicates RRC
connection suspension in _RRCConnectionRelease_ message. When entering
RRC_INACTIVE, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any RRC
configuration received from the network.
The resumption of an RRC connection from RRC_INACTIVE is initiated by upper
layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED
state or by RRC layer for, e.g. RNAU or reception of RAN paging. When the RRC
connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC
connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any
RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume
procedure re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection from RRC_INACTIVE, the
network may resume the suspended RRC connection and UE enters to
RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume using RRC message without
security protection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE with wait time, or directly
re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release
the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS
level recovery.
#### 5.3.1.2 Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as
well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the
AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm
and two parameters, namely the _keyChangeIndicator_ and the
_nextHopChainingCount,_ which are used by the UE to determine the AS security
keys upon handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume and/ or UP-
EDT.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers
SRB1, SRB2 and SRB4. When configured with MCG only, the ciphering algorithm is
common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1, SRB2, SRB4 and DRBs). Neither
integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
RRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one
message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated.
However, it is possible to switch to a \'NULL\' ciphering algorithm (eea0).
The \'NULL\' integrity protection algorithm (eia0) is used only for the UE in
limited service mode, as specified in TS 33.401 [32]. In case the \'NULL\'
integrity protection algorithm is used, \'NULL\' ciphering algorithm is also
used.
NOTE 1: Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has
failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies three different security keys: one for the integrity protection
of RRC signalling (K~RRCint~), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling
(K~RRCenc~) and one for the ciphering of user data (K~UPenc~). All three AS
keys are derived from the K~eNB~ key. The K~eNB~ is based on the K~ASME~ key
for E-UTRA/EPC, or K~AMF~ for E-UTRA/5GC, which is handled by upper layers.
Upon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are
exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at
connection establishment.
The integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is
based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is
performed by the source eNB.
The integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The
four AS keys (K~eNB,~ K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~) change upon every
handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume and UP-EDT. The
_keyChangeIndicator_ is used upon handover and indicates whether the UE should
use the keys associated with the K~ASME~ key for E-UTRA/EPC, or K~AMF~ for
E-UTRA/5GC, taken into use with the latest successful NAS SMC procedure. The
_nextHopChainingCount_ parameter is used upon handover, connection re-
establishment, connection resume and UP-EDT by the UE when deriving the new
K~eNB~ that is used to generate K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ (see TS
33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover procedure may be used to change the keys
in RRC_CONNECTED.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323
[8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC) is maintained for each
direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering. For each
SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both ciphering and integrity protection.
It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given
security key. At connection resume the COUNT is reset. As specified in TS
33.401 clause 7.2.9.1 [32], the eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the
COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same K~eNB~, e.g. due to the
transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and
multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers, multiple termination
point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP re-establishment
(COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst the key stream inputs
(i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been updated. In order to avoid
such re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB
establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or by triggering a transition
from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE and then back to RRC_CONNECTED.
In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets
include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for
E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC). In addition, an overflow
counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as
specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and _HFN_ as specified in TS 38.323
[83] for E-UTRA/5GC). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the
eNB.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit
BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is
the value of the corresponding _srb-Identity_ with the MSBs padded with
zeroes.
With E-UTRA/5GC for a UE not capable of NGEN-DC, the same ciphering algorithm
signalled at SMC or handover is used for all radio bearers. Likewise, the same
integrity algorithm signalled at SMC or handover is used for all SRBs.
In case of DC, a separate K~eNB~ is used for SCG-DRBs (S-K~eNB~). This key is
derived from the key used for the MCG (K~eNB~) and an SCG counter that is used
to ensure freshness. To refresh the S-K~eNB~ e.g. when the COUNT will wrap
around, E-UTRAN employs an SCG change, i.e. an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_
message including _mobilityControlInfoSCG_. When performing handover, while at
least one SCG-DRB remains configured, both K~eNB~ and S-K~eNB~ are refreshed.
In such case E-UTRAN performs handover with SCG change i.e. an
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including both _mobilityControlInfo_
and _mobilityControlInfoSCG_. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio
bearers within a CG but may be different between MCG and SCG. The ciphering
algorithm for SCG DRBs can only be changed upon SCG change.
In case of (NG)EN-DC or of SN terminated RB without SCG, the network indicates
whether the UE shall use either K~eNB~ or S-K~gNB~ for a particular DRB. In
case of NE-DC, the network indicates whether the UE shall use either K~gNB~ or
S-K~eNB~ for a particular DRB. S-K~gNB~/S-K~eNB~ is derived from K~eNB~/K~gNB~
as defined in TS 33.501 [86], uses a different counter (_sk-Counter_) and is
used only for DRBs using NR PDCP. Whenever there is a need to refresh
S-K~gNB~/S-K~eNB~, e.g. upon change of MN or SN, the NR SCG reconfiguration
with sync and key change is used for S-K~gNB~ refresh (see 5.3.1.1) and the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including _mobilityControlInfoSCG_ is
used for S-K~eNB~ refresh (see 5.3.10.10). E-UTRAN provides a UE configured
with (NG)EN-DC with an _sk-Counter_ even when no DRB is setup using S-K~gNB~
i.e. to facilitate configuration of SRB3. The same ciphering algorithm as
signalled by _nr-RadioBearerConfig1_ and _nr-RadioBearerConfig2_ as defined in
TS 38.331 [82] is used for all radio bearers using the same key (i.e. K~eNB~
or S-K~gNB~). Likewise, the same integrity algorithm as signalled by _nr-
RadioBearerConfig1_ and _nr-RadioBearerConfig2_ as defined in TS 38.331 [82]
is used for all SRBs using the same key. Although NR RRC uses different values
for the security algorithms than E-UTRA, the actual algorithms are the same in
case of (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC in this version of the specification. Hence, for
such algorithms, the security capabilities supported by a UE are consistent
across these RATs. For MR-DC, integrity protection is not enabled for DRBs
terminated on eNB or when the master node is an ng-eNB.
NOTE 2: The network ensures that different values are used for the SCG counter
and for the _sk-Counter_ when deriving S-K~gNB~ and/or S-K~eNB~ from the same
master key.
#### 5.3.1.2a RN security
For RNs, AS security follows the procedures in 5.3.1.2. Furthermore, E-UTRAN
may configure per DRB whether or not integrity protection is used. The use of
integrity protection may be configured only upon DRB establishment and
reconfigured only upon handover or upon the first reconfiguration following
RRC connection re-establishment.
To provide integrity protection on DRBs between the RN and the E-UTRAN, the
K~UPint~ key is derived from the K~eNB~ key as described in TS 33.401 [32].
The same integrity protection algorithm used for SRBs also applies to the
DRBs. The K~UPint~ changes at every handover and RRC connection re-
establishment and is based on an updated K~eNB~ which is derived by taking
into account the _nextHopChainingCount._ The COUNT value maintained for DRB
ciphering is also used for integrity protection, if the integrity protection
is configured for the DRB.
#### 5.3.1.3 Connected mode mobility
In RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides
when the UE shall connect to which E-UTRA cell(s), or inter-RAT cell. For
network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, the PCell can be changed using
an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the _mobilityControlInfo_
(handover), whereas the SCell(s) can be changed using the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message either with or without the
_mobilityControlInfo_.
In DC, an SCG can be established, reconfigured or released by using an
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message with or without the
_mobilityControlInfo_. In case Random Access to the PSCell or initial PUSCH
transmission to the PSCell if _rach-SkipSCG_ is configured is required upon
SCG reconfiguration, E-UTRAN employs the SCG change procedure (i.e. an
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the
_mobilityControlInfoSCG_). The PSCell can only be changed using the SCG change
procedure and by release and addition of the PSCell.
In (NG)EN-DC, an NR SCG can be established or reconfigured by using an
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message containing _nr-
secondaryCellGroupConfig_ and _nr-RadioBearerConfig_. The contents of _nr-
secondaryCellGroupConfig_ and _nr-RadioBearerConfig_ , of other (NG)EN-DC
fields as well as the associated procedures are specified in TS 38.331 [82].
In (NG)EN-DC, the PSCell can only be changed using the Reconfiguration with
sync procedure, with or without MR-DC release and addition.
The network triggers the handover procedure e.g. based on radio conditions,
load. To facilitate this, the network may configure the UE to perform
measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration of measurement
gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e. without having
received measurement reports from the UE.
Before sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or
more target cells. The source eNB selects the target PCell. The source eNB may
also provide the target eNB with a list of best cells on each frequency for
which measurement information is available, in order of decreasing RSRP. The
source eNB may also include available measurement information for the cells
provided in the list. The target eNB decides which SCells are configured for
use after handover, which may include cells other than the ones indicated by
the source eNB. If an SCG is configured, handover involves either SCG release
or either SCG change (in case of DC) or an _NR SCG reconfiguration with sync
and key change_ (in case of EN-DC and NGEN-DC). In case the UE was configured
with (EN-) DC or NGEN-DC, the target eNB indicates in the handover message
whether the UE shall release the entire (NR) SCG configuration. Upon
connection re-establishment, the UE releases the entire SCG configuration
except for the DRB configuration, while E-UTRAN in the first reconfiguration
message following the re-establishment either releases the DRB(s) or
reconfigures the DRB(s) to MCG DRB(s).
The target eNB generates the message used to perform the handover, i.e. the
message including the AS-configuration to be used in the target cell(s). The
source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/ content) forwards the
handover message/ information received from the target to the UE. When
appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for (a subset of) the
DRBs.
After receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target
PCell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource
selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous, or at
the first available PUSCH occasion if _rach-Skip_ is configured. Consequently,
when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in the target
PCell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH occasion the UE
may use. The first available PUSCH occasion is provided by _ul-ConfigInfo_ ,
if configured, otherwise UE shall monitor the PDCCH of target eNB. Upon
successful completion of the handover, the UE sends a message used to confirm
the handover.
If the target eNB does not support the release of RRC protocol which the
source eNB used to configure the UE, the target eNB may be unable to
comprehend the UE configuration provided by the source eNB. In this case, the
target eNB should use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE for
Handover and Re-establishment. Full configuration option includes an
initialization of the radio configuration, which makes the procedure
independent of the configuration used in the source cell(s) with the exception
that the security algorithms are continued for the RRC re-establishment.
The same behavior applies in (NG)EN-DC, if upon handover the target eNB is
unable to comprehend the MCG part of the UE configuration i.e. the target eNB
uses the full configuration option which involves release and configuration of
(most of the) MCG and NR SCG configuration. In case of (NG)EN-DC, the target
SgNB may be unable to comprehend the NR SCG configuration provided by the
source SgNB. In such a case, release and addition may be applied for the NR
SCG part of the configuration.
NOTE 1: When using release and addition for the NR SCG configuration during
handover or SN change, E-UTRAN includes _drb-ToReleaseList_ for the SN
terminated RBs. For SN modification case, see TS 37.340 [81].
After the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted
in the target cell(s). This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode and for
handovers not involving full configuration option. The further details are
specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of handover not
involving full configuration option, the SN and the HFN are reset except for
the DRBs using RLC-AM mode (for which both SN and HFN continue). For
reconfigurations involving the full configuration option, the PDCP entities
are newly established (SN and HFN do not continue) for all DRBs irrespective
of the RLC mode. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8].
One UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is
regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether
the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).
The source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to
return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure,
the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source PCell or in
another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection
resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a
cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation
has been performed. The cell in which the re-establishment procedure succeeds
becomes the PCell while SCells and STAGs, if configured, are released.
Normal measurement and mobility procedures are used to support handover to
cells broadcasting a CSG identity. In addition, E-UTRAN may configure the UE
to report that it is entering or leaving the proximity of cell(s) included in
its CSG whitelist. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may request the UE to provide
additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell e.g. global
cell identity, CSG identity, CSG membership status.
NOTE 2: E-UTRAN may use the \'proximity report\' to configure measurements as
well as to decide whether or not to request additional information broadcast
by the handover candidate cell. The additional information is used to verify
whether or not the UE is authorised to access the target PCell and may also be
needed to identify handover candidate cell (_PCI confusion_ i.e. when the
physical layer identity that is included in the measurement report does not
uniquely identify the cell).
#### 5.3.1.4 Connection control in NB-IoT
In NB-IoT, during the RRC connection establishment procedure, SRB1bis is
established implicitly with SRB1. SRB1bis uses the logical channel identity
defined in 9.1.2a, with the same configuration as SRB1 but no PDCP entity.
SRB1bis is used until security is activated. The RRC messages to activate
security (command and successful response) are sent over SRB1 being integrity
protected and ciphering is started after completion of the procedure. In case
of unsuccessful security activation, the failure message is sent over SRB1 and
subsequent messages are sent over SRB1bis. Once security is activated, new RRC
messages shall be transmitted using SRB1. A NB-IoT UE that only supports the
Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS 24.301 [35]) only establishes
SRB1bis.
A NB-IoT UE only supports 0, 1 or 2 DRBs, depending on its capability. A NB-
IoT UE that only supports the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS
24.301 [35]) does not need to support any DRBs and associated procedures.
Table 5.3.1.4-1 lists the procedures that are applicable for NB-IoT. All other
procedures are not applicable; this is not further stated in the corresponding
procedures.

an incoming call.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the _Paging_ message at
the UE\'s paging occasion as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. E-UTRAN may address
multiple UEs within a _Paging_ message by including one _PagingRecord_ for
each UE. E-UTRAN may also indicate a change of system information, and/ or
provide an ETWS notification or a CMAS notification in the _Paging_ message.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of the _Paging_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _Paging_ message, the UE shall:

The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection, to resume a
suspended RRC connection, to move the UE from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_CONNECTED or
to perform EDT. RRC connection establishment involves SRB1 (and SRB1bis for
NB-IoT) establishment. The procedure is also used to transfer the initial NAS
dedicated information/ message from the UE to E-UTRAN.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- When establishing an RRC connection:
\- to establish SRB1 and, for NB-IoT, SRB1bis;
\- When resuming an RRC connection from a suspended RRC connection or from
RRC_INACTIVE:
\- to restore the AS configuration from a stored context including resuming
SRB(s) and DRB(s);
\- When performing EDT.
#### 5.3.3.1a Conditions for establishing RRC Connection for sidelink
communication/ discovery/ V2X sidelink communication
For sidelink communication an RRC connection is initiated only in the

#### 5.3.4.1 General
Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful
Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC connection
establishment.
#### 5.3.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the security mode command procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. Moreover, E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- when only SRB1, or for NB-IoT SRB1 and SRB1bis, is established, i.e. prior
to establishment of SRB2 and/ or DRBs.

3> derive the K~UPint~ key associated with the _integrityProtAlgorithm_
indicated in the _SecurityModeCommand_ message, as specified in TS 33.401
[32];
2> configure lower layers to apply integrity protection using the indicated
algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately, i.e. integrity protection shall
be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including
the _SecurityModeComplete_ message;
2> configure lower layers to apply ciphering using the indicated algorithm,
the K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key after completing the procedure, i.e.
ciphering shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the
UE, except for the _SecurityModeComplete_ message which is sent unciphered;
2> if connected as an RN:
3> configure lower layers to apply integrity protection using the indicated
algorithm and the K~UPint~ key, for DRBs that are subsequently configured to
apply integrity protection, if any;
2> consider AS security to be activated;
2> upon RRC connection establishment, if UE does not need UL gaps during
continuous uplink transmission:
3> configure lower layers to stop using UL gaps during continuous uplink
transmission in FDD for _SecurityModeComplete_ message and subsequent uplink
transmission in RRC_CONNECTED except for UL transmissions as specified in TS
36.211 [21];
2> submit the _SecurityModeComplete_ message to lower layers for transmission,
upon which the procedure ends;
1> else:
2> continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of the
_SecurityModeCommand_ message, i.e. neither apply integrity protection nor
ciphering.
2> submit the _SecurityModeFailure_ message to lower layers for transmission,
upon which the procedure ends;
### 5.3.5 RRC connection reconfiguration
#### 5.3.5.1 General
Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC connection reconfiguration, successful
Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC connection reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/ modify/ release RBs, to perform handover, to setup/ modify/ release
measurements, to add/ modify/ release SCells. As part of the procedure, NAS
dedicated information may be transferred from E-UTRAN to the UE.
#### 5.3.5.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN may initiate the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- the _mobilityControlInfo_ is included only when AS-security has been
activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
\- the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC
connection establishment) is included only when AS security has been
activated;
\- the addition of SCells is performed only when AS security has been
activated;

#### 5.3.5.8 Radio Configuration involving full configuration option
The UE shall:
1> if the UE is connected to EPC:
2> release/ clear all current dedicated radio configurations except for the

(NG)EN-DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR SCG configuration.
Such NR SCG configuration does not include the DRB configuration as configured
by _nr-RadioBearerConfig1_ and nr-_RadioBearerConfig2_).
1> if the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message includes the
_measConfigAppLayer_ set to _setup_ and the _measConfigAppLayer_ includes the
_serviceType_ stored in the current UE configuration:

connected to EPC:
3> release the NR PDCP entity and establish it with an E-UTRA PDCP entity and
with the current (MCG) security configuration;
NOTE 1a: The UE applies the LTE ciphering and integrity protection algorithms
that are equivalent to the previously configured NR security algorithms.
3> associate the RLC bearer of this SRB with the established PDCP entity;

including _drb-identity_ of these bearers from the current UE configuration
and trigger the setup of the DRBs within the AS in clause 5.3.10.3 using the
new configuration. The _eps-bearerIdentity_ acts as the anchor for associating
the released and re-setup DRB. In the AS the DRB re-setup is equivalent with a
new DRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).

### 5.3.6 Counter check
#### 5.3.6.1 General
Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by E-UTRAN to request the UE to verify the
amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is
requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT
match with the values indicated by E-UTRAN.
NOTE: The procedure enables E-UTRAN to detect packet insertion by an intruder
(a \'man in the middle\').
#### 5.3.6.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending a _CounterCheck_ message.
NOTE: E-UTRAN may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches
a specific value.
#### 5.3.6.3 Reception of the _CounterCheck_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _CounterCheck_ message, the UE shall:
1> for each DRB that is established:
2> if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is
a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3> assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2> if the _drb-Identity_ is not included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> if the DRB is configured with E-UTRA PDCP:
4> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
3> else if the DRB is configured with NR PDCP:
4> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of TX_NEXT -- 1 and RX_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS
38.323 [83]), respectively;
2> else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT
are different from the value indicated in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> if the DRB is configured with E-UTRA PDCP:
4> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
3> else if the DRB is configured with NR PDCP:
4> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of TX_NEXT -- 1 and RX_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS
38.323 [83]), respectively;
1> for each DRB that is included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ in the
_CounterCheck_ message that is not established:
2> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding
values in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ and the least significant bits set to
zero;
1> submit the _CounterCheckResponse_ message to lower layers for transmission
upon which the procedure ends;
### 5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment
#### 5.3.7.1 General
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC connection re-establishment, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection, which
involves the resumption of SRB1 (SRB1bis for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security
has not been activated) operation, the re-activation of security (except for a
NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated) and the configuration
of only the PCell.
Except for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated, a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED, for which security has been activated, may initiate the
procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-
establishment succeeds only if the concerned cell is prepared i.e. has a valid
UE context. In case E-UTRAN accepts the re-establishment, SRB1 operation
resumes while the operation of other radio bearers remains suspended. If AS
security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but
instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly.
When AS security has not been activated, a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection
re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation in RRC_CONNECTED
may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- When AS security has been activated:
\- to reconfigure SRB1 and to resume data transfer only for this RB;
\- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms.
\- For a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control
Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, when AS security has not been activated:
\- to re-establish SRB1bis and to continue data transfer for this RB.
#### 5.3.7.2 Initiation
The UE shall only initiate the procedure either when AS security has been
activated or for a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for
the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation. The UE initiates the procedure when
one of the following conditions is met:
1> upon detecting radio link failure, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1> upon handover failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.6; or
1> upon mobility from E-UTRA failure, in accordance with 5.4.3.5; or
1> except for UP-EDT, upon integrity check failure indication from lower
layers concerning SRB1 or SRB2; or
1> upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.5;
or
1> upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with TS38.331
[82], clause 5.3.5.5.
NOTE: For UP-EDT, integrity check failure indication from lower layers is
handled in accordance with clause 5.3.3.16.

1> for the MCG, apply the default MAC main configuration as specified in
9.2.2;
1> release _powerPrefIndicationConfig_ , if configured and stop timer T340, if
running;
1> release _reportProximityConfig_ , if configured and clear any associated
proximity status reporting timer;

1> release _idc-Config_ , if configured;
1> release _sps-AssistanceInfoReport_ , if configured;
1> release _measSubframePatternPCell_ , if configured;
1> release the entire SCG configuration, if configured, except for the DRB
configuration (as configured by _drb-ToAddModListSCG_);
1> if (NG)EN-DC is configured:
2> perform MR-DC release, as specified in TS 38.331[82], clause 5.3.5.10;

1> if T309 is running:
2> stop timer T309 for all access categories;
2> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.16.4.
1> if the UE is connected to 5GC and the selected cell is only connected to
EPC; or
1> if the UE is connected to EPC and the selected cell is only connected to
5GC:
2> perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with
release cause \'RRC connection failure\';
1> else:
2> stop timer T311;
2> start timer T301;
2> apply the _timeAlignmentTimerCommon_ included in
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ ;
2> if the UE is a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the

## 5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
### 5.4.1 Introduction
The general principles of connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.3.
The general principles of the security handling upon connected mode mobility
are described in 5.3.1.2.
For the (network controlled) inter RAT mobility from E-UTRA for a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED, a single procedure is defined that supports both handover, cell
change order with optional network assistance (NACC) and enhanced CS fallback
to CDMA2000 1xRTT. The same procedure also supports inter-system handover
between E-UTRA/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC. In case of mobility to CDMA2000, the eNB
decides when to move to the other RAT while the target RAT determines to which
cell the UE shall move.
### 5.4.2 Handover to E-UTRA
#### 5.4.2.1 General
Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to E-UTRA, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network,
transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g.
GERAN, UTRAN or NR) to E-UTRAN, or transfer a connection between the UE and
the E-UTRAN with one type of CN to the E-UTRAN with a different type of CN.
The handover to E-UTRA procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination
with DRBs, are established in another RAT or in E-UTRA connected to another
type of CN. Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has
been activated in UTRAN. Handover to E-UTRA connected to a different type of
CN applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRAN. Handover from
NR to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has been activated in NR.
#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation
The RAN using another RAT or the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN
initiates the handover to E-UTRA procedure, in accordance with the
specifications applicable for the other RAT or for the E-UTRA connected to a
different type of CN, by sending the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message
via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is
performed.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated
in the other RAT or in the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN;
\- to establish SRB1, SRB2 and one or more DRBs, i.e. at least the DRB
associated with the default EPS bearer is established if the target CN is EPC
and at least one DRB is established if the target CN is 5GC.
#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ by the UE
If the UE is able to comply with the configuration included in the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message, the UE shall:
1> if the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message does not include the
_fullConfig_ and the UE is connected to 5GC (i.e., delta signalling during
intra 5GC handover):

configurations for all RBs from source RAT prior to the reception of the
inter-RAT handover _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message);

_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message causes a protocol error for which the
generic error handling as defined in 5.7 specifies that the UE shall ignore
the message.
NOTE 2: If the UE is unable to comply with part of the configuration, it does
not apply any part of the configuration, i.e. there is no partial success/

### 5.4.3 Mobility from E-UTRA
#### 5.4.3.1 General
Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from E-UTRA, successful
Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from E-UTRA, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using
another Radio Access Technology (RAT), e.g. GERAN, UTRA, CDMA2000 systems, NR,
or handover a UE to an E-UTRA cell connected to another type of CN. The
mobility from E-UTRA procedure covers the following type of mobility:
\- handover, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes radio
resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
\- cell change order, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message may include
information facilitating access of and/ or connection establishment in the
target cell, e.g. system information. Cell change order is applicable only to
GERAN; and
\- enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_
message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the
target cell. The enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT may be combined with
concurrent handover or redirection to CDMA2000 HRPD.
NOTE: For the case of dual receiver/transmitter enhanced CS fallback to
CDMA2000 1xRTT, the _DLInformationTransfer_ message is used instead of the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message (see TS 36.300 [9]).
#### 5.4.3.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the mobility from E-UTRA procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ message or in response to
reception of CS fallback indication for the UE from MME, by sending a
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- the procedure is initiated only when AS-security has been activated, and
SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
#### 5.4.3.3 Reception of the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message and
perform a cell change order to GERAN, even if no prior UE measurements have
been performed on the target cell.
The UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> stop timer T312, if running;
1> if T309 is running:
2> stop timer T309 for all access categories;
2> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.16.4.
1> if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set to
_handover_ :
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _utra_ or _geran_ :
3> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards the RAT indicated by the
_targetRAT-Type_ included in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message;
3> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA_ to the upper layers;
3> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specifications of the target RAT;
> 3> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _geran_ :
4> use the contents of _systemInformation_ , if provided for PS Handover, as
the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
NOTE 1: If there are DRBs for which no radio bearers are established in the
target RAT as indicated in the _targetRAT-MessageContainer_ in the message,
the E-UTRA RRC part of the UE does not indicate the release of the concerned
DRBs to the upper layers. Upper layers may derive which bearers are not
established from information received from the AS of the target RAT.
NOTE 2: In case of SR-VCC, the DRB to be replaced is specified in TS 23.216
[61].
2> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _eutra_ :
3> consider inter-system mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
3> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA_ to the upper layers, if included;
3> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with clause 5.4.2.3;
2> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _nr_ :
3> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards NR;
3> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specifications in TS 38.331 [82];
2> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _cdma2000-1XRTT_ or _cdma2000-HRPD_
:
3> forward the _targetRAT-Type_ and the _targetRAT-MessageContainer_ to the
CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-
RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the CDMA2000 target-RAT;
1> else if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set
to _cellChangeOrder_ :
2> start timer T304 with the timer value set to _t304,_ as included in the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message;
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _geran_ :
3> if _networkControlOrder_ is included in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_
message:
4> apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3> else:
4> acquire _networkControlOrder_ and apply the value as specified in TS 44.060
[36];
3> use the contents of _systemInformation_ , if provided, as the system
information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
2> establish the connection to the target cell indicated in the
_CellChangeOrder_ ;
NOTE 3: The criteria for success or failure of the cell change order to GERAN
are specified in TS 44.060 [36].
1> if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set to _e-
CSFB_ :
2> if _messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT_ is present:
3> forward the _messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers for
the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specification of the target RAT;
2> if _mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD_ is present and is set to _handover_ :
3> forward the _messageContCDMA2000-HRPD_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers for the
UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with
the specification of the target RAT;
2> if _mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD_ is present and is set to _redirection_ :
3> forward the _redirectCarrierCDMA2000-HRPD_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
NOTE 4: When the CDMA2000 upper layers in the UE receive both the
_messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT_ and _messageContCDMA2000-HRPD_ the UE performs
concurrent access to both CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD RAT.
NOTE 5: The UE should perform the handover, the cell change order or enhanced
1xRTT CS fallback as soon as possible following the reception of the RRC
message _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ , which could be before confirming
successful reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.
#### 5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from E-UTRA
Upon successfully completing the handover, the cell change order or enhanced
1xRTT CS fallback, the UE shall:
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ is set
to _eutra_ (intra-E-UTRA inter-system HO):
2> indicate to the upper layers associated to the source system the release of
the RRC connection together with the release cause \'other\';
2> the procedure ends;
1> else if the UE was connected to 5GC prior to the reception of the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ and the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ is set to _nr_ :
2> reset MAC;
2> stop all timers that are running except T325 and T330;
2> release _ran-NotificationAreaInfo_ , if stored;
2> release the AS security context including the K~RRCenc~ key, the K~RRCint~,
the K~UPint~ key and the K~UPenc~ key, if stored;
2> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity, the MAC
configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all
established RBs;
NOTE 1: PDCP and SDAP configured by the source configurations RAT prior to the
handover that are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling
(i.e., during inter-RAT intra-sytem handover when _fullConfig_ is not present)
is used, are not released as part of this procedure.
1> else:
2> perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with
release cause \'other\';
NOTE 2: If the UE performs enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback along with concurrent
mobility to CDMA2000 HRPD and the connection to either CDMA2000 1xRTT or
CDMA2000 HRPD succeeds, then the mobility from E-UTRA is considered
successful.
#### 5.4.3.5 Mobility from E-UTRA failure
The UE shall:
1> if T304 configured in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message expires
(mobility from E-UTRA failure); or
1> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target
radio access technology; or
1> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in
the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message; or
1> if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message, causing the UE to fail the procedure
according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT (i.e. according
to clause 5.3.5.6 if the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ is set to _eutra_):
2> stop T304, if running;
2> if the _cs-FallbackIndicator_ in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message was
set to _TRUE_ or _e-CSFB_ was present:
_3 >_ indicate to upper layers that the CS fallback procedure has failed;
2> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell, excluding the
configuration configured by the _physicalConfigDedicated_ , _mac-MainConfig_
and _sps-Config_ ;
2> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;
NOTE: For enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, the above UE behavior
applies only when the UE is attempting the enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback and
connection to the target radio access technology fails or if the UE is
attempting enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback along with concurrent mobility to
CDMA2000 HRPD and connection to both the target radio access technologies
fails.
### 5.4.4 Handover from E-UTRA preparation request (CDMA2000)
#### 5.4.4.1 General
Figure 5.4.4.1-1: Handover from E-UTRA preparation request
The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the UE to prepare for handover or
enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback to CDMA2000 by requesting a connection with this
network. The UE may use this procedure to concurrently prepare for handover to
CDMA2000 HRPD along with preparation for enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000
1xRTT. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
This procedure is also used to trigger the UE which supports dual Rx/Tx
enhanced 1xCSFB to redirect its second radio to CDMA2000 1xRTT.
The handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure applies when signalling
radio bearers are established.
#### 5.4.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure to a
UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ message or
CS fallback indication for the UE, by sending a
_HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message. E-UTRA initiates the procedure
only when AS security has been activated.
#### 5.4.4.3 Reception of the _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ by the UE
Upon reception of the _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message, the UE
shall:
1> if _dualRxTxRedirectIndicator_ is present in the received message:
2> forward _dualRxTxRedirectIndicator_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2> forward _redirectCarrierCDMA2000-1XRTT_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers, if
included;
1> else:
2> indicate the request to prepare handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback and
forward the _cdma2000-Type_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2> if _cdma2000-Type_ is set to _type1XRTT_ :
3> forward the _rand_ and the _mobilityParameters_ to the CDMA2000 upper
layers;
2> if _concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD_ is present in the received message:
3> forward _concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2> else:
3> forward _concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD_ , with its value set to _FALSE_ , to the
CDMA2000 upper layers;
### 5.4.5 UL handover preparation transfer (CDMA2000)
#### 5.4.5.1 General
Figure 5.4.5.1-1: UL handover preparation transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to tunnel the handover related CDMA2000
dedicated information or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback related CDMA2000 dedicated
information from UE to E-UTRAN when requested by the higher layers. The
procedure is triggered by the higher layers on receipt of
_HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message. If preparing for enhanced CS
fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT and handover to CDMA2000 HRPD, the UE sends two
consecutive _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ messages to E-UTRAN, one per
addressed CDMA2000 RAT Type. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs
only.
#### 5.4.5.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL handover preparation transfer procedure
whenever there is a need to transfer handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback
related non-3GPP dedicated information. The UE initiates the UL handover
preparation transfer procedure by sending the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_
message.
#### 5.4.5.3 Actions related to transmission of the
_ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
as follows:
1> include the _cdma2000-Type_ and the _dedicatedInfo_ ;
1> if the _cdma2000-Type_ is set to _type1XRTT_ :
2> include the _meid_ and set it to the value received from the CDMA2000 upper
layers;
1> submit the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
#### 5.4.5.4 Failure to deliver the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
The UE shall:
1> if the UE is unable to guarantee successful delivery of
_ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ messages:
2> inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information
contained in the concerned _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message;
### 5.4.6 Inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN
#### 5.4.6.1 General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN procedure is to
transfer, under the control of the source radio access technology, a
connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/ GPRS)
to E-UTRAN.
#### 5.4.6.2 Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than E-UTRAN,
e.g. GSM/GPRS, using procedures specific for that RAT, orders the UE to change
to an E-UTRAN cell. In response, upper layers request the establishment of an
RRC connection as specified in clause 5.3.3.
NOTE: Within the message used to order the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell,
the source RAT should specify the identity of the target E-UTRAN cell as
specified in the specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1> upon receiving an _RRCConnectionSetup_ message:
2> consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have completed
successfully;
#### 5.4.6.3 UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell change order
If the inter-RAT cell change order fails the UE shall return to the other
radio access technology and proceed as specified in the appropriate
specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1> upon failure to establish the RRC connection as specified in clause 5.3.3:
2> consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have failed;
NOTE: The cell change was network ordered. Therefore, failure to change to the
target PCell should not cause the UE to move to UE-controlled cell selection.
## 5.5 Measurements
### 5.5.1 Introduction
The UE reports measurement information in accordance with the measurement
configuration as provided by E-UTRAN. E-UTRAN provides the measurement
configuration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated
signalling, i.e. using the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ or
_RRCConnectionResume_ message.
The UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:
\- Intra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier
frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).
\- Inter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from
any of the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).
\- Inter-RAT measurements of NR frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT or WLAN
frequencies.
\- CBR measurements.
\- Sensing measurements.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1\. **Measurement objects:** The objects on which the UE shall perform the
measurements.
\- For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object
is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency,
E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of
\'blacklisted\' cells and a list of \'whitelisted\' cells. Blacklisted cells
are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
\- For inter-RAT NR measurements a measurement object is a single NR carrier
frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a
list of \'blacklisted\' cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event
evaluation or measurement reporting.
\- For inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a
single UTRA carrier frequency.
\- For inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN
carrier frequencies.
\- For inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells
on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.
\- For inter-RAT WLAN measurements a measurement object is a set of WLAN
identifiers and optionally a set of WLAN frequencies.
\- For CBR measurements and sensing measurements a measurement object is a set
of transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication.
NOTE 1: Some measurements using the above mentioned measurement objects, only
concern a single cell, e.g. measurements used to report neighbouring cell
system information, PCell UE Rx-Tx time difference, or a pair of cells, e.g.
SSTD measurements between the PCell and the PSCell.
2\. **Reporting configurations** : A list of reporting configurations where
each reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement
report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).
3\. **Measurement identities** : A list of measurement identities where each
measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting
configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible
to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration,
as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same
measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in
the measurement report.
4\. **Quantity configurations:** One quantity configuration is configured per
RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and
associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of
that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity,
except for NR where the network may configure up to 2 sets of quantity
configurations each comprising per measurement quantity seperate filters for
cell and RS index measurement results. The quantity configuration set that
applies for a given measurement is indicated within the NR measurement object.
5\. **Measurement gaps:** Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements,
i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.
E-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency
(except for WLAN and except for CBR measurements), i.e. it is not possible to
configure two or more measurement objects for the same frequency with
different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets and/ or blacklists.
E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event e.g. by configuring
two reporting configurations with different thresholds.
The UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting
configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement
object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type,
possibly including intra-frequency object(s) (i.e. the object(s) corresponding
to the serving frequency(ies)), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT
objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and
inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to
any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting
configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some
measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1\. The serving cell(s) - these are the PCell and one or more SCells, if
configured for a UE supporting CA or DC. Likewise, NR serving cell(s) are the
NR PCell, NR PSCell and NR SCells, if the UE is configured with MR-DC.
2\. Listed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s) or,
for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs matching the WLAN identifiers configured in the
measurement object or the WLAN the UE is connected to.
3\. Detected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies)
indicated by the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs not
included in the _measObjectWLAN_ but meeting the triggering requirements.
For E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells,
detected cells, transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication,
and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports
on any reception on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT NR, the UE measures
and reports on detected cells and, if configured with MR-DC, on NR serving
cell(s). For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and
optionally on cells that are within a range for which reporting is allowed by
E-UTRAN. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected cells.
For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For
inter-RAT WLAN, the UE measures and reports on listed cells.
NOTE 2: For inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on
detected cells for the purpose of SON.
NOTE 3: This specification is based on the assumption that typically CSG cells
of home deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list.
Furthermore, the assumption is that for non-home deployments, the physical
cell identity is unique within the area of a large macro cell (i.e. as for
UTRAN).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause 5.5.2,
refers to a field it concerns a field included in the _VarMeasConfig_ unless
explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure
covers the direct UE action related to the received _measConfig_.
### 5.5.2 Measurement configuration
#### 5.5.2.1 General
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to ensure that, whenever the UE has a _measConfig_ , it includes a
_measObject_ for each LTE serving frequency;
\- to configure at most one measurement identity using a reporting
configuration with the _purpose_ set to _reportCGI_ ;
\- for E-UTRA serving frequencies, set the EARFCN within the corresponding
_measObject_ according to the band as used for reception/ transmission;
\- to configure at most one measurement identity using a reporting
configuration with _ul-DelayConfig_ ;
\- to configure at most one measurement identity using a reporting
configuration with _reportSFTD-Meas_ ;
\- to configure at most one _MeasObjectNR_ with the same _carrierFreq_ ;
The UE shall:
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _measObjectToRemoveList_ :

received value of _allowInterruptions_ ;
#### 5.5.2.2 Measurement identity removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the received _measIdToRemoveList_ that is
part of the current UE configuration in _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> remove the entry with the matching _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within
the _VarMeasConfig_ ;
2> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
2> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, and reset the associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this
_measId_ ;
NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the
_measIdToRemoveList_ includes any _measId_ value that is not part of the
current UE configuration.
#### 5.5.2.2a Measurement identity autonomous removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the associated _reportConfig_ concerns an event involving a serving cell
while the concerned serving cell is not configured; or
2> if the associated _reportConfig_ concerns an event involving a WLAN
mobility set while the concerned WLAN mobility set is not configured; or
2> if the associated _reportConfig_ concerns an event involving a transmission
resource pool for V2X sidelink communication while the concerned resource pool
is not configured; or
2> if the associated _reportConfig_ concerns an event involving _reportSFTD-
Meas_ set to _pSCell_ while the _nr-Config_ is not configured:

3> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
3> stop the periodical reporting timer if running, and reset the associated
information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this _measId_ ;
NOTE 1: The above UE autonomous removal of _measId_ \'s applies only for
measurement events A1, A2, A6, and also applies for events A3 and A5 if
configured for PSCell and W2 and W3 and V1 and V2 and event involving
_reportSFTD-Meas_ set to _pSCell_ , if configured.
NOTE 2: When performed during re-establishment, the UE is only configured with
a primary frequency (i.e. the SCell(s) and WLAN mobility set are released, if
configured).
#### 5.5.2.3 Measurement identity addition/ modification
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- configure a _measId_ only if the corresponding measurement object, the
corresponding reporting configuration and the corresponding quantity
configuration, are configured;
The UE shall:

that is part of the current UE configuration in _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> remove the entry with the matching _measObjectId_ from the _measObjectList_
within the _VarMeasConfig_ ;
2> remove all _measId_ associated with this _measObjectId_ from the
_measIdList_ within the _VarMeasConfig,_ if any;
2> if a _measId_ is removed from the _measIdList:_
3> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
3> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, and reset the associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this
_measId_ ;
NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the
_measObjectToRemoveList_ includes any _measObjectId_ value that is not part of
the current UE configuration.

#### 5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1> for each measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according
to 5.5.3.1:
> NOTE 1: This does not include quantities configured solely for UE Rx-Tx time
> difference, SSTD measurements and RSSI, channel occupancy measurements, WLAN
> measurements of Band, Carrier Info, Available Admission Capacity, Backhaul
> Bandwidth, Channel Utilization, and Station Count, CBR measurement, sensing
> measurement and UL PDCP Packet Delay per QCI measurement i.e. for those
> types of measurements the UE ignores the _triggerQuantity_ and
> _reportQuantity_.
2> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:
> where
>
> **_M~n~_** is the latest received measurement result from the physical
> layer;
>
> **_F~n~_** is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for
> evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
>
> **_F~n-1~_** is the old filtered measurement result, where **_F~0~_** is set
> to **_M~1~_** when the first measurement result from the physical layer is
> received; and
>
> except for NR, **_a_** = 1/2^(**_k_** /4)^, where **_k_** is the
> _filterCoefficient_ for the corresponding measurement quantity received by
> the _quantityConfig; for NR,__a_**= 1/2^(**_ki_**/4)^, where** _k~i~___is
> the_ filterCoefficient_ for the corresponding measurement quantity of the
> i:th _QuantityConfigNR_ in _quantityConfigNRList_ , and _i_ is indicated by
> _quantityConfigSet_ in _MeasObjectNR;_
2> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are
preserved at different input rates, observing that the _filterCoefficient_
**_k_** assumes a sample rate equal to 200 ms;
> NOTE 2: If **_k_** is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
>
> NOTE 3: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation
> of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic

### 5.5.6 Measurement related actions
#### 5.5.6.1 Actions upon handover and re-establishment
E-UTRAN applies the handover procedure as follows:
\- when performing the handover procedure, as specified in 5.3.5.4, ensure
that a _measObjectId_ corresponding to each handover target serving frequency
is configured as a result of the procedures described in this clause and in
5.3.5.4;
\- when changing the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged,
E-UTRAN releases the _measObject_ corresponding to the source frequency and
adds a _measObject_ corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not
reconfigure the _measObject_);
E-UTRAN applies the re-establishment procedure as follows:
\- when performing the connection re-establishment procedure, as specified in
5.3.7, ensure that a _measObjectId_ corresponding each target serving
frequency is configured as a result of the procedure described in this clause
and the subsequent connection reconfiguration procedure immediately following
the re-establishment procedure;
\- in the first reconfiguration following the re-establishment when changing
the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged, E-UTRAN releases the
_measObject_ corresponding to the source frequency and adds a _measObject_
corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not reconfigure the
_measObject_);
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to _periodical_ :
3> remove this _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
1> if the procedure was triggered due to a handover or successful re-
establishment and the procedure involves a change of primary frequency, update
the _measId_ values in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ as follows:
2> if a _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the target primary frequency
exists in the _measObjectList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
3> for each _measId_ value in the _measIdList_ :
4> if the _measId_ value is linked to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding
to the source primary frequency:
5> link this _measId_ value to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the
target primary frequency;
4> else if the _measId_ value is linked to the _measObjectId_ value
corresponding to the target primary frequency:
5> link this _measId_ value to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the
source primary frequency;
2> else:
3> remove all _measId_ values that are linked to the _measObjectId_ value
corresponding to the source primary frequency;
1> remove all measurement reporting entries within _VarMeasReportList_ ;
1> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, as well as associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for all
_measId_ ;
1> release the measurement gaps (configured by E-UTRA RRC), if activated;
NOTE 1: If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency or
inter-RAT measurements, the UE resumes the inter-frequency and inter-RAT
measurements after the E-UTRAN has setup the measurement gaps.
NOTE 2: In this procedure, the UE may or may not release the
_measGapSharingConfig_.
#### 5.5.6.2 Speed dependant scaling of measurement related parameters
The UE shall adjust the value of the following parameter configured by the
E-UTRAN depending on the UE speed: _timeToTrigger_. The UE shall apply 3
different levels, which are selected as follows:
The UE shall:
1> perform mobility state detection using the mobility state detection as
specified in TS 36.304 [4] with the following modifications:
2> counting handovers instead of cell reselections;
2> applying the parameter applicable for RRC_CONNECTED as included in
_speedStatePars_ within _VarMeasConfig;_
> 1> if high mobility state is detected:
2> use the _timeToTrigger_ value multiplied by _sf-High_ within
_VarMeasConfig_ ;
> 1> else if medium mobility state is detected:
2> use the _timeToTrigger_ value multiplied by _sf-Medium_ within
_VarMeasConfig_ ;
1> else:
> 2> no scaling is applied;
### 5.5.7 Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication
#### 5.5.7.1 General
Figure 5.5.7.1-1: Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is
going to start/stop OTDOA inter-frequency RSTD measurements which require
measurement gaps as specified in TS 36.133 [16], clause 8.1.2.6. The procedure
is also used to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop
OTDOA intra-frequency RSTD measurements which require measurement gaps. This
procedure is also used to indicate to the network the measurement gap that the
category M1 or M2 UE prefers to perform RSTD measurements with dense PRS
configuration, as specified in TS 36.133 [16], Table 8.1.2.1-3.
NOTE: It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
#### 5.5.7.2 Initiation
The UE shall:
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing inter-frequency
RSTD measurements and the UE requires measurement gaps for these measurements
while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2> initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1: The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the
indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are
available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new
indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the
procedure in the same PCell once per frequency if the provided measurement
gaps are insufficient.
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing inter-frequency
RSTD measurements:
2> initiate the procedure to indicate stop;
NOTE 2: The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not
previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
#### 5.5.7.3 Actions related to transmission of
_InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication_ message
The UE shall set the contents of _InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication_ message
as follows:
1> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start or stop of inter-frequency
RSTD measurements:
2> set the _rstd-InterFreqIndication_ as follows:
3> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of inter-frequency RSTD
measurements:
4> set the _rstd-InterFreqInfoList_ according to the information received from
upper layers;
4> for category M1 or M2 UE, if the procedure is initated to indicate the
measurement gap that the UE prefers to perform RSTD measurements with dense
PRS configuration:
5> set the _measPRS-Offset-r15_ according to the UE preference;
3> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of inter-frequency RSTD
measurements:
4> set the _rstd-InterFreqIndication_ to the value _stop_ ;
1> else:
2> set the _rstd-InterFreqIndication_ as follows:
3> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of intra-frequency RSTD
measurements:
4> set the _carrierFreq_ in the _rstd-InterFreqInfoList_ to the carrier
frequency of the serving cell;
4> for category M1 or M2 UE, if the procedure is initated to indicate the
measurement gap that the UE prefers to perform RSTD measurements with dense
PRS configuration:
5> set the _measPRS-Offset-r15_ according to the UE preference;
3> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of intra-frequency RSTD
measurements:
4> set the _rstd-InterFreqIndication_ to the value _stop_ ;
1> submit the _InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
## 5.6 Other
### 5.6.0 General
For NB-IoT, only a subset of the procedures described in this clause apply.
Table 5.6.0-1 specifies the procedures that are applicable to NB-IoT. All
other procedures are not applicable to NB-IoT; this is not further stated in
the corresponding procedures.

* * *
### 5.6.1 DL information transfer
#### 5.6.1.1 General
Figure 5.6.1.1-1: DL information transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer NAS, (tunnelled) non-3GPP
dedicated information or time reference information from E-UTRAN to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.6.1.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the DL information transfer procedure whenever there is a
need to transfer NAS, non-3GPP dedicated information or time reference
information. E-UTRAN initiates the DL information transfer procedure by
sending the _DLInformationTransfer_ message.
#### 5.6.1.3 Reception of the _DLInformationTransfer_ by the UE
Upon receiving _DLInformationTransfer_ message, the UE shall:
1> if the UE is a NB-IoT UE; or
1> if the _dedicatedInfoType_ is present and set to _dedicatedInfoNAS_ :
2> forward the _dedicatedInfoNAS_ to the NAS upper layers.
1> if the _dedicatedInfoType_ is present and set to
_dedicatedInfoCDMA2000-1XRTT_ or to _dedicatedInfoCDMA2000-HRPD_ :
2> forward the _dedicatedInfoCDMA2000_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
1> if _timeReferenceInfo_ is included:
2> calculate the time reference based on the included _time_ , _timeInfoType_
and _referenceSFN_ in _timeReferenceInfo_ ;
2> calculate the inaccuracy of the time reference based on the _uncertainty_
and other implementation-related inaccuracies, if _uncertainty_ is included in
_timeReferenceInfo_ ;
2> inform upper layers of the time reference and, if _uncertainty_ is included
in _timeReferenceInfo,_ of the inaccuracy of the time reference.
### 5.6.2 UL information transfer
#### 5.6.2.1 General
Figure 5.6.2.1-1: UL information transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer NAS or (tunnelled) non-3GPP
dedicated information from the UE to E-UTRAN.
#### 5.6.2.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever
there is a need to transfer NAS or non-3GPP dedicated information, except at
RRC connection establishment or resume in which case the NAS information is
piggybacked to the _RRCConnectionSetupComplete_ or
_RRCConnectionResumeComplete_ message correspondingly. The UE initiates the UL
information transfer procedure by sending the _ULInformationTransfer_ message.
When CDMA2000 information has to be transferred, the UE shall initiate the
procedure only if SRB2 is established.
#### 5.6.2.3 Actions related to transmission of _ULInformationTransfer_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULInformationTransfer_ message as
follows:
1> if there is a need to transfer NAS information:
2> if the UE is a NB-IoT UE:
3> set the _dedicatedInfoNAS_ to include the information received from upper
layers;
2> else, set the _dedicatedInfoType_ to include the _dedicatedInfoNAS_ ;
1> if there is a need to transfer CDMA2000 1XRTT information:
2> set the _dedicatedInfoType_ to include the _dedicatedInfoCDMA2000-1XRTT_ ;
1> if there is a need to transfer CDMA2000 HRPD information:
2> set the _dedicatedInfoType_ to include the _dedicatedInfoCDMA2000-HRPD_ ;
1> upon RRC connection establishment, if UE supports the Control Plane CIoT
EPS optimisation and UE does not need UL gaps during continuous uplink
transmission:
2> configure lower layers to stop using UL gaps during continuous uplink
transmission in FDD for _ULInformationTransfer_ message and subsequent uplink
transmission in RRC_CONNECTED except for UL transmissions as specified in TS
36.211 [21];
1> submit the _ULInformationTransfer_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
#### 5.6.2.4 Failure to deliver _ULInformationTransfer_ message
The UE shall:
1> if the UE is a NB-IoT UE, AS security is not started and radio link failure
occurs before the successful delivery of _ULInformationTransfer_ messages has
been confirmed by lower layers; or
1> if mobility (i.e. handover, RRC connection re-establishment) occurs before
the successful delivery of _ULInformationTransfer_ messages has been confirmed
by lower layers:
2> inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information
contained in the concerned _ULInformationTransfer_ messages;
### 5.6.2a UL information transfer for MR-DC
#### 5.6.2a.1 General
Figure 5.6.2a.1-1: UL information transfer MR-DC
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer from the UE to E-UTRAN MR-DC
dedicated information e.g. the NR RRC Measurement Report message.
#### 5.6.2a.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever
there is a need to transfer MR DC dedicated information as specified in TS
38.331 [82]. I.e. the procedure is not used during an RRC connection
reconfiguration involving NR connection reconfiguration, in which case the MR
DC information is piggybacked to the _RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete_
message.
#### 5.6.2a.3 Actions related to transmission of _ULInformationTransferMRDC_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULInformationTransferMRDC_ message as
follows:
1> if there is a need to transfer MR DC dedicated information:
2> set the _ul-DCCH-MessageNR_ to include the MR DC dedicated information to
be transferred;
1> submit the _ULInformationTransferMRDC_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
#### 5.6.2a.4 Void
### 5.6.3 UE capability transfer
#### 5.6.3.1 General
Figure 5.6.3.1-1: UE capability transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer UE radio access capability
information from the UE to E-UTRAN.
If the UE has changed its E-UTRAN radio access capabilities, the UE shall
request higher layers to initiate the necessary NAS procedures (see TS 23.401
[41]) that would result in the update of UE radio access capabilities using a
new RRC connection.
NOTE: Change of the UE\'s GERAN UE radio capabilities in RRC_IDLE is supported
by use of Tracking Area Update.
#### 5.6.3.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs
(additional) UE radio access capability information. Except if the UE is using
Control plane CIoT EPS optimisation, E-UTRAN should retrieve UE capabilities
only after AS security activation and E-UTRAN does not forward capabilities
that were retrieved before AS security activation to the CN.
#### 5.6.3.3 Reception of the _UECapabilityEnquiry_ by the UE
The UE shall:
1> for NB-IoT, set the contents of _UECapabilityInformation_ message as
follows:
2> include the _UE Radio Access Capability Parameters_ within the _ue-
Capability_ ;

EUTRA-Capabilities_ and _tdd-Add-UE-EUTRA-Capabilities_ (including their sub-
fields), to include the values applicable for both FDD and TDD (i.e.
functionality supported by both modes);
4> if (some of) the UE capability fields have a different value for FDD and
TDD:
5> if for FDD, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is
indicated by the previous fields of _UECapabilityInformation_ :
6> include field _fdd-Add-UE-EUTRA-Capabilities_ and set it to include fields
reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FDD;

indicated by the previous fields of _UECapabilityInformation_ :
6> include field _tdd-Add-UE-EUTRA-Capabilities_ and set it to include fields
reflecting the additional functionality applicable for TDD;
NOTE 1: The UE includes fields of _XDD-Add-UE-EUTRA-Capabilities_ in
accordance with the following:
\- The field is included only if one or more of its sub-fields (or bits in the
feature group indicators string) has a value that is different compared to the
value signalled elsewhere within _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ ;
(this value signalled elsewhere is also referred to as the _Common value_ ,
that is supported for both XDD modes)
\- For the fields that are included in _XDD-Add-UE-EUTRA-Capabilities_ , the

### 5.6.9 In-device coexistence indication
#### 5.6.9.1 General
Figure 5.6.9.1-1: In-device coexistence indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN about (a change of) the In-
Device Coexistence (IDC) problems experienced by the UE in RRC_CONNECTED, as
described in TS 36.300 [9], and to provide the E-UTRAN with information in
order to resolve them.
#### 5.6.9.2 Initiation
A UE capable of providing IDC indications may initiate the procedure when it
is configured to provide IDC indications and upon change of IDC problem
information.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if configured to provide IDC indications:
2> if the UE did not transmit an _InDeviceCoexIndication message_ since it was
configured to provide IDC indications:
3> if on one or more frequencies for which a _measObjectEUTRA_ is configured,
the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if on one or more
supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies for which a
measurement object is configured, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it
cannot solve by itself; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for MR-DC, and if on one or more
supported MR-DC combination comprising of at least one E-UTRA carrier
frequency for which a measurement object is configured and at least one NR
carrier frequency included in _candidateServingFreqListNR_ , the UE is
experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself:
4> initiate transmission of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.6.9.3;
2> else:
3> if the set of frequencies, for which a _measObjectEUTRA_ is configured and
on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself,
is different from the set indicated in the last transmitted
_InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if for one or more of the frequencies in the previously reported set of
frequencies, the _interferenceDirection_ is different from the value indicated
in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if the TDM assistance information is different from the assistance
information included in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message;
or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if the
_victimSystemType_ is different from the value indicated in the last
transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if the set of
supported UL CA combinations on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that
it cannot solve by itself and that the UE includes in
_affectedCarrierFreqCombList_ according to 5.6.9.3, is different from the set
indicated in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for MR-DC, and if the
_victimSystemType_ is different from the value indicated in the last
transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for MR-DC, for one or more of the
frequencies in the previously reported set of frequencies, if
_interferenceDirectionMRDC_ is different from the value indicated in the last
transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for MR-DC, and if the set of
supported MR-DC combinations on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that
it cannot solve by itself and that the UE includes in
_affectedCarrierFreqCombInfoListMRDC_ according to 5.6.9.3, is different from
the set indicated in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message:
4> initiate transmission of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.6.9.3;
NOTE 1: The term \"IDC problems\" refers to interference issues applicable
across several subframes/slots where not necessarily all the subframes/slots
are affected.
NOTE 2: For the frequencies on which a serving cell or serving cells is
configured that is activated, IDC problems consist of interference issues that
the UE cannot solve by itself, during either active data exchange or upcoming
data activity which is expected in up to a few hundred milliseconds.\ For
frequencies on which a SCell or SCells is configured that is deactivated,
reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that the activation of the
SCell or SCells would result in interference issues that the UE would not be
able to solve by itself.\ For a non-serving frequency, reporting IDC problems
indicates an anticipation that if the non-serving frequency or frequencies
became a serving frequency or serving frequencies then this would result in
interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.
#### 5.6.9.3 Actions related to transmission of _InDeviceCoexIndication_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message as
follows:

4> include a set of at least one NR carrier frequency included in
_candidateServingFreqListNR_ and optionally one or more E-UTRA carrier
frequency for which a measurement object is configured, that is affected by
IDC problems;
3> else:
4> optionally include a set of at least one NR carrier frequency included in
_candidateServingFreqListNR_ and optionally one or more E-UTRA carrier
frequency for which a measurement object is configured, that is affected by

which measurement results are available:
2> set the _measResultFreqListNR_ to include the best measured cells, ordered
such that the best cell is listed first using RSRP to order if RSRP
measurement results are available for cells on this frequency, otherwise using
RSRQ to order if RSRQ measurement results are available for cells on this
frequency, otherwise using SINR to order, and based on measurements collected
up to the moment the UE detected the failure, and for each cell that is
included, include the optional fields that are available;
NOTE: Field _measResultSCG_ is used to report available results for NR
frequencies the UE is configured to measure by NR RRC signalling.
The UE shall submit the _SCGFailureInformationNR_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
### 5.6.14 LTE-WLAN Aggregation
#### 5.6.14.1 Introduction
E-UTRAN can configure the UE to connect to a WLAN and configure bearers for
LWA (referred to as LWA DRBs). The UE uses the WLAN parameters received from
E-UTRAN in performing WLAN measurements. The UE also performs WLAN connection
management as described in 5.6.15 while LWA is configured.
#### 5.6.14.2 Reception of LWA configuration
Upon reception of LWA configuration, the UE shall:
1> if the received _lwa-Configuration_ is set to _release_ :

1> else:
2> if the received _lwa-Config_ includes _lwa-WT-Counter_ :
3> determine the S-K~WT~ key based on the K~eNB~ key and received _lwa-WT-
Counter_ value, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
3> forward the S-K~WT~ key to upper layers to be used as a PMK or PSK for WLAN
authentication;
2> if the received _lwa-Config_ includes _lwa-MobilityConfig:_
3> if the received _lwa-MobilityConfig_ includes _wlan-ToReleaseList_ :
4> for each _WLAN-Identifiers_ included in _wlan-ToReleaseList_ :
5> remove the _WLAN-Identifiers_ if already part of the current _wlan-
MobilitySet_ in _VarWLAN-MobilityConfig;_
3> if the received _lwa-MobilityConfig_ includes _wlan-ToAddList_ :
4> for each _WLAN-Identifiers_ included in _wlan-ToAddList_ :

4> set _successReportRequested_ in _VarWLAN-MobilityConfig_ to the value of
_successReportRequested_ ;
3> if the received _lwa-MobilityConfig_ includes _wlan-SuspendConfig_ :
4> set the field(s) in _wlan-SuspendConfig_ within _VarWLAN-MobilityConfig_ to
the value(s) of field(s) included in _wlan-SuspendConfig_ ;
2> start WLAN Status Monitoring as described in 5.6.15.4;
#### 5.6.14.3 Release of LWA configuration
To release the LWA configuration, the UE shall:

> Status;_
1> stop timer T351, if running;
1> stop WLAN status monitoring and WLAN connection attempts for LWA;
1> indicate the release of LWA configuration, if configured, to upper layers;
### 5.6.15 WLAN connection management
#### 5.6.15.1 Introduction
WLAN connection management procedures in this clause are triggered as
specified in other clauses where the UE is using a WLAN connection for LWA,
RCLWI or LWIP.
The UE stores the current WLAN mobility set, which is a set of one or more
WLAN identifier(s) (e.g. BSSID, SSID, HESSID) in _wlan-MobilitySet_ in
_VarWLAN-MobilityConfig._ This WLAN mobility set can be configured and updated
by the eNB. A WLAN is considered to be inside the WLAN mobility set if its
identifiers match all WLAN identifiers of at least one entry in _wlan-
MobilitySet_ and outside the WLAN mobility set otherwise. When the UE receives
a new or updated WLAN mobility set, it initiates connection to a WLAN inside
the WLAN mobility set _,_ if not already connected to such a WLAN, and starts
WLAN status monitoring as described in 5.6.15.4. The UE can perform WLAN
mobility within the WLAN mobility set (connect or reconnect to a WLAN inside
the WLAN mobility set) without any signalling to E-UTRAN.
The UE reports the WLAN connection status information to E-UTRAN as described
in 5.6.15.2. The information in this report is based on the monitoring of WLAN
connection as described in 5.6.15.4.
#### 5.6.15.2 WLAN connection status reporting
##### 5.6.15.2.1 General
Figure 5.6.15.2.1-1: WLAN connection status reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN about the status of WLAN
connection for LWA, RCLWI, or LWIP.
##### 5.6.15.2.2 Initiation

1> it connects successfully to a WLAN inside WLAN mobility set while T351 is
running after a WLAN mobility set change; or
1> after a _lwa-WT-Counter_ update or after a _lwip-Counter_ update (if
success report is requested by the eNB); or
1> its connection or connection attempts to all WLAN(s) inside WLAN mobility
set fails in accordance with WLAN Status Monitoring described in 5.6.15.4; or
1> T351 expires; or
1> its WLAN connection to all WLAN(s) inside WLAN mobility set becomes
temporarily unavailable; or
1> its WLAN connection to a WLAN inside the WLAN mobility set is successfully
established after its previous WLAN Connection Status Report indicating WLAN
temporary suspension;

1> if WLAN connection or connection attempts to all WLAN(s) inside WLAN
mobility set fails:
2> if the failure is due to WLAN radio link issues:
3> set the _status_ in _VarWLAN-Status_ to _failureWlanRadioLink;_
> 2> else if the failure is due to UE internal problems related to WLAN:
3> set the _status_ in _VarWLAN-Status_ to _failureWlanUnavailable;_
NOTE 1: The UE internal problems related to WLAN include connection to another
WLAN based on user preferences or turning off WLAN connection or connection
rejection from WLAN or other WLAN problems.

### 5.6.17 LTE-WLAN aggregation with IPsec tunnel
#### 5.6.17.1 General
The WLAN resources that are used over the LWIP tunnel as described in TS
36.300 [9] established as part of LWIP procedures are referred to as \'LWIP
resources\'. The purpose of this clause is to specify procedures to indicate
to higher layers to initiate the establishment/ release of the LWIP tunnel
over WLAN and to indicate which DRB(s) shall use the LWIP resources.
#### 5.6.17.2 LWIP reconfiguration
The UE shall:
1> if the received _lwip-Configuration_ _is set to release_ :
2> release the LWIP configuration, if configured, as described in 5.6.17.3;
1> else:
2> if _lwip-MobilityConfig is included_ :

### 5.6.18 Void
### 5.6.19 Application layer measurement reporting
#### 5.6.19.1 General
Figure 5.6.19.1-1: Application layer measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN about application layer
measurement report.
#### 5.6.19.2 Initiation
A UE capable of application layer measurement reporting in RRC_CONNECTED may
initiate the procedure when configured with application layer measurement,
i.e. when _measConfigAppLayer_ has been configured by E-UTRAN.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if configured with application layer measurement, and SRB4 is configured,
and the UE has received application layer measurement report information from
upper layers:
2> set the _measReportAppLayerContainer_ in the _MeasReportAppLayer_ message
to the value of the application layer measurement report information;
2> set the _serviceType_ in the _MeasReportAppLayer_ message to the type of
the application layer measurement report information;
2> submit the _MeasReportAppLayer_ message to lower layers for transmission
via SRB4.
### 5.6.20 IDLE Mode Measurements
#### 5.6.20.1 General
This procedure specifies the measurements done by a UE in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE when it has an IDLE mode measurement configuration and the
storage of the available measurements by a UE in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and
RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.6.20.2 Initiation
While T331 is running, the UE shall:
1> perform the measurements in accordance with the following:
2> for each entry in _measIdleCarrierListEUTRA_ within _VarMeasIdleConfig_ :
3> if UE supports carrier aggregation between serving carrier and the carrier
frequency and bandwidth indicated by _carrierFreq_ and _allowedMeasBandwidth_
within the corresponding entry;
4> perform measurements in the carrier frequency and bandwidth indicated by
_carrierFreq_ and _allowedMeasBandwidth_ within the corresponding entry;
NOTE 1: The fields _s-NonIntraSearch_ in _SystemInformationBlockType3_ do not
affect the UE measurement procedures in IDLE mode. How the UE performs
measurements in IDLE mode is up to UE implementation as long as the
requirements in TS 36.133 [16] are met for measurement reporting. UE is not
required to perform idle measurements if the SIB2 does not contain
_idleModeMeasurements_.
4> if the _measCellList_ is included:
5> consider the serving cell and cells identified by each entry within the
_measCellList_ to be applicable for idle mode measurement reporting;
4> else:
5> consider the serving cell and up to _maxCellMeasIdle_ strongest identified
cells whose RSRP/RSRQ measurement results are above the value(s) provided in
_qualityThreshold_ (if any) to be applicable for idle mode measurement
reporting;
4> store measurement results for cells applicable for idle mode measurement
reporting within the _VarMeasIdleReport_ ;
NOTE 2: How the UE prioritizes which frequencies to measure or report (in case
it is configured with more frequencies than it can measure or report) is left
to UE implementation.
3> else:
4> do not consider the carrier frequency to be applicable for idle mode
measurement reporting;
1> if _validityArea_ is configured in _VarMeasIdleConfig_ and UE reselects to
a serving cell whose physical cell identity does not match any entry in
_validityArea_ for the corresponding carrier frequency:
2> stop T331;
#### 5.6.20.3 T331 expiry or stop
The UE shall:
1> if T331 expires or is stopped:
2> release the _VarMeasIdleConfig_ ;
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation whether to continue IDLE mode measurements
according to SIB5 configuration after T331 has expired or stopped.
### 5.6.21 Failure information
#### 5.6.21.1 General
Figure 5.6.21.1-1: Failure information
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN about a failure that the UE
has experienced.
#### 5.6.21.2 Initiation
A UE initiates the procedure to report failures when one of the following
conditions is met:
1> upon detecting RLC failure, in accordance with 5.3.11.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> initiate transmission of the _FailureInformation_ message in accordance
with 5.6.21.3;
#### 5.6.21.3 Actions related to transmission of _FailureInformation_ message
When initiating the procedure according to 5.6.21.2, the UE shall set the
contents of the _FailureInformation_ message as follows:
1> if the procedure is initiated to report RLC failure:
2> set _logicalChannelIdentity_ to the logical channel identity of the RLC
entity;
2> set _cellGroupIndication_ to the cell group where the RLC entity is
located;
2> set _failureType_ to the type of failure that has been detected;
The UE shall submit the _FailureInformation_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
## 5.7 Generic error handling
### 5.7.1 General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent clauses applies unless
explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error
handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
\- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer
syntax supported by the UE.
\- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved
value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
\- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour
that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved field.
### 5.7.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1> when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH, CCCH, MCCH, SC-
MCCH or SBCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid, as specified in ITU-T
X.680 (07/2002) [13]:
2> ignore the message;
NOTE: This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other
than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the
transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined
as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably
detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message
level.
### 5.7.3 Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not
comprehend:
2> if a default value is defined for this field:
3> treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2> else if the concerned field is optional:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the
need code for absence of the concerned field;
2> else:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with clause
5.7.4;
### 5.7.4 Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message
(e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field
is absent or treated as absent:
2> if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:
3> ignore the message;
2> else:
3> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE
OF):
4> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended
field was not present;
3> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the
\'parent\' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the
erroneous field:
4> consider the \'parent\' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent \'parent\' field(s),
until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3> else (field at message level):
4> ignore the message;
NOTE 1: The error handling defined in these clauses implies that the UE
ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended
value.
NOTE 2: The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels
other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for
errors that can be regarded as invalid E-UTRAN operation e.g. E-UTRAN not
observing conditional presence.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested
error handling for errors in extension fields.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
\-- Example with extension addition group
ItemInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OF ItemInfo
ItemInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
...
[[ field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL -- Need ON
]]
}
\-- Example with traditional non-critical extension (empty sequence)
BroadcastInfoBlock1 ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::= SEQUENCE {
field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL -- Need OP
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable
in case of nested error handling:
\- an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in
the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of
_field3_ would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than
just the extension addition group containing _field3_ and _field4_)
\- a traditional _nonCriticalExtension_ is not regarded as a level on its own.
E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the
conditionality of _field3_ would result in the entire _BroadcastInfoBlock1_ to
be ignored (rather than just the non critical extension containing _field3_
and _field4_).
### 5.7.5 Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent;
NOTE: This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value
range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in
clause 5.7.3.
## 5.8 MBMS
### 5.8.1 Introduction
#### 5.8.1.1 General
In general the control information relevant only for UEs supporting MBMS is
separated as much as possible from unicast control information. Most of the
MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for MBMS
common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel
per MBSFN area. In case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE
acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs that are configured to
identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action
applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast
services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the specification, an
MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service
at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more
than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE implementation. The MCCH
carries the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message, which indicates the MBMS
sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource
configuration. The MCCH may also carry the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message, when
E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are receiving
or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services.
A limited amount of MBMS control information is provided on the BCCH. This
primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the MCCH(s). This
information is carried by means of a single MBMS specific
_SystemInformationBlock_ : _SystemInformationBlockType13_. An MBSFN area is
identified solely by the _mbsfn-AreaId_ in _SystemInformationBlockType13_. At
mobility, the UE considers that the MBSFN area is continuous when the source
cell and the target cell broadcast the same value in the _mbsfn-AreaId_.
#### 5.8.1.2 Scheduling
The MCCH information is transmitted periodically, using a configurable
repetition period. Scheduling information is not provided for MCCH i.e. both
the time domain scheduling as well as the lower layer configuration are semi-
statically configured, as defined within _SystemInformationBlockType13_.
For MBMS user data, which is carried by the MTCH logical channel, E-UTRAN
periodically provides MCH scheduling information (MSI) at lower layers (MAC).
This MCH information only concerns the time domain scheduling i.e. the
frequency domain scheduling and the lower layer configuration are semi-
statically configured. The periodicity of the MSI is configurable and defined
by the MCH scheduling period.
#### 5.8.1.3 MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the
concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the
same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its
scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period
boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod _m_ = 0, where _m_ is
the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The
modification period is configured by means of _SystemInformationBlockType13_.
When the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs
about the change during a first modification period. In the next modification
period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These general
principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours
indicate different MCCH information. Upon receiving a change notification, a
UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information
immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the
previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH
information.
Figure 5.8.1.3-1: Change of MCCH Information
Indication of an MBMS specific RNTI, the M-RNTI (see TS 36.321 [6]), on PDCCH
is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about an MCCH
information change. When receiving an MCCH information change notification,
the UE knows that the MCCH information will change at the next modification
period boundary. The notification on PDCCH indicates which of the MCCHs will
change, which is done by means of an 8-bit bitmap. Within this bitmap, the bit
at the position indicated by the field _notificationIndicator_ is used to
indicate changes for that MBSFN area: if the bit is set to \"1\", the
corresponding MCCH will change. No further details are provided e.g. regarding
which MCCH information will change. The MCCH information change notification
is used to inform the UE about a change of MCCH information upon session start
or about the start of MBMS counting.
The MCCH information change notifications on PDCCH are transmitted
periodically and are carried on MBSFN subframes only except on MBMS-dedicated
cell or FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell where the MCCH information change is
provided on non-MBSFN subframes. These MCCH information change notification
occasions are common for all MCCHs that are configured, and configurable by
parameters included in _SystemInformationBlockType13:_ a repetition
coefficient, a radio frame offset and a subframe index. These common
notification occasions are based on the MCCH with the shortest modification
period.
NOTE 1: E-UTRAN may modify the MBMS configuration information provided on MCCH
at the same time as updating the MBMS configuration information carried on
BCCH i.e. at a coinciding BCCH and MCCH modification period. Upon detecting
that a new MCCH is configured on BCCH, a UE interested to receive one or more
MBMS services should acquire the MCCH, unless it knows that the services it is
interested in are not provided by the corresponding MBSFN area.
A UE that is receiving an MBMS service via MRB shall acquire the MCCH
information from the start of each modification period. A UE interested to
receive MBMS from a carrier on which _dl-Bandwidth_ included in
_MasterInformationBlock_ is set to _n6_ shall acquire the MCCH information at
least once every MCCH modification period. A UE that is not receiving an MBMS
service via MRB, as well as UEs that are receiving an MBMS service via MRB but
potentially interested to receive other services not started yet in another
MBSFN area from a carrier on which _dl-Bandwidth_ included in
_MasterInformationBlock_ is other than n6, shall verify that the stored MCCH
information remains valid by attempting to find the MCCH information change
notification at least _notificationRepetitionCoeff_ times during the
modification period of the applicable MCCH(s), if no MCCH information change
notification is received.
NOTE 2: In case the UE is aware which MCCH(s) E-UTRAN uses for the service(s)
it is interested to receive, the UE may only need to monitor change
notifications for a subset of the MCCHs that are configured, referred to as
the \'applicable MCCH(s)\' in the above.
### 5.8.2 MCCH information acquisition
#### 5.8.2.1 General
Figure 5.8.2.1-1: MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBMS
control information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies
to MBMS capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.8.2.2 Initiation
A UE interested to receive MBMS services shall apply the MCCH information
acquisition procedure upon entering the corresponding MBSFN area (e.g. upon
power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification that the
MCCH information has changed. A UE that is receiving an MBMS service shall
apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MCCH, that
corresponds with the service that is being received, at the start of each
modification period.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH
information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e.
delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE
discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information unless
explicitly specified otherwise.
#### 5.8.2.3 MCCH information acquisition by the UE
An MBMS capable UE shall:
1> if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification:
2> start acquiring the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message and the
_MBMSCountingRequest_ message if present, from the beginning of the
modification period following the one in which the change notification was
received;
NOTE 1: The UE continues using the previously received MCCH information until
the new MCCH information has been acquired.
1> if the UE enters an MBSFN area:
2> acquire the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message and the _MBMSCountingRequest_
message if present, at the next repetition period;
1> if the UE is receiving an MBMS service:
2> start acquiring the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message and the
_MBMSCountingRequest_ message if present, that both concern the MBSFN area of
the service that is being received, from the beginning of each modification
period;
#### 5.8.2.4 Actions upon reception of the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message
No UE requirements related to the contents of this _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_
apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the
concerned system information, the corresponding field descriptions.
#### 5.8.2.5 Actions upon reception of the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message
Upon receiving _MBMSCountingRequest_ message, the UE shall perform the MBMS
Counting procedure as specified in 5.8.4.
### 5.8.3 MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration
#### 5.8.3.1 General
The MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to
configure RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to
receive an MRB. The procedure applies to UEs interested to receive one or more
MBMS services.
NOTE: In case the UE is unable to receive an MBMS service due to capability
limitations, upper layers may take appropriate action e.g. terminate a lower
priority unicast service.
#### 5.8.3.2 Initiation
The UE applies the MRB establishment procedure to start receiving a session of
a service it has an interest in. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon
start of the MBMS session, upon (re-)entry of the corresponding MBSFN service
area, upon becoming interested in the MBMS service, upon removal of UE
capability limitations inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
The UE applies the MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session. The
procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBMS session, upon leaving
the corresponding MBSFN service area, upon losing interest in the MBMS
service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the
concerned service.
#### 5.8.3.3 MRB establishment
Upon MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the configuration specified in
9.1.1.4;
1> configure an MTCH logical channel in accordance with the received
_locgicalChannelIdentity_ , applicable for the MRB, as included in the
_MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message;
1> configure the physical layer in accordance with the _pmch-Config_ ,
applicable for the MRB, as included in the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message;
1> inform upper layers about the establishment of the MRB by indicating the
corresponding _tmgi_ and _sessionId_ ;
#### 5.8.3.4 MRB release
Upon MRB release, the UE shall:
1> release the RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer
configuration;
1> inform upper layers about the release of the MRB by indicating the
corresponding _tmgi_ and _sessionId_ ;
### 5.8.4 MBMS Counting Procedure
#### 5.8.4.1 General
Figure 5.8.4.1-1: MBMS Counting procedure
The MBMS Counting procedure is used by the E-UTRAN to count the number of
RRC_CONNECTED mode UEs which are receiving via an MRB or interested to receive
via an MRB the specified MBMS services.
The UE determines interest in an MBMS service, that is identified by the TMGI,
by interaction with upper layers.
#### 5.8.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending an _MBMSCountingRequest_ message.
#### 5.8.4.3 Reception of the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message, the UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode
shall:
1> if the _SystemInformationBlockType1,_ that provided the scheduling
information for the _systemInformationBlockType13_ that included the
configuration of the MCCH via which the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message was
received, contained the identity of the Registered PLMN; and
1> if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB at
least one of the services in the received _countingRequestList:_
2> if more than one entry is included in the _mbsfn-AreaInfoList_ received in
the _SystemInformationBlockType13_ that included the configuration of the MCCH
via which the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message was received _:_
3> include the _mbsfn-AreaIndex_ in the _MBMSCountingResponse_ message and set
it to the index of the entry in the _mbsfn-AreaInfoList_ within the received
_SystemInformationBlockType13_ that corresponds with the MBSFN area used to
transfer the received _MBMSCountingRequest_ message;
2> for each MBMS service included in the received _countingRequestList_ :
3> if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB this
MBMS service:
4> include an entry in the _countingResponseList_ within the
_MBMSCountingResponse_ message with _countingResponseService_ set it to the
index of the entry in the _countingRequestList_ within the received
_MBMSCountingRequest_ that corresponds with the MBMS service the UE is
receiving or interested to receive;
2> submit the _MBMSCountingResponse_ message to lower layers for transmission
upon which the procedure ends;
NOTE 1: UEs that are receiving an MBMS User Service, as specified in TS 23.246
[56], by means of a Unicast Bearer Service, as specified in TS 26.346 [57],
(i.e. via a DRB), but are interested to receive the concerned MBMS User
Service, as specified in TS 23.246 [56], via an MBMS Bearer Service (i.e. via
an MRB), respond to the counting request.
NOTE 2: If ciphering is used at upper layers, the UE does not respond to the
counting request if it can not decipher the MBMS service for which counting is
performed (see TS 22.146 [62], clause 5.3).
NOTE 3: The UE treats the _MBMSCountingRequest_ messages received in each
modification period independently. In the unlikely case E-UTRAN would repeat
an _MBMSCountingRequest_ (i.e. including the same services) in a subsequent
modification period, the UE responds again. The UE provides at most one
_MBMSCountingResponse_ message to multiple transmission attempts of an
_MBMSCountingRequest_ messages in a given modification period.
### 5.8.5 MBMS interest indication
#### 5.8.5.1 General
Figure 5.8.5.1-1: MBMS interest indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN that the UE is receiving or
is interested to receive MBMS service(s) via an MRB or SC-MRB, and if so, to
inform E-UTRAN about the priority of MBMS versus unicast reception or MBMS
service(s) reception in receive only mode.
#### 5.8.5.2 Initiation
An MBMS or SC-PTM capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in
several cases including upon successful connection establishment, upon
entering or leaving the service area, upon session start or stop, upon change
of interest, upon change of priority between MBMS reception and unicast
reception, upon change to a PCell broadcasting _SystemInformationBlockType15_
, upon starting and stopping of MBMS service(s) in receive only mode, upon
change of receive only mode frequency, bandwidth or subcarrier spacing of MBMS
service(s) in receive only mode.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if _SystemInformationBlockType15_ is broadcast by the PCell; or
1> if _mbms-ROM-ServiceIndication_ is received in
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ from PCell:
2> ensure having a valid version of _SystemInformationBlockType15_ for the
PCell, if present;
2> if the UE did not transmit an _MBMSInterestIndication_ message since last
entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
2> if since the last time the UE transmitted an _MBMSInterestIndication_
message, the UE connected to a PCell neither broadcasting
_SystemInformationBlockType15_ nor including _mbms-ROM-ServiceIndication_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ :
3> if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3, is not empty:
4> initiate transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.8.5.4;
2> else:
3> if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3, has changed since the last transmission of the
_MBMSInterestIndication_ message; or
3> if at least one of the subcarrier spacing or bandwidth parameter of receive
only mode MBMS frequency of interest, determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3,
has changed since the last transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_
message; or
3> if the prioritisation of reception of all indicated MBMS frequencies
compared to reception of any of the established unicast bearers has changed
since the last transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message:
4> initiate transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.8.5.4;
NOTE: The UE may send an _MBMSInterestIndication_ even when it is able to
receive the MBMS services it is interested in i.e. to avoid that the network
allocates a configuration inhibiting MBMS reception.
3> else if _SystemInformationBlockType20_ is broadcast by the PCell:
4> if since the last time the UE transmitted an _MBMSInterestIndication_
message, the UE connected to a PCell not broadcasting
_SystemInformationBlockType20_ ; or
4> if the set of MBMS services of interest determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3a is different from _mbms-Services_ included in the last transmission
of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message;
5> initiate the transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message in
accordance with 5.8.5.4.
#### 5.8.5.3 Determine MBMS frequencies of interest
The UE shall:
1> consider a frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest if the
following conditions are met:
2> at least one MBMS session the UE is receiving or interested to receive via
an MRB or SC-MRB is ongoing or about to start; and
NOTE 1: The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and
stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 36.300 [9]
or TS 26.346 [57].
2> for at least one of these MBMS sessions either
_SystemInformationBlockType15_ acquired from the PCell includes for the
concerned frequency one or more MBMS SAIs as indicated in the USD for this
session or this session is in receive only mode; and
NOTE 2: The UE considers a frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of
interest even though E-UTRAN may (temporarily) not employ an MRB or SC-MRB for
the concerned session. I.e. the UE does not verify if the session is indicated
on (SC-)MCCH
NOTE 3: The UE considers the frequencies of interest independently of any
synchronization state, e.g. TS 36.300 [9], Annex J.1.
2> the UE is capable of simultaneously receiving MRBs and/or is capable of
simultaneously receiving SC-MRBs on the set of MBMS frequencies of interest,
regardless of whether a serving cell is configured on each of these
frequencies or not; and
2> the _supportedBandCombination_ the UE included in _UE-EUTRA-Capability_
contains at least one band combination including the set of MBMS frequencies
of interest;
NOTE 4: Indicating a frequency implies that the UE supports
_SystemInformationBlockType13_ or _SystemInformationBlockType20_ acquisition
for the concerned frequency i.e. the indication should be independent of
whether a serving cell is configured on that frequency.
NOTE 5: When evaluating which frequencies it can receive simultaneously, the
UE does not take into account the serving frequencies that are currently
configured i.e. it only considers MBMS frequencies it is interested to
receive.
NOTE 6: The set of MBMS frequencies of interest includes at most one frequency
for a given physical frequency. The UE only considers a physical frequency to
be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest if it supports at least one of the
bands indicated for this physical frequency in _SystemInformationBlockType1_
(for serving frequency) or _SystemInformationBlockType15_ (for neighbouring
frequencies). In this case, E-UTRAN may assume the UE supports MBMS reception
on any of the bands supported by the UE (i.e. according to
_supportedBandCombination_).
#### 5.8.5.3a Determine MBMS services of interest
The UE shall:
1> consider a MBMS service to be part of the MBMS services of interest if the
following conditions are met:
2> the UE is SC-PTM capable; and
2> the UE is receiving or interested to receive this service via an SC-MRB;
and
2> one session of this service is ongoing or about to start; and
2> one or more MBMS SAIs in the USD for this service is included in
_SystemInformationBlockType15_ acquired from the PCell for a frequency
belonging to the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined according to
5.8.5.3.
#### 5.8.5.4 Actions related to transmission of _MBMSInterestIndication_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message as
follows:
1> if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3, is not empty:
2> include _mbms-FreqList_ and set it to include the MBMS frequencies of
interest sorted by decreasing order of interest, using the EARFCN
corresponding with _freqBandIndicator_ included in
_SystemInformationBlockType1 (for serving frequency)_ , if applicable, and the
EARFCN(s) as included in _SystemInformationBlockType15 (for neighbouring
frequencies)_ ;
NOTE 1: The EARFCN included in _mbms-FreqList_ is merely used to indicate a
physical frequency the UE is interested to receive i.e. the UE may not support
the band corresponding to the included EARFCN (but it does support at least
one of the bands indicated in system information for the concerned physical
frequency).
2> include _mbms-Priority_ if the UE prioritises reception of all indicated
MBMS frequencies above reception of any of the unicast bearers;
2> if _SystemInformationBlockType20_ is broadcast by the PCell:
3> include _mbms-Services_ and set it to indicate the set of MBMS services of
interest determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3a;
NOTE 2: If the UE prioritises MBMS reception and unicast data cannot be
supported because of congestion on the MBMS carrier(s), E-UTRAN may initiate
release of unicast bearers. It is up to E-UTRAN implementation whether all
bearers or only GBR bearers are released. E-UTRAN does not initiate re-
establishment of the released unicast bearers upon alleviation of the
congestion.
1> if the UE is receiving MBMS service(s) in receive only mode:
2> if the _supportedBandCombination_ the UE included in _UE-EUTRA-Capability_
contains at least one band combination including the _mbms-ROM-Freq_ :
3> include _mbms-ROM-Freq_ , _mbms-ROM-SubcarrierSpacing_ and _mbms-Bandwidth_
;
NOTE 3: The EARFCN included in _mbms-ROM-Freq_ is used to indicate a physical
frequency the UE is interested to receive MBMS service(s) in receive only mode
and is determined based on UE implementation.
The UE shall submit the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
## 5.8a SC-PTM
### 5.8a.1 Introduction
#### 5.8a.1.1 General
SC-PTM control information is provided on a specific logical channel: the SC-
MCCH. The SC-MCCH carries the _SCPTMConfiguration_ message which indicates the
MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) information on
when each session may be scheduled, i.e. scheduling period, scheduling window
and start offset. The _SCPTMConfiguration_ message also provides information
about the neighbour cells transmitting the MBMS sessions which are ongoing on
the current cell. In this release of the specification, an SC-PTM capable UE
is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and
reception of more than one MBMS service in parallel is left for UE
implementation.
A limited amount of SC-PTM control information is provided on the BCCH or BR-
BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the SC-MCCH.
NOTE: For BL UEs and UEs in CE, SC-MCCH transmission uses a 1.4 MHz channel
bandwidth and a maximum TBS of 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT UEs,
the maximum TBS for SC-MCCH transmission is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].
#### 5.8a.1.2 SC-MCCH scheduling
The SC-MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over
SC-MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period.
SC-MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are
indicated on PDCCH.
#### 5.8a.1.3 SC-MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of SC-MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the
concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the
same SC-MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by
its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification
period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod _m_ = 0, where
_m_ is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The
modification period is configured by means of _SystemInformationBlockType20_
(_SystemInformationBlockType20-NB_ in NB-IoT). If H-SFN is provided in
_SystemInformationBlockType1-BR_ , modification period boundaries for BL UEs
or UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod _m_
=0. The modification period boundaries for NB-IoT UEs are defined by SFN
values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod _m_ =0.
When the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information, it notifies the
UEs, other than BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, about the change in the first
subframe which can be used for SC-MCCH transmission in a repetition period.
LSB bit in 8-bit bitmap when set to \'1\' indicates the change in SC-MCCH.
Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services
transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH information starting from
the same subframe. The UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information
until the UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.
When the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information for start of new
MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, it notifies BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-
IoT UEs about the change in every PDCCH which schedules the first SC-MCCH in a
repetition period in the current modification period. The notification is
transmitted with 1 bit. The bit, when set to \'1\', indicates the start of new
MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22], clauses 5.3.3.1.14 and 6.4.3.3. Upon
receiving a change notification, a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE interested to
receive MBMS services transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH
information scheduled by the PDCCH. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE applies
the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the BL UE, UE in CE or NB-
IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.
When the network changes SC-MTCH specific information e.g. start of new MBMS
service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM or change of ongoing MBMS service(s)
transmitted using SC-PTM, it notifies the BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in
the PDCCH which schedules the SC-MTCH in the current modification period. The
notification is transmitted with a 2 bit bitmap. The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap,
when set to \'1\', indicates the change of the on-going MBMS service and the
MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to \'1\', indicates the start of new MBMS
service(s), see TS 36.212 [22], clauses 5.3.3.1.12, 5.3.3.1.13 and 6.4.3.2. In
the case the network changes an on-going SC-MTCH transmission in the next
modification period, it notifies the BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in the
PDCCH which schedules this SC-MTCH in the current modification period. In the
case the network starts new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, the
network notifies the UEs which have on-going SC-MTCH in the PDCCH scheduling
each of the SC-MTCH. Upon receiving such notification, a BL UE, UE in CE or
NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information at the start of the next
modification period. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE applies the previously
acquired SC-MCCH information until the BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires
the new SC-MCCH information.
#### 5.8a.1.4 Procedures
The SC-PTM capable UE receiving or interested to receive MBMS service(s) via
SC-MRB applies SC-PTM procedures described in 5.8a and, except for NB-IoT UE,
the MBMS interest indication procedure as specified in 5.8.5.
### 5.8a.2 SC-MCCH information acquisition
#### 5.8a.2.1 General
Figure 5.8a.2.1-1: SC-MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the
SC-PTM control information that is broadcast by the E-UTRAN. The procedure
applies to SC-PTM capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE except for BL UEs, UEs in
CE and NB-IoT UEs, performing EDT procedure. This procedure also applies to
SC-PTM capable UEs that are in RRC_CONNECTED except for BL UEs, UEs in CE or
NB-IoT UEs.
#### 5.8a.2.2 Initiation
A UE interested to receive MBMS services via SC-MRB shall apply the SC-MCCH
information acquisition procedure upon entering the cell broadcasting
_SystemInformationBlockType20_ (_SystemInformationBlockType20-NB_ in NB-IoT)
(e.g. upon power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification
that the SC-MCCH information has changed. A UE, except for BL UE, UE in CE or
NB-IoT UE, that is receiving an MBMS service via SC-MRB shall apply the SC-
MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the SC-MCCH information that
corresponds with the service that is being received, at the start of each
modification period. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE that is receiving an
MBMS service via SC-MRB shall apply the SC-MCCH information acquisition
procedure upon receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information that
corresponds with the service that is being received is about to be changed.
The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE that is receiving an MBMS service via SC-MRB
may apply the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure upon receiving a
notification that the SC-MCCH information is about to be changed due to start
of a new service.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the SC-
MCCH information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored SC-MCCH
information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for SC-MCCH
information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in SC-MCCH
information unless explicitly specified otherwise.
#### 5.8a.2.3 SC-MCCH information acquisition by the UE
A SC-PTM capable UE shall:
1> if the procedure is triggered by an SC-MCCH information change notification
and the UE has no ongoing MBMS service:
2> except for a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, start acquiring the
_SCPTMConfiguration_ message from the subframe in which the change
notification was received;
2> for a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, acquire the _SCPTMConfiguration_
message scheduled by the PDCCH in which the change notification was received;
NOTE 1: The UE continues using the previously received SC-MCCH information
until the new SC-MCCH information has been acquired.
1> if the UE enters a cell broadcasting _SystemInformationBlockType20_
(_SystemInformationBlockType20-NB_ in NB-IoT):
2> acquire the _SCPTMConfiguration_ message at the next repetition period;
1> if the UE is receiving an MBMS service via an SC-MRB:
2> except for BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, start acquiring the
_SCPTMConfiguration_ message from the beginning of each modification period;
2> a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE shall start acquiring the
_SCPTMConfiguration_ message at the start of the next modification period upon
receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information that corresponds with
the service that is being received is about to be changed;
2> a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE may start acquiring the _SCPTMConfiguration_
message at the start of the next modification period upon receiving a
notification that the SC-MCCH information is about to be changed due to start
of a new service;
#### 5.8a.2.4 Actions upon reception of the _SCPTMConfiguration_ message
No UE requirements related to the contents of this _SCPTMConfiguration_ apply
other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the
concerned system information, the corresponding field descriptions.
### 5.8a.3 SC-PTM radio bearer configuration
#### 5.8a.3.1 General
The SC-PTM radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure
RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive an
SC-MRB transmitted on SC-MTCH. The procedure applies to SC-PTM capable UEs
that are in RRC_IDLE and to SC-PTM capable UEs that are not BL UEs, UEs in CE
or NB-IoT UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, and are interested to receive one or more MBMS
services via SC-MRB.
NOTE: In case the UE is unable to receive an MBMS service via an SC-MRB due to
capability limitations, upper layers may take appropriate action e.g.
terminate a lower priority unicast service.
#### 5.8a.3.2 Initiation
The UE applies the SC-MRB establishment procedure to start receiving a session
of a MBMS service it has an interest in. The procedure may be initiated e.g.
upon start of the MBMS session, upon entering a cell providing via SC-MRB a
MBMS service in which the UE has interest, upon becoming interested in the
MBMS service, upon removal of UE capability limitations inhibiting reception
of the concerned service.
The UE applies the SC-MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session. The
procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBMS session, upon leaving
the cell where a SC-MRB is established, upon losing interest in the MBMS
service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the
concerned service.
#### 5.8a.3.3 SC-MRB establishment
Upon SC-MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the configuration specified in
9.1.1.7;
1> configure a SC-MTCH logical channel applicable for the SC-MRB and instruct
MAC to receive DL-SCH on the cell where the _SCPTMConfiguration_ message was
received for the MBMS service for which the SC-MRB is established and using
_g-RNTI_ and _sc-mtch-SchedulingInfo_ (if included) in this message for this
MBMS service;
1> configure the physical layer in accordance with the _sc-mtch-InfoList_ ,
applicable for the SC-MRB, as included in the _SCPTMConfiguration_ message;
1> inform upper layers about the establishment of the SC-MRB by indicating the
corresponding _tmgi_ and _sessionId_ ;
#### 5.8a.3.4 SC-MRB release
Upon SC-MRB release, the UE shall:
1> release the RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer
configuration;
1> inform upper layers about the release of the SC-MRB by indicating the
corresponding _tmgi_ and _sessionId_ ;

## 5.10 Sidelink
### 5.10.1 Introduction
The sidelink communication and associated synchronisation resource
configuration applies for the frequency at which it was received/ acquired.
Moreover, for a UE configured with one or more SCells, the sidelink
communication and associated synchronisation resource configuration provided
by dedicated signalling applies for the PCell/ the primary frequency. The
sidelink discovery and associated synchronisation resource configuration
applies for the frequency at which it was received/ acquired or the indicated
frequency in the configuration. For a UE configured with one or more SCells,
the sidelink discovery and associated synchronisation resource configuration
provided by dedicated signalling applies for the PCell/ the primary frequency
/ any other indicated frequency.
NOTE 1: Upper layers configure the UE to receive or transmit sidelink
communication on a specific frequency, to monitor or transmit non-PS related
sidelink discovery announcements on one or more frequencies or to monitor or
transmit PS related sidelink discovery announcements on a specific frequency,
but only if the UE is authorised to perform these particular ProSe related
sidelink activities.
NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation which actions to take (e.g. termination
of unicast services, detach) when it is unable to perform the desired sidelink
activities, e.g. due to UE capability limitations.
Sidelink communication consists of one-to-many and one-to-one sidelink
communication. One-to-many sidelink communication consists of relay related
and non-relay related one-to-many sidelink communication. One-to-one sidelink
communication consists of relay related and non-relay related one-to-one
sidelink communication. In relay related one-to-one sidelink communication the
communicating parties consist of one sidelink relay UE and one sidelink remote
UE.
Sidelink discovery consists of public safety related (PS related) and non-PS
related sidelink discovery. PS related sidelink discovery consists of relay
related and non-relay related PS related sidelink discovery. Upper layers
indicate to RRC whether a particular sidelink announcement is PS related or
non-PS related.
Upper layers indicate to RRC whether a particular sidelink procedure is V2X
related or not.
The specification covers the use of UE to network sidelink relays by
specifying the additional requirements that apply for a sidelink relay UE and
a sidelink remote UE. I.e. for such UEs the regular sidelink UE requirements
equally apply unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### 5.10.2 Sidelink UE information
#### 5.10.2.1 General
Figure 5.10.2-1: Sidelink UE information
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN that the UE is interested
or no longer interested to receive sidelink communication or discovery, to
receive V2X sidelink communication, as well as to request assignment or
release of transmission resources for sidelink communication or discovery
announcements or V2X sidelink communication or sidelink discovery gaps, to
report parameters related to sidelink discovery from system information of
inter-frequency/PLMN cells and to report the synchronization reference used by
the UE for V2X sidelink communication.
#### 5.10.2.2 Initiation
A UE capable of sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication or
sidelink discovery that is in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure to
indicate it is (interested in) receiving sidelink communication or V2X
sidelink communication or sidelink discovery in several cases including upon
successful connection establishment, upon change of interest, upon change to a
PCell broadcasting _SystemInformationBlockType18_ or
_SystemInformationBlockType19_ or _SystemInformationBlockType21_ including
_sl-V2X-ConfigCommon_. A UE capable of sidelink communication or V2X sidelink
communication or sidelink discovery may initiate the procedure to request
assignment of dedicated resources for the concerned sidelink communication
transmission or discovery announcements or V2X sidelink communication
transmission or to request sidelink discovery gaps for sidelink discovery
transmission or sidelink discovery reception and a UE capable of inter-
frequency/PLMN sidelink discovery parameter reporting may initiate the
procedure to report parameters related to sidelink discovery from system
information of inter-frequency/PLMN cells.

### 5.10.7 Sidelink synchronisation information transmission
#### 5.10.7.1 General
Figure 5.10.7.1-1: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink
communication or V2X sidelink communication, in (partial) coverage
Figure 5.10.7.1-2: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink
communication or V2X sidelink communication / sidelink discovery, out of
coverage
Figure 5.10.7.1-3: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink
discovery, in (partial) coverage
The purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a
UE. For sidelink discovery, the synchronisation information concerns a
Sidelink Synchronisation Signal (SLSS) and, in case of PS related discovery,
also timing information and some additional configuration parameters (i.e. the
_MasterInformationBlock-SL_ message), while for sidelink communication or V2X
sidelink communication it concerns an SLSS and the _MasterInformationBlock-SL_
or _MasterInformationBlock-SL-V2X_ message. A UE transmits synchronisation
information either when E-UTRAN configures it to do so by dedicated signalling
(i.e. network based), or when not configured by dedicated signalling (i.e. UE
based) and E-UTRAN broadcasts (in coverage) or pre-configures a threshold (out
of coverage).
The synchronisation information transmitted by the UE may be derived from
information/ signals received from E-UTRAN (in coverage) or received from a UE
acting as synchronisation reference for the transmitting UE or received from
GNSS. In the remainder, the UE acting as synchronisation reference is referred
to as SyncRef UE.
#### 5.10.7.2 Initiation

_syncTxPeriodic_ is not included:

### 5.10.9 Sidelink common control information
#### 5.10.9.1 General
The sidelink common control information is carried by a single message, the
_MasterInformationBlock-SL_ (MIB-SL) message for sidelink discovery and
sidelink communication or the _MasterInformationBlock-SL-V2X_ (MIB-SL-V2X)
message for V2X sidelink communication. The MIB-SL or MIB-SL-V2X includes
timing information as well as some configuration parameters and is transmitted
via SL-BCH.
The MIB-SL for sidelink discovery and sidelink communication uses a fixed
schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms without repetitions. In particular, the
MIB-SL is scheduled in subframes indicated by _syncOffsetIndicator-r12_ i.e.
for which (10*DFN + subframe number) mod 40 = _syncOffsetIndicator-r12_.
The MIB-SL-V2X for V2X sidelink communication uses a fixed schedule with a
periodicity of 160 ms without repetitions. In particular, the MIB-SL-V2X is
scheduled in subframes indicated by _SL-OffsetIndicatorSync_ i.e. for which
(10*DFN + subframe number) mod 160 = _SL-OffsetIndicatorSync_.
The sidelink common control information may change at any transmission i.e.
neither a modification period nor a change notification mechanism is used.
A UE configured to receive or transmit sidelink communication or PS related
sidelink discovery shall:
1> if the UE has a selected SyncRef UE, as specified in 5.10.8.2:
2> ensure having a valid version of the _MasterInformationBlock-SL_ message of
that SyncRefUE;

#### 5.10.13.2 V2X sidelink communication transmission pool selection
For a frequency used for V2X sidelink communication, if **_zoneConfig_ is**
not ignored as specified in 5.10.13.1, the UE configured by upper layers for
V2X sidelink communication shall only use the pool which corresponds to
geographical coordinates of the UE, if **_zoneConfig_ is included in**

frequency; or if **_zoneConfig_ is included** in _SL-V2X-Preconfiguration_ for
the concerned frequency, and the UE is configured to use resource pools in
_SL-V2X-Preconfiguration_ for the frequency, according to 5.10.13.1. The UE
shall only use the pool which is associated with the synchronization reference

1> if **the UE is configured to transmit on** _p2x-CommTxPoolNormalCommon_
**or on** _p2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType21_ or on _p2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in

1> if **_zoneConfig_ is included in** _SystemInformationBlockType21_ **and the
UE is configured to transmit on** _v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated_ for P2X
related V2X sidelink communication and _zoneID_ is not included in
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated_ ; or
1> if **_zoneConfig_ is not included** in the entry of _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_
**for the concerned frequency and the UE is configured to transmit on**
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_ or _p2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in

_v2x-CommTxPoolList_ in _SL-V2X-Preconfiguration_ for the concerned frequency:
2> select a pool associated with the synchronization reference source selected
in accordance with 5.10.8.2;
NOTE 0: If multiple pools are associated with the selected synchronization
reference source, it is up to UE implementation which resource pool is
selected for V2X sidelink communication transmission.
1> if **_zoneConfig_ is included in** _SystemInformationBlockType21_ **and the
UE is configured to transmit on** _v2x-CommTxPoolNormalCommon_ **or**
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated_ for non-P2X related V2X sidelink

UE is configured to transmit on** _v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated_ for P2X
related V2X sidelink communication and _zoneID_ is included in
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated_ ; or
1> if **_zoneConfig_ is included** in the entry of _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_
**for the concerned frequency and if the UE is configured to transmit on**
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_ or is configured to transmit
on _p2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_ in
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ and _zoneID_ is included in

2> select the pool configured with _zoneID_ equal to the zone identity
determined below and associated with the synchronization reference source
selected in accordance with 5.10.8.2;
The UE shall determine an identity of the zone (i.e. Zone_id) in which it is
located using the following formulae, if _zoneConfig_ is included in
_SystemInformationBlockType21_ or _SystemInformationBlockType26_ or in
_SL-V2X-Preconfiguration_ :
_x_ ~1~= FLOOR (_x_ / _L_) Mod _Nx_ ;
_y_ ~1~= FLOOR (_y_ / _W_) Mod _Ny_ ;
Zone_id = _y_ ~1~ * _Nx_ \+ _x_ ~1~.
The parameters in the formulae are defined as follows:
> **_L_** is the value of _zoneLength_ included in _zoneConfig_ in
> _SystemInformationBlockType21_ or _SystemInformationBlockType26_ or in
> _SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;_
>
> **_W_** is the value of _zoneWidth_ included in _zoneConfig_ in
> _SystemInformationBlockType21_ or _SystemInformationBlockType26_ or in
> _SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;_
>
> **_Nx_** is the value of _zoneIdLongiMod_ included in _zoneConfig_ in
> _SystemInformationBlockType21_ or _SystemInformationBlockType26_ or in
> _SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;_
>
> **_Ny_** is the value of _zoneIdLatiMod_ included in _zoneConfig_ in
> _SystemInformationBlockType21_ or _SystemInformationBlockType26_ or in
> _SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;_
>
> **_x_** is the geodesic distance in longitude between UE\'s current location
> and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [80] and it is
> expressed in meters;
>
> **_y_** is the geodesic distance in latitude between UE\'s current location
> and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [80] and it is
> expressed in meters.
The UE shall select a pool of resources which includes a _zoneID_ equals to
the Zone_id calculated according to above mentioned formulae and indicated by
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated, v2x-CommTxPoolNormalCommon_ ,
_v2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in _v2x-InterFreqInfoList_ or _p2x-CommTxPoolNormal_ in
_v2x-InterFreqInfoList_ in _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ , or
_v2x-CommTxPoolList_ according to 5.10.13.1.
NOTE 1: The UE uses its latest geographical coordinates to perform resource
pool selection.
NOTE 2: If geographical coordinates are not available and zone specific TX
resource pools are configured for the concerned frequency, it is up to UE
implementation which resource pool is selected for V2X sidelink communication
transmission.
#### 5.10.13.3 V2X sidelink communication transmission reference cell
selection
A UE capable of V2X sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers
to transmit V2X sidelink communication shall:
1> for each frequency used to transmit V2X sidelink communication, select a
cell to be used as reference for synchronisation and DL measurements in
accordance with the following:
2> if the frequency concerns the primary frequency:
3> use the PCell (RRC_CONNECTED) or the serving cell (RRC_IDLE) as reference;
2> else if the frequency concerns a secondary frequency:
3> use the concerned SCell as reference;
2> else if the UE is in coverage of the concerned frequency:
3> use the DL frequency paired with the one used to transmit V2X sidelink
communication as reference;
2> else (i.e., out of coverage on the concerned frequency):
3> use the PCell (RRC_CONNECTED) or the serving cell (RRC_IDLE) as reference,
if needed;
### 5.10.14 DFN derivation from GNSS
When the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source, the DFN used
for V2X sidelink communication is derived from the current UTC time, by the
following formulae:
_DFN_ = FLOOR (0.1*(_Tcurrent_ \--_Tref--offsetDFN_)) mod 1024
_SubframeNumber_ = FLOOR (_Tcurrent_ \--_Tref--offsetDFN_) mod 10
Where:
**_Tcurrent_** is the current UTC time that obtained from GNSS. This value is
expressed in milliseconds;
**_Tref_** is the reference UTC time 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1
January, 1900 (midnight between Thursday, December 31, 1899 and Friday,
January 1, 1900). This value is expressed in milliseconds;
**_OffsetDFN_** is the value _offsetDFN_ if configured, otherwise it is zero.
This value is expressed in milliseconds.
NOTE: In case of leap second change event, how V2X UE obtains the scheduled
time of leap second change to adjust _Tcurrent_ correspondingly is left to UE
implementation. How V2X UE handles the sudden discontinuity of DFN is left to
UE implementation.
# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters (tabular & ASN.1)
## 6.1 General
The contents of each RRC message is specified in clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to
specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further
detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The
syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract
types is further specified in a similar manner in clause 6.3.
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the
ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1),
is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement
in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the
downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1-1.
Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to
be present
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Abbreviation | Meaning | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Cond _conditionTag_ | _Conditionally present_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | A field for which the need is specified | | | by means of conditions. For each | | | _conditionTag_ , the need is specified in | | | a tabular form following the ASN.1 | | | segment. In case, according to the | | | conditions, a field is not present, the | | | UE takes no action and where applicable | | | shall continue to use the existing value | | | (and/ or the associated functionality) | | | unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g. | | | in the conditional presence table or in | | | the description of the field itself). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need OP | _Optionally present_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | A field that is optional to signal. For | | | downlink messages, the UE is not required | | | to take any special action on absence of | | | the field beyond what is specified in the | | | procedural text or the field description | | | table following the ASN.1 segment. The UE | | | behaviour on absence should be captured | | | either in the procedural text or in the | | | field description. | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need ON | _Optionally present, No action_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | A field that is optional to signal. _If | | | the message is received by the UE, and_ | | | in case the field is absent, the UE takes | | | no action and where applicable shall | | | continue to use the existing value (and/ | | | or the associated functionality). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need OR | _Optionally present, Release_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | A field that is optional to signal. _If | | | the message is received by the UE, and_ | | | in case the field is absent, the UE shall | | | discontinue/ stop using/ delete any | | | existing value (and/ or the associated | | | functionality). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
Any field with Need ON in system information shall be interpreted as Need OR.
Need codes may not be specified for a parent extension field/ extension group,
used in downlink, which includes one or more child extension fields. Upon
absence of such a parent extension field/ extension group, the UE shall:
\- For each individual child extension field, including extensions that are
mandatory to include in the optional group, act in accordance with the need
code that is defined for the extension;
\- Apply this behaviour not only for child extension fields included directly
within the optional parent extension field/ extension group, but also for
extension fields defined at further nesting levels as long as for none of the
fields in-between the concerned extension field and the parent extension field
a need code is specified;
NOTE 1: The above applies for groups of non critical extensions using double
brackets (referred to as extension groups), as well as non-critical extensions
at the end of a message or at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING
or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).
Need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child)
field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is
present. This rule does not apply for optional parent extension fields/
extension groups without need codes,
NOTE 2: The previous rule implies that E-UTRAN has to include such a parent
extension field to release a child field that is either:
> \- Optional with need OR, or
>
> \- Conditional while the UE releases the child field when absent.
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by
means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {
field11 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
field12 InformationElement12 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
...,
[[ field13 InformationElement13 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field14 InformationElement14 OPTIONAL -- Need ON
]]
}
InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE {
field21 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
\- if _field2_ in _RRCMessage-r8-IEs_ is absent, the UE does not modify
_field21_ ;
\- if _field2_ in _RRCMessage-r8-IEs_ is present but does not include
_field21_ , the UE releases _field21_ ;
\- if the extension group containing _field13_ is absent, the UE releases
_field13_ and does not modify _field14_ ;
\- if _nonCriticalExtension_ defined by IE _RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs_ is absent,
the UE does not modify _field3_ and releases _field4_ ;
In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to
the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.

If E-UTRAN includes the | | _securityConfigHO-v1530 (i.e., with suffix)_ , the choice _intra5GC_ | | is used for handover from NR or **E-UTRA** /5GC to **E-UTRA** /5GC | | while the choice _fivegc-ToEPC_ is used for inter-system handover | | from NR or **E-UTRA** /5GC to **E-UTRA** /EPC and the choice | | _epc-To5GC_ is used for inter-system handover from **E-UTRA** /EPC to | | **E-UTRA** /5GC. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_sk-Counter_** | | | | A one-shot counter used upon initial configuration of S-K~gNB~ as | | well as upon refresh of S-K~gNB~. E-UTRAN always provides this field | | either upon initial configuration of an NR SCG, or upon | | configuration of the first (SN terminated) RB using S-K~gNB~, | | whichever happens first. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_sl-V2X-ConfigDedicated_** | | | | Indicates sidelink configuration for non-P2X related V2X sidelink | | communication as well as P2X related V2X sidelink communication. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_smtc_** | | | | The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for | | NR PSCell addition and SN change. It is based on timing reference of | | EUTRA PCell. NOTE 2. | | | | If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the _measObjectNR_ | | having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured | | before the reception of the RRC message. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex_** | | | | Indicates the serving cell whose UL transmission may be interrupted | | during SRS transmission on a PUSCH-less cell. During SRS | | transmission on a PUSCH-less cell, the UE may temporarily suspend | | the UL transmission on a serving cell with PUSCH in the same CG to | | allow the PUSCH-less cell to transmit SRS. The PUSCH-less cell is | | always a TDD cell but the serving cell with PUSCH may be either a | | FDD or TDD cell. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_subframeAssignment_** | | | | Indicates DL/UL subframe configuration where sa0 points to | | Configuration 0, sa1 to Configuration 1 etc. as specified in TS | | 36.211 [21], table 4.2-2. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_systemInformationBlockType1Dedicated_** | | | | This field is used to transfer _SystemInformationBlockType1 or | | SystemInformationBlockType1-BR to the UE._ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_systemInformationBlockType2Dedicated_** | | | | **This field is used to transfer BR version of | |_SystemInformationBlockType2 _to BL UEs or UEs in CE or | |_ SystemInformationBlockType2 _to non-BL UEs._ * | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | _**t350** _| | | |_ *Timer T350 as described in clause 7.3.** Value _minN corresponds | | to N minutes._ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_tdm-PatternConfig_** | | | | UL/DL reference configuration **indicating the time during which a | | UE configured with (NG)EN-DC is allowed to transmit.

intra-system handover within E-UTRA or upon the first reconfiguration after
RRC connection re-establishment; or for intra-system handover from NR to
E-UTRA, otherwise the field is not present. _HO-5GC_ The field is mandatory
present in case of handover within **E-UTRA** /5GC, handover to **E-UTRA**
/5GC, handover from NR to **E-UTRA** /EPC, or handover from **E-UTRA** /5GC to
**E-UTRA** /EPC, otherwise the field is not present. _HO-toEPC_ The field is
mandatory present in case of handover within **E-UTRA** /EPC or to **E-UTRA**
/EPC, except handover from NR or **E-UTRA** /5GC, otherwise the field is not

E-UTRA or for reconfigurations when _fullConfig_ is included; otherwise the
field is optionally present, need ON. _nonFullConfig_ The field is not present
when the _fullConfig_ is included or in case of handover to E-UTRA; otherwise
it is optional present, need ON. _nonHO_ The field is not present in case of
handover within E-UTRA or to E-UTRA; otherwise it is optional present, need
ON. _SCellAdd_ The field is mandatory present upon SCell addition; otherwise
it is not present. _SCellAdd2_ The field is mandatory present upon SCell

NOTE 1: Fields _sk-Counter_ and _nr-RadioBearerConfig1/ 2_ are placed outside
_nr-Config_ , as these may be configured while the UE is not configured with
(NG)EN-DC.
NOTE 2: It is not specified whether the timing reference for the SMTC
configuration is the source EUTRA PCell or the target EUTRA PCell in case the
NR PSCell addition or SN change takes place simultaneously with handover. As a
consequence, explicit SMTC configuration is only supported when the source
EUTRA PCell and the target EUTRA PCell of the handover are SFN/subframe-
synchronized.

NOTE 1: During handover, the UE performs a MAC reset, which involves reverting
to the default CQI/ SRS/ SR configuration in accordance with clause 5.3.13 and
TS 36.321 [6], clauses 5.9 and 5.2. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated
radio resource configuration, the default configuration (rather than the
configuration used in the source PCell) is used as the basis for the delta
signalling that is included in the message used to perform handover.
NOTE 2: Since delta signalling is not supported for the common SCell
configuration, E-UTRAN can only add or release the uplink of an SCell by
releasing and adding the concerned SCell.
#### \-- _P-Max_
The IE _P-Max_ is used to limit the UE\'s uplink transmission power on a
carrier frequency and is used to calculate the parameter _Pcompensation_
defined in TS 36.304 [4]. Corresponds to parameter P~EMAX~ or P~EMAX,c~ in TS
36.101 [42]. The UE transmit power on one serving cell shall not exceed the
configured maximum UE output power of the serving cell determined by this
value as specified in TS 36.101 [42], clauses 6.2.5 or 6.2.5A, or, when
transmitting sidelink discovery announcements within the coverage of the
concerned cell, as specified in TS 36.101 [42], clause 6.2.5D.

E-UTRAN does not include this field when | | _SRB-ToAddMod_ is included in _srb-ToAddModListSCG_. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_physicalConfigDedicated_** | | | | The default dedicated physical configuration is specified in 9.2.4. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_resAllocGranularity_** | | | | **_Indicates the resource allocation and precoding granularity_** in | | PRB pair level **_of the signaled neighboring cell,_** see TS 36.213 | | [23], clause 7.1.6. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_rlc-BearerConfigSecondary_** | | | | The configuration of a secondary RLC bearer within the same Cell | | Group as may e.g. be used in case of PDCP duplication using CA. The | | configuration comprises a (secondary) RLC entity, a logical channel | | identity and a logical channel configuration. E-UTRAN may configure | | this for SRB1, SRB2 and DRBs. For SRBs, E-UTRAN only configures the | | field for MCG (i.e. if included in _radioResourceConfigDedicated_. | | E-UTRAN configures the same RLC mode (AM/ UM) as used for the | | original RLC entity. The primary RLC entity is configured by | | _RLC-Config_. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_rlc-Config_** | | | | For SRBs a choice is used to indicate whether the RLC configuration | | is signalled explicitly or set to the values defined in the default | | RLC configuration for SRB1 in 9.2.1.1 or for SRB2 in 9.2.1.2. RLC AM | | is the only applicable RLC mode for SRB1 and SRB2. E-UTRAN does not | | reconfigure the RLC mode of DRBs except when a full configuration | | option is used, and may reconfigure the RLC SN field size and the AM | | RLC LI field size only upon handover within E-UTRA or upon the first | | reconfiguration after RRC connection re-establishment or upon SCG | | Change for SCG and split DRBs. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_servCellp-a_** | | | | Indicates the power offset **for QPSK C-RNTI based PDSCH | | transmissions used by the serving cell,** see TS 36.213 [23], | | clause 5.2**.** Value dB-6 corresponds to -6 dB, dB-4dot77 | | corresponds to -4.77 dB etc. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_sps-Config_** | | | | The default SPS configuration is specified in 9.2.3. Except for | | handover or releasing SPS for MCG, E-UTRAN does not reconfigure | | _sps-Config_ for MCG when there is a configured downlink assignment | | or a configured uplink grant for MCG (see TS 36.321 [6]). Except | | for SCG change or releasing SPS for SCG, E-UTRAN does not | | reconfigure _sps-Config_ for SCG when there is a configured downlink | | assignment or a configured uplink grant for SCG (see TS 36.321 | | [6]). In one serving cell, _sps-Config-v1530_ is not present | | simultaneously with either _sps-Config_ (without suffix) or | | _sps-Config-r12_. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_srb-Identity_** | | | | **Value 1 is applicable for SRB1 only. Value 2 is applicable for | | SRB2 only.** Value 4 is applicable for SRB4 only, if configured. For | | a split SRB the same identity is used for the MCG and NR SCG RLC | | bearer configurations. If _srb-Identity-v1530_ is received, the UE | | shall ignore _srb-Identity_ (i.e. without suffix). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_srb-Identity-v1530_** | | | | E-UTRAN does not include this field when _SRB-ToAddMod_ is included | | in _srb-ToAddModListSCG_. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_srb-ToAddModListExt_** | | | | The field is to configure SRB4. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_srb-ToAddModList_** | | | | E-UTRAN configures the same RAT type (i.e. EUTRA or NR) for PDCP | | configuration of SRB1 and SRB2. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_transmissionModeList_** | | | | Indicates a subset of transmission mode 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, for | | the signaled neighboring cell for which _NeighCellsInfo_ applies. | | When TM10 is signaled, other signaled transmission parameters in | | _NeighCellsInfo_ are not applicable to up to 8 layer transmission | | scheme of TM10. E-UTRAN may indicate TM9 when TM10 with QCL type A | | and DMRS scrambling with {width="0.65625in" | | height="0.23958333333333334in"} in TS 36.211 [21], clause | | 6.10.3.1, is used in the signalled neighbour cell and TM9 or TM10 | | with QCL type A and DMRS scrambling with | | {width="0.65625in" | | height="0.23958333333333334in"} in TS 36.211 [21], clause | | 6.10.3.1, is used in the serving cell. UE behaviour with NAICS when | | TM10 is used is only defined when QCL type A and DMRS scrambling | | with {width="0.65625in" | | height="0.23958333333333334in"} in TS 36.211 [21], clause | | 6.10.3.1, is used for the serving cell and all signalled neighbour | | cells.

The | | first 5 octets correspond to Mobile Station Classmark 2 and the | | following octets correspond to Mobile Station Classmark 3. The | | Mobile Station Classmark 2 is formatted as \'TLV\' and is coded in | | the same way as the _Mobile Station Classmark 2_ information element | | in TS 24.008 [49]. The first octet is the _Mobile station | | classmark 2 IEI_ and its value shall be set to 33H. The second octet | | is the _Length of mobile station classmark 2_ and its value shall be | | set to 3. The octet 3 contains the first octet of the value part of | | the _Mobile Station Classmark 2_ information element, the octet 4 | | contains the second octet of the value part of the _Mobile Station | | Classmark 2_ information element and so on.

The | | sixth octet of this octet string contains octet 1 of the value part | | of _Mobile station classmark 3_ , the seventh of octet of this octet | | string contains octet 2 of the value part of _Mobile station | | classmark 3_ and so on. Note. | | | | For GERAN PS: the encoding of UE capabilities is formatted as \'V\' | | and is coded in the same way as the value part in the _MS Radio | | Access Capability_ information element in TS 24.008 [49]. | | | | For CDMA2000-1XRTT: the octet string contains the A21 Mobile | | Subscription Information and the encoding of this is defined in | | A.S0008 [33]. The A21 Mobile Subscription Information contains the | | supported CDMA2000 1xRTT band class and band sub-class information. | | | | For NR: The octet string contains the IE _UE-NR-Capability_ as | | defined in TS 38.331 [82]. | | | | For EUTRA-NR: The octet string contains the IE _UE-MRDC-Capability_ | | as defined in TS 38.331 [82] | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
NOTE: The value part is specified by means of CSN.1, which encoding results in
a bit string, to which final padding may be appended up to the next octet
boundary TS 24.008 [49]. The first/ leftmost bit of the CSN.1 bit string is
placed in the first/ leftmost/ most significant bit of the first octet. This
continues until the last bit of the CSN.1 bit string, which is placed in the
last/ rightmost/ least significant bit of the last octet.
#### \-- _UE-EUTRA-Capability_

NOTE 1: The IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ does not include AS security capability
information, since these are the same as the security capabilities that are
signalled by NAS. Consequently, AS need not provide \"man-in-the-middle\"
protection for the security capabilities.
NOTE 2: The column FDD/ TDD diff indicates if the UE is allowed to signal, as
part of the additional capabilities for an XDD mode i.e. within _UE-EUTRA-
CapabilityAddXDD-Mode-xNM_ , a different value compared to the value signalled
elsewhere within _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ (i.e. the common value, supported for
both XDD modes). A \'-\' is used to indicate that it is not possible to signal
different values (used for fields for which the field description is provided
for other reasons). Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE
supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a capability for which it indicates
support within the capability signalling.
NOTE 2a: From REL-15 onwards, the UE is not allowed to signal different values
for FDD and TDD unless yes is indicated in column FDD/ TDD diff (i.e. no need
to introduce field description solely for the purpose of indicate no).
NOTE 3: The _BandCombinationParameters for the same band combination can be
included more than once._
NOTE 4: UE CA and measurement capabilities indicate the combinations of
frequencies that can be configured as serving frequencies.
NOTE 5: The grouping of the cells to the first and second cell group, as
indicated by _supportedCellGrouping_ , is shown in the table below. The
leading / leftmost bit of _supportedCellGrouping_ corresponds to the Bit
String Position 1.
Nr of Band Entries: 5 4 3

15 01111
NOTE 6: UE includes the _intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12_ also for
bandwidth class A because of the presence conditions in
_BandCombinationParameters-v1270_. For example, if UE supports CA_1A_41D band
combination, if UE includes the field _intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12_ for
band 41, the UE includes _intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12_ also for band 1.
NOTE 6a: For multiple _BandParameters_ entries with the same _bandEUTRA_ and
same _ca-BandwidthClassDL_ in a supported band combination, the UE
capabilities indicated by _BandParameters_ are agnostic to the order in which
they are indicated in the _bandParameterList_ , under the condition that the
set of the capabilities indicated for the concerned _bandEUTRA_ (e.g.
_bandParametersDL_ and _bandParametersUL)_ are used together, and the
concerned _BandParameters_ correspond to the _supportedBandwithCombinationSet_
for which set of channel bandwidths for carrier(s) is the same among sub-
blocks, as defined in TS 36.101 [42], Table 5.6A.1-3, Table 5.6A.1-4, Table
5.6A.1-5.
NOTE 7: For a UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ but
supports a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation),
the ASN.1 comprehension requirement are specified in Annex F.
NOTE 8: For a UE that does not include _mimo-WeightedLayersCapabilities-r13_ ,
or for the case with no CC configured with FD-MIMO, the FD-MIMO processing
capability condition is not applicable (i.e. considered as satisfied). For a
UE that includes _mimo-WeightedLayersCapabilities-r13_ , the FD-MIMO
processing capability condition is satisfied if the equation 4.3.28.13-1 in TS
36.306 [5] is satisfied.

## 6.6 Direct Indication Information
Direct Indication information is transmitted on MPDCCH using P-RNTI but
without associated _Paging_ message. Table 6.6-1 defines the Direct Indication
information, see TS 36.212 [22], clause 5.3.3.1.14.
When bit n is set to 1, UE shall behave as if the corresponding field is set
in the _Paging_ message, see 5.3.2.3. Bit 1 is the least significant bit.

be ignored by UE if received.
## 6.6a Direct Indication FeMBMS
On MBMS-dedicated cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, a Direct Indication
FeMBMS is transmitted on PDCCH together with 8-bit MCCH change notification
using M-RNTI, see TS 36.212 [22], clause 5.3.3.1.4. Table 6.6a-1 defines the
Direct Indication FeMBMS.
When the first bit is set to 1, UE shall behave as if _systemInfoModification_
field is set in the _Paging_ message and when the second bit is set to 1, UE
shall behave as if both _etws-Indication and cmas-Indication_ are set in the
_Paging_ message, see 5.3.2.3. Bit 1 is the least significant bit.

pools in _preconfigComm_ to cover reception from in coverage UEs using
scheduled resource allocation. For such a resource pool the network should set
all bits of _subframeBitmap_ to 1 and _offsetIndicator_ to indicate the

# 10 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
## 10.1 General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes.
These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio
Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics
as the RRC messages that are transferred across the E-UTRA radio interface,
i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
## 10.2 Inter-node RRC messages
### 10.2.1 General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2- or the
S1-interface, either to or from the eNB, i.e. a single \'logical channel\' is
used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information
could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

## 10.5 Mandatory information in _AS-Config_
The _AS-Config_ transferred between source eNB and target-eNB shall include
all IEs necessary to describe the AS context. The conditional presence in
clause 6 is only applicable for eNB to UE communication.
The \"need\" or \"cond\" statements are not applied in case of sending the IEs
from source eNB to target eNB. Some fields shall be included regardless of the
\"need\" or \"cond\" e.g. _discardTimer_. The _AS-Config_ re-uses information
elements primarily created to cover the radio interface signalling
requirements. The information elements may include some parameters that are
not relevant for the target eNB e.g. the SFN as included in the
_MasterInformationBlock_.
All the fields in the _AS-Config_ as defined in 10.3 that are introduced after
v9.2.0 and that are optional for eNB to UE communication shall be included, if
the functionality is configured, except for the fields _sourceOtherConfigSN-
NR_ and _sourceRB-ConfigSN-NR_ in AS _-ConfigNR_. The fields in the _AS-
Config_ that are defined before and including v9.2.0 shall be included as
specified in the following.
Within the _sourceRadioResourceConfig,_ _sourceMeasConfig_ and
_sourceOtherConfig_ , the source eNB shall include fields that are optional
for eNB to UE communication, if the functionality is configured unless
explicitly specified otherwise in the following:
\- in accordance with a condition that is explicitly stated to be applicable;
or

value is the same as the default value that is defined; or
\- the need of the field is OP and the current UE configuration corresponds
with the behaviour defined for absence of the field;

## 10.6 Inter-node NB-IoT messages
### 10.6.1 General
This clause specifies NB-IoT RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-
or the S1-interface, either to or from the eNB, i.e. a single \'logical
channel\' is used for all NB-IoT RRC messages transferred across network
nodes.

## 10.9 Mandatory information in _AS-Config-NB_
The _AS-Config-NB_ transferred between source eNB and target-eNB shall include
all IEs necessary to describe the AS context. The conditional presence in
clause 6 is only applicable for eNB to UE communication.
The \"Need\" or \"Cond\" statements are not applied in case of sending the IEs
from source eNB to target eNB. Some information elements shall be included
regardless of the \"Need\" or \"Cond\" e.g. _discardTimer_. The _AS-Config-NB_
re-uses information elements primarily created to cover the radio interface
signalling requirements.
Within the _sourceRadioResourceConfig,_ the source eNB shall include fields
that are optional for eNB to UE communication, if the functionality is
configured unless explicitly specified otherwise in the following:
\- in accordance with a condition that is explicitly stated to be applicable;
or
\- a default value is defined for the concerned field; and the configured
value is the same as the default value that is defined; or
\- the need of the field is OP and the current UE configuration corresponds
with the behaviour defined for absence of the field;

## 11.2 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the
following tables, by means of a value N:
N = the number of 1ms subframes from the end of reception of the E-UTRAN -> UE
message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the
reception of uplink grant for the UE -> E-UTRAN response message with no
access delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by
scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation).
NOTE: No processing delay requirements are specified for RN-specific
procedures.

## 11.3 Void
###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
## A.1 Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol
data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
## A.2 Procedural specification
### A.2.1 General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception
of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU
specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details
of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be
done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g.
general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple
fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements
regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are send to E-UTRAN
i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
### A.2.2 More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
\- Bullets:
\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are
part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'
\- All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a semi-
colon i.e. an \';\'
\- Conditions
\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end
of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in \'if cond1;
or cond2:
## A.3 PDU specification
### A.3.1 General principles
#### A.3.1.1 ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract
syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the
specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1
code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with a text paragraph
consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 start tag_ , which consists of a double
hyphen followed by a single space and the text string \"ASN1START\" (in all
upper case letters). Each ASN.1 section ends with a text paragraph consisting
entirely of an _ASN.1 stop tag_ , which consists of a double hyphen followed
by a single space and the text \"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters):
\-- ASN1START
\-- ASN1STOP
The text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not
contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU
contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text
paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the
order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE: A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists
of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the
entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed
by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the
occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
#### A.3.1.2 ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should
be based on the following guidelines:
\- Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, _e.g._ , the
_RRCConnectionModificationCommand_ , should be used for reference in the
procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
\- Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case,
with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a
capital, _e.g._ , _EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since
the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-
TimeDifference_.
\- Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case
thereafter, _e.g._ , _establishmentCause_. If a field identifier begins with
an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is
lowercase (_plmn-Identity_ , not _pLMN-Identity_). The acronym is set off with
a hyphen (_ue-Identity_ , not _ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a
consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers_.
\- Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially
widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent
possible.
\- Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should
be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which
should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use \'Meas\' instead of
\'Measurement\' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are
given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
\- _For future extension:_ When an extension is introduced a suffix is added
to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/ or type. A suffix of the
form \"‑rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types
introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/ first
release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a
revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, _e.g._
, _Foo-r9_ for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type _Foo_. A suffix of the form
\"‑rXb\" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same
release (X) as the original version of the field, \"‑rXc\" for a second intra-
release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"‑vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1
fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or
type (see clause A.4), e.g., _AnElement-v10b0_ for the extension of the ASN.1
type _AnElement_ introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number
_0...9, 10, 11, etc._ is used to represent the first part of the version
number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters _a, b, c,
etc._ are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number
if they are greater than 9\. In the procedural specification, in field
descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a
clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
\- More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants
of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the
identifiers e.g. _MeasObjectUTRA_ , _ConfigCommon_. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included
in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be
attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the
different variants.

Request Rx Reception Sched Scheduling Sync Synchronisation Thresh Threshold
Tx/ Transm Transmission UL Uplink
NOTE: The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be
used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
#### A.3.1.3 Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the
specification is made using the ASN.1 field or type identifier of the
referenced element. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text
references should be in the _italic font style_. The \"do not check spelling
and grammar\" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., \" \")
should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU type should be made using the corresponding ASN.1
type identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to the
_RRCConnectionRelease_ message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any
other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the
_prioritisedBitRate_ field in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority Priority,
prioritisedBitRate PrioritisedBitRate,
bucketSizeDuration BucketSizeDuration,
logicalChannelGroup INTEGER (0..3)
} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
NOTE: All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this
annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to
include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted
from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym \"IE\", e.g., a
reference to the IE _LogicalChannelConfig_ in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when
those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the
specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a
particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information
element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be
used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1
value, e.g., \'if the _status_ field is set to value _true_ \'.
### A.3.2 High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are
alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
message DL-DCCH-MessageType
}
DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE {
dlInformationTransfer DLInformationTransfer,
handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
mobilityFromEUTRACommand MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
rrcConnectionReconfiguration RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
rrcConnectionRelease RRCConnectionRelease,
securityModeCommand SecurityModeCommand,
ueCapabilityEnquiry UECapabilityEnquiry,
spare1 NULL
},
messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types
are alternatives within the inner level _c1_ CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare1_ in this case) may be included within the
_c1_ CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an
integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using
the _messageClassExtension_ alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
### A.3.3 Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one
shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8 RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Hooks for _critical_ and _non-critical_ extension should normally be included
in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described
in clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents
and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between
the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented
from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not
comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the
inner level _c1_ CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare3_ down to _spare1_
in this case) may be included within the _c1_ CHOICE. The number of spare
alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be
decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the
future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original
specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
_criticalExtensionsFuture_ in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases
of the protocol, the inner level _c1_ CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be
excluded, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here. -- -- Cond condTag
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information
to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-
critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still
able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or
other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are
facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original
specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at
the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field
that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of an empty
sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a
_field description_ table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic
properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is
shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case
there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g.
because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for
each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that
needs to be specified.
+-------------------------------------------+ | _%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions_ | +===========================================+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+
The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the
ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall
include a first paragraph with a _field identifier_ (in **_bold and italic_**
font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The
following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style),
e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/ or
specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of
the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be
omitted from the field description table.
### A.3.4 Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to
the one shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-ConfigSIB ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo
}
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need ON
}
PRACH-ConfigInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
prach-ConfigIndex ENUMERATED {ffs},
highSpeedFlag ENUMERATED {ffs},
zeroCorrelationZoneConfig ENUMERATED {ffs}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same
set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break
down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs _PRACH-ConfigSIB_
and _PRACH-Config_ in this example, are preferably placed together in a common
ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base,
defined as the _generic type identifier_. It may be complemented by a suffix
to distinguish the different variants. The \"_PRACH-Config_ \" is the generic
type identifier in this example, and the \"_SIB_ \" suffix is added to
distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a group
of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type
identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of
an existing IE is created for _critical_ or _non-critical_ extension of the
protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the
IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix is
added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in clause
A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or
extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE
types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types
should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type
definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a
benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these
IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data
elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ , should
not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification.
An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be
defined in a separate clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1
section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs
_PRACH-ConfigSIB_ and _PRACH-Config_ in the example above). Such IE types are
also referred to as \'global IEs\'.
NOTE: Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation
error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE
type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline
level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the
example above, may be followed by a _field description_ table, where a further
description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information
elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in
clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the
_field description_ table is the same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the
specification of the PDU type.
### A.3.5 Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It
identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a
value for that field in the encoding:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PreambleInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
numberOfRA-Preambles INTEGER (1..64) DEFAULT 1,
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword
OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission
carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need ON
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need statement. The need statement
includes the keyword \"Need\", followed by one of the predefined semantics
tags (OP, ON or OR) defined in clause 6.1. If the semantics tag OP is used,
the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the field
description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the
following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE,
then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field
in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
### A.3.6 Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In
addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph
including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword
\"Cond\", followed by a condition tag associated with the field (\"UL\" in
this example):
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority INTEGER (0),
...
} OPTIONAL -- Cond UL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field
description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a _conditional
presence_ table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for
including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1
section.
_Conditional presence_ _Explanation_
* * *
UL **Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with
the condition tag = \"UL\". Semantics in case of optional presence under
certain conditions may also be specified.**
The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading:
\"Conditional presence\") contains the condition tag (in _italic_ font style),
which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry
in the table. The second column (heading: \"Explanation\") contains a text
specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the
field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional
presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined
tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field
despends on the presence and/ or value of other fields within the same
message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another feature/
function has been configured, while this function can be configured
indepedently e.g. by another message and/ or at another point in time, the
relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description
table.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence,
the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.
### A.3.7 Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct
in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an
information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would
not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in
the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo
PLMN-IdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code
to contain types with unpredictable names:
\-- /bad example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
## A.4 Extension of the PDU specifications
### A.4.1 General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different
versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this
requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
\- Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).
\- Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be
possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of
the other parts of the message).
\- Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used,
the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical
channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may
be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring
of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing
protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when
there is a need to introduce a \'clean\' message version. Such a need appears
when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical
extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with
the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered
when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical
extension mechanisms.
### A.4.2 Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are
both \"outer branch\" and \"inner branch\" mechanisms available. The \"outer
branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name _criticalExtensions_ , with two
values, _c1_ and _criticalExtensionsFuture_. The _criticalExtensionsFuture_
branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner
branch\" mechanism.
The \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
\"_MessageName-rX-IEs_ \" (e.g., \"_RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs_ \")
or \"_spareX_ \", with the spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\"
structures contain the _complete_ structure of the message IEs for the
appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10
version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not
obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional
Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an \'outer branch\', or an
\'outer branch\' in combination with an \'inner branch\' including a certain
number of spares:
\- For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on
a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
\- An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
\- The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that
the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release
with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values).
The estimation of the critical extension likelyhood may be based on the
number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
\- In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all
spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions
are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism
by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release

}

\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Later release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {

}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level
of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended
version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be
included (e.g. original field is mandatory, EUTRAN is unaware if UE supports
the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be
required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the
use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original
and of a later release
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

}
\-- ASN1STOP
Conditional presence Explanation
* * *
_NoField2rN_ The field is optionally present, need ON, if _field2-rN_ is
absent. Otherwise the field is not present
Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same
release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct
an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to
assist E-UTRAN in deciding whether or not to use the critically extension.
### A.4.3 Non-critical extension of messages
#### A.4.3.1 General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in
A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:
\- When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been
critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier
critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
\- The extension marker (\"...\") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used unless a length determinant is not required. Examples
of cases where a length determinant is not required:
\- at the end of a message,
\- at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING
\- When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter
belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the \'_default
extension location_ \')
\- It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of
the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible
level.
\- In specific cases it may be preferrable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the \'_actual extension location_ \') e.g. when it is possible
to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should
be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.
\- In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher
level in the message should be considered.
\- In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE
should be defined. The IE\'s ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same
ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are
intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location,
an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily
introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not
allways be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the
actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 section.
#### A.4.3.2 Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous clause, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
\- Extension markers within SEQUENCE
\- Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the
higher nesting levels
\- Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields
as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex
structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list)
\- Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important
information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT
\- Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages
on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully
\- The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the
specification are grouped together using double brackets.
\- Extension markers within ENUMERATED
\- Spare values are used until the number of values reaches the next power of
2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new value,
e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".
\- Extension markers within CHOICE:
\- Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for
the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g.
ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the
behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not
required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the
extended value.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new choice
value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an
OCTET or BIT STRING:
\- When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a \"Need\" statement should
not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one
extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For
simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a \"Need\" statement when the
field is not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
\- In case a need statement is not provided for a group, a \"Need\" statement
is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e.
including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify
the action upon absence of the whole group.
#### A.4.3.3 Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number
of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also
illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism
is used.
NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while
the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n
receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced
mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 ENUMERATED {
value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,
..., value5-v960 },
field2 CHOICE {
field2a BOOLEAN,
field2b InformationElement2b,
...,
field2c-v960 InformationElement2c-r9
},
...,
[[ field3-r9 InformationElement3-r9 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
]],
[[ field3-v9a0 InformationElement3-v9a0 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field4-r9 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
]]
}
InformationElement1-r10 ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 ENUMERATED {
value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,
value5-v960, value6-v1170, spare2, spare1, ...},
field2 CHOICE {
field2a BOOLEAN,
field2b InformationElement2b,
field2c-v960 InformationElement2c-r9,
...,
field2d-v12b0 INTEGER (0..63)
},
field3-r9 InformationElement3-r10 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field4-r9 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field5-r10 BOOLEAN,
field6-r10 InformationElement6-r10 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
...,
[[ field3-v1170 InformationElement3-v1170 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions of _InformationElement1_ as shown in the
above example:
\-- The _InformationElement1_ is initially extended with a number of non-
critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced
for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE
_InformationElement1_ (i.e. _InformationElement1-r10_) is defined in which the
earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the
original field.
\-- The _value4-v880_ is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for _field1_. Likewise _value6-v1170_ replaces _spare3_ that
was originally defined in the r10 version of _field1_
\-- Within the critically extended release 10 version of _InformationElement1_
, the names of the original fields/ IEs are not changed, unless there is a
real need to distinguish them from other fields/ IEs. E.g. the _field1_ and
_InformationElement4_ were defined in the original protocol version (release
8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the _field3-r9_ is introduced in release 9
and not re-tagged; although, the _InformationElement3_ is also critically
extended and therefore tagged _InformationElement3-r10_ in the release 10
version of InformationElement1.
#### A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a
message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the
end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or
OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v860-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v860-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4-v860 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need OP
field5-v860 BOOLEAN OPTIONAL, -- Cond C54
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field6-v940 InformationElement6-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
nonCriticalExtensions SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The _InformationElement4_ is introduced in the original version of the
protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
#### A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default
extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case
an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
#### \-- _ParentIE-WithEM_
The IE _ParentIE-WithEM_ is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level
IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ which not include the
extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have
to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0_
and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0_ (both in release N) are used to connect non-
critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs
to the actual extension location in this IE.
**_ParentIE-WithEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ParentIE-WithEM ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Root encoding, including:
childIE1-WithoutEM ChildIE1-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
childIE2-WithoutEM ChildIE2-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
...,
[[ childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL -- Need ON
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The fields _childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0_ may not really need to be optional
(depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
\-- In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields
should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
#### \-- _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, used to control
certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be
setup or released using the local IE _ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature_. The example
illustrates how the new field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the
configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the
following assumptions:
\-- when initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the
original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as
if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
\-- when the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.
\-- when omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling
for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
\-- when omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases
the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may
be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an
eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may
not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.
**_ChildIE1-WithoutEM_** information elements
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ChildIE1-WithoutEM ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Root encoding, including:
chIE1-ConfigurableFeature ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature OPTIONAL -- Need ON

ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0 ::= SEQUENCE {

}
\-- ASN1STOP
_Conditional presence_ _Explanation_
* * *
_ConfigF_ The field is optional present, need OR, in case of
_chIE1-ConfigurableFeature_ is included and set to \"setup\"; otherwise the
field is not present and the UE shall delete any existing value for this
field.
#### \-- _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, typically used
to control certain radio configurations. The example illustrates how the new
field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the configuration of the
configurable feature.
**_ChildIE2-WithoutEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ChildIE2-WithoutEM ::= CHOICE {
release NULL,

## A.5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC
messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier
1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC_IDLE should not include the RRC
transaction identifier.
2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.
3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an
RRC transaction identifier.
5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a
corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction
identifier.
## A.6 Protection of RRC messages (informative)
The following list provides information which messages can be sent
(unprotected) prior to security activation and which messages can be sent
unprotected after security activation. Those messages indicated \"-\" in \"P\"
column should never be sent unprotected by eNB or UE. Further requirements are
defined in the procedural text.
P...Messages that can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation
A - I...Messages that can be sent without integrity protection after security
activation
A - C...Messages that can be sent unciphered after security activation
NA... Message can never be sent after security activation

## A.7 Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous conventions should be used:
\- References: Whenever another specification is referenced, the specification
number and optionally the relevant clause, table or figure, should be
indicated in addition to the pointer to the References clause e.g. as follows:
\'see TS 36.212 [22, 5.3.3.1.6]\'.
\- UE capabilities: TS 36.306 [5] specifies that E-UTRAN should in general
respect the UE\'s capabilities. Hence there is no need to include statement
clarifying that E-UTRAN, when setting the value of a certain configuration
field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is a particular
need e.g. particularly complicated cases.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Release 8 and 9 AS feature handling
## B.1 Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in fields
_featureGroupIndicators_ (in Table B.1-1) and _featureGroupIndRel9Add_ (in
Table B.1-1a).
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the fields
_featureGroupIndicators_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ and
_featureGroupIndRel9Add_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability-v9a0_. All the
functionalities defined within the field _featureGroupIndicators_ defined in
Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a are mandatory for the UE (with exceptions for
category M1 and M2 UEs), if the related capability (frequency band, RAT, SR-
VCC or Inter-RAT ANR) is also supported. For a specific indicator, if all
functionalities for a feature group listed in Table B.1-1 have been
implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e.
if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table B.1-1 or
Table B.1-1a, which have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the
indicator as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators that correspond to RATs not supported by the
UE as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in Table B.1-1
or Table B.1-1a, as zero (0).
If the optional fields _featureGroupIndicators_ or _featureGroupIndRel9Add_
are not included by a UE of a future release, the network may assume that all
features pertaining to the RATs supported by the UE, respectively listed in
Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a and deployed in the network, have been implemented
and tested by the UE.
In Table B.1-1, a \'VoLTE capable UE\' corresponds to a UE which is IMS voice
capable and a \'MCPTT capable UE\' corresponds to a UE which supports MCPTT
voice application as defined in TS 23.179 [73].
The indexing in Table B.1-1a starts from index 33, which is the leftmost bit
in the field _featureGroupIndRel9Add_.

different values for FDD and TDD. Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD
serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature for which it
indicates support within the FGI signalling.
**Clarification for mobility from EUTRAN and inter-frequency handover within
EUTRAN**
There are several feature groups related to mobility from E-UTRAN and inter-
frequency handover within EUTRAN. The description of these features is based
on the assumption that we have 5 main \"functions\" related to mobility from
E-UTRAN:
A. Support of measurements and cell reselection procedure in idle mode
B. Support of RRC release with redirection procedure in connected mode
C. Support of Network Assisted Cell Change in connected mode
D. Support of measurements and reporting in connected mode
E. Support of handover procedure in connected mode
All functions can be applied for mobility to Inter-frequency to EUTRAN, GERAN,
UTRAN, CDMA2000 HRPD and CDMA2000 1xRTT except for function C) which is only
applicable for mobility to GERAN. Table B.1-2 below summarises the mobility
functions that are supported based on the UE capability signalling (band
support) and the setting of the feature group support indicators.

In case measurements and reporting function is not supported by UE, the
network may still issue the mobility procedures redirection (B) and CCO (C) in
a blind fashion.
## B.2 CSG support
In this release of the protocol, it is mandatory for the UE to support a
minimum set of CSG functionality consisting of:
\- Identifying whether a cell is CSG or not;
\- Ignoring CSG cells in cell selection/reselection.
Additional CSG functionality in AS, i.e. the requirement to detect and camp on
CSG cells when the \"CSG whitelist\" is available or when manual CSG selection
is triggered by the user, are related to the corresponding NAS features. This
additional AS functionality consists of:
\- Manual CSG selection;
\- Autonomous CSG search;
\- Implicit priority handling for cell reselection with CSG cells.
It is possible that this additional CSG functionality in AS is not supported
or tested in early UE implementations.
Note that since the above AS features relate to idle mode operations, the
capability support is not signalled to the network. For these reasons, no
\"feature group indicator\" is assigned to this feature to indicate early
support in Rel-8.
###### ## Annex C (normative): Release 10 AS feature handling
## C.1 Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in field
_featureGroupIndRel10_.
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the field
_featureGroupIndRel10_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability-v1020-IEs_. All the
functionalities defined within the field _featureGroupIndRel10_ defined in
Table C.1-1 are mandatory for the UE, if the related capability (spatial
multiplexing in UL, PDSCH transmission mode 9, carrier aggregation, handover
to EUTRA, or RAT) is also supported. For a specific indicator, if all
functionalities for a feature group listed in Table C.1-1 have been
implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e.
if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table C.1-1
have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the indicator as zero
(0).
The UE shall set all indicators that correspond to RATs not supported by the
UE as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in Table
C.1-1, as zero (0).
If the optional field _featureGroupIndRel10_ is not included by a UE of a
future release, the network may assume that all features, listed in Table
C.1-1 and deployed in the network, have been implemented and tested by the UE.
The indexing in Table C.1-1 starts from index 101, which is the leftmost bit
in the field _featureGroupIndRel10_.

different values for FDD and TDD. Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD
serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature for which it
indicates support within the FGI signalling.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Descriptive background information
## D.1 Signalling of Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (Multiple FBI)
### D.1.1 Mapping between frequency band indicator and multiple frequency band
indicator
This clause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI)
lists and the E-UTRA frequency bands in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ by means
of an example as shown in Figure D.1.1-1. In this example:
\- E-UTRAN cell belongs to band B90 and also bands B6, B7, B91, and B92.
**\- The _freqBandIndicatorPriority _field is not present in_ __
SystemInformationBlockType1_**.**
\- E-UTRAN uses B64 to indicate the presence of B90 in
_freqBandIndicator-v9e0_.
\- For the MFBI list of this cell, E-UTRAN uses B64 in _MultiBandInfoList_ to
indicate the position and priority of the bands in _MultiBandInfoList-v9e0_.
\- The UE, after reading _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , generates an MFBI
list with priority of B91, B6, B92, and B7. _If the UE supports the frequency
band in the freqBandIndicator-v9e0 IE it applies that frequency band._
Otherwise, the UE applies the first listed band in the MFBI list which it
supports _._

### D.1.2 Mapping between inter-frequency neighbour list and multiple
frequency band indicator
This clause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI)
lists and the E-UTRA frequencies signalled in _SystemInformationBlockType5_ by
means of an example as shown in Figure D.1.2-1. In this example:
\- E-UTRAN includes 4 frequencies (EARFCNs): the bands associated with f1 and
f4 belong to bands lower than 64; the bands associated with f2 and f3 belong
to bands larger than 64. The reserved EARFCN value of 65535 is used to
indicate the presence of _ARFCN-ValueEUTRA-v9e0_.
\- The band associated with f1 has two overlapping bands, B1 and B2 (lower
than 64); the band associated with f2 has one overlapping band, B91; the band
associated with f3 has four overlapping bands B3, B4, B92, and B93; the band
associated with f4 does not have overlapping bands.
\- E-UTRAN includes 4 lists in both _interFreqCarrierFreqList-v8h0_ and
_interFreqCarrierFreqList-v9e0_ and ensure the order of the lists is matching.
Each list corresponds to one EARFCN and contains up to 8 bands. The first list
corresponds to f1, the second list corresponds to f2, and so on. The grey
lists mean not including _MultiBandInfoList_ or _MultiBandInfoList-v9e0_ ,
i.e. the corresponding EARFCN does not have any overlapping frequency bands in
_MultiBandInfoList_ or _MultiBandInfoList-v9e0_.

### D.1.3 Mapping between UTRA FDD frequency list and multiple frequency band
indicator
This clause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI)

###### ## Annex E (normative): TDD/FDD differentiation of FGIs/capabilities in
TDD-FDD CA
Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD
CA shall support a feature/capability for which it indicates support within
the FGI/capability signalling.
A UE that indicates support for TDD/ FDD CA:
\- For the fields for which the UE is allowed to indicate different support
for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature on the PCell and/or
SCell(s), as specified in tables E-1, E-2 and E-3 in accordance to the
following rules:
\- PCell: the UE shall support the feature for the PCell, if the UE indicates
support of the feature for the PCell duplex mode;
\- SCell: the UE shall support the feature for SCell(s), if the UE indicates
support of the feature for the SCell duplex mode;
\- Per serving cell: the UE shall support the feature for a serving cell if
the UE indicates support of the feature for the serving cell\'s duplex mode;
\- All serving cells: UE shall support the feature if the UE indicates support
of the feature for both TDD and FDD duplex modes;
\- For the fields where the UE is not allowed to indicate different support
for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature for PCell and SCell(s) if
the UE indicates support of the feature via the common FGI/capability bit.

###### ## Annex F (normative): UE requirements on ASN.1 comprehension
This clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax
support i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.
A UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ shall comprehend
the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the
first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support
dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features
it does not support.
In case a UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ supports
a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation) additional
requirements apply.
**Cricitical extensions (dedicated signalling)**
If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions
(i.e. case of dedicated signalling), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the
transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature
implemented early. This in particular concerns the ASN.1 parts related to
configuration of the feature. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1
parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).
If configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release X+ N
involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall
support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated
with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented
feature(s), the UE need however not support functionality beyond what is
defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.
Let\'s consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field
_accessStratumRelease_ that supports the features associated with fields A1,
A3 and A5 of _InformationElementA_ (see ASN.1 below). The feature implemented
early is associated with field A5, and can only be configured by the --rX+N
version of _InformationElementA_. In such case, the UE should support
configuration of the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 by the
--rX+N version of _InformationElementA_. If however one of the features was
modified, e.g. the feature associated with _fieldA3_ , E-UTRAN should assume
the UE only supports the feature according to the release it indicated in
field _accessStratumRelease_ (X). I.e. UE is neither required to support the
additional code-point (_n80-vX+N0_) nor the additional sub-field (_fieldA3a_).

}
**Non-cricitical extensions (broadcast signalling)**
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions
in broadcast signalling (i.e. system information), the UE shall comprehend the
parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the
feature implemented early. The SIB(s) containing the release X+ N fields
related to the early implemented features may also include other extensions
concerning releases from X upto X+N. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate
fields (but again is not required to support the functionality associated with
these intermediate fields, in case this concerns optional features not
supported by the UE).
###### ## Annex G (normative): List of CRs Containing Early Implementable
Features and Corrections
This annex lists the Change Requests (CRs) whose changes may be implemented by
a UE of an earlier release than which the CR was approved in (i.e. CRs that
contain on their coversheets the sentence \"Implementation of this CR from
Rel-N will not cause interoperability issues\").
