# 1 Scope
The present document is the Technical Report on TR on V2X new ban combinations
for LTE.
The purpose of the present document is to study the extension of the band
combinations for V2X service to grow the LTE V2X ecosystem. Specially, analyze
the harmonics/IMDs problems on the own Rx frequency bands for daul
transmission. (e.g. transmission of Band 47 on PC5 operation and transmission
of licensed band on Uu operation).
Also RAN4 study on increasing of the number of multi-carrier for LTE-based V2X
service. It can support **concurrent operation of LTE CA band combinations on
Uu interface and Band 47 on PC5 interface. Operator propose new band

# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
**3GPP is now completing the Release 14 work on LTE V2X including RAN4 minimum
requirements and frequency bands for V2X operation. The current specification
considers an initial set of frequency bands for Uu and PC5 interface that we
requested as part of Release 14 work.**
**However, in order to continue to grow the LTE V2X ecosystem, it will be
necessary to extend the frequency bands support by the V2X UE on Uu with
concurrent operation of Band 47 on PC5 in Release 15 and later, and in
addition to include RF requirements for:**
\- LTE Carrier Aggregation on Uu concurrently with PC5 operation
## 4.2 Objective
**The objective of this work item is to specify RAN4 RF requirements for the
following:**
\- Concurrent operation of additional LTE Uu frequency bands and PC5 operation
on Band 47
\- Highest priority, and target for [RAN#76]{.underline} completion, shall be
given to the following combination:
* * *
V2X MCC Band V2X Band Channel bandwidths Interface V2X_20_47 20 5, 10, 15, 20
Uu 47 10, 20 PC5
* * *
\- Other LTE Uu frequency bands are not precluded. For the target completion
date, RAN4 should guaranteed the minimum two RAN4 WG meeting from the starting
for new band combinations.
* * *
V2X inter-band concurrent combination V2X Band Channel bandwidths [MHz]
Interface V2X_34_47 34 5, 10, 15 Uu 47 10, 20 PC5 V2X_5_47 5 5, 10 Uu 47 10,
20 PC5 V2X_28_47 28 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 Uu 47 10, 20 PC5 V2X_71_47 71 5, 10, 15,
20 Uu 47 10, 20 PC5
* * *
\- Concurrent operation of LTE Uu Carrier Aggregation and PC5 operation on
Band 47. Proposed combinations to be proposed during the work item inline with
the CA basket WID approach.
\- Based on agreed work plan (R4-1703287), the total number of carriers of LTE
Uu CA and PC5 operation is restricted up to 3CCs in this WI.
\- E.g. CA_XA-YA (Uu) + 47A (PC5) or XA (Uu) + 47B (PC5)
Newly proposed combinations may be included to this work item at every RAN
plenary, but shall have been proposed at the RAN4 meeting prior to the
corresponding RAN plenary where they are agreed.
Once a band combination is completed, it shall be included in the 3GPP
specifications immediately, and Release independence of that combination shall
be supported from release 14 (same approach as for LTE frequency bands and CA
combinations today).
# 5 Additional UE RF: General part
## 5.1 UE RF requirements
For LTE-based V2X service in Rel-14, RAN4 considered example RF architecture
as shown in Figure 5.1-1.
Figure 5.1-1: Example RF architecture of inter-band con-current operation
without harmonic problems
In rel-14, RAN4 only added V2X band combination without harmonics/IMDs problem
to own V2X received frequency bands based on the agreed WF in rel-14 as below
Agreed WF: For introducing new license bands for V2X operation, RAN4 agreed
the follow phased approach
\- Due to time limitation to complete at March 2017 in rel-14, the phased
approach proposed to add new licensed bands as below
\- 1st phase, Add new licensed bands w/o harmonics/IMD problems into Band 47.
\- So Band 3/7/8/39/41 are added for the new inter-band con-current V2X
operation in V2X WI.
\- 2nd phase, RAN4 study how to solve the harmonics/IMDs problems of multi-
carrier V2X band **combination.**
Hence, RAN4 need to study how to solve the harmonics/IMD problem into the own
receiving frequency bands for inter-band con-current V2X operation.
Table 5.1-1 shows the harmonics and IMDs problem by legacy LTE UL transmission
or dual transmission with licensed band and unlicensed band.

Based on the analysis Table 5.1-1, we summary the coexistence problem to own
V2X Rx bands as below
\- Issue 1: Harmonics problem into Band 47
\- Issue 2: IMD problem into Band 47 ïƒ  Not occurred issues
\- Issue 3: IMD problem into licensed band (Band 21, Band 65)
However, the issue 2 is not occurred for inter-band con-current V2X UE
including Band 47. Since Band 47 could not receive signal during Band 47
sidelink transmission as shown in Figure 5.1-2. Therefore, we can summary two
major problems for inter-band con-current V2X operation to define new V2X band
combinations.
Figure 5.1-2: 3 problems for inter-band con-current V2X operation
### 5.1.1 Candidate solution for self-interference issues
#### 5.1.1.1 Solution1: Harmonics problem on Band 47
The 7^th^ harmonics of Band 20 is would interfere the reception of the Band
47. To analyse the self- desense level, we consider two option as below
\- Option1: Separate Ant. Architecture w/ HTF
\- Option2: Separate Ant. Architecture w/o HTF
The example RF architecture for option1 on V2X_20A-47A UE is shown in Figure
5.1.1.1-1.
{width="4.5in" height="3.7270833333333333in"}
Figure 5.1.1.1-1: Example RF architecture for V2X_20A-47A con-current
operation with harmonic trap filter
The Table 5.1.1.1-1 is the required MSD level for V2X_20A-47A is derived as
below.
Table 5.1.1.1-1: Estimated MSD level at Band 47 (V2X_20A-47A)
* * *
Thermal W/ HTF W/O HTF  
H7 level (dBm) MSD (dB) H7 level (dBm) MSD (dB) Main Path -101 -101.0 3.08
-93.8 8.06 Diversity Path -101 -100.6 3.27 -93.7 8.12 After MRC **0.16**
**5.08**
* * *
From the estimated MSD level at Band 47 by 7^th^ harmonics from Band 20 is
about 0dB when we consider the harmonics trap filter to mitigate the harmonics
products.
Hence we propose as below to solve the harmonics problems into Band 47
\- **Proposal:** For V2X band combination with harmonics problems, RAN4 should
consider the harmonics trap filter to mitigate the harmonic products into Band
47 and protect the safety message.
However, low-order harmonic will be more interfered the reception of the Band
47 such as V2X_1A-47A UE or V2X_47A-65A UE.
The Table 5.1.1.1-2 shows the estimated MSD level for V2X_1A-47A UE as below.
Table 5.1.1.1-2: Estimated MSD level at Band 47 (V2X_1A-47A) in current
satatus
* * *
Thermal W/ HTF W/O HTF  
H3 level (dBm) MSD (dB) H3 level (dBm) MSD (dB) Main Path -101 -81.9 19.2
-74.9 26.2 Diversity Path -101 -81.9 19.2 -74.9 26.2 After MRC **16.2**
**23.2**
* * *
To derive the MSD level, the dominant factor in the RF component parameters
for V2X_1A-47A UE are B1 PA attenuation level to protect Band 47 and PCB
isolation level (PA to B47 LNA).
If PA vendor consider Band 47 as LTE protection band, the B1 PA attenuation
level will be improved, and also the UE vendor should be improved the PCB
isolation level by considering state-of-art technology. Then the required MSD
level can be achieved as 0dB for V2X_1A-47A UE as below Table 5.1.1.1-3.
Table 5.1.1.1-3: Estimated MSD level at Band 47(V2X_1A-47A) in state-of-art
technology
* * *
Thermal W/ HTF W/O HTF  
H3 level (dBm) MSD (dB) H3 level (dBm) MSD (dB) Main Path -101 -100.8 3.18
-90.5 10.98 Diversity Path -101 -100.4 3.37 -90.5 11.01 After MRC **0.26**
**7.98**
* * *
So RAN4 recommend when V2X band combination has low-order harmonic problem, UE
vendor could consider state-of-art technology to increase the Band 1 PA
attenuation level at the frequency range of Band 47. Also need to get the
tight PCB isolation by implementation. Then RAN4 define 0dB MSD in Band 47 for
V2X inter-band concurrent operation UE with low-order harmonic problem.
However, this approach is quite difficult to apply all phone type UE in
current state-of-art technology status. So the alternative solution is that
0dB MSD would be guaranteed when V2X UE transmit the V2X message within
1920\~1950MHz frequency range since 3^rd^ harmonic products do not fall into
the own Band 47 band. However, V2X UE send a message in 1950\~1975MHz, then
the received signal in Band 47 would be desensitized by generated 3^rd^
harmonic products. So RAN4 should define A-MPR requirements to protect V2X
safety messages in Band 47.
Hence we propose as below to solve the harmonics problems into Band 47.
\- **Proposal:** If the MSD level is not guarantee 0dB for V2X band
combination even if use harmonic trap filter, RAN4 shall define two minimum
requirement. One is to guarantee 0dB MSD in a certain TX frequency band since
the generated harmonics products will not impacted to receive the V2X safety
message in Band 47. The other is defining of the A-MPR requirements to protect
the safety message in the harmonic range.
#### 5.1.1.2 Solution2: IMD problem on licensed Bands
The IMD problem into the own receiving Band XX can be raised by dual
transmission from the V2X_21A-47A UE and V2X_47A-65A UE in Table 5.1-1.
The problems on the own licensed Band is quite similar to inter-band CA
combination. So this IMD problem can be easily solved by following dual uplink
CA band combination.
In dual uplink CA, RAN4 define MSD requirements to allow sensitivity
degradation in own receiving frequency band.
Hence, we propose as below to solve the IMD problems into licensed Rx Band.
**\- Proposal:** For V2X band combination with IMD problems by dual
transmission, RAN4 define MSD level to allow sensitivity degradation in own
receiving frequency band.

Based on the harmonics/IMD analysis tables, the 7^th^ harmonics product will
be impact to the own reception of V2X_20A-47A UE. This impact will be studied
to slove the self-interference problems.
The impact on ISM band at 2.4GHz was already covered in 2DL/2UL CA WI in
rel-12 which was solved by in-device coexistence solution such as TDM or FDM
operation between dual uplink in licensed band and reception in unlicensed
band.

### 6.2.3 Coexistence studies
The analysis of harmonics for band 34 and band 47 are listed in table 6.2.3-1
below. As the harmonics of band 47 distribute in the frequency range higher
than 5.9GHz, only the harmonics of band 34 are listed. It can be observed that
no harmonics of band 34 will fall into band 47 as well as other IMT bands,
which means there is no harmonic issue caused by this band combination.

The IMD analysis of band 34 and band 47 are listed in table 6.2.3-2 below.
According to the analysis, the 3rd order IMD products will fall into the UL
band of band 2, and the 5th order IMD products will fall into the DL band of
band 23. However, it should be noted that band 2 and band 23 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Band 34\. Hence, there is no IMD
issue caused by the combination of band 34 and band 47.
