# 4 General
## 4.1 General aspects
The Xw user plane (Xw UP) protocol is located in the User Plane of the Radio
Network layer over the Xw interface.
In LWA option, the Xw UP protocol is used to convey control information
related to the user data flow management of E-RABs. The WT flow control
feedback may support indication of successful transmission towards a UE, or
successful delivery to the UE, as defined in TS 36.300 [2].
In LWIP option, the Xw UP protocol is used to convey control information
related to the user data flow management of each UE. The WT flow control
feedback may support indication of successful transmission towards a UE, as
defined in TS 36.300 [2].
Each Xw UP protocol instance is associated to one E-RAB only.
This version of the present document defines the Xw UP protocol in the context
of LTE-WLAN Aggregation and LWIP option, more specifically, for UE user data
setup for LWIP operation or for Xw user data bearers setup for E-RABs
configured with the LWA bearer option.
If configured, Xw UP protocol instances exist at the eNB and the WT between
which the Xw user data bearers are setup.
In this version of the present document, Xw UP protocol data is conveyed by
GTP-U protocol means, more specifically, by means of the "Xw RAN Container"
GTP-U extension header as defined in TS 29.281 [3].
# 5 Xw user plane protocol
## 5.1 General
The Xw UP protocol layer is using services of the transport network layer in
order to allow flow control of user data packets transferred over the Xw
interface.
## 5.2 Xw user plane protocol layer services
For LWA option, the following functions are provided by the Xw UP protocol:
\- Provision of Xw UP specific sequence number information for user data
transferred from the eNB to the WT for a specific E-RAB configured with the
LWA bearer option;
\- Information of successful transmission towards or in sequence delivery to
the UE of LWA PDUs from WT for user data associated with a specific E-RAB
configured with the LWA bearer option;
\- Information of LWA PDUs that were not transferred towards or not delivered
to the UE;
\- Information of the currently desired buffer size at the WT for transmitting
to the UE user data associated with a specific E-RAB configured with the LWA
bearer option;
\- Information of the currently minimum desired buffer size at the WT for
transmitting to the UE user data associated with all E-RABs configured with
the LWA bearer option.
For LWIP option, the following functions are provided by the Xw UP protocol:
\- Provision of Xw UP specific sequence number information for user data
transferred from the eNB to the WT for a specific UE configured with the LWIP
bearer option;
\- Information of successful transmission towards the UE of LWIP PDUs from WT
for user data of a UE configured with the LWIP bearer option;
\- Information of LWIP PDUs that were not transferred towards the UE;
\- Information of the currently desired buffer size at the WT for transmitting
to the UE user data for a specific UE configured with the LWIP bearer option;
\- Information of the currently minimum desired buffer size at the WT for
transmitting to the UE user data for UEs configured with the LWIP bearer
option.
## 5.3 Services expected from the Xw Transport Network Layer
The Xw user plane protocol layer expects the following services from the
Transport Network Layer:
\- Transfer of user data.
## 5.4 Elementary procedures
### 5.4.1 Transfer of Downlink User Data
#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure is to provide Xw-U
specific sequence number information at the transfer of user data carrying a
DL LWA PDU or DL LWIP PDU from the eNB to the WT via the Xw-U interface.
In LWA option, an Xw user plane instance making use of the Transfer of
Downlink User Data procedure is associated to a single E-RAB only. The
Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure is invoked whenever user data for
that particular E-RAB needs to be sent across the Xw-U interface.
In LWIP option, an Xw user plane instance making use of the Transfer of
Downlink User Data procedure is associated to a single UE only. The Transfer
of Downlink User Data procedure is invoked whenever user data for that
particular UE needs to be sent across the Xw-U interface.
The eNB shall assign consecutive Xw-U sequence numbers to each transferred
Xw-U packet.
The WT shall detect whether an Xw-U packet was lost and memorise the
respective sequence number after it has declared the respective Xw-U packet as
being "lost".
In LWA option, the WT shall transfer the remaining LWA PDUs towards the UE and
memorise the highest Xw-U sequence number of the PDCP PDU that was
successfully transferred towards or delivered to the UE.
NOTE: For LWA option, the Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure and the
associated feedback of lost Xw-U packets assist the eNB in avoiding PDCP HFN
de-synchronisation. If an E-UTRAN deployment decides to not use the Transfer
of Downlink User Data procedure, PDCP HFN synchronization should be ensured by
other means, e.g. UE feedback.
In LWIP option, the WT shall transfer the remaining LWIP PDUs towards the UE
and memorise the highest Xw-U sequence number of the LWIP PDU that was
successfully transferred towards the UE.

#### 5.4.1.2 Unsuccessful operation
Void.
### 5.4.2 Downlink Data Delivery Status
#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure is to provide
feedback from the WT to the eNB to allow the eNB to control the downlink user
data flow via the WT for the respective E-RAB in LWA option or for respective
UE in LWIP option. The WT may also transfer uplink user data for the concerned
E-RAB to the eNB together with a DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame within the same
GTP-U PDU.
When the WT decides to trigger the Feedback for Downlink Data Delivery
procedure it shall report:
a) the highest Xw-U sequence number successfully transferred towards or
delivered to the UE among those PDUs received from the eNB;
b) the desired buffer size in bytes for:
\- for LWA option: the concerned E-RAB;
\- for LWIP option: the concerned UE;
c) the minimum desired buffer size in bytes for the UE;
d) the Xw-U packets that were declared as being "lost" by the WT and have not
yet been reported to the eNB within the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame.
NOTE: If an E-UTRAN deployment has decided not to use the Transfer of Downlink
User Data procedure, d) above is not applicable.
The DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame shall also include an indication whether the
frame is the last DL status report received in the course of releasing a
bearer from the WT. When receiving such indication, if applicable, the eNB
considers that no more UL data is to be expected from the WT.
The eNB, when receiving the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame:
\- regards the desired buffer size under b) and c) above as the amount of data
desired from the WT being declared;
\- for the LWA option: from the Xw-U sequence number reported under a) above
within the same frame, as well as from the most recently reported Xw-U
sequence number(s) of all other E-RABs established for the UE;
\- as the momentary desired buffer sizes, independent of buffer sizes
indicated in the past.
\- is allowed to remove the buffered PDCP or LWIP PDUs according to the
feedback of successfully delivered PDCP or LWIP PDUs;
\- decides upon the actions necessary to take for PDCP or LWIP PDUs reported
other than successfully delivered.
After being reported to the eNB, the WT removes the respective Xw-U sequence
numbers.

## 5.5 Elements for the Xw user plane protocol
### 5.5.1 General
In the present document the structure of frames are specified by using figures
similar to figure 5.5.1-1.
Bits | 
> Number of Octets
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |  |   
Field 1 | Field 2 | 1 | Octet 1 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 3 | Field 4 | 2 | Octet 2 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 4 continue | Spare |  | Octet 3 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 6 | 2 | Octet 4 Octet 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 6 continue | Padding Bits |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Future extension | 0-m |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Padding | 0-3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Figure 5.5.1-1: Example frame format
Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within an
octet have the most significant bit located at the higher bit position
(indicated above frame in figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a field spans
several octets, most significant bits are located in lower numbered octets
(right of frame in figure 5.5.1-1).
On the Xw interface, the frame is transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according to decreasing
bit position (bit position 7 first).
Bits labelled \"Spare\" should be set to "0" by the sender and should not be
checked by the receiver.
The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet aligned (by adding \'Padding Bits\' when needed). The
total size of the frame shall not exceed 1018 octets (see TS 29.281 [3]).
The receiver should be able to remove an additional future extension field
that may be present.
Padding octets may be added at the end of the frame, see Padding in 5.5.3.12.
### 5.5.2 Frame format for the Xw user plane protocol
#### 5.5.2.1 DL USER DATA (PDU Type 0)
This frame format is defined to allow the WT to detect lost Xw-U packets and
is associated with the transfer of a Downlink LWA PDU over the Xw-U interface.
The following shows the respective DL USER DATA frame.
