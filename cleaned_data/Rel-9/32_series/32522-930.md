# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
Self Organizing Networks (SON) Policy Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP,
through which an IRPAgent can communicate management information to one or
several IRPManagers concerning SON policies. The SON policy NRM IRP comprises
a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol neutral Information
Service and one or more Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral SON policy NRM IRP:
Information Service (IS).
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such
as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [11]). However, which
Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.
The present document also contains stage 2 descriptions for those
functionalities for the Self-**Optimization OAM**.

## 4.3 Handover (HO) Parameter Optimization Function
### 4.3.1 Objective and Targets
For intra-LTE, one of the following targets or the combination of the
following targets shall be used. The specific target value shall be configured
by operators. Operators should assign priorities for targets being used. The
first priority target will be tried to achieve by SON entity firstly. The
lower priority targets will be tried to achieve based on precondition that the
higher priority targets have already been achieved.
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Target Name | Definition | Legal Values | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Rate of failures | (the number of | Integer | | related to handover | failure events | | | | related to handover) | [0..100] in unit | | | / (the total number | percentage | | | of handover events) | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
The objective of minimizing the number of unnecessary handovers shall always
be pursued in case the other target/s configured by the operator is/are
achieved. This objective may not need configuration of a target value.
### 4.3.2 Parameters To Be Optimized

### 4.3.3 Optimization Method
#### 4.3.3.1 Problem Detection
HO Parameter Optimization Function shall focus on detecting the problem
scenarios described in 32.521 [5]; namely: too early handovers, too late
handovers and inefficient use of NW resources due to HOs. For more information
about these scenarios see 32.521 [5] section 6.1.3.
The following inputs may be used for the identification of the problem
scenarios:
\- Event capture and analysis
\- UE measurements
\- Performance measurements
In event capture and analysis, the eNodeB exploits event information
associated with a UE context, such as evidence of previous handovers (UE
History, see 36.423 [7]) and HO failure details (such as in which cell the
handover failed and where the UE re-established the connection).
UE measurements are sent within UE measurement reports and they may indicate
whether HOs are too early or too late.
HO-related performance measurements (PMs) collected at the source and / or
target eNB can be useful in detecting HO-related issues on the cell level.
Since the impact of incorrect HO parameter setting will also be on the cell-
level, PMs can provide useful information that can be used to detect and
resolve HO-related issues due to incorrect parameter settings.
#### 4.3.3.2 Problem Solution
HO Parameter Optimization Function will aim at optimizing the HO parameters
listed in Section 4.3.2 in such way to mitigate the problem scenarios
discussed in Section 4.3.3.1. The optimization algorithms will not be
specified. The exact set of HO parameters that may be adjusted by the
algorithms is dictated by the choice of triggered HO measurements made by the
RRM entity in an eNodeB.
### 4.3.4 Architecture
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition of Logical Functions
**HO Parameter Optimization Monitor Function:** This function is used for
monitoring the handover parameter optimization (e.g. monitoring related
performance counters or alarms).
**HO Parameter Optimization Policy Control Function:** This function is used
for configuring the handover parameter optimization policies.
#### 4.3.4.2 Location of Logical Functions
For handover parameter optimization, the SON algorithm is located in eNB. The
detailed SON functionalities in eNB are out of scope of this specification.
### 4.3.5 PM
IRPManager shall collect HO-related performance measurements from the source
and / or target eNB which can be useful in detecting HO-related issues on the
cell level. The following input can be used for the identification of the
problem scenarios specified:
The number of RLF event happened within a interval after handover success
Performance Measurements related to handover failure are captured in the table
below.
The Performance Measurements are for outgoing handovers. Further, they should
be available on a cell relation basis.
* * *
Performance measurement name Description Related targets Number of handover
events Includes successful handovers plus all identified failures Rate of
failures related to handover Number of HO failures All failure cases Rate of
failures related to handover Number of too early HO failures Too early HO
failure cases Rate of failures related to handover Number of too late HO
failures Too late HO failure cases Rate of failures related to handover Number
of HO failures to wrong cell HO failures to wrong cell Rate of failures
related to handover

### 5.3.1 SONTargets
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
This IOC represents targets for SON functions and their relative priorities.
Currently targets for Handover parameter optimization and Load Balancing
optimization are defined. Targets for other SON functions like Energy Saving,
Coverage and Capacity optimization, RACH optimization etc. are FFS.
Target hierarchy rule:
> An NRM IOC instance X may name-contain an IOC SONTargets instance T. The
> rule states that:
  * If X name-contains a SONTargets instance T, then T is applicable to X.
  * If X and all its superior instances do not name-contain any SONTargets instance, then no SONTargets instance is applicable to X.
  * If X does not name-contain any SONTargets instance, but one or more of X's superior instances name-contain a SONTargets instance, then the SONTargets instance of the superior intance closest to X, in X's naming tree, is applicable to X.
