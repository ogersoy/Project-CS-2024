Point (IRP): Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Solution Set (SS)
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as a single action on a NE of the 3G network or
as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many NEs.
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of Integration Reference Points
(IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which realise the functional
capabilities over this interface. The basic structure of the IRPs is defined
in 3GPP TS 32.101 [5] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].
Network Elements (NEs) under management and element managers generate
notifications of events about occurrences within the network. Different kinds
of events carry different kinds of information. For instance a new alarm as
specified in Alarm IRP: Information Service [1], is one possible kind of
event, an object creation as specified in Basic CM IRP: Information Service
[8] is another possible kind of event.
Information of an event is carried in notification. An IRPAgent (typically an
EM or a NE) emits notifications. IRPManager (typically a network management
system) receives notifications. The purpose of Notification IRP is to define
an interface through which an IRPManager can subscribe to IRPAgent for
receiving notifications.
This IRP bases its design on work captured in ITU-T Recommendation X.734 [2],
OMG Notification Service [4]. The central design ideas are:
  * Separation of notification Consumers (IRPManagers) from Producers > (IRPAgents);
  * Notifications are sent to IRPManagers without the need for > IRPManagers to periodically check for new notifications.
Common characteristics related to notifications in all other IRPs are gathered
in one IRP.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Common Object Request Broker Architecture
(CORBA) Solution Set (SS) for the IRP whose semantics is specified in
Notification IRP: Information Service (3GPP TS 32.302 [5]).
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.302.

# 4 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of Notification IRP is specified in 3GPP TS
32.302 [5]. This clause specifies features that are specific to the CORBA
Solution Set (SS).
## 4.1 Notification services
In the CORBA Solution Set, notifications are emitted by IRPAgent using CORBA
Notification service (OMG TC Document telecom [2]) and Structured Events.
CORBA Event service (OMG CORBA services [3]) provides event routing and
distribution capabilities. CORBA Notification service provides, in addition to
Event service, event filtering and support for Quality of Service (QoS) as
well.
A subset of CORBA Notification services shall be used to support the
implementation of notification. This CORBA Notification service subset, in
terms of OMG Notification service (OMG TC Document telecom [2]) defined
methods, is identified in the present.
### 4.1.1 Support of Push and Pull Interface
The IRPAgent shall support the OMG Notification push interface model.
Additionally, it may support the OMG Notification pull interface model as
well.
### 4.1.2 Support of multiple notifications in one push operation
For efficiency, IRPAgent uses the following OMG Notification Service (OMG TC
Document telecom [2]) defined interface to pack multiple notifications and
push them to IRPManager using one method push_structured_events. The method
takes as input a parameter of type EventBatch as defined in the OMG
CosNotification module (OMG TC Document telecom [2]). This data type is a
sequence of Structured Events (see clause 4). Upon invocation, this parameter
will contain a sequence of Structured Events being delivered to IRPManager by
IRPAgent to which it is connected.
The maximum number of events that will be transmitted within a single
invocation of this operation is controlled by IRPAgent wide configuration
parameter. The amount of time IRPAgent will accumulate individual events into
the sequence before invoking this operation is controlled by IRPAgent wide
configuration parameter as well.
IRPAgent may push EventBatch with only one Structured Event.
The OMG Notification service (OMG TC Document telecom [2]) defined IDL module
is shown below.
module CosNotifyComm {
> ...
>
> Interface SequencePushConsumer : NotifyPublish {
>
> void push_structured_events(
>
> in CosNotification::EventBatch notifications)
>
> raises( CosEventComm::Disconnected);
>
> ...
>
> }; // SequencePushConsumer
...
}; // CosNotifyComm
### 4.1.3 Support of filterable and non-filterable notification parameters
The OMG Notification service defined IDL CosNotification::StructuredEvent and
CosNotification::EventBatch data types are shown below.
struct StructuredEvent {\ EventHeader header;\ FilterableEventBody
filterable_data;\ any remainder_of_body;\ }; // StructuredEvent
typedef sequence\ EventBatch;
Notification IS parameters are mapped:
\- either to the Structured Event header, i.e. above IDL StructuredEvent data
structure field header;
\- or to the Structured Event body, and in this case:
\- when defined in the IS as filterable, to the Structured Event filterable
body fields, i.e. above IDL StructuredEvent data structure field
filterable_data;
\- when defined in the IS as non-filterable, to the Structured Event remaining
body, i.e. above IDL StructuredEvent data structure field remainder_of_body.
The OMG Notification service defined IDL CosNotification::FilterableEventBody
data type and its supporting types are shown below.
struct Property {\ PropertyName name;\ PropertyValue value;\ };
typedef sequence\ PropertySeq;
typedef PropertySeq FilterableEventBody;
In order to ensure uniform implementation for notification IS parameters
mapped to Structured Event Name-Value pairs whether defined in the IS as
filterable or as non-filterable, IDL StructuredEvent data structure field
remainder_of_body of type any shall be mapped to the IDL data structure
NotificationIRPNotifications::NonFilterableEventBody defined in annex clause
A.5:
struct NonFilterableEventBody {\ CosNotification::PropertySeq
name_value_pairs;\ any remainder_of_non_filterable_body;\ };
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 Operation mapping
Notification IRP: IS (3GPP TS 32.302 [5]) defines semantics of operations
visible across this IRP. These operations are the operations of the IOCs
defined in 3GPP TS 32.302 [5].
Table 1 maps the operations defined in Notification IRP: IS (3GPP TS 32.302
[5]) to their equivalents (methods) in this Solution Set (SS). Specifically,
the table 1 maps the operations of the IOCs defined in 3GPP TS 32.302 [5] to
their equivalents in this SS. Since one of the IOCs, the NotificationIRP IOC,
inherits from the ManagedGenericIRP IOC [4], the table 1 also maps the
operations of ManagedGenericIRP IOC to their equivalents (methods) in this SS.
Table 1 also qualifies if a method is Mandatory (M) or Optional (O).
Table 1: Mapping from IS Operation to SS Equivalents

The | | | | IDL specification of | | | | this method is not | | | | included in annex A. | | | | If IRPAgent supports | | | | the optional | | | | attach_push_b | | | | method, it shall | | | | support this method | | | | as mandatory. | | | | | | | | If subscription is | | | | established using | | | | attach_pull method, | | | | the SS equivalent | | | | shall be | | | | modify_constraints. | | | | The method is | | | | defined by OMG | | | | Notification Service | | | | Filter Interface | | | | (OMG TC Document | | | | telecom [2]).

The | | | | IDL specification of | | | | this method is not | | | | included in annex A. | | | | If IRPAgent supports | | | | the optional | | | | attach_push_b | | | | method, it shall | | | | support this method | | | | as mandatory. | | | | | | | | If subscription is | | | | established using | | | | attach_pull, there | | | | is no SS equivalent. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | resumeSubscription | If subscription is | See box on the left. | | | established using | | | | attach_push, there | | | | is no SS equivalent. | | | | In other words, | | | | IRPManager cannot | | | | resume subscription. | | | | | | | | If subscription is | | | | established using | | | | attach_push_b, the | | | | SS equivalent shall | | | | be | | | | resume_connection. | | | | This method is | | | | defined by OMG | | | | Notification Service | | | | (OMG TC Document | | | | telecom [2]).

## 5.2 Operation parameter mapping
3GPP TS 32.302 [5] defines semantics of parameters carried in operations
across the Notification IRP. Table 2 through table 14 indicate the mapping of
these parameters, as per operation, to their equivalents defined in this SS.

IRPManager | | | | stores the s1. IRPManager | | | | sends s1 as input | | | | parameter of attach_push | | | | to IRPAgent. IRPAgent | | | | receives s1, performs | | | | CORBA | | | | ::ORB::string_to_object | | | | to obtain the | | | | IRPManager\'s IOR and | | | | uses it for its future | | | | methods. IRPAgent also | | | | stores the s1 for future | | | | comparisons. IRPManager | | | | later calls detach with | | | | s1. IRPAgent receives the | | | | stringified IOR s1, | | | | compares it with those | | | | stored stringified IORs | | | | (e.g. s1), finds a match, | | | | and performs the detach | | | | process.

## 5.3 Notification parameter mapping
Notification IRP: IS (3GPP TS 32.302 [5]) defines the semantics of common
attributes carried in notifications. This SS does not provide the mapping of
these attributes to their CORBA SS equivalents. Other IRPs such as Alarm IRP:
IS (3GPP TS 32.111-2 [6]) identify and qualify these common attributes for use
in their environment. Their corresponding SS documents define the mapping of
these attributes to their SS equivalents.
# 6 IRPAgent\'s Behaviour
This clause describes some IRPAgent\'s behaviour not captured by IDL.
## 6.1 Subscription
IRPManager can invoke multiple attach_push, multiple attach_push_b or multiple
attach_pull using different manager_reference(s). As far as IRPAgent is
concerned, the IRPAgent will emit notifications to multiple \"places\" with
their independent filter requirements. IRPAgent will not know if the
notifications are going to the same IRPManager.
If IRPManager invokes multiple attach_push, attach_push_b or attach_pull using
the same manager_reference and with an already subscribed
notification_category, IRPAgent shall raise AlreadySubscribed exception to all
invocations except one.
IRPManager can invoke multiple attach_push using the same manager_reference
and with one or more not-yet-subscribed notification_categories. In this case,
if IRPAgent supports all the notification categories requested, IRPAgent shall
accept the invocation; otherwise, it raises
AtLeastOneNotificationCategoryNotSupported exception. IRPAgent shall have
similar behaviour for attach_push_b and attach_pull.
When IRPManager is in subscription by invoking attach_push, IRPManager can
change the filter constraint, using change_subscription_filter, applicable to
the notification categories specified in the attach_push.
When IRPManager is in subscription by invoking attach_push_b, IRPManager can
change the filter constraint during subscription using the OMG defined
Notification Service Filter Interface. IRPManager shall not use
change_subscription_filter; otherwise it shall get an exception.
## 6.2 IRPAgent supports multiple categories of Notifications
IRPAgent may emit multiple categories of Notifications. IRPAgent may have
mechanism for IRPManager to pull for notifications of multiple categories.
IRPManager can query IRPAgent about the categories of notifications supported
by using get_notification_categories.
IRPManager uses a parameter, notification_categories, in attach_push,
attach_push_b and attach_pull to specify one or more categories of
notifications wanted.
IRPManager uses a zero-length sequence in notification_categories of
attach_push, attach_push_b and attach_pull to specify that all IRPAgent
supported categories of notifications are wanted. If IRPManager uses
attach_push with zero-length sequence in notification_categories and if the
operation is successful, IRPAgent shall reject subsequent attach_push
operation, regardless if the notification_categories contains a zero-length
sequence or one or more specific notification categories. IRPAgent shall have
similar behaviour for attach_push_b and attach_pull.
## 6.3 IRPAgent\'s integrity risk of attach_push_b Method
In the case that IRPAgent implements this method by extending or using OMG
compliant Notification Service, the following IRPManager behaviour illustrates
a risk to IRPAgent\'s integrity.
Given the object reference (IOR) of the SequenceProxyPushSupplier (as the
mandatory output parameter of the subject method), IRPManager can invoke
SequenceProxyPushSupplier.MyAdmin method.
IRPManager can then obtain the consumer admin object of the proxy. Then
IRPManager can invoke ConsumerAdmin.MyChannel to get the IOR of the
Notification Channel. IRPManager then can call EventChannel.MyFactory which
will provide IRPManager the IOR of the EventChannelFactory itself. IRPManager
can then able to invoke methods directly on the EventChannelFactory, like
get_all_channels which lists all channel numbers and create_channel which
allows IRPManager to create any number of additional channels.
A malicious IRPManager can, given access to the EventChannelFactory, get a
list of existing channels and start connecting them together at random thus
compromising the IRPAgent\'s integrity. Deployment of this attach_push_b needs
strong authentication and authorisation mechanism in place.
The attach_push is mandatory. IRPAgent compliant to this IRP shall support it.
The attach_push_b is optional. It is recommended that IRPAgent concerned with
integrity risk should not support the attach_push_b option.
## 6.4 Quality of Service Parameters
The OMG Notification Service [2] supports a variety of Quality of Service
(QoS) properties, such as reliability and priority, that may be expressed to
indicate the delivery characteristics of notifications. The following OMG
Notification Service QoS parameter settings shall be required when the
IRPAgent uses the OMG Notification Service to support this SS:
1\. The order policy shall be set to FifoOrder (First-in, First-out) [2].
2\. The message priority shall be set to 0, i.e. no priority [2].
3\. The Start Time Supported shall be set to false, i.e. do not use Start Time
[2].
4\. The Stop Time Supported shall be set to false, i.e. do not use Stop Time
[2].
When the OMG Notification Service is not used, the IRPAgent shall provide
First-in, First-out notification ordering, not provide message priority and
not provide the support of Start Time and Stop Time.
