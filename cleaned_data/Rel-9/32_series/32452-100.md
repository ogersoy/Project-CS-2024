The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor HNS.
During the lifetime of HNS, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see
3GPP TS 32.600 [1].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of HNS require data on which to base decisions. This data refers to
the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In order to
produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs, which
comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external system,
e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further evaluation. The
purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms involved in the
collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 [2] helps in the definition of new performance
measurements that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and
inclusion in the present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down
performance measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-
user of performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for Home Node B subsystem
(HNS).\ HNS [3] is consists of a HNB and HNB-GW. And, it appears as an RNS to
the core network and is connected by means of the Iu-CS interface to the MSC
and by means of the Iu-PS interface to the SGSN.\ TS 32.401 [4] describes
Performance Management concepts and requirements.\ The present document is
valid for all measurement types provided by an implementation of a HNS.\ Only
measurement types that are specific to HNS are defined within the present
documents. Vendor specific measurement types used in HNS are not covered.
Instead, these could be applied according to manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to HNB and HNB GW);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. HNB registration measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.

# 4 Functionality related measurements
The measurements defined in this clause are related to the functionality
aspect performance. The detailed measurements for each function are defined in
the following subclauses.
  1. Measurements related to HNB-GW \------------------------------
    1. ### UE registration/de-registration related measurements
      1. #### Overview
The UE Registration procedure provides means for the HNB to convey UE
identification data to the HNB-GW in order to perform access control for the
UE in the HNB-GW. The UE Registration also establishes a UE specific context
identifier to be used between HNB and HNB-GW. The procedure triggered when the
UE attempts to access the HNB via an initial NAS message and there is no
context in the HNB allocated for that UE. The successful UE registration rate
thus poses an important impact on the QoE which accessing the HNB networks
from a macro view on the OA&M basis.
The de-registration procedure may be originated by either HNB or HNB GW.

    1.  Measurements related to HNB
        ---------------------------
# 5 Equipment related measurements
The measurements defined in this subclause are related to the equipment aspect
performance. The measurements defined in the following subclauses are common
for all of the equipments in HNS and shall be applied to all of the network
elements in HNS. TS 23.060 [3] has specified Home Node B subsystem. Therefore,
equipments related measurements should be performed on HNB and HNB-GW.
## 5.1 Equipment measurements for HNB
## 5.2 Equipment measurements for HNB-GW
###### ## Annex A: Use cases for performance measurements definition
This annex provides the concrete use cases for the HNS performance
measurements defined in clause 4.
# A.1 Use case of registration and de-registration measurements
UE registration is one of most important step to start delivering services by
the HNS to users.
The success or failure of a registration directly impacts the quality level
for delivering the service by the networks, and also user's experience. So the
success or failure of registration needs be monitored, this can be achieved by
the calculation of registration setup success rate which gives a direct view
to evaluate the user's access to the network and analyze the specific reason
causing the failure in order to find out the problem and ascertain the
solutions.
In addition, de-registration is another sort of indicator to guarantee user
QoS level. In the case of radio resource and transport resource shortage, HNB
or HNB-GW could initiates a de-registration requests. The collections of de-
registration would help to evaluate network deployment states. Depending on
these parameters meaning, network optimizations could be implemented. This can
be achieved by identifying the specific reason and splitting into sub-
subcounters per cause. These parameters give a direct view to evaluate network
states.
# A.2 Use case of the SCTP signalling measurements
In order to avoid the overload of HNB-GW, SCTP signaling measurements data
will be combined with HNB-GW user plane measurement data to reflect load
status on HNB-GW.
In addition, the ratio of signaling to data bandwidth usage is very useful to
monitor some abnormal events, such as if the ratio of them is too high, some
unusual events are possible happened. Therefore, the operator could analyze
whether some problems exist in the network or not, and may find out root-
causes leaded to the bad conditions, finally resolve the problems.
# A.3 Use case of HNB registration and de-registration measurements
HNB registration and de-registration are most important step to start or cease
delivering services by the networks to users.
The successful and failed HNB registration rate can reflect Iuh link status
between HNB and HNB-GW. It could be used to evaluate an operational quality
for operators. Especially, HNB uses a leased backhaul to connect to HNB-GW. A
successful HNB registration rate could be treated as a key performance
indicator to offer to users who signed SLA with operators. A failed HNB
registration could be aroused by several causes, such network congestion,
blacklisted HNB, unauthorized HNB location, etc. The monitor of failed reason
could facilitate trouble-shooting. Operator can determine root-causes
depending on the feedback. In addition, an operational optimization can be
performed in the specific area, where HNBs using similar LAC are often failed
to get service.
HNB-GW originated de-registration will be performed whenever HNB-GW needs to
terminate operations with an HNB. The specific causes can be extracted from
the signalling HNB DE-REGISTER, such as overload and unspecified. In the case
of overload, it can accurately reflect HNB-GW load status. And, operators
could implement further measures to avoid potential failures when specific
HNB-GW often initiates de-registration process with the cause of overload.
# A.4 Use case of HNB-GW user plane measurements
HNB-GW user plane related measurements are used to measure data volume on Iuh
interface including incoming and outgoing of data packets and octets for RTP
and GTP-U.
Based on that, the measurements are useful to analyze data volumes and
velocity from HNB-GW point-of-view. If the data volume is too high, more
interface bandwidth should be deployed, or HNB-GW load balance should be
considered. If data velocity is too high, the packet forwarding capacity of
HNB-GW should be enhanced to avoid data congestion.
In addition, differentiating user plane statistics on PS and CS domain can
allow operators to monitor respective data volume for different service type.
Furthermore, it can also reflect the load status on Iucs and Iups interfaces,
on which performance evaluations will benefit from distinguished data stream
monitoring
Finally, HNB-GW user plane related measurements could be together with other
performance measurements to analyze network performance to find out the
abnormal events.
