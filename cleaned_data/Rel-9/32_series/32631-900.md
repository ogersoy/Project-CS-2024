# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; Configuration Management (CM); as identified
below:
**32.631: \"Core network resources Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements\"**
32.632: \"**Core network resources Integration Reference Point (IRP); Network
Resource Model (NRM)\"**
32.633: \"Core network resources Integration Reference Point (IRP); Common
Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\"
32.635: \"Core network resources Integration Reference Point (IRP); Bulk CM
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format definition\"
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Data:** is any information or set of information required to give software
or equipment or combinations thereof a specific state of functionality.
**Element Manager (EM):** provides a package of end-user functions for
management of a set of closely related types of Network Elements (NEs). These
functions can be divided into two main categories:
  * _Element Management Functions_ for management of NEs on an individual basis. These are basically the same functions as supported by the corresponding local terminals.
  * _Sub-Network Management Functions_ that are related to a network model for a set of NEs constituting a clearly defined sub-network, which may include relations between the NEs. This model enables additional functions on the sub-network level (typically in the areas of network topology presentation, alarm correlation, service impact analysis and circuit provisioning).
**Integration Reference Point (IRP):** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [6].
**Information Service (IS):** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [6].
**Solution Set (SS):** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [6].
**IRP Solution Set:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**Managed Object (MO):** an abstract entity, which may be accessed through an
open interface between two or more systems, and representing a Network
Resource (NR) for the purpose of management. The Managed Object (MO) is an
instance of a Managed Object Class (MOC) as defined in a Management
Information Model (MIM). The MIM does not define how the MO or NR is
implemented; only what can be seen in the interface.
**Managed Object Class (MOC):** a description of all the common
characteristics for a number of MOs, such as their attributes, operations,
notifications and behaviour.
**Management Information Model (MIM)** : also referred to as NRM -- see the
definition below. There is a slight difference between the meaning of MIM and
NRM -- the term MIM is generic and can be used to denote any type of
management model, while NRM denotes the model of the actual managed
telecommunications Network Resources (NRs).
**Network Element (NE):** is a discrete telecommunications entity, which can
be, managed over a specific interface e.g. the RNC.
**Network Manager (NM)** : provides a package of end-user functions with the
responsibility for the management of a network, mainly as supported by the
EM(s) but it may also involve direct access to the NEs. All communication with
the network is based on open and well-standardised interfaces supporting
management of multi-vendor and multi-technology NEs.
**Network Resource (NR):** is a component of a NE, which can be identified as
a discrete separate entity and is in an object oriented environment for the
purpose of management represented by an abstract entity called Managed Object
(MO).
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : a model representing the actual managed
telecommunications Network Resources (NRs) that a System is providing through
the subject IRP. An NRM describes Managed Object Classes (MOC), their
associations, attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as
\"MIM\" (see above) which originates from the ITU-T TMN.
**Object Management Group (OMG):** see http://www.omg.org.
**Operations System (OS):** indicates a generic management system, independent
of its location level within the management hierarchy.

# 4 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
A. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
B. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].

  2. The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall provide support for enabling consistency between UTRAN/GERAN and CN parameters, e.g. by defining relevant attributes.
