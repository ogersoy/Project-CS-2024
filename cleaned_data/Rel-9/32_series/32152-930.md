# 1 Scope
3GPP has chosen UML to capture systems behaviour in the IRP IS context.
UML provides a rich set of concepts, notations and model elements to model
distributive systems. Usage of all UML notations and model elements is not
necessary for the purpose of IRP IS specifications. This TS documents the
necessary and sufficient set of UML notations and model elements, including
the ones built by the UML extension mechanism \>, for use by
3GPP IRP IS authors. Collectively, this set of notations and model elements is
called the 3GPP IRP IS modelling repertoire.
The selection of the UML notations and model elements in this repertoire is
based on the needs of the existing 3GPP IRP IS specifications. Future IRP IS
releases may require the use of additional UML notations or model elements.
IRP IS specifications shall employ the UML notation and model elements of this
repertoire and may also employ other UML notation and model elements
considered necessary. However, before any other UML notation and model
elements may be employed in an approved 3GPP IRP specification, the other
notation and model elements should be agreed for inclusion first in this
repertoire.

# 4 Requirements
IRPAgent can be characterized by several different but related models. The
models can be exterior or interior to the IRPAgent. Exterior models are use
case models and interior models are object models.
Current version of this TS focuses on the interior model aspects of IRPAgents.
The notation elements captured in this repertoire shall be used to model all
aspects of NRM IRP IS (such as GERAN NRM IRP: IS) and (interface) IRP (such as
Alarm IRP: IS).
All quotes are from [5].
Capitalized words are defined by various 3GPP IRP IS specifications or the
reference [5].
# 5 Model Elements and Notations
## 5.1 Basic model elements
UML defined a number of basic model elements. This subclause lists the
selected subset for use in the repertoire. The semantics of the selected ones
are defined in [5].
### 5.1.1 attribute
See subclause 3.25 of [5].
This sample shows someattributes, listed as strings in the attribute
compartment of the class AlarmInformation.
{width="1.3465277777777778in" height="1.4333333333333333in"}
### 5.1.2 aggregation
See subclause 3.43.2.5 of [5].
This sample shows a hollow diamond attached to the end of a path to indicate
aggregation. The diamond is attached to the class that is the aggregate.
{width="5.106944444444444in" height="0.6777777777777778in"}
### 5.1.3 operation
See subclause 3.26 of [5].
This sample shows two operations, shown as strings in the operation
compartment of class NotificationIRPManagement, that the instance of
NotificationIRPManagement may be requested to perform. The operation has a
name, e.g. subscribe and a list of arguments (not shown).
{width="2.0395833333333333in" height="1.0666666666666667in"}
### 5.1.4 association and association name
See subclause 3.41 of [5].
These two samples show a binary association between exactly two model
elements. The association can include the possibility of relating a model
element to itself. The first sample shows a bi-directional association in that
each model element is aware of the other. The second sample shows a
unidirectional association (shown with an open arrow at the target model
element end) in that only the source model element is aware of the target
model element and not vice-versa.
Association can be named, such as _abcd_ and _label6_ in the following
samples.
{width="5.613194444444445in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
{width="5.626388888888889in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
### 5.1.5 realization relationship
See subclause 2.5.2.1 of [5].
This sample shows the realization relationship between a source model element,
AlarmIRP, and a target model element, AlarmIRPOperations_1. The source model
element implements the target model element. The target model element needs to
be an \>.
{width="5.222916666666666in" height="1.0666666666666667in"}
### 5.1.6 generalization relationship
See subclause 3.50 of [5].
This sample shows a generalization relationship between a more general element
(the **IRPAgent**) and a more specific element (the IRPAgent_vendor_A) that is
fully consistent with the first element and that adds additional information.
{width="5.1402777777777775in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
### 5.1.7 dependency relationship
See subclause 3.51 of [5].
This sample shows that BClass instances have a semantic relationship with
AClass instances. It indicates a situation in which a change to the target
element will require a change to the source element in the dependency.
{width="5.770138888888889in" height="0.6805555555555556in"}
### 5.1.8 note
See subclause 3.11 of [5].
This sample shows a note, as a rectangle with a \"bent corner\" in the upper
right corner. The note contains arbitrary text. It appears on a particular
diagram and may be attached to zero or more modelling elements by dashed
lines.
{width="4.403472222222222in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
### 5.1.9 multiplicity, a.k.a. cardinality
See subclause 3.44 of [5].
This sample shows a multiplicity attached to the end of an association path.
The meaning of this multiplicity is that one to many. Network instance(s) is
associated with zero, one or more SubNetwork instances.
In Release 7 and earlier versions, the cardinality zero can indicate that the
IOC has the so-called "transient state" characteristic. For example, it
indicates that the instance is not yet created but it is in the process of
being created. In Release 8 and onwards, the cardinality zero will not be used
to indicate this characteristic since such characteristic is considered
inherent in all IOCs. In Release 8 and onwards, all IOCs defined are
considered to have such inherent "transient state" characteristics.
{width="5.073611111111111in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
### 5.1.10 Rolename
See subclause 3.43.2.6 of [5].
This sample shows a Person (say instance John) is associated with a Company
(say whose DN is "Company=XYZ"). We navigate the association by using the
opposite association-end such that John's Person.theCompany would hold the DN,
i.e.\"Company=XYZ\". Use noun for the rolename.
{width="5.733333333333333in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
## 5.2 Stereotype
This subclause lists all allowable stereotypes to be used in IRP IS
specifications. One stereotype \> is defined in [5]. This
document lists it out for ease of reference and completness. Other stereotypes
are defined in this document.

### 5.2.1 \>
Subclause 2.5.2.25 of [5]:
\"An interface is a named set of operations that characterize the behaviour of
an element. In the metamodel, an Interface contains a set of Operations that
together define a service offered by a Classifier realizing the Interface. A
Classifier may offer several services, which means that it may realize several
Interfaces, and several Classifiers may realize the same Interface.
Interfaces may not have Attributes, Associations, or Methods. An Interface may
participate in an Association provided the Interface cannot see the
Association; that is, a Classifier (other than an Interface) may have an
Association to an Interface that is navigable from the Classifier but not from
the Interface.\"
Subclause 2.5.4.6 of [5]: \"The purpose of an interface is to collect a set of
operations that constitute a coherent service offered by classifiers.
Interfaces provided a way to partition and characterize groups of operations.
An interface is only a collection of operations with a name. It cannot be
directly instantiated. Instantiable classifiers, such as class or use case,
may use interfaces for specifying different services offered by their
instances. Several classifiers may realize the same interface. All of them
must contain at least the operations matching those contained in the
interface. The specification of an operation contains the signature of the
operation (i.e. its name, the types of the parameters and the return type). An
interface does not imply any internal structure of the realizing classifier.
For example, it does not include which algorithm to use for realizing an
operation.\"
An operation may, however, include a specification of the effects [e.g. with
pre and post-conditions] of its invocation.
#### 5.2.1.1 Sample
This sample shows an AlarmIRPOperations_1 \> that has two
operations. The input and output parameters of the operations are hidden (i.e.
not shown). The AlarmIRP has a unidirectional mandatory realization
relationship with the \>.

### 5.2.3 \>
It is a form or template representing a number of

operations), and interactions that are present in the represented

The semantics of a \> is that all behaviour of the

Since this class is simply a representation of other classes, this class
cannot define its own behaviour other than those already defined by the
represented \>.
A particular \> can be represented by zero, one or
more \> or \>. For example, the ManagedElement
\> can have MonitoredEntity \> and
ManagedEntity \>.
The attributes of the \> are accessible by the source entity
that has an association with the \>.
#### 5.2.3.1 Sample
This shows a \> named MonitoredEntity. It represents all NRM

whose instances are being monitored for alarm conditions.
Note that \> does not define any attribute. The attributes

### 5.2.4 \>
It is a form or template representing common class properties (e.g.
attributes, links, operations and interactions) of a number of represented

The semantics of an \> is that all attributes, links operations
and interactions encapsulated by the \> may or may not be present
in the represented \>. The \>
represents a placeholder class that is most useful in technology neutral
analysis models that will require further specification and/or mapping within
a more complete construction model.
#### 5.2.4.1 Sample
This shows an \> StateManagement. It also shows an
\> IRPAgent that depends on this StateManagement.
Note that the StateManagement has defined a number of attributes (not shown in
the UML diagram).
The classes that depend on this StateManagement may or may not use all of the
StateManagement attributes. In other words, at least one of the attributes of
StateManagement is present in the IRPAgent. The precise set of StateManagement
attributes used by the IRPAgent is specified in specification that defines the
IRPAgent.

### 5.2.5 \>
It is the descriptor for a set of network resources and network management
capabilities. Each \> represents a set of instances
with similar structure, behaviour and relationships.
This \> and other information classes such as
\> are mapped into technology specific model elements. The
mapping of IS modelling constructs to technology specific modelling constructs
are captured in the corresponding IRP Solution Set specifications.
The name of an \> has scope within the 3GPP IRP IS
document in which it is specified and the name must be unique among all
\> names within that 3GPP IRP IS document. The IRP
IS document name is considered in the similar way as the UML Package-name.
The \> is identical to UML _class_ except that it
does not include/define methods or operations.
Subclause 3.22.1 of [5]: \"A _class_ represents a concept within the system
being modelled. Classes have data structure and behaviour and relationships to
other elements.\"

### 5.2.8 Void
### 5.2.9 \>
It specifies a unidirectional composition. The target instance is uniquely
identifiable, within the namespace of the source entity, among all other
targeted instances of the same target classifier and among other targeted
instances of other classifiers that have the same \> composition with
the source.
The source classifier and target classifier shall both have a naming
attribute.
Composition used as the act of name containment provides a semantic of a
whole-part relationship between the domain and the named elements that are
contained, even if only by name. From the management perspective access to the
part is through the whole. Multiplicity shall be indicated at both ends of the
relationship.
A target instance can not have multiple \> with multiple sources,
i.e. a target instance can not participate in or belong to multiple
namespaces.
#### 5.2.9.1 Sample
This shows that all instances of MscFunction are uniquely identifiable within
a ManagedElement instance\'s namespace.

### 5.2.10 \>
The \> (alternatively \>) enables the indication of
optionality of attributes, parameters and operations (respectively) within the
UML diagrams. The semantics of optionality are defined in TS 32.150 [3].
In the absence of the stereotype, the attribute, parameter, or operation in
question is mandatory.

### 5.2.12 \>
This is a unidirectional association. The source passes network management
information to target. The source and target are entities or processes running
in different IRP instances such as AlarmIRP, PMIRP. The instances may be name-
contained by the same IRPAgent or different IRPAgent instances. The precise
network management information passed and the information transfer mechanism
are not standardized and are vendor-specific.
#### 5.2.12.1 Sample
This shows that NLIRP (NotificationLog IRP) can pass some network management
information to FTIRP.

## 5.3 Void
## 5.4 Association classes
Subclause 3.46 of OMG: \"Unified Modelling Language Specification, Version
1.51\" [5] http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/uml.htmd defines an
association class as
> \"An association class is an association that also has class properties (or
> a class that has association properties).\ Even though it is drawn as an
> association and a class, it is really just a single model element.\".
Association classes are appropriate for use when an Â«InformationObjectClassÂ»
needs to maintain associations to several other Â«InformationObjectClassÂ»\'s
and there are relationships between the members of the associations within the
scope of the \"containing\" Â«InformationObjectClassÂ». For example, a namespace
maintains a set of bindings, a binding ties a name to an object. A Binding
Â«IOCÂ» can be modelled as an Association Class that provides the binding
semantics to the relationship between a name and some other
Â«InformationObjectClassÂ». This is depicted in the following figure (exemplary
only, not taken from another 3GPP specification).

The actual names of the IOC represented by Link_a_z \> and by
ExternalLink_a_z \> are listed under the subsection of X.Y of
the associated YyyFunction. For example, under X.Y.1 for AsFunction, two

The \> and \> are stereotypes. These
two stereotypes serve similar purpose in that each is a named set of network
resource properties. However, their applications, in the context of supporting
