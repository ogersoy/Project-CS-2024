# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; Test management Integration Reference
Point (IRP), as identified below:
32.321: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements\"
**32.322: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information
Service (IS)\"**
32.323: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\"
32.325: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) definitions\"
A 3G telecommunication network is composed of a multitude of different Network
Elements (NE). For a successful operation of the network the operator must be
provided with mechanisms allowing him to manage the network. These management
activities can be grouped into several areas: configuration management, fault
management, performance management, accounting management and security
management.
A management function assisting in different high level management areas such
as fault management and performance management is test management. The purpose
of testing is to get information about the functionality and performance of
the 3G managed network subject to the test.
The present document is part of a TS-family defining the Telecommunication
Management (TM) of 3G systems.\ The TM principles are described in 3GPP TS
32.101 [5]. The TM architecture is described in 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].\ The other
specifications define the interface (Itf-N) between the managing system
(manager), which is in general the Network Manager (NM) and the managed system
(agent), which is either an Element Manager (EM) or the managed NE itself. The
Itf-N is composed of a number of integration reference points (IRPs) defining
the information in the agent that is visible for the manager, the operations
that the manager may perform on this information and the notifications that
are sent from the agent to the manager. One of these IRPs is the Test
Management IRP.
Each IRP is specified by the requirements part, the IS part and at least one
SS (e.g. CORBA SS).
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the IS part of the Test Management IRP, which
describes the semantics of the information and the interactions visible across
Itf-N in a protocol independent way. The information is specified by means of
information object classes and the interactions by means of operations and
notifications. The present document does not specify the syntax (encoding) of
the information.

## 5.2 Class Diagram
### 5.2.1 Attributes and Relationships
The following figure shows, for the Test Management IRP, the class definitions
and the relationships between the classes.
From the cardinalities can be seen that each instance of _TestManagementIRP_
may have several instances of _TestActionPerformer_. Each instance of
_TestActionPerformer_ can have multiple instances of associated
_TesterObjects_. Each instance of _TesterObject_ in turn has one instance of
_TestInvocation_. For the resource self test, each instance of TesterObject
has one instance of MORT. For the connection and loopback test, each instance
of TesterObject has two instances of MORT.
### 5.2.2 Inheritance
The following figure depicts the inheritance relationships between the
information object classes.
## 5.3 Information Object Classes (IOCs) definition
### 5.3.1 Information Object Class _TestManagementIRP_
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
The IOC _TestManagementIRP_ together with the IOC _TestActionPerformer_
represent the test management capabilities defined by this specification. To
conduct a test of network resources, this object may require capabilities of
other objects such as _TesterObject_. The IOC _TestManagementIRP_ inherits
from the IOC _ManagedGenericIRP_ specified in 3GPP TS 32.312 [2].
#### 5.3.1.2 Attributes
The IOC _TestManagementIRP_ has no own attributes, only those inherited from
the IOC _ManagedGenericIRP_.
### 5.3.2 Information Object Class _TestActionPerformer_
#### 5.3.2.1 Definition
The IOC _TestActionPerformer_ provides the ability to receive and react upon
test requests. This class must also be able to instantiate and delete tester
objects or, in case the tester objects are permanently instantiated, to
allocate and reserve them for their usage. This specification does not require
this IOC to be instantiated. It may be abstract and used for inheritance
purposes only. In this way the ability to receive and react upon test requests
may be included in any other IOC.
#### 5.3.2.2 Attributes
+-------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Attribute | Visibility | Support | Read | Write | | name | | Qualifier | Qualifier | Qualifier | +-------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | support | + | M | M | _-_ | | edTOClasses | | | | | +-------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | testAction | + | M | M | _-_ | | PerformerId | | | | | | | | see note | | | +-------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | NOTE: This | | | | | | attribute | | | | | | is only | | | | | | mandatory | | | | | | in case the | | | | | | IOC | | | | | | TestActi | | | | | | onPerformer | | | | | | is | | | | | | in | | | | | | stantiated. | | | | | | In case | | | | | | this IOC is | | | | | | an abstract | | | | | | class and | | | | | | used for | | | | | | inheritance | | | | | | purposes | | | | | | only the | | | | | | attribute | | | | | | shall be | | | | | | omitted. | | | | | +-------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
### 5.3.3 Information Object Class _TesterObject_
#### 5.3.3.1 Definition
The IOC _TesterObject_ monitors and controls the testing of a _MORT_ instance
and reports the outcome of the test execution. Tester Objects (TOs) are
instantiated by the IOC _TestActionPerformer_ in response to a valid test
initiation request (_initiateTests_). They are deleted after termination of
the test. It is also possible that TOs are permanently instantiated. In this
case they are allocated to a certain _TestActionPerformer_ during the test
execution. After termination of the test they are released.
The IOC _TesterObject_ defines a generic TO. It shall be used as an abstract
class from which more specific tester objects shall be derived by
specialisation for each test category. Test categories and the associated test
category specific TOs are defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.737 [10]. These
test category specific TOs can be specialised further by defining Vendor-
Specific-Extended (VSE) TOs. The generic TO defines attributes pertaining to a
test and required for all test categories.
Each test invocation shall have only one associated TO.
Only test category specific TOs or VSE TOs shall be instantiated.
For simplicity this specification will often use only the term TO. In this
case either the test category specific TO or the VSE TO is referred to
depending on which is actually instantiated.
#### 5.3.3.2 Attributes

### 5.3.4 Information Object Class _ResourceSelfTestTesterObject_
#### 5.3.4.1 Definition
The IOC _ResourceSelfTesterObject_ is a specialised TO for the resource self
test. It inherits from the IOC _TesterObject._ It specifies the triggering
events for the emission of the test result notifications.
#### 5.3.4.2 Attributes
This IOC has no own attributes, only those inherited from the generic IOC
_TesterObject_.
### 5.3.5 Proxy Class VSETestCategoryTesterObject
#### 5.3.5.1 Definition
Certain tests may not fit in any of the test categories defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.737 [10]. In this case vendors may define new (VSE) test
categories and the associated test category specific TOs. The Proxy Class
_VSETestCategoryTesterObject_ represents the set of these VSE test category
tester objects
The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class _VSETestCategoryTesterObject_ shall
inherit from the IOC _TesterObject_.
NOTE: A vendor may also claim 3GPP compliance to a certain release in case
that a specific test fits into one of the ITU-T test categories without that
the corresponding ITU-T test category specific TO is supported in this release
supposed that this test category specific TO will be added in a later release
than the current one. The vendor shall update this specification in due time.
#### 5.3.5.2 Attributes
The attributes of this IOC are vendor specific.
### 5.3.6 Proxy Class VSEResourceSelfTestTesterObject
#### 5.3.6.1 Definition
In case the IOC _ResourceSelfTestTesterObject_ does not fulfil the specific
requirements of a certain resource self test, vendors may define proprietary
IOCs by further specialisation. The Proxy Class
_VSEResourceSelfTestTesterObject_ represents these IOCs.
The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class _VSEResourceSelfTestTesterObject_
shall inherit from the IOC _ResourceSelfTestTesterObject_.
#### 5.3.6.2 Attributes
Apart from the attributes inherited the attributes of the IOCs represented by
this Proxy Class are vendor specific.
### 5.3.7 Proxy Class _VSETesterObject_
#### 5.3.7.1 Definition
In case an IOC represented by the Proxy Class _VSETestCategoryTesterObject_
does not fulfil the specific requirements of a certain test, vendors may
define proprietary IOCs by further specialisation. The Proxy Class
_VSETesterObject_ represents these IOCs.
The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class _VSETesterObject_ shall inherit from
the associated IOC represented by the Proxy Class
_VSETestCategoryTesterObject_.
#### 5.3.7.2 Attributes
Apart from the attributes inherited the attributes of the IOCs represented by
this Proxy Class are vendor specific.
### 5.3.8 Proxy Class _MORT_
#### 5.3.8.1 Definition
The ProxyClass _MORT_ represents a network resource that is under test. Its
class definition shall be one defined in the various 3GPP Network Resource
Model specifications or defined by a VSE network resource class.
#### 5.3.8.2 Attributes
This IOC has no attributes.
### 5.3.9 Information Object Class _TestInvocation_
#### 5.3.9.1 Definition
The IOC _TestInvocation_ is the abstract representation of a test invocation.
A test invocation shall aim to test one or more capabilities of a MORT. The
IRPManager can request for the establishment of a test invocation using the
operation _initiateTests_.
A MORT can be complex in that there are multiple capabilities that can be
subject to test. Therefore, it is possible to have multiple test activities
active, all aimed at the same MORT but on its different capabilities. Whether
multiple test activities can be testing the same MORT capabilities at the same
time is an implementation decision, probably based on the nature and behaviour
of the TO, and therefore, is outside the scope of this specification.

#### 5.3.10.1 Definition
The IOC NetworkPerformFaultTesterObject is a specialised TO for the network
performance test. It inherits from the IOC TesterObject _._
#### 5.3.10.2 Attributes
Apart from the attributes inherited from the generic IOC TesterObject, this
IOC has own attributes in the below table.

#### 5.3.11.1 Definition
In case the IOC NetworkPerformFaultTesterObject does not fulfil the specific
requirements of a certain connection test, vendors may define proprietary IOCs
by further specialisation. The Proxy Class VSENetworkPerformFaultTesterObject
represents these IOCs.
The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class VSENetworkPerformFaultTesterObject
shall inherit from the IOC NetworkPerformFaultTesterObject.
#### 5.3.11.2 Attributes
Apart from the attributes inherited the attributes of the IOCs represented by
this Proxy Class are vendor specific.

# 6 Interface definition
## 6.1 Class diagram representing interfaces
The following diagram depicts the interfaces of the Test Management IRP with
their corresponding operations and notifications.
## 6.2 Generic rules
**Rule 1:** Each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 2:** Each operation with at least one optional input parameter supports
a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where \"xxx\"
is the name of the optional input parameter and the preâ€‘condition indicates
that the operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally,
each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 3:** Each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem that is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
## 6.3 Interface testManagementIRPControlOperations
The interface _TestManagementIRPControlOperations_ contains the operations
_initiateTests_ and _terminateTests_. It must be implemented by every object
with the ability to receive and react upon test requests, for example by every
instance of _TestActionPerformer_.
### 6.3.1 Operation _initiateTests_ (M)
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
The IRPManager uses this operation to request the IRPAgent to initiate
controlled tests. A single test request may initiate multiple (one or more)
tests.
For each test to be initiated the managed object representing the network
resource to be tested and the tester object class must be specified.
The initiated tests are independent and not related to each other. This
implies that independent test result notifications are sent for each of the

### 6.3.2 Operation _terminateTests_ (M)
#### 6.3.2.1 Definition
The IRPManager uses this operation to request the IRPAgent to terminate tests
during their life time. A single _terminateTests_ operation may terminate
multiple (one or more) tests.
The tests to be terminated are identified by their test invocation
identifiers. The IRPManager terminating a test may be different from the
IRPManager that initiated the test. The _terminateTests_ operation must be
invoked on the object which received the corresponding _initiateTests_
operation.

## 6.4 Interface TestManagementIRPMonitorOperations
The interface _TestManagementIRPMonitorOperations_ contains the operation
_monitorTest_. It has a realisation relationship with the IOC
_TestActionPerformer_.
### 6.4.1 Operation _monitorTest_ (M)
#### 6.4.1.1 Definition
IRPManager shall be able to retrieve information about the test as observed by
the TO during the test execution by reading the relevant attributes of the TO
associated to the test. Also after the test execution the manager shall be
able to read these attributes as long as the TO exists. Attributes conveying
information about the test execution are _testState_ and _testOutcome_.
Depending on the specific test category specific TO or the VSE TO other
attributes may also contain information about the test execution. In this case
the subject operation may also allow to read the values of these attributes.

## 6.5 Interface TestManagementIRPNotifications
### 6.5.1 Notification _notifyTestResults_ (M)
#### 6.5.1.1 Definition
Test results are made available to the IRPManager by one or more notifications
_notifyTestResults_ emitted by the TO that is related to the test invocation.
Depending on the nature of the test and the specification of the TO behaviour,
the TO may need to convey to the IRPManager a test result data set. There are
two ways to convey this kind of information. One way is to use the parameter
_additionalInformation_ of the notification. In this case, the _fileReference_
and _fileExpiryDate_ shall contain no information or be absent. The other way
is to use a file to capture the test result data set. In this case, the
_additionalInformation_ parameter may contain no information or be absent and
the _fileReference_ and _fileExpiryDate_ shall be present. The file that
captures the test result data set shall contain VSE attributes and other 3GPP
attributes such as _testerObjectClass_ , _testOutcome_ , etc.
The use of the _additionalInformation_ parameter or a file to capture the test
result data set is specified by the class specification of the TO.
In case the TO uses _additionalInformation_ (and not a file) to capture the
test result data set, that TO may emit this notification to transfer
intermediate (non-final) test results. In this kind of notifications, the
_testOutcome_ parameter shall be absent. The TO should emit at least one more
notification regarding the subject test invocation in the future. The last
notification pertaining to a particular test invocation shall be indicated by
including the _testOutcome_ parameter in the notification.
In the case the TO uses a file to capture the test result data set, that TO
shall not issue any notifications to transfer intermediate test results. The
TO may capture the non-final test results in the file used to capture the
final test result data set.
The events triggering the emission of test result notifications depend on the
specific test. They shall be specified by the TO that is actually
instantiated, i.e. either by the test category specific TO or the VSE TO. Some
generic triggering events are included in this specification. It is expected
that vendors specify more triggering events.

#### 6.5.1.2 Triggering Events for the Test
For the test the events triggering the emission of test result notifications
are:
  * Termination of the test execution.
The test may be terminated explicitly by a test termination request. The
events triggering an implicit termination are:
  * Fulfilment of the conditions for a successful termination of the > test.
  * Fulfilment of the conditions for a premature termination of the > test.
  * Occurrence of an error situation.
##### 6.5.1.2.1 From-State
testTerminateRequestReceived OR testCompleted OR prematureTermination OR
testTimedOut OR errorSituationOccured.
* * *
Assertion Name Definition testTerminateRequestReceived The object with the
ability to receive and react upon test requests has received a test
termination request (see note). testCompleted The predefined conditions for a
successful completion of the test are fulfilled (see note).
prematureTermination The predefined conditions for a premature termination of
the test are fulfilled (see note). errorSituationOccured An error situation
has occurred during the test execution and the tester object has aborted the
test invocation (see note). NOTE: The conditions to satisfy this trigger are
related to the VSE TO definition and therefore, their specifications are
outside the scope of 3GPP.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Network Performance Measurement Procedure
There are four procedures in network performance measurement: initiation,
termination, monitor and test result report.
In the initiation, NM sends an initiation request in which there are some
configuration parameters to EM with operation _initialTests_. The EM will
store the parameters and send some configuration parameters to the source NE
and destination NE (or the loopback NE) to initiate the network performance
measurement. For the IP network, the network elements will start the test with
the protocols defined in IETF [12] [13]. The following figure illustrates the
test initialisation procedure.
Figure A.1 Initiation procedure for Network Performance Measurement
When the NM terminates the test, NM sends a termination request to EM with
operation _terminateTests_. The EM will save and send some parameters to the
source NE and destination NE (or the loopback NE) to terminate the network
performance measurement. The following figure illustrates the test termination
procedure.
Figure A.2 Termination procedure for Network Performance Measurement
When the NM monitors the test, NM sends a monitor request to EM with operation
_monitorTests_. If it is needed, the EM will send request to the NE(s) to
retrieve information before it send back the output parameters. Then the EM
will send back the output parameters to the NM. The following figure
illustrates the test monitor procedure.
Figure A.3 Monitor procedure for Network Performance Measurement
After the test is terminated, the test result is recorded in a test result
file in EM. Then the EM sends a notification _notifyTestResults_ to the NM, in
which there is some information for the NM to retrieve the file. The following
figure illustrates the test monitor procedure.
