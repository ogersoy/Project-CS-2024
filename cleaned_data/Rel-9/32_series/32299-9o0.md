# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**middle tier (charging) TS:** term used for the 3GPP charging TSs that
specify the domain / subsystem / service specific, online and offline,
charging functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from 3GPP
TS 32.250 to 3GPP TS 32.279, e.g. 3GPP TS 32.250 [10] for the CS domain, or
3GPP TS 32.270 [30] for the MMS service. Currently, there is only one \"tier
1\" TS in 3GPP, which is the TS 32.240 that specifies the charging
architecture and principles. Finally, there are a number of top tier TSs in
the 32.29x numbering range ([50] ff) that specify common charging aspects such
as parameter definitions, encoding rules, the common billing domain interface
or common charging applications.
**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **does
not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the
charging mechanism with session/service control is required

# 4 Architecture Considerations
## 4.1 High level architecture
The Rf and the Ro are reference points from the Charging Trigger Function
(CTF) to the Charging Data Function (CDF) and the Online Charging Function
(OCF) respectively, and are intended for the transport of charging events. Rf
is used for offline charging whereas Ro is used for online charging. The
following figures depict the position of the Rf and Ro reference points within
the overall 3GPP online and offline charging architecture.
**CTF:** **C** harging **T** rigger **F** unction
**CDF:** **C** harging **D** ata **F** unction
**CGF:** **C** harging **G** ateway **F** unction
**BD:** **B** illing **D** omain. This may also be a billing mediation device
/ post-processing system.

**BD:** **B** illing **D** omain. This may also be a billing mediation device
/ post-processing system.
Figure 4.1.2: Logical ubiquitous online charging architecture
Different mappings of the ubiquitous offline charging functions, CTF, CDF and
CGF, onto physical implementations are possible. Further details of the
configuration refer toTS 32.240 [1]. Details of the implementation options per
domain / subsystem / service (usually a subset of the overall possible
variants described above) are specified in the respective middle tier TS.
### 4.1.1 Charging related transfer requirements
Each CTF would have CDF and OCF address list to which it can send its charging
events and/or charging requests. The list will be organized in address
priority order. If the primary charging function is not available (e.g., out
of service) then the CTF shall send the charging information to the secondary
charging function and so on.
Within the scope of this release, each network element that generates charging
information will send the information only to the charging entities of the
same PLMN, and not to charging entities in other PLMNs.
Each CDF in the PLMN may know of other CDFs\' network addresses (e.g., for
redundancy reasons, to be able to recommend another CDF address with the
Redirection Request message). This is achieved by OAM&P configuration
facilities that will enable each CDF to have a configurable list of peer CDF
addresses.
# 5 3GPP charging applications requirements
## 5.1 Offline Charging Scenarios
### 5.1.1 Basic Principles
Offline charging for both events and sessions between CTF and the CDF is
performed using the Rf reference point as defined in TS 32.240[1].
Two basic scenarios are used:
\- Event based Charging;
\- Session based Charging.
#### 5.1.1.1 Event based charging
In the following scenario, CTF asks the CDF to store event related charging
data.
Figure 5.1.1.1: Event Based Charging
**\- Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired resource from the
network element.
**\- Content/Service Delivery:** the network element delivers the
content/service.
**\- Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
service delivery
**\- Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store event
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**\- Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**\- Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored.
#### 5.1.1.2 Session based charging
In the following scenario, CTF asks the CDF to store session related charging
data.
Figure 5.1.1.2: Session based charging
**\- Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired session from the
network element.
**\- Session ongoing:** the network element establish the session
**\- Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
session.
**\- Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store session
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**\- Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**\- Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored
**\- Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
session due of e.g. intermediate timer expiry
**\- Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store session
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**\- Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**\- Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored
**\- Session release:** the session is released
**\- Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related to
session due of session termination.
**\- Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store session
related charging data for CDR generation purposes.
**\- Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR is
generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.
**\- Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that charging
data was stored.
### 5.1.2 Basic Operation
Event and session based Charging are performed by the use of the \"_Charging
Data Transfer_ \" operation:
\- \"_Charging Data Request_ \"; sent from CTF ïƒ  CDF\ After detecting a
chargeable event, the CTF sends a Charging Data Request to the CDF.
\- \"_Charging Data Response_ \"; sent from CDF ïƒ  CTF\ The CDF replies with a
Charging Data Response, which informs the CTF that charging data was received.
Table 5.1.2.1 and table 5.1.2.2 describe the content of these operations.

## 5.2 Online Charging scenarios
Online charging for both events and sessions between CTF and the OCF is
performed using the Ro reference point. The Ro reference point supports
integrity protection and authentication for the case that the CTF is outside
the operator domain.
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
There are two sub-functions for online charging that affect online charging
principles and require a more detailed description: rating and unit
determination. Both rating and unit determination can be implemented
centralized, i.e. on the OCF, or decentralized, that is, on the CTF.
Unit determination refers to the calculation of the number of non-monetary
units (service units, data volume, time and events) that shall be assigned
prior to starting service delivery.
\- With Centralized Unit Determination, the OCF determines the number of non-
monetary units that a certain service user can consume based on a service
identifier received from the CTF.
\- With the Decentralized Unit Determination approach, the CTF determines
itself how many units are required to start service delivery, and requests
these units from the OCF.
After checking the service user\'s account balance, the OCF returns the number
of granted units to the CTF. The CTF is then responsible for the supervision
of service delivery. Particularly, the CTF shall limit service delivery to the
corresponding number of granted units.
Rating refers to the calculation of a price out of the non-monetary units
calculated by the unit determination function.
\- With the Centralized Rating approach, the CTF and the OCF exchange
information about non-monetary units. The OCF translates these units into
monetary units.
\- With the Decentralized Rating approach, the corresponding rating control is
performed within the CTF. Consequently, CTF and OCF exchange information about
monetary units.
Three cases for online charging can be distinguished: immediate event charging
(IEC), event charging with unit reservation (ECUR) and session charging with
unit reservation (SCUR). These cases are further described in TS 32.240 [1].
### 5.2.2 Charging Scenarios
In order to perform event charging via Ro, the scenarios between the involved
entities UE-A, OCF and CTF need to be defined. The charging flows shown in
this subclause include scenarios with immediate event charging and event
charging with reservation. In particular, the following cases are shown:
> 1 Immediate Event Charging
a) Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
b) Centralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
c) Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
> 2 Event charging with Reservation
a) Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating

c) Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
> 3 Session charging with Reservation
a) Decentralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
b) Centralized Unit Determination and Centralized Rating
c) Decentralized Unit Determination and Decentralized Rating
The combination of Centralized Unit Determination with Decentralized Rating is
not possible.

### 5.2.3 Basic Operations
On-line credit control uses two basic logical operations: Debit Units and
Reserve Units.
  * \"_Debit Units Request_ \"; sent from CTF ïƒ  OCF\ After receiving a service request from the subscriber, the CTF sends a _Debit Units Request_ to the OCF. The CTF may either specify a service identifier (centralised unit determination) or the number of units requested (decentralised unit determination).\ For refund purpose, the CTF sends a _Debit Units Request_ to the OCF as well.
  * \"_Debit Units Response_ \"; sent from OCF ïƒ  CTF\ The OCF replies with a _Debit Units Response_ , which informs the CTF of the number of units granted as a result of the _Debit Units Request_. This includes the case where the number of units granted indicates the permission to render the requested service.\ For refund purpose, the OCF replies with a _Debit Units Response_.
  * \"_Reserve Units Request_ \"; sent from CTF ïƒ  OCF\ Request to reserve a number of units for the service to be provided by an CTF. In case of centralised unit determination, the CTF specifies a service identifier in the _Reserve Unit Request_ , and the OCF determines the number of units requested. In case of decentralised unit determination, the number of units requested is specified by the CTF.
  * \"_Reserve Units Response_ \"; sent from OCF ïƒ  CTF\ Response from the OCF which informs the CTF of the number of units that were reserved as a result of the \"_Reserve Units Request_ \".
IEC uses the Direct Debiting One Time Event procedure specified in RFC 4006
and therefore is performed by the use of the logical \"Debit Units\"
operation, as specified in section 6.3.3.
SCUR and ECUR use both the \"Debit Units\" and \"Reserve Units\" operations.
SCUR uses the Session Based Credit Control procedure specified in RFC 4006\.
In session charging with unit reservation, when the \"Debit Units\" and
\"Reserve Units\" operations are both needed, they shall be combined in one
message, as specified in section 6.3.5.
For SCUR and ECUR the consumed units are deducted from the subscriber\'s
account after service delivery. Thus, the reserved and consumed units are not
necessarily the same. Using this operation, it is also possible for the CTF to
modify the current reservation, including the return of previously reserved
units.
Table 5.2.3.1 and table 5.2.3.2 describe the content of these operations.

## 5.3 Other requirements
### 5.3.1 Re-authorization
The server may specify an idle timeout associated with a granted quota.
Alternatively, the client may have a configurable default value. The expiry of
that timer shall trigger a re-authorization request.
Mid-session service events (re-authorisation triggers) may affect the rating
of the current service usage. The server may instruct the credit control
client to re-authorize the quota upon a number of different session related
triggers that can affect the rating conditions.
When a re-authorization is trigger, the client shall reports quota usage. The
reason for the quota being reported shall be notified to the server.
### 5.3.2 Threshold based re-authorization triggers
The server may optionally include an indication to the client of the remaining
quota threshold that shall trigger a quota re-authorization.
### 5.3.3 Termination action
The server may specify to the client the behaviour on consumption of the final
granted units; this is known as termination action.
### 5.3.4 Account Expiration
The server may provide to the client the date and time of account expiration,
which the client may use depending on operator policy.
# 6 3GPP Charging Applications -- Protocol Aspects
## 6.1 Basic Principles for Diameter Offline Charging
In order to support the offline charging principles described in the present
document, the Diameter client and server must implement at least the following
Diameter options listed in RFC 3588 [401], i.e. the basic functionality of
Diameter accounting, as defined by the Diameter Base Protocol (RFC 3588 [401])
is re-used..
The charging architecture implementing Diameter adheres to the structure where
all communications for offline charging purposes between the CTF (Diameter
client) and the CDF (Diameter server) are carried out on the Diameter Rf
reference point, where the CTF reports charging information to the Charging
Data Function (CDF). The CDF uses this information to construct and format
CDRs. The above-mentioned reference points are defined in TS 32.240 [1].
A configurable timer is supported in the CDF to supervise the reception of the
ACR [Interim] and/or ACR [Stop]. An instance of the \"Timer\" is started at
the beginning of the accounting session, reset on the receipt of an ACR
[Interim] and stopped at the reception of the ACR [Stop]. Upon expiration of
the timer, the CDF stops the accounting session with the appropriate error
indication.
For offline charging, the CTF implements the accounting state machine
described in RFC 3588 [401]. The server (CDF) implements the accounting state
machine \"SERVER, STATELESS ACCOUNTING\" as specified in RFC 3588 [401], i.e.
there is no order in which the server expects to receive the accounting
information.
The offline charging functionality is based on the network elements reporting
accounting information upon reception of various messages which trigger
charging generation, as most of the accounting relevant information is
contained in these messages. This reporting is achieved by sending Diameter
_Accounting Requests_ (ACR) [start, interim, stop and event] from the network
elements to the CDF.
Following the Diameter base protocol specification, the following \"types\" of
accounting data may be sent with regard to offline charging:
  * START session accounting data.
  * INTERIM session accounting data.
  * STOP session accounting data.
  * EVENT accounting data.
Two cases are currently distinguished for offline charging purposes:
  * Event based charging; and
  * Session based charging.
ACR types START, INTERIM and STOP are used for accounting data related to
successful sessions. In contrast, EVENT accounting data is unrelated to
sessions, and is used e.g. for a simple registration or interrogation and
successful service event triggered by a network element. In addition, EVENT
accounting data is also used for unsuccessful session establishment attempts.
The flows and scenarios for the above two described cases are further detailed
below.
### 6.1.1 Event based charging
In the case of event based charging, the network reports the usage or the
service rendered where the service offering is rendered in a single operation.
It is reported using the ACR EVENT.
The following figure shows the transactions that are required on the Diameter
offline interface in order to perform event based charging. The operation may
alternatively be carried out prior to, concurrently with or after
service/content delivery.
Figure 6.1.1: Event Based offline charging
Step 1: The network element receives indication that service has been
used/delivered.
Step 2: The network element (acting as client) sends _Accounting-Request_
(ACR) with _Accounting-Record-Type_ AVP set to EVENT_RECORD to indicate
service specific information to the CDF (acting as server).
Step 3: The CDF receives the relevant service charging parameters and
processes accounting request.
Step 4: The CDF returns _Accounting-Answer_ message with _Accounting-Record-
Type_ AVP set to EVENT_RECORD to the network element in order to inform that
charging information was received.
### 6.1.2 Session based charging
Session based charging is the process of reporting usage reports for a session
and uses the START, INTERIM & STOP accounting data. During a session, a
network element may transmit multiple ACR Interims\' depending on the
proceeding of the session.
The following figure shows the transactions that are required on the Diameter
offline interface in order to perform session based charging.
Figure 6.1.2: Session based offline charging
Step 1: The network element receives a service request. The service request
may be initiated either by the user or the other network element.
Step 2: In order to start accounting session, the network element sends a
_Accounting-Request_ (ACR) with _Accounting-Record-Type_ AVP set to
START_RECORD to the CDF.
Step 3: The CDF opens a CDR for current session.
Step 4: The CDF returns _Accounting-Answer_ (ACA) message with _Accounting-
Record-Type_ set to START_RECORD to the network element and possibly _Acct-
Interim-Interval AVP_ (AII) set to non-zero value indicating the desired
intermediate charging interval.
Step 5: When either AII elapses or charging conditions changes are recognized
at Network Element (NE), the NE sends an _Accounting-Request_ (ACR) with
_Accounting-Record-Type_ AVP set to INTERIM_RECORD to the CDF.
Step 6: The CDF updates the CDR in question.
Step 7: The CDF returns _Accounting-Answer_ (ACA) message with _Accounting-
Record-Type_ set to INTERIM_RECORD to the network element.
Step 8: The service is terminated.
Step 9: The network element sends a _Accounting-Request_ (ACR) with
_Accounting-Record-Type_ AVP set to STOP_RECORD to the CDF.
Step 10: The CDF updates the CDR accordingly and closes the CDR.
Step 11: The CDF returns _Accounting-Answer_ (ACA) message with _Accounting-
Record-Type_ set to STOP_RECORD to the network element.
### 6.1.3 Offline charging error cases - Diameter procedures
#### 6.1.3.1 CDF connection failure
When the connection towards the primary CDF is broken, the process of sending
accounting information should continue towards a secondary CDF (if such a CDF
is configured). For further CDF connection failure functionality, see
subclause \"_Transport Failure Detection_ \" in the RFC 3588 [401].
If no CDF is reachable the network element may buffer the generated accounting
data in non-volatile memory. Once the CDF connection is working again, all
accounting messages stored in the buffer is sent to the CDF, in the order they
were stored in the buffer.
#### 6.1.3.2 No reply from CDF
In case a network element does not receive an ACA in response to an ACR, it
may retransmit the ACR message. The waiting time until a retransmission is
sent, and the maximum number of repetitions are both configurable by the
operator. When the maximum number of retransmissions is reached and still no
ACA reply has been received, the network element executes the CDF connection
failure procedure as specified above.
If retransmitted ACRs\' are sent, they are marked with the T-flag as described
in RFC 3588 [401], in order to allow duplicate detection in the CDF, as
specified in the next subclause.
#### 6.1.3.3 Duplicate detection
A Diameter client marks possible duplicate request messages (e.g.
retransmission due to the link fail over process) with the T-flag as described
in RFC 3588 [401].
If the CDF receives a message that is marked as retransmitted and this message
was already received, then it discards the duplicate message. However, if the
original of the re-transmitted message was not yet received, it is the
information in the marked message that is taken into account when generating
the CDR. The CDRs are marked if information from duplicated message(s) is
used.
#### 6.1.3.4 CDF detected failure
The CDF closes a CDR when it detects that expected Diameter ACRs for a
particular session have not been received for a period of time. The exact
behaviour of the CDF is operator configurable.
## 6.2 Message Contents for Offline Charging
### 6.2.1 Summary of Offline Charging Message Formats
#### 6.2.1.1 General

## 6.3 Basic Principles for Diameter Online charging
### 6.3.1 Online Specific Credit Control Application Requirements
For online charging, the basic functionality as defined by the IETF Diameter
Credit Control application is used. The basic structure follows a mechanism
where the online client (CTF) requests resource allocation and reports credit
control information to the Online Charging System (OCS).
The usage and values of _Validity-Time_ AVP and the timer \"Tcc\" are under
the sole control of the credit control server (OCS) and determined by operator
configuration of the OCS.
Editor's note: There may be a requirement to add a minimum value for the
_Validity-Time_ AVP. It may need to be moved the subsection where the
_Validity-Time AVP_ is handled.
The online client implements the state machine described in RFC 4006 [402] for
\"CLIENT, EVENT BASED\" and/or \"CLIENT, SESSION BASED\". I.e. when the client
applies IEC it uses the \"CLIENT, EVENT BASED\" state machine, and when the
client applies ECUR defined in 3GPP it uses the \"CLIENT, SESSION BASED\"
state machine for the first and final interrogations.
The OCS implements the state machine described in RFC 4006 [402] for the
\"SERVER, SESSION AND EVENT BASED\" in order to support Immediate Event
Charging and Event Charging with Unit Reservation.

Editor's note: Message flows and scenarios should be moved into clause 5.
#### 6.3.2.1 Basic Principles
For online charging the Diameter Credit Control Application (DCCA) defined in
RFC 4006 [402] is used with additional AVPs defined in the present document.
Three cases for control of user credit for online charging are distinguished:
  * Immediate Event Charging IEC; and
  * event charging with unit reservation (ECUR).
  * Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
In the case of Immediate Event Charging (IEC),the credit control process for
events is controlled by the corresponding _CC-Requested-Type_ EVENT_REQUEST
that is sent with Credit _-Control-Request (_ CCR) for a given credit control
event.
In the case of Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) the _CC-Request-
Type_ INITIAL / TERMINATION_REQUEST are used for charging for a given credit
control event, however, where a reservation is made prior to service delivery
and committed on execution of a successful delivery.
Session Charging with Unit Reservation is used for credit control of sessions
and uses the _CC-Request-Type_ INITIAL / UPDATE and TERMINATION_REQUEST.
The network element may apply IEC, where CCR event messages are generated, or
ECUR, using CCR Initial and Termination. The decision whether to apply IEC or
ECUR is based on the service and/or operator\'s policy.
### 6.3.3 Immediate Event Charging (IEC)
Figure 6.3.3 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro reference
point in order to perform event based Direct Debiting operation. The Direct
Debiting operation may alternatively be carried out prior to service/content
delivery.\ the Network Element must ensure that the requested service
execution is successful, when this scenario is used.
Figure 6.3.3: IEC Direct Debiting Operation
Step 1. The network element receives a service request.\ The Direct Debiting
Operation is performed as described in RFC 4006 [402].
Step 2. The network element performs direct debiting prior to service
execution. Network element (acting as DCCA client) sends _Credit-Control-
Request_ (CCR) with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP set to EVENT_REQUEST to indicate
service specific information to the OCS (acting as DCCA server). The
_Requested-Action_ AVP (RA) is set to DIRECT_DEBITING. If known, the network
element may include _Requested-Service-Unit_ AVP (RSU) (monetary or non-
monetary units) in the request message.
Step 3. Having transmitted the _Credit-Control-Request_ message the network
element starts the communication supervision timer \'Tx\' (RFC 4006 [402]).
Upon receipt of the _Credit-Control- Answer_ (CCA) message the network element
shall stop timer Tx.
Step 4. The OCS determines the relevant service charging parameters .
Step 5. The OCS returns _Credit-Control-Answer_ message with _CC-Request-Type_
AVP set to EVENT_REQUEST to the network element in order to authorize the
service execution\ (_Granted-Service-Unit_ AVP (GSU) and possibly _Cost-
Information_ AVP (CI) indicating the cost of the service and _Remaining-
Balance_ AVP are included in the _Credit-Control-Answer_ message).\ The
_Credit-Control-Answer_ message has to be checked by the network element
accordingly and the requested service is controlled concurrently with service
delivery. The _Refund-Information_ AVP may be included in the _Credit-Control-
Answer_ message in order to be sent during the REFUND-ACCOUNT mechanism, see
below scenario.
Step 6. Service is being delivered.
NOTE: It is possible to perform also, CHECK_BALANCE and PRICE_ENQUIRY using
above described mechanism RFC 4006 [402].
Figure 6.3.3a shows the transactions for refund purpose.
Figure 6.3.3a: IEC Direct Debiting Operation for refund purpose
The Direct debiting operation is performed, previously, as described in RFC
4006 [402].
Step 1. The service charged previously through Direct Debiting Operation is
finally proved to be unsuccessfully delivered.
Step 2. As a consequence, the network element performs direct debiting
operation in order to perform the related refund. Network element (acting as
DCCA client) sends _Credit-Control-Request_ (CCR) with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP
set to EVENT_REQUEST to indicate service specific information to the OCS
(acting as DCCA server). The _Requested-Action_ AVP (RA) is set to REFUND-
ACCOUNT. The network element includes _Refund-Information AVP if_ received in
the previous IEC CCA.
Step 3. Having transmitted the _Credit-Control-Request_ message the network
element starts the communication supervision timer \'Tx\' (RFC 4006 [402]).
Upon receipt of the _Credit-Control- Answer_ (CCA) message the network element
shall stop timer Tx.
Step 4. The OCS reads the AVPs included in the CCR and performs the refund
accordingly.
Step 5. The OCS returns _Credit-Control-Answer_ message with _CC-Request-Type_
AVP set to EVENT_REQUEST and the related result code.
### 6.3.4 Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR)
Figure 6.3.4 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro reference
point in order to perform the ECUR. ECUR is used when event charging needs
separate reserve and commit actions.
Figure 6.3.4: ECUR for session based credit control
Step 1. The network element receives a service request. The service request
may be initiated either by the user or the other network element.
Step 2. In order to perform Reserve Units operation for a number of units
(monetary or non-monetary units), the network element sends a _Credit-Control-
Request_ (CCR) with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST to the OCS.
If known, the network element may include _Requested-Service-Unit_ (RSU) AVP
(monetary or non monetary units) in the request message.
Step 3. If the service cost information is not received by the OCS, the OCS
determines the price of the desired service according to the service specific
information received by issuing a rating request to the Rating Function. If
the cost of the service is included in the request, the OCS directly reserves
the specified monetary amount. If the credit balance is sufficient, the OCS
reserves the corresponding amount from the users account.
> Step 4. Once the reservation has been made, the OCS returns _Credit-Control-
> Answer_ (CCA) message with _CC-Request-Type_ set to INITIAL_REQUEST to the
> network element in order to authorize the service execution (_Granted-
> Service-Unit_ and possibly _Cost-Information_ indicating the cost of the
> service and _Remaining-Balance_ AVP are included in the _Credit-Control-
> Answer_ message). The OCS may return the _Validity-Time_ (VT) AVP with value
> field set to a non-zero value. The OCS may indicate in the _Low-Balance-
> Indication_ AVP that the subscriber account balance has fallen below a
> predefined treshold of this account.
Step 5. Content/service delivery starts and the reserved units are
concurrently controlled.
Step 6. When content/service delivery is completed, the network element sends
_CCR_ with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP set to TERMINATION_REQUEST to terminate the
active credit control session and report the used units _._
Step 7. The OCS deducts the amount used from the account. Unused reserved
units are released, if applicable.
> Step 8. The OCS acknowledges the reception of the CCR message by sending
> _CCA_ message with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP indicating TERMINATION_REQUEST
> (possibly _Cost-Information_ AVP indicating the cumulative cost of the
> service and _Remaining-Balance_ AVP are included in the _Credit-Control-
> Answer_ message).
NOTE: This scenario is supervised by corresponding timers (e.g. validity time
timer) that are not shown in the figure 6.3.4.
### 6.3.5 Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
Figure 6.3.5 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro reference
point in order to perform the SCUR.
Figure 6.3.5: SCUR for session based credit control
Step 1. The network element receives a session initiation. The session
initiation may be done either by the user or the other network element.
Step 2. In order to perform Reserve Units operation for a number of units
(monetary or non-monetary units), the network element sends a _Credit-Control-
Request_ (CCR) with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST to the OCS.
If known, the network element may include _Requested-Service-Unit_ (RSU) AVP
(monetary or non monetary units) in the request message.
Step 3. If the service cost information is not received by the OCS, the OCS
determines the price of the desired service according to the service specific
information received by issuing a rating request to the Rating Function. If
the cost of the service is included in the request, the OCS directly reserves
the specified monetary amount. If the credit balance is sufficient, the OCS
reserves the corresponding amount from the users account.
> Step 4. Once the reservation has been made, the OCS returns _Credit-Control-
> Answer_ (CCA) message with _CC-Request-Type_ set to INITIAL_REQUEST to the
> network element in order to authorize the service execution (_Granted-
> Service-Unit_ and possibly _Cost-Information_ indicating the cost of the
> service and _Remaining-Balance_ AVP are included in the _Credit-Control-
> Answer_ message). The OCS may return the _Validity-Time_ (VT) AVP with value
> field set to a non-zero value. The OCS may indicate in the _Low-Balance-
> Indication_ AVP that the subscriber account balance has fallen below a
> predefined threshold of this account.
Step 5. Content/service delivery starts and the reserved units are
concurrently controlled.
Step 6. During session delivery, in order to perform Debit Units and
subsequent Reserve Units operations, the network element sends a CCR with _CC-
Request-Type_ AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST, to report the units used and request
additional units, respectively. The CCR message with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP set
to UPDATE_REQUEST must be sent by the network element between the
INITIAL_REQUEST and TERMINATION_REQUEST either on request of the credit
control application within the validity time or if the validity time is
elapsed. If known, the network element may include _Requested-Service-Unit_
AVP (monetary or non monetary units) in the request message. The _Used-
Service-Unit_ (USU) AVP is complemented in the CCR message to deduct units
from both the user\'s account and the reserved units, respectively.
Step 7. The OCS deducts the amount used from the account. If the service cost
information is not received by the OCS, the OCS determines the price of the
desired service according to the service specific information received by
issuing a rating request to the Rating Function. If the cost of the service is
included in the request, the OCS directly reserves the specified monetary
amount. If the credit balance is sufficient, the OCS reserves the
corresponding amount from the users account.
> Step 8. Once the deduction and reservation have been made, the OCS returns
> _Credit-Control-Answer_ message with _CC-Request-Type_ set to UPDATE_REQUEST
> to the network element, in order to allow the content/service delivery to
> continue (new _Granted-Service-Unit_ _(GSU) AVP_ and possibly _Cost-
> Information_ _(CI) AVP_ indicating the cumulative cost of the service and
> _Remaining-Balance_ AVP are included in the _Creditâ€‘Control-Answer_
> message). The OCS may include in the CCA message the _Final-Unit-Indication_
> (FUI) AVP to indicate the final granted units. The OCS may indicate in the
> _Low-Balance-Indication_ AVP that the subscriber account balance has fallen
> below a predefined threshold of this account.
Step 9. Session delivery continues and the reserved units are concurrently
controlled.
Step 10. The session is terminated at the network element.
Step 11. The network element sends CCR with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP set to
TERMINATION_REQUEST to terminate the active credit control session and report
the used units _._
Step 12. The OCS deducts the amount used from the account. Unused reserved
units are released, if applicable.
> Step 13. The OCS acknowledges the reception of the CCR message by sending
> CCA message with _CC-Request-Type_ AVP indicating TERMINATION_REQUEST
> (possibly _Cost-Information_ AVP indicating the cumulative cost of the
> service and _Remaining-Balance_ AVP are included in the _Credit-Control-
> Answer_ message).
NOTE: This scenario is supervised by corresponding timers (e.g. validity time
timer) that are not shown in figure 6.3.5.
### 6.3.6 Error Cases and Scenarios
This subclause describes various error cases and how these should be handled.
The failure handling behaviour is locally configurable in the network element.
If the _Direct-Debiting-Failure-Handling_ or _Credit-Control-Failure-Handling_
AVP is not used, the locally configured values are used instead.
#### 6.3.6.1 Duplicate Detection
The detection of duplicate request is needed and must be enabled. To speed up
and simplify as much as possible the duplicate detection, the all-against-all
record checking should be avoided and just those records marked as potential
duplicates need to be checked against other received requests (in real-time )
by the receiver entity.
The network element marks the request messages that are retransmitted after a
link fail over as possible duplicates with the T-flag as described in RFC 3588
[401]. For optimized performance, uniqueness checking against other received
requests is only necessary for those records marked with the T-flag received
within a reasonable time window. This focused check is based on the inspection
of the _Session-Id_ and _CC-Request-Number_ AVP pairs.
Note that for EBCC the duplicate detection is performed in the Correlation
Function that is part of the OCS. The OCS that receives the possible duplicate
request should mark as possible duplicate the corresponding request that is
sent over the \'Rc\' reference point. However, this assumption above is for
further study and needs to be clarified.
For credit control duplicate detection, please refer to the Diameter Credit
Control.
#### 6.3.6.2 Reserve Units and Debit Units Operation Failure
In the case of an OCS connection failure, and/or receiving error responses
from the OCS, please refer to RFC 3588 [401] and RFC 4006 [402] for failure
handling descriptions.
### 6.3.7 Support of Tariff Changes during an Active User Session
#### 6.3.7.1 Support of Tariff Changes using the Tariff Switch Mechanism
After a tariff switch has been reached, all the active user sessions shall
report their session usage by the end of the validity period of the current
request and receive new quota for resource usage for the new tariff period.
In order to avoid the need for mass simultaneous quota refresh, the traffic
usage can be split into resource usage before a tariff switch and resources
used after a tariff switch.
The Tariff-Time-Change AVP is used to determine the tariff switch time as
described by RFC 4006 [402]. In addition to the scenarios described in RFC
4006 [402], the Tariff-Time-Change AVP may also be used in the context of
continuously time-based charging.
The Tariff-Change-Usage AVP is used within the Used-Service-Units AVP to
distinguish reported usage before and after the tariff time change.
The Tariff-Change-Usage AVP is not used directly within the Multiple-Services-
Credit-Control AVP.
#### 6.3.7.2 Support of Tariff Changes using Validity Time AVP
Changes to the tariffs pertaining to the service during active user sessions
may also be handled using the Validity Time AVP.
NOTE: RFC 4006 does not directly describe how tariff changes are handled with
validity time. If validity time is used for tariff time changes it might
overload the client and the server.
### 6.3.8 Support of Re-authorisation
Mid Diameter CC session re-authorisations of multiple active resource quotas
within a DCC session can be achieved using a single Diameter _Credit Control
Request/Answer_ message sequence.
The OCS may also re-authorise multiple active resource quotas within a DCC
session by using a single Diameter _Re-Auth-Request/Answer_ message sequence.
New quota allocations received by the Network Element override any remaining
held quota resources after accounting for any resource usage while the re-
authorisation was in progress.
### 6.3.9 Support of Failure Handling
The Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP as defined in RFC 4006 [402]
determines what to do if the sending of Diameter credit-control messages to
the OCS has been temporarily prevented. The usage of Credit-Control-Failure-
Handling AVP gives flexibility to have different failure handling for credit-
control session.
This AVP may be received from the OCS or may be locally configured. The value
received from the OCS in the Diameter Credit-Control-Answer message always
override any already existing value.
As defined in RFC 4006 [402], the Tx timer is introduced to limit the waiting
time in the CTF for an answer to the credit control request sent to the OCS.
When the Tx timer elapses the CTF takes an action to the end user according to
the value of the Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP.
It is possible that several concurrent Credit Control Request messages are
triggered for the same online charging session. In this case, each Credit
Control Request message shall reset the Tx timer as defined in RFC 4006 [402].
### 6.3.10 Support of Failover
As defined in RFC 4006 [402] if a failure occurs during an ongoing credit-
control session, the CTF may move the credit control message stream to an
alternative OCS if the primary OCS indicated FAILOVER_SUPPORTED in the CC-
Session-Failover AVP. In case CC-Session-Failover AVP is set to FAILOVER_NOT
SUPPORTED the credit control message stream is not moved to a backup OCS.
For new credit control sessions, failover to an alternative OCS should be
performed if possible. For instance, if an implementation of the CTF can
determine primary OCS unavailability it can establish the new credit control
sessions with a possibly available secondary OCS.
Since the OCS has to maintain session states, moving the credit-control
message stream to a backup OCS requires a complex charging context transfer
solution. This charging context transfer mechanism by OCS is out of the scope
of the 3GPP standardization work.
### 6.3.11 Credit Pooling
Credit pooling shall be supported as described in TS 32.240 [1].
Note: Credit pooling is not applicable to IEC since there is no quota
management between CTF and OCF.
## 6.4 Message formats for Online Charging
### 6.4.1 Summary of Online Charging Message Formats
#### 6.4.1.1 General
The corresponding Diameter credit control application messages for the Debit /
Reserve Unit Request operation is Credit-Control-Request (CCR) and for the
Debit / Reserve Unit Response operation is Credit-Control-Answer (CCA) as
specified in RFC 4006 [402].
The Diameter Credit-Control Application (DCCA) specifies an approach based on
a series of \"interrogations\":
  * Initial interrogation.
  * Zero, one or more interim interrogations.
  * Final interrogation.
In addition to a series of interrogations, also a one time event
(interrogation) can be used e.g. in the case when service execution is always
successful.
All of these interrogations use Credit _-Control-Request_ and _Credit-Control-
Answer_ messages. The _Credit-Control-Request_ for the \"interim
interrogation\" and \"final interrogation\" reports the actual number of
\"units\" that were used, from what was previously reserved. This determines
the actual amount debited from the subscriber\'s account.
Table 6.4.1.1 describes the use of these Diameter messages which are adapted
for 3GPP online charging.
Table 6.4.1.1: Online Charging Messages Reference Table
* * *
Command-Name Source Destination Abbreviation Credit-Control-Request CTF OCS
CCR Credit-Control-Answer OCS CTF CCA Capabilities-Exchange-Request CTF OCS
CER Capabilities Exchange Answer OCS CTF CEA
* * *
Additional Diameter messages (i.e. ASR/ASA, DPR/DPA, DWR/DWA, RAR/RAA) are
used according to the Diameter Base Protocol Accounting (DBPA) specification
in RFC 3588 [401] and to the DCCA specification in RFC 4006 [402].
#### 6.4.1.2 Structure for the Credit Control Message Formats
The following is the basic structure shared by all online charging messages.
This is based directly on the format of the messages defined in RFC 4006
[402].
Those Diameter Accounting AVPs that are used for 3GPP online charging are
marked in the table of contents 6.4.2 and 6.4.3 with a category as specified
in TS 32.240 [1].
In the definition of the Diameter Commands, the AVPs that are specified in the
referenced specifications but not used by the 3GPP charging specifications are
marked with strikethrough, e.g. ~~[ Acct-Multi-Session-Id ]~~.
The following symbols are used in the message format definitions:
  * \ indicates a mandatory AVP with a fixed position in the > message.
  * {AVP} indicates a mandatory AVP in the message.
  * [AVP] indicates an optional AVP in the message.
  * *AVP indicates that multiple occurrences of an AVP is possible.
### 6.4.2 Credit-Control-Request Message
The CCR messages, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 is sent by
the CTF to the OCF in order to request credits for the request bearer /
subsystem /service.
The CCR message format is defined according to RFC 4006 [402] as follows:
\ ::= \
**\ 
{ Origin-Host }
{ Origin-Realm }
{ Destination-Realm }
{ Auth-Application-Id }
{ Service-Context-Id }
{ CC-Request-Type }
{ CC-Request-Number }

## 6.5 Other procedural description of the 3GPP charging applications
### 6.5.1 Re-authorization
#### 6.5.1.1 Idle timeout
The server may specify an idle timeout associated with a granted quota using
the Quota-Holding-Time AVP. If no traffic associated with the quota is
observed for this time, the client shall understand that the traffic has
stopped and the quota is returned to the server. The client shall start the
quota holding timer when quota consumption ceases. This is always when traffic
ceases, i.e. the timer is re-started at the end of each packet. It applies
equally to the granted time quota and to the granted volume quota. The timer
is stopped on sending a CCR and re-initialised on receiving a CCA with the
previous used value or a new value of Quota-Holding-Time if received.
Alternatively, if this AVP is not present, a locally configurable default
value in the client shall be used. A Quota-Holding-Time value of zero
indicates that this mechanism shall not be used.
#### 6.5.1.2 Change of charging conditions
There are a number of mid-session service events (re-authorisation triggers),
which could affect the rating of the current service usage, e.g. end user QoS
changes or location updates. When allocating resources, the server may
instruct the credit control client to re-authorize the quota upon a number of
different session related triggers that can affect the rating conditions. The
server instruct the Network Element to monitor for such events by using the
Trigger AVP containing one or more Trigger-Type AVPs in the CCA command. These
events are in addition to the static triggers defined in the service specific
document (middle tier TS).
Once the OCS has armed one or more triggers using the Trigger AVP at the
Network Element, these triggers shall remain in effect until another Trigger
AVP is received for the same Rating Group, where the Network Element shall arm
all triggers present in the Trigger AVP and reset all other triggers. The
presence of the Trigger AVP without any Trigger-Type AVPs in a CCA allows OCS
to disable all the triggers that were armed in a previous Trigger AVP.
NOTE: This removes the need for the OCS to send trigger information in every
CCA message when they have not changed.
When one of the armed triggers happen, a credit re-authorization shall be sent
to the server including information related to the service event even if all
the granted service units have not been used. The quota is also being
reported.
For example, if the Trigger AVP is used, then the client shall only re-
authorise the quota for the service usage associated with events which were
included in the last received Trigger AVP.
If the server does not control the events for re-authorisation using the
Trigger AVP, the Network Element shall only monitor for default events defined
in the relevant service specific document (middle tier TS).
#### 6.5.1.3 Reporting quota usage
The credit control client shall report the quota usage under a number of
circumstances. When this happens, the reason for the quota being reported is
notified to the server through the use of the Reporting-Reason AVP in the CCR.
The reason for reporting credit usage can occur directly in the Multiple-
Services-Credit-Control AVP, or in the Used-Service-Units AVP, depending on
whether it applies for all quota types or a particular quota type
respectively. It shall not be used at command level. It shall always and shall
only be sent when usage is being reported.
When the reason is RATING_CONDITION_CHANGE, the Trigger AVP shall also be
included to indicate the specific armed trigger events which caused the
reporting and re-authorisation request.
#### 6.5.1.4 Quota consumption
The consumption of quota is captured using mechanisms described in 6.5.1.3.
Volume quota is considered used or consumed in the normal way, corresponding
to actual traffic.
The consumption of time quota may be controlled by Quota-Consumption-Time as
described in clause 6.5.4, or by extended mechanisms as described in clause
6.5.7.
### 6.5.2 Threshold based re-authorization triggers
The server may optionally include as part of the Multiple-Services-Credit-
Control AVP, when it is providing a quota, an indication to the client of the
remaining quota threshold that shall trigger a quota re-authorization. The
Time-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the threshold in seconds when the granted
quota is time, and the Volume-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the threshold in
octets when the granted quota is volume. The Unit-Quota-Threshold AVP
indicates the threshold in service specific units, that are defined in the
service specific documents, when the granted quota is service specific.
If the threshold triggers were included along with the quota granted, the
Credit Control client, then, shall seek re-authorisation from the server for
the quota when the quota contents fall below the supplied threshold. The
client shall allow service to continue whilst the re-authorisation is
progress, until the original quota had been consumed.
### 6.5.3 Termination action
The termination action is sent over the Ro reference point. Two different
approaches are specified:
  * The Final-Unit-Indication AVP with Final-Unit-Action TERMINATE does not include any other information. When the user has consumed the final granted units, the network element shall terminate the service. This is the default handling applicable whenever the client receives an unsupported Final-Unit-Action value. If the Final-Unit-Indication AVP is at Multiple-Services-Credit-Control level, the network element shall send Credit Control Request message with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST and report the Used-Service-Unit AVP for the service that has terminated, as defined in RFC 4006 [402].
  * Another termination action consists in re-directing packets corresponding to a terminated service (consumption of the final granted units) to an application server. This allows the client to redirect user originated requests to a top-up server so that network access can be re-instated. This functionality is achieved with the server returning a \"REDIRECT\" and redirect-to URL in the Final-Units-Action AVP of the Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP or at command level. Upon receiving this result code, the Network Element shall apply the redirection. The URL should be categorized so that the End-User's ability to reach it is guaranteed.
### 6.5.4 Quota consumption time
The server may optionally indicate to the client that the quota consumption
must be stopped after a period equal to the Quota Consumption Time in which no
packets are received or at session termination, whichever is sooner. This is
indicated by including the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP in the CCA. The idle
period equal to the Quota Consumption Time is included in the reported usage.
The quota is consumed normally during gaps in traffic of duration less than or
equal to the Quota-Consumption-Time. Quota consumption resumes on receipt of a
further packet belonging to the service data flow.
If packets are allowed to flow during a Credit Control Request (Update)/Credit
Control Answer exchange, and the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP value in the
provided quota is the same as in the previously provided quota, then the
Quota-Consumption-Time runs normally through this procedure. For example, if 5
seconds of a 10 second QCT timer have passed when a CCR[Update] is triggered,
and the CCA[Update] returns 2 seconds later, then the QCT timer will expire 3
seconds after the receipt of the CCA and the remaining unaccounted 5 seconds
of usage will be recorded against the new quota even though no packets were
transmitted with the new quota.
In the case of a new quota with the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP, or when
packets are blocked during the CCR[Update]/CCA procedure then the Quota-
Consumption-Time stops running (if it was running) and quota consumption
begins again when the next service data flow packet matching the Charging Rule
is received.
If a Quota-Consumption-Time AVP value of zero is provided, or if no Quota-
Consumption-Time AVP is present in the CCA, the quota is consumed continuously
from the point at which it is granted.
### 6.5.5 Service Termination
The OCF may determine that a service requires termination. The OCF may perform
this termination synchronously if it has a CCR pending processing by returning
CCA with Result-Code AVP with value DIAMETER-AUTHORIZATION-REJECTED. If the
OCF does not have a pending request (asynchronous), the OCF may trigger an ASR
to terminate the Diameter session related to the service. On reception of an
ASR, the CTF shall close the associated Credit-Control session by sending a
CCR [TERMINATE]. The behaviour of the CTF, in relation to the user session, on
reception of an ASR is detailed in the middle-tier TS. As an alternative to
the ASR, the OCF may trigger a RAR to which the CTF behaves as described in
RFC 4006 [402] and the OCF shall return a CCA with Result-Code AVP with value
DIAMETER-AUTHORIZATION-REJECTED for the resulting CCR.
### 6.5.6 Envelope reporting
The OCF may determine the need for additional detailed reports identifying
start time and end times of specific activity in addition to the standard
quota management provided in RFC 4006 [402]. The OCF controls this by sending
a CCA with Envelope-Report AVP with the appropriate values. The CTF, on
receiving the command, will monitor for traffic for a period of time
controlled by the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP and report each period as a
single envelope for each Quota-Consumption-Time expiry where there was
traffic. The OCF may request envelope reports for just time, time and volume,
time and number of events, or time and volume and number of events.
NOTE: Envelope reporting is independent of quota management (i.e. there is no
interaction).
### 6.5.7 Combinational quota
The Quota-Consumption-Time mechanism, described in clause 6.5.4, may be
extended (and replaced) when granting time based quota to provide potentially
more efficient use of the online charging interface, i.e. reduced traffic and
the algorithms in the OCF are potentially simpler. The alternative handling
mechanisms that are defined in this clause are:
  1. Continuous Time Period (CTP)
  2. Discrete Time Period (DTP)
Both DTP and CTP define time-envelopes in their own manner. The method of
forming a time-envelope is controlled by the Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP, which
selects the algorithm and the length of the base time interval.
The base time interval, specified by the Base-Time-Interval AVP, is a basic
unit for consuming quota. Quota is deemed to be consumed at the start of each
base time interval. The CTF shall allow traffic to pass for the duration of
the base time interval.
For DTP, the base time interval defines the length of the discrete time
period. A time envelope corresponds to exactly one DTP (and therefore to one
base time interval). Quota consumption resumes only on the first traffic
following the expiry of the DTP (or the closure of the envelope).
For CTP, the mechanism constructs a time-envelope out of consecutive base time
intervals in which traffic has occurred up to and including the first base
time interval which contains no traffic. Therefore quota consumption continues
within the time envelope, if there was traffic in the previous base time
interval. After an envelope has closed, then the quota consumption resumes
only on the first traffic following the closure of the envelope. The envelope
for CTP includes the last base time interval, i.e. the one which contained no
traffic. The end of an envelope can only be determined \"retrospectively\".
If the CTF receives a Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP with both the
Quota-Consumption-Time AVP and Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP, then the Time-Quota-
Mechanism AVP takes precedence and the CTF shall behave accordingly.
If the server requires details of when the DTPs and CTPs occurred then it
shall request the reporting of the corresponding time envelopes, by including
the Envelope-Reporting AVP when granting quota in the CCA (INITIAL) to
indicate whether the client shall report the start and end of each time
envelope, in those cases in which quota is consumed in envelopes. The CTF
generates envelopes according to the rules described above and carry each
envelope in a separate instance of the Envelope AVP in the CCR.
### 6.5.8 Online control of offline charging information
The Offline-Charging AVP is used on the Ro interface by the OCS to control the
CTF in relation to the mechanism by which the CTF generates offline charging
information, e.g. for flow based charging controls the formation of service
data containers. The information contained, within the Offline-Charging AVP,
takes precedence over the default configuration at the CTF. If the Offline-
Charging AVP is not sent in the CCA, the OCS does not control the offline
charging mechanisms and therefore the default configuration at the CTF is
employed.
Controls over time usage, defined in clause 6.5.6 and 6.5.7, are included.

NOTE: _Result-Code_ AVP is defined in Diameter Base Protocol in RFC 3588
[401]. However, new values are used in offline and online charging
applications. These additional values are defined below.
### 7.1.1 Accounting-Input-Octets
The _Accounting-Input-Octets_ AVP (AVP code 363) contains the number of octets
transmitted during the data container recording interval, reflecting the
volume counts for uplink traffic for a data flow.
### 7.1.2 void
### 7.1.3 Accounting-Output-Octets
The _Accounting-Output-Octets_ AVP (AVP code 364) contains the number of
octets transmitted during the data container recording interval, reflecting
the volume count for downlink traffic for a data flow.
### 7.1.4 void
### 7.1.5 Acct-Application-Id AVP
The _Acct-Application-Id_ AVP (AVP code 259) shall contain the value of 3 as
defined in RFC 3588 [401] according TS 29.230 [206].
### 7.1.6 Auth-Application-Id AVP
The _Auth-Application-Id_ AVP (AVP code 258) shall contain the value of 4 as
defined in RFC 4006 [402] according TS 29.230 [206].
### 7.1.7 Called-Station-Id
The _Called-Station-Id_ AVP (AVP code 30) shall contain the Access Point Name
(APN) the user is connected to.
### 7.1.8 Event-Timestamp AVP
The _Event-Timestamp_ AVP (AVP code 55) shall contain the time when the
chargeable event is received in the CTF.
### 7.1.9 Multiple-Services-Credit-Control
The _Multiple-Services-Credit-Control_ AVP (AVP code 456) is of type grouped
as specified in RFC 4006 [402]. It contains additional 3GPP specific charging
parameters.
It has the following ABNF grammar:
\ ::= \
> [ Granted-Service-Unit ]\ [ Requested-Service-Unit ]\ * [ Used-Service-Unit
> ]\ ~~[ Tariff-Change-Usage ]~~\ * [ Service-Identifier ]\ [ Rating-Group ]\
> * [ G-S-U-Pool-Reference ]~~\ ~~ [ Validity-Time ]\ [ Result-Code ]\ [
> Final-Unit-Indication ]\ [ Time-Quota-Threshold ]\ [ Volume-Quota-Threshold
> ]\ [ Unit-Quota-Threshold ]\ [ Quota-Holding-Time ]\ [ Quota-Consumption-

>
> * [ Envelope ]\ [ Envelope-Reporting ]\ [ Time-Quota-Mechanism ]\ * [
> Service-Specific-Info ]
>
> [ QoS-Information ]
>
> ~~* [ AVP ]~~
### 7.1.10 Rating-Group AVP
The _Rating-Group_ AVP (AVP code 432), is defined in RFC 4006 [402]. It
contains the charging key (defined in TS 23.203 [218]). Each quota allocated
to a Diameter CC session has a unique Rating Group value as specified in RFC
4006 [402].
### 7.1.11 Result-Code AVP
This subclause defines new _Result-Code_ AVP (AVP code 268) values that must
be supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to the present
document. The Result-Code AVP operates as described in RFC 3588 [401] and RFC
4006 [402].
The following result code descriptions are examples of the possible uses for
the code:
**Transient Failures (4xxx):**
DIAMETER_END_USER_SERVICE_DENIED 4010
The OCF denies the service request due to service restrictions (e.g. terminate
rating group) or limitations related to the end-user, for example the end-
user\'s account could not cover the requested service.
DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE 4011
The OCF determines that the service can be granted to the end user but no
further credit control\ needed for the service (e.g. service is free of charge
or is treated for offline charging). DIAMETER_CREDIT_LIMIT_REACHED 4012
The OCF denies the service request since the end- user\'s account could not
cover the requested service. If the CCR contained used-service-units they are
deducted, if possible.
**Permanent Failures (5xxx):**
DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED 5003
The OCF denies the service request in order to terminate the service for which
credit is requested. For example this error code is used to inform IP CAN
bearer has to be terminated in the CCR message or to inform blacklist the
rating group in the Multiple-Service-Credit-Control AVP.
DIAMETER_USER_UNKNOWN 5030
The specified end user could not be found in the OCF.
DIAMETER_RATING_FAILED 5031
This error code is used to inform the CTF that the OCF cannot rate the service
request due to insufficient rating input, incorrect AVP combination or due to
an AVP or an AVP value that is not recognized or supported in the rating. For
Flow Based Charging this error code is used if the Rating group is not
recognized. The Failed-AVP AVP MUST be included and contain a copy of the
entire AVP(s) that could not be processed successfully or an example of the
missing AVP complete with the Vendor-Id if applicable. The value field of the
missing AVP should be of correct minimum length and contain zeroes.
### 7.1.12 Service-Context-Id AVP
The _Service-Context-Id_ AVP is defined in RFC 4006 [402]. It is of type
UTF8String and contains a unique identifier of the Diameter Credit Control
service specific document that applies to the request. This is an identifier
allocated by the service provider/operator, by the service element
manufacturer or by a standardization body and MUST uniquely identify a given
Diameter Credit Control service specific document. For offline charging, this
identifies the service specific document (\'middle tier\' TS) on which
associated CDRs should based. The format of the Service-Context-Id is:
\"extensions\".MNC.MCC.\"Release\".\"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\"
The 3GPP specific values for \"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\" are:
  * For PS charging: **32251\@3gpp.org**
  * For WLAN charging: **32252\@3gpp.org**
  * For IMS charging: **32260\@3gpp.org**
  * For MMS service charging: **32270\@3gpp.org**
  * For LCS service charging: **32271\@3gpp.org**
  * **For PoC service charging: 32272\@3gpp.org**
  * For MBMS service charging: 32273\@3gpp.org
  * For SMS service charging: 32274\@3gpp.org
  * For MMTel service charging: 32275@3gpp.org
  * For AoC Service Information: 32280\@3gpp.org
The \"Release\" indicates the 3GPP Release the service specific document is
based upon e.g. 6 for Release 6.
As a minimum, Release \"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\" shall be used. If
the minimum is used all operator configurable parameters (Oc and Om) are
optional.
The MNC.MCC identifies the operator implementing the service specific
document, which is used to determine the specific requirements for the
operator configurable parameters.
The \"extensions\" is operator specific information to any extensions in a
service specific document.
### 7.1.13 Service-Identifier AVP
The _Service-Identifier_ AVP (AVP code 439), is defined in RFC 4006 [402]. For
further details, please refer the middle-tier specification.
### 7.1.14 Used-Service-Unit AVP
The _Used-Service-Unit_ AVP (AVP code 446) is of type grouped as specified in
RFC 4006 [402]. It contains additional 3GPP specific charging parameters.
It has the following ABNF grammar:
\ ::= \
> [ Reporting-Reason ]
>
> [ Tariff-Change-Usage ]
>
> [ CC-Time ]
>
> ~~[ CC-Money ]~~
>
> [ CC-Total-Octets ]
[ CC-Input-Octets ]
[ CC-Output-Octets ]
[ CC-Service-Specific-Units ]
*[ Event-Charging-TimeStamp ]
~~*[ AVP ]~~
### 7.1.15 User-Name AVP
The _User-Name_ AVP (AVP code 1) contains the user name in the format of a NAI
according to RFC 3588 [401].
### 7.1.16 Vendor-Id AVP
The _Vendor-Id_ AVP (AVP code 266), as part of the _Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id_ grouped AVP, shall contain the value of 10415, which is the
IANA registered value for \'3GPP\' in TS 29.230 [206].
### 7.1.17 User-Equipment-Info AVP
The _User-Equipment-Info_ AVP (AVP code 458) is of type grouped and contains
the identity and capability of the terminal the subscriber is using for the
connection to network according to IETF RFC 4006 [402] with the following ABNF
grammar:
User-Equipment-Info ::= \
{ User-Equipment-Info-Type }
{ User-Equipment-Info-Value }.
When the User-Equipment-Info-Type AVP (AVP code 459) is set to IMEISV (0), the
value within the User-Equipment-Info-Value AVP (AVP code 460) is of type
OctetString and shall be a UTF-8 encoded decimal.
The composition of the IMEISV follows the IMEI definition in TS 23.003 [224].
## 7.2 3GPP specific AVPs
For the purpose of offline charging additional AVPs are used in ACR / ACA and
for online charging additional AVPs are used in CCR / CCA. All 3GPP specific
AVPs mentioned are relevant for both offline and online charging unless
specifically excluded. The information is summarized in the following table
along with the AVP flag rules.
The 3GPP Charging Application uses the value 10415 (3GPP) as _Vendor-Id._
Detailed descriptions of AVPs that are used specifically for 3GPP charging are
provided in the subclauses below the table. However, for AVPs that are just
borrowed from other applications only the reference (e.g. TS 29.229 [204]), is
provided in the following table and the detailed description is not repeated.
Where 3GPP RADIUS VSAs are re-used, they shall be translated to Diameter AVPs
as described in RFC 4005 [407] with the exception that the \'M\' flag shall be
set and the \'\'P\' flag may be set.
