# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of documents that specify charging
functionality and charging management in 3GPP networks (GSM/UMTS/EPS). The
3GPP core network charging architecture and principles are specified in
document TS 32.240 [1], which provides an umbrella for other charging
management documents that specify:
\- the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);
\- the content of real-time charging events per domain/subsystem (online
charging);
\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
subsystems;
\- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
charging information\ (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].
The present document specifies the CDR parameters, the abstract syntax and
encoding rules for all the CDR types that are defined in the charging
management TSs described above. Therefore, it is only applicable to offline
charging. The mechanisms used to transfer the CDRs from the generating node to
the operator's billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation device)
are specified in TS 32.297 [42]. Further details with respect to the
operator's billing domain for offline charging are out of scope of 3GPP
standardisation.
Note that a generic Diameter application for online charging in 3GPP networks
is specified in TS 32.299 [50]. Furthermore, 3GPP TSs are being created to
standardise some technical aspects of the operator's billing domain for online
charging, i.e. the Online Charging System (OCS).
All terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR 21.905
[100]. Those that are common across charging management in 3GPP domains or
subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1] and are copied
into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally, those
items that are specific to the present document are defined exclusively in the
present document.
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS
22.115 [101].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 32.240 [1] and TS 32.297 [42] as well as the following apply:
**Billing Domain:** part of the operator network, which is outside the core
network, which receives and processes CDR files from the core network charging
functions. It includes functions that can provide billing mediation and
billing or other (e.g. statistical) end applications. It is only applicable to
offline charging (see \"Online Charging System\" for equivalent functionality
in online charging).
**Charging Data Record (CDR):** formatted collection of information about a
chargeable event (e.g. time of call set-up, duration of the call, amount of
data transferred, etc) for use in billing and accounting. For each party to be
charged for parts of or all charges of a chargeable event a separate CDR is
generated, i.e. more than one CDR may be generated for a single chargeable
event, e.g. because of its long duration, or because more than one charged
party is to be charged.
**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **does
not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered.
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the
charging mechanism with bearer/session/service control is required.
Editor's Note: to be completed based on definitions in TS 32.240 [1] and
32.297 [42].
## 3.2 Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols as specified
in TS 32.240 [1], TS 32.297 [42], TS 23.060 [202] and the following apply:
Bx The Interface between a Charging Gateway Function (CGF) and the Billing
Domain (BD)
Ga Interface between a node transmitting CDRs (i.e. CDF) and a CDR receiving
functionality (CGF)
Gn Interface between two GSNs within the same PLMN.
Gp Interface between two GSNs in different PLMNs. The Gp interface allows
support of GPRS network services across areas served by the co-operating GPRS

# 4 Architecture Considerations
The following diagram provides a high level view of the parts of the charging
architecture that are relevant for the present document. The arrows depict the
direction of the charging information flow, where R~f~ carries charging
events, G~a~ carries CDRs and B~x~ carries CDR files.
Figure 4.1: Logical offline charging architecture
The present document specifies the parameters, abstract syntax and encoding
rules for all 3GPP defined CDR types as applicable to the Bx interface, i.e.
the CDR files.
CDF and CGF may or may not be integrated with each others, the core network or
service nodes, or the BD.\ The possibilities for integration or distribution
of these functions are described for each domain, subsystem or service in the
respective domain/subsystem/service specific charging TS. In the distributed
case, the 3GPP standardised reference points/interfaces depicted above, shall
be used.
Refer to TS 32.240 [1] for a complete description of the charging
architecture.\ Refer to TS 32.297 [42] for the description of the CGF's file
based interface to the BD.
# 5 CDR parameters and abstract syntax
This clause specifies the parameters and the abstract syntax of the CDRs
defined for 3GPP charging management in references TS 32.250 [10] to TS 32.275
[35]. In doing this, the ASN.1 specified by the X.680 [300] is utilised as the
notational tool.
This clause is organised in two parts:
> \- the first part describes the CDR parameters;
>
> \- the second part specifies the abstract syntax of the CDRs as seen in the
> CDR files transferred across the Bx interface.
Each part is further subdivided into a number of subclauses that contain
generic, bearer level, service level, and subsystem level CDR parameters and
abstract syntax definitions. Word processing features, such as formatting
options, have also been used to enhance human readability.
The complete set of all CDR syntax definitions is replicated in annex A in a
machine processable format. Technically, the contents of this clause and annex
A are completely identical. In case of deviations between this clause and
annex A due to errors in the present document, the annex shall prevail.
Note that the encoding rules for the abstract syntax specified in this clause,
are detailed in clause 6.
## 5.1 CDR parameter description
Editor's note: this subclause needs to be aligned with subclause 5.2
concerning the allocation of parameters to the domains versus making them
generic.
### 5.1.1 Generic CDR parameters
This subclause contains the description of generic CDR parameters, where the
term \"generic\" implies that these parameters are applicable to CDR types of
more than one domain/service/subsystem.
#### 5.1.1.1 Serving Network Identity
This field contains a SGSN PLMN Identifier (Mobile Country Code and Mobile
Network Code), of the SGSN that was used during the Location request. In case
the SGSN changes during the transaction, only the ID of the SGSN that was used
at the beginning of the transaction is included in the CDR.
The MCC and MNC are coded as described for 'Routing Area Identity' in TS
29.060 [215].
#### 5.1.1.2 Service Context Id
This field contains the Service Context Id from Diameter Accounting, if
Diameter Accounting was used and the field included. It identifies the
service, sub-system or domain and release that the CDR is applicable to. The
contents are described in TS 32.299 [50].
#### 5.1.1.3 Subscription Identifier
This field identifies the charged party . The contents are coded in a similar
fashion as for the Subscription-Id AVP in TS 32.299 [50].
#### 5.1.1.4 Service Specific Info
This grouped field holds the sub-fields \"service specific data\" and
\"service specific type\" if and as provided by an Application Server or PCEF
only for pre-defined PCC rules.
#### 5.1.1.5 Service Specific Type
This field holds the type of the Service Specific Data parameter.
#### 5.1.1.6 Service Specific Data
This field contains the value of service specific data.
### 5.1.2 Bearer level CDR parameters
This subclause contains the description of the CDR parameters that are
specific to the bearer level CDR types. This comprises the CDR types from the
Circuit Switched (CS) domain (TS 32.250 [10]), the Packet Switched (PS)
domain, i.e. GPRS (TS 32.251 [11]), and WLAN (TS 32.252 [12]).
#### 5.1.2.1 CS domain CDR parameters
This subclause contains the description of the CDR parameters that are
specific to the CS domain CDR types as specified in TS 32.250 [10].
##### 5.1.2.1.1 Additional Charging Information
This field consists of two parts, a charge indicator and additional charging
parameters. The charge indicator is derived from the information contained
within the ISUP \"backward call indicator\" and may be used to store a charge
indicator (charge/no charge) received from another network node. The
additional charging parameters are non-standard and intended to permit the
inclusion of further charging information received from Intelligent Network
and/or Value Added Service nodes.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 AoC parameters/change of AoC parameters
The AoC parameter field contains the set of charge advice (AoC) parameters
sent to the MS on call set-up. If further sets of parameters are sent during
the call, as a result of a tariff switch-over for example, then this may be
recorded in the Change of AoC Parameter field including the time at which the
change occurred.
It should be noted that the Change of AoC Parms. field is optional and not
required if partial records are generated on tariff switch-over.
The AoC parameters are defined in TS 22.024 [104].
##### 5.1.2.1.3 Basic Service/change of service/ISDN Basic Service
The basic service field contains the code of the basic service employed on
call set-up. Any alteration to the basic service during the connection may be
recorded in the change of service field including the time at which the change
took place.
The change of service field is optional and may be omitted if partial records
are created whenever the basic service is changed.
The coding of basic services is defined in detail in TS 29.002 [214].
In the case of the transit record the GSM basic service employed is generally
not available. However, if the device on which the call originates/terminates
is connected via ISDN digital subscriber signalling then the appropriate ISDN
basic service code may be recorded in the record. One possible example
includes the direct connection of an ISDN PABX to an MSC/VLR.
##### 5.1.2.1.4 Call duration
This field contains the relevant call duration in seconds. For incomplete
calls (call attempts) the relevant duration is the call holding time from the
seizure to the release of the traffic channel. For complete (answered) calls
this is the chargeable duration from answer to release of the traffic channel.
For partial records this is the duration of the individual partial record and
not the cumulative duration of the call.
It should be noted that the time stamps may be expressed in terms of tenths of
seconds or even milliseconds and, as a result, the calculation of the call
duration may result in the rounding or truncation of the measured duration to
a whole number of seconds.
Whether or not rounding or truncation is to be used is considered to be
outside the scope of the present document subject to the following
restrictions:
1) A call duration of zero seconds shall not be accepted.
2) The same method of truncation/rounding shall be applied to both single and
partial records.
If CAMEL is invoked for the call and a control relationship is existing, the
call might continue after a RELEASE or a DISCONNECT from the called party side
received by the gsmSSF. The call duration of the incoming leg is stored in the
main body of the call record. For each outgoing leg the call duration is
stored in the respective \'CAMELInformation\' module. If a call leg does not
reach answer status and attempt charging is enabled a \'CAMELInformation\'
module containing the holding time is generated.
An example of how to use the call duration and the timestamps is given in
figure 2. It shows a CAMEL controlled mobile originated follow-on scenario.
The uppermost arrow  marks the over all duration of the call that is to be
measured and stored in the main body of the respective MOC record. The
duration before t~5~ (incoming leg) or t~4~ (outgoing leg) needs not to be
stored since the call is answered later on. The call duration in the first
outgoing leg module contains the time interval from t~4~ to t~6~ (period ).
The call duration measurement of the second outleg is started with t~9~ and
ended with t~10~ (interval ).
Since the last outgoing leg is not answered, the respective module contains
the holding time starting with t~11~ and ending with t~13~ (period ).
(The timestamps t~1~, t~2~, t~3~, t~7~, t~8~ and t~12~ are mentioned for
completion reasons only.)

Figure 5.1: Call duration measurement in follow-on scenarios
##### 5.1.2.1.5 Call reference
This field uniquely identifies a call or transaction on one side of the
interface (i.e. \'A\' or \'B\' side) and is derived from the transaction
identifier of TS 24.008 [208]. It is also used to identify all partial records
and transactions belonging to the same connection.
For the avoidance of doubt, there is **no** global call reference defined
within GSM and the call reference field **cannot** be used to combine, for
example, the MOC and MTC records of a mobile‑to‑mobile connection.
##### 5.1.2.1.6 Calling/called/connected/translated number
In general an Recommendation E.164 [308] number but may also include other
numbering plans e.g. Recommendation X.121. Each of these fields includes the
type of number and number plan as specified in detail in TS 24.008 [208].
Where appropriate, these fields may also contain the presentation and
screening information also specified in TS 24.008 [208].
The called number is the number received from the mobile station on mobile
originated call set-up as defined in TS 24.008 [208]. Similarly, the calling
number is the number received from the network on mobile terminated call set-
up. In case of CAMEL initiated Call Forward (CF), the called (forwarded-to)
number is returned by CAMEL.
The translated number is the result of any digit translation performed by the
MSC on the called number received from the mobile station on mobile originated
call set-up. This parameter is not included in the CDR if no digit translation
has taken place.
The connected number is the number of the actual party reached as defined in
TS 24.008 [208]. Although this is normally identical to the called number it
may differ. This parameter is not included if identical to the called number.
The following examples are intended to explain the use of these fields:
EXAMPLE 1: Called Number = Connected Number
Normal call from a mobile subscriber to a mobile subscriber or to a PSTN
subscriber.
EXAMPLE 2: Called Number != Connected Number
In case of routing to a PABX with Automatic Call Distribution or to an ISDN
Basic Access with several devices attached. The connected number is that of
the party actually reached. N.B. The recording of the actual number connected
may be limited by the capability of intermediate signalling connections.
EXAMPLE 3: MTC record for Call Forwarding (\"A\" -> \"B\" -> \"C\")
In case of call forwarding, the connected number recorded in the MTC record of
the \"B\" subscriber is that of the forwarded-to party or \"C\" subscriber.
The calling party field contains the number of the \"A\" subscriber.
EXAMPLE 4: Translated Number
This field is only present if digit translation is applied by the MSC to the
called number received from the mobile station. Examples include abbreviated
dialling codes and service numbers.
##### 5.1.2.1.7 Calling Party Number
This field contains Calling Party Number modified by CAMEL service.
##### 5.1.2.1.8 CAMEL call leg information
This field contains a set of CAMEL information IEs according to the number of
outgoing CAMEL call legs.
##### 5.1.2.1.9 CAMEL information
This field contains a list of parameters with information related to one CAMEL
outgoing call leg. This parameter list is an Information Element (IE) used in
the CAMEL Call Leg Information field.
As a network option, parameters that are identical to the corresponding values
in the top level structure of the record are not recorded again. That means
whenever a value is not mentioned in this set the value provided in the basic
record is valid instead. This might lead to an empty or even absent structure,
if no parameter was modified.

##### 5.1.2.1.24 Event time stamps
These fields contain the event time stamps relevant for each of the individual
record types.
The call records may contain three significant call handling time stamps:
\- the time at which the resource in question was seized (Seizure time);
\- the time at which the call was answered or at which charging commences
(Answer time);
\- the time at which the resource was released (Release time).
For both Mobile Originated and Mobile Terminated calls, the Seizure time is
the time at which the traffic channel is allocated i.e. the time at which the
ASSIGN COMMAND message is sent to the MS.
For Mobile Originated calls the Answer time is the time at which the CONNECT
message is sent to the calling party. For Mobile Terminated calls the time at
which the CONNECT message is received from the called party. However, if the
subscriber has subscribed to the advice of charge charging level service, then
the answer time shall be derived from the time at which the FACILITY message
is received from the MS containing the acknowledgement of receipt of the AOC
parameters. Similarly, if the AOC parameters are changed during the call then
the change time recorded for a subscriber with AOC charging level is the
receipt of the FACILITY message from the MS. For a subscriber with AOC
information level the change time recorded is the time at which the FACILITY
is sent to the MS. Finally, in case of call re-establishment the answer time
is the time at which the new traffic channel is allocated by the MSC i.e. when
the ASSIGN COMMAND is sent to the MS.
The Release time is the time at which the connection is released by either
party i.e. a DISCONNECT or RELEASE is sent by the network or a DISCONNECT is
received from the MS. In the case of a radio link failure, the release time is
the time at which the failure was detected by the MSC.
For unsuccessful call attempts the Seizure time is mandatory. The Release time
is optional and the call duration recorded is the call holding time i.e. the
difference between the two.
For successful calls the Answer time is mandatory and both the Seizure and
Release times are optional. The call duration recorded is the chargeable
duration i.e. the difference between the Answer and Release time stamps.
The event records include the following time stamps:
\- HLR-int time: The receipt of a MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO request by the HLR;
\- Loc.Upd. time: The receipt of a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION_AREA request by the VLR
or the receipt of a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION request by the HLR;
\- SS-Action: The receipt of a supplementary service request by the VLR;
e.g. MAP_REGISTER_SS, MAP_INVOKE_SS
\- SMS-MO: The receipt of an RP_DATA message from the MS containing an
SMS_SUBMIT PDU;
\- SMS-MT: The transmission of an RP_DATA message to the MS containing an
SMS_DELIVER PDU;
\- LCS: The time the LR was processed.
It should be noted that the events listed above are only examples in order to
demonstrate the principles and that the list is by no means exhaustive.
All time-stamps include a minimum of date, hour, minute and second.
##### 5.1.2.1.25 Fixed Network User Rate
This field indicates the user data rate applied for the connection in the

##### 5.1.2.1.26 Free format data
This field contains charging information sent by the gsmSCF in the Furnish
Charging Information (FCI) messages as defined in TS 29.078 [217]. The data
can be sent either in one FCI message or several FCI messages with append
indicator. This data is transferred transparently in the CAMEL clauses of the
relevant call records. \'Free format data\' sent to the legID=1 is always
stored in the top level of the respective record. \'Free format data\' sent to
the legID >1 is stored in the appropriate CAMEL call leg information field.
If the FCI is received more then once during one continuing incoming/outgoing
CAMEL call leg, the append indicator defines whether the FCI information is
appended to previous FCI and stored in the relevant record or the information
of the last FCI received is stored in the relevant record (the previous FCI
information shall be overwritten).
In the event of partial output the currently valid \'Free format data\' is
stored in the partial record.
##### 5.1.2.1.27 Free format data append indicator
This field contains an indicator whether free format data is to be appended to
free format data stored in previous partial CDR. This field is needed in CDR
post-processing to sort out valid free format data for that call leg from
sequence of partial records. Creation of partial records is independent on
received FCIs and thus valid free format data may be divided to different
partial records.
If field is missing then free format data in this CDR replaces all received
free format data in previous CDRs. Append indicator is not needed in the first
partial record. In following partial records indicator shall get value true if
all FCIs received during that partial record have append indicator. If one or
more of the received FCIs for that call leg during the partial record do not
have append indicator then this field shall be missing.

transparent HSCSD connections only);
\- a list of the channel codings accepted by the MS;
\- the maximum number of traffic channels accepted by the MS (this is noted in
the channels requested field);
\- the channel coding and the number of traffic channels actually used for the
call.
In case the network or user initiated modification procedure takes place
during the call, the AIUR requested, the channel coding used and the number of
traffic channel requested/used might be recorded in the Change of HSCSD
parameters field including the time at which the change occurred and which
entity requested the change.

APN can also be a wildcard, in which case the SGSN/MME selects the access
point address.
Following TS 23.003 [200], the APN field is specified in the CDR by two
variable strings. The first is the APN Network Identifier (NI portion) and the
second is the APN Operator Identifier (OI portion). The APN NI may contain one
or more label as described in TS 23.003 [200]. The APN OI is composed of three
labels. The first and second labels together shall uniquely identify the PLMN
operator (e.g. \"mnc\.mcc\.gprs\").
To represent the APN NI and OI in the PCN CDRs, the \"dot\" notation shall be
used.
See TS 23.003 [200] and TS 23.060 [202] for more information about APN format
and access point decision rules.
##### 5.1.2.2.2 APN Selection Mode

This field contains the short message Destination Number modified by the CAMEL
service.
  * CAMEL SMSC Address (S-SMO-CDR):
This field contains the SMSC address modified by the CAMEL service.
  * SCF address (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR, S-SMT-CDR):
This field identifies the CAMEL server serving the subscriber. Address is
defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.
  * Service key (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR, S-SMT-CDR):
This field identifies the CAMEL service logic applied. Service key is defined
in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.
  * Default Transaction/SMS Handling (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR, S-SMT-CDR):
This field indicates whether or not a CAMEL encountered default GPRS- or SMS-
handling. This field shall be present only if default call handling has been
applied. Parameter is defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription
information.
  * Free Format Data (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR, S-SMT-CDR):
This field contains charging information sent by the gsmSCF in the Furnish
Charging Information GPRS messages as defined in TS 29.078 [217]. The data can
be sent either in one FCI message or several FCI messages with append
indicator. This data is transferred transparently in the CAMEL clauses of the
relevant call records.
If the FCI is received more then once during one CAMEL call, the append
indicator defines whether the FCI information is appended to previous FCI and
stored in the relevant record or the information of the last FCI received is
stored in the relevant record (the previous FCI information shall be
overwritten).
In the event of partial output the currently valid \"Free format data\" is
stored in the partial record.
  * FFD Append Indicator (S-CDR, M-CDR):
This field contains an indicator whether CAMEL free format data is to be
appended to free format data stored in previous partial CDR. This field is
needed in CDR post processing to sort out valid free format data for that call
leg from sequence of partial records. Creation of partial records is
independent of received FCIs and thus valid free format data may be divided to
different partial records.
If field is missing then free format data in this CDR replaces all received
free format data in previous CDRs. Append indicator is not needed in the first
partial record. In following partial records indicator shall get value true if
all FCIs received during that partial record have append indicator. If one or
more of the received FCIs for that call leg during the partial record do not
have append indicator then this field shall be missing.
  * Level of CAMEL services (S-CDR, M-CDR):
This field describes briefly the complexity of CAMEL invocation. Categories
are the same as in circuit switched services and measure of resource usage in
VPLMN requested by HPLMN.

##### 5.1.2.2.6 Cell Identifier
For GSM, the Cell Identifier is defined as the Cell Id, reference 24.008
[208], and for UMTS it is defined as the Service Area Code in TS 25.413 [212].
##### 5.1.2.2.7 Charging Characteristics
The Charging Characteristics field allows the operator to apply different kind
of charging methods in the CDRs.\ A subscriber may have Charging
Characteristics assigned to his subscription. These characteristics can be
supplied by the HLR/HSS to the SGSN/MME as part of the subscription
information, and, upon activation of an IP-CAN bearer, the SGSN/MME forwards
the charging characteristics to the GGSN/S-GW according to the rules specified
in Annex A of TS 32.251 [11]. This information can be used by the PCNs to
activate charging generation and e.g. control the closure of the CDR or the
traffic volume containers (see clause 5.1.2.2.25) and applied charging
characteristics is included in CDRs transmitted to nodes handling the CDRs via
the Ga reference point. It can also be used in nodes handling the CDRs (e.g.,
the CGF or the billing system) to influence the CDR processing priority and
routing. These functions are accomplished by specifying the charging
characteristics as sets of charging profiles and the expected behaviour
associated with each profile.\ The interpretations of the profiles and their
associated behaviours can be different for each PLMN operator and are not
subject to standardisation. In the present document only the charging
characteristic formats and selection modes are specified.
The functional requirements for the Charging Characteristics are further
defined in normative Annex A of TS 32.251 [11], including an example for the
definitions of the trigger profiles associated with each CDR type.
The format of charging characteristics field is depicted in Figure 4. Each Bx
(x =0..15) refers to a specific behaviour defined on a per-Operator basis,
indicated as active when set to "1" value. See Annex A of TS 32.251 [11] for
guidance on how behaviours could be defined.
Figure 5.1.2.2.7.1: Charging Characteristics flags
##### 5.1.2.2.8 Charging Characteristics Selection Mode

  * Visiting default;
  * Roaming default;
  * APN specific;
  * Subscription specific.
In the S-GW/P-GW the allowed values are:
  * Home default;

  * Roaming default;
```{=html}
``` \- Serving node supplied.
NOTE: The value \'Serving Node Supplied\' is used if the CC what was received
from e.g. S-GW is used i.e. the one what comes during bearer activation.
Further details are provided in TS 32.251 [11] Annex A.
##### 5.1.2.2.9 Charging ID
This field is a charging identifier, which can be used together with P-GW
address to identify all records produced in SGSN(s), S-GW and P-GW involved in
a single IP-CAN bearer. Charging ID is generated by P-GW at IP-CAN bearer
activation and transferred to bearer requesting SGSN/S-GW. At inter-SGSN/S-GW
change the charging ID is transferred to the new SGSN/S-GW as part of each
active IP-CAN bearer.
In case of PMIP-based connectivity, the Charging Id is generated per PDN
connection.
Different P-GWs allocate the charging ID independently of each other and may
allocate the same numbers.\ The CGF and/or BS may check the uniqueness of each
charging ID together with the P-GWs address and optionally\ (if still
ambiguous) with the record opening time stamp.
##### 5.1.2.2.10 Destination Number
This field contains short message Destination Number requested by the user.
See TS 32.250 [10].
##### 5.1.2.2.11 Diagnostics
This field includes a more detailed technical reason for the releases of the
connection refer TS 32.250 [10]. The diagnostics may also be extended to
include manufacturer and network specific information.
##### 5.1.2.2.12 Duration
This field contains the relevant duration in seconds for IP-CAN bearer (S-CDR,
SGW-CDR, PGW-CDR, and attachment (M-CDR).\ It is the duration from Record
Opening Time to record closure. For partial records this is the duration of
the individual partial record and not the cumulative duration.
It should be noted that the internal time measurements may be expressed in
terms of tenths of seconds or even milliseconds and, as a result, the
calculation of the duration may result in the rounding or truncation of the
measured duration to a whole number of seconds.
Whether or not rounding or truncation is to be used is considered to be
outside the scope of the present document subject to the following
restrictions:
1) A duration of zero seconds shall be accepted providing that the transferred
data volume is greater than zero.
2) The same method of truncation/rounding shall be applied to both single and
partial records.
##### 5.1.2.2.13 Dynamic Address Flag
This field indicates that PDN address has been dynamically allocated for that
particular IP CAN bearer (PDN connection). This field is missing if address is
static. Dynamic address allocation might be relevant for charging e.g. as one
resource offered and possible owned by network operator.
##### 5.1.2.2.13a Dynamic Address Flag Extension
This field indicates that the IPv4 address has been dynamically allocated for
that particular IP CAN bearer (PDN connection) of PDN type IPv4v6, and the
dynamic IPv6 prefix is indicated in Dynamic Address Flag. This field is
missing if IPv4 address is static. Dynamic address allocation might be
relevant for charging e.g. as one resource offered and possible owned by
network operator.
##### 5.1.2.2.14 Event Time Stamps
These fields contain the event time stamps relevant for each of the individual
record types.
All time-stamps include a minimum of date, hour, minute and second.
##### 5.1.2.2.15 Void
##### 5.1.2.2.16 GGSN Address Used
This field is the current serving GGSN/P-GW IP Address for the Control Plane.
If both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address of the GGSN/P-GW are available, the SGSN
shall include the IPv4 address in the CDR.
##### 5.1.2.2.16A Void
(Void).
##### 5.1.2.2.17 IMS Signalling Context
Indicates if the IP-CAN bearer is used for IMS signalling. It is only present
if the IP-CAN bearer is an IMS signalling bearer. A IP-CAN bearer for IMS
signalling is determined via the \"IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag\" conveyed
via the \"Activate PDP context request\" message from the MS to the network
(refer to TS 24.008 ).
##### 5.1.2.2.18 IMSI Unauthenticated Flag
This field indicates that provided "Served IMSI" is not authenticated, and
relates to an emergency bearer established with IMSI as identifier (refer to
TS 23.060 [202] and TS 29.274 [223]). This field is missing if IMSI is

##### 5.1.2.2.23 LCS QoS
This information element defines the Quality of Service for a location request
as defined in TS 49.031 [227].
##### 5.1.2.2.24 List of Service Data
This list includes one or more service data containers. Depending the
reporting level of PCC rules one service data container either includes

The parameter corresponds to the Charging Key as specified in TS 23.203 [203].
**Charging Rule Base Name** is the reference to group of PCC rules predefined
at the PCEF. This field is included if any of the PCC rules, which usage is
reported within this service data container, was activated by using the
Charging Rule Base Name **as specified in TS 29.212 [220]. In case multiple
Charging Rule Base Names activate PCC rules, which usage is reported within
this service data container, the P-GW shall include only one occurrence to the
service data container.**
**Result Code** contains the result code after the interconnection with the
OCS. **This field may be added to the service data container if online and
offline charging are both used for same rating group. The result code in
service data container is the value of the Result-Code AVP received within
last CCA message in corresponding MSCC AVP to this service data container.**
**Local Sequence Number** is a service data container sequence number. It
starts from 1 and is increased by 1 for each service date container generated
within the lifetime of this IP-CAN bearer.
**Time of First Usage** is the time stamp for the first IP packet to be
transmitted and mapped to the current service data container. For envelope
reporting controlled by the Time Quota Mechanism, this indicates the time
stamp for the first IP packet to be transmitted that causes an envelope to be
opened -- see TS 32.299 [50].
**Time of Last Usage** is the time stamp for the last IP packet to be
transmitted and mapped to the current service data container. For envelope
reporting, controlled by the Time Quota Mechanism, this indicates the time
stamp for an envelope to be closed -- see TS 32.299 [50] for conditions for
envelope closure.
**Time Usage** contains the effective used time within the service data
container recording interval.
**Service Condition Change** defines the reason for closing the service data
container (see TS 32.251 [11]), such as tariff time change, IP-CAN bearer
modification(e.g. QoS change, S-GW change, user location change, user CSG
information change), service usage thresholds, service idled out, termination
or failure handling procedure. When one of the "CGI/SAI, ECGI or TAI or RAI
Change" are reported as user location change, the dedicated value in service
Condition Change is set instead of the generic "user location change" value.
This field is specified as bitmask for support of multiple change trigger
(e.g. S-GW and QoS change). This field is derived from Change-Condition AVP at
Service-Data-Container AVP level defined in TS 32.299 [40] when received on
Rf. Each value is mapped to the corresponding value in
"ServiceConditionChange" field. When simultaneous change triggers are met,
multiple Change-Condition values are set in field bitmask.When no Change-
Condition AVP is provided, the "recordClosure" value is set for the service
data container. For envelope reporting, the Service Condition Change value
shall always take the value \"envelopeClosure\". The mechanism for creating
the envelope is identified within the Time Quota Mechanism field.
**EPC Qos Information** in service specific service data containers contains
the QoS applied for the service. This is included in the first service data
container. In following container EPC QoS information is present if previous
change condition is \"QoS change\". T**he P-GW shall include only one EPC QoS
Information occurrence to one service data container.**
**Serving Node Address** contains the valid serving node (e.g.SGSN/S-GW)
control plane IP address during the service data container recording interval.
**Data Volume Uplink** and **Downlink,** includes the number of octets
transmitted during the service data container recording interval in the uplink
and/or downlink direction, respectively. In case of GTP based tunnelling, the
amount of data counted in P-GW shall be based on the payload of the GTP-U
protocol. In case of PMIP based protocol, the amount of data counted in P-GW
shall be based on the payload of the GRE tunnel. In case of DSMIPv6 based
protocol, the amount of data counted in P-GW shall be based on the payload of
the tunnelling layer. As minimum behaviour, the full payload shall be
included.
**Report Time** is a time stamp, which defines the moment when the service
data container is closed.
**Service Identifier is a** n identifier for a service. The service identifier
may designate an end user service, a part of an end user service or an
arbitrarily formed group thereof**. This field is only included if reporting
is per combination of the rating group and service id.**
**PS Furnish Charging Information** includes charging information per rating
group in case it is sent by OCS**.**
**User location information contains the user location (e.g. CGI/SAI,**
ECGI/TAI **or RAI) where the UE was located during the service data container
recording interval. This** is included in the service data container only if
previous container's change condition is \"user location change\" or one of
the "CGI/SAI, ECGI or TAI or RAI Change". Note the user location information
in PGW-CDR main level contains the location where the UE was when PGW-CDR was
opened.
**3GPP2 User Location Information contains the 3GPP2 user location (i.e.
3GPP2-BSID:** Cell-Id, SID, NID**) where the UE was located during the service
data container recording interval. This** is included in the service data
container only if previous container's change condition is \"user location
change\". Note the "3GPP2 user location information" in PGW-CDR main level
contains the location where the UE was when PGW-CDR was opened.
**User CSG information contains the** status of the user accessing a CSG cell
(CSG ID within the PLMN, Access mode and indication on CSG membership)
**during the service data container recording interval. This** is included in
the service data container only if previous container's change condition is
\"user CSG information change\". Note the \"user CSG information\" in PGW-CDR
main level contains the \"user CSG information\" when PGW-CDR was opened.
**AF-Record-Information includes the \"AF Charging Identifier\" (ICID for IMS)
and associated flow identifiers generated by the AF and received by the P-GW
over Gx interfaces as defined in TS 29.212 [220]. In case usage of PCC rules,
which usage is reported within the container, has different AF-Record-
Information then the P-GW shall include all occurrences to the service data
container.**
**Event Based Charging Information** includes the number of events and
associated timeStamps (each event is timestamped) during the service data
container recording interval.
**Time Quota Mechanism** contains two further subfields and is included if
envelope reporting is required:
> **Time Quota Type** identifies the mechanism by which time based usage
> should be reported -- as defined in TS 32.299 [50].
>
> **Base Time Interval** identifies the length of the base time interval, for
> controlling the reporting of time based usage, in seconds.
**Service Specific Info** holds service specific data for a pre-defined PCC
rule that is used for enhanced packet filtering.
##### 5.1.2.2.25 List of Traffic Data Volumes
This list applicable in S-CDR and SGW-CDR includes one or more containers.
In SGW-CDR containers are per QCI/ARP pair. This means that if QoS control
within one IP-CAN bearer is applicable in S-GW, there can be several
containers open at same time one per each applied QCI/ARP pair.
Each container includes the following fields:
**Data Volume Uplink, Data Volume Downlink, Change Condition and Change
Time**.
**Data Volume Uplink** includes the number of octets transmitted during the
use of the packet data services in the uplink direction. In MBMS charging,
this field is normally to be set to zero, because MBMS charging is based on
the volume of the downlink data. The counting of uplink data volumes is
optional. In S-CDR this field is not present when the SGSN has successfully
established Direct Tunnel between the RNC and the GGSN.
**Data Volume Downlink** includes the number of octets transmitted during the
use of the packet data services in the downlink direction. In S-CDR this field
is not present when the SGSN has successfully established Direct Tunnel
between the RNC and the GGSN.
**Change Condition** defines the reason for closing the container (see TS
32.251 [11]), such as tariff time change, QoS change or closing of the CDR. .
This field is derived from Change-Condition AVP Traffic-Data-Volumes AVP level
defined in TS 32.299 [40] when received on Rf. Each value is mapped to the
corresponding value in "ChangeCondition" field. When no Change-Condition AVP
is provided, the "recordClosure" value is set for the container. For User
Location Change, when one of the "CGI/SAI, ECGI or TAI or RAI Change" are
reported as user location change, the dedicated value in service Condition
Change is set instead of the generic "user location change" value.
**Change Time** is a time stamp, which defines the moment when the volume
container is closed or the CDR is closed. All the active IP-CAN bearers do not
need to have exactly the same time stamp e.g. due to same tariff time change
(variance of the time stamps is implementation and traffic load dependent, and
is out of the scope of standardisation).
**User Location Information** contains the location (e.g. CGI/SAI**,**
ECGI/TAI or RAI) where the UE is located and used during the transfer of the
data volume captured by the container (applicable only to the SGW-CDR).
**This** is included in the Traffic data container only if previous
container's change condition is \"user location change\". Note the user
location information in SGW-CDR main level contains the location where the UE
was when SGW-CDR was opened.
**User CSG information contains the** status of the user accessing a CSG cell
(CSG ID within the PLMN, Access mode and indication on CSG membership)
**during** the transfer of the data volume captured by the container**. This**
is included in the Traffic data container only if previous container's change
condition is \"user CSG information change\". Note the \"user CSG
information\" in S-CDR/SGW-CDR main level contains the \"user CSG
information\" when S-CDR/SGW-CDR was opened.
**EPC QoS Information** In case of IP-CAN bearer specific container this
contains authorized QoS for the IP-CAN bearer. First container for each
QCI/ARP pair includes this field. In following containers this field is
present if previous change condition is \"QoS change\". This field is
applicable only in SGW-CDR.
In S-CDR first container includes following optional fields: QoS Requested and
QoS Negotiated. In following containers QoS Negotiated is present if previous
change condition is \"QoS change\". In addition to the QoS Negotiated
parameter the QoS Requested parameter is present in following containers if
the change condition is \"QoS change\" and the QoS change was initiated by the
MS via a IP-CAN bearer modification procedure.
Table 5.1.2.2.23.1 illustrates an examplefor S-CDR but same principles are
applicable also for SGW-CDR. There are five containers (sets of volume counts)
caused by one QoS change, one location change, one tariff time change and one
Direct Tunnel establishment (direct tunnel change applicable in S-CDR only).

The amount of data counted in the S-GW shall be the payload of the user plane
at the S1-U/S4/S2interface. Therefore the data counted already includes the IP
PDP bearer protocols i.e. IP or PPP.
The data volume counted in the SGSN is dependent on the system. For GSM SGSN
the data volume is the payload of the SNDCP PDUs at the Gb interface. For
UMTS-SGSN it is the GTP-U PDUs at the Iu-PS interface. Therefore, in both
systems, the data counted already includes the overheads of any PDP bearer
protocols.
In GSM, in order to avoid that downstream packets transmitted from the old
SGSN to the new SGSN at inter SGSN RA update induce the increase of the PDP
CDR downstream volume counters in both SGSN the following rules must be
followed:
\- For PDP contexts using LLC in unacknowledged mode: an SGSN shall update the
PDP CDR when the packet has been sent by the SGSN towards the MS;
For PDP contexts using LLC in acknowledged mode, a GSM-SGSN shall only update
the PDP CDR at the reception of the acknowledgement by the MS of the correct
reception of a downstream packet. In other worlds, for inter SGSN RA update,
the new SGSN shall update the PDP CDR record when a downstream packet sent by
the old SGSN is received by the MS and acknowledged by the MS towards the new
SGSN through the RA update complete message.
In UMTS, the not transferred downlink data can be accounted for in the S-CDR
with \"RNC Unsent Downlink Volume\" field, which is the data that the RNC has
either discarded or forwarded during handover. Data volumes retransmitted (by
RLC or LLC) due to poor radio link conditions shall not be counted.

##### 5.1.3.1.17 GGSN Address
This parameter holds the control plane IP address of the GGSN that handles one
or more media component(s) of a IMS session. If GPRS is used to access the
IMS, the GGSN address is used together with the GPRS charging ID as the access
part of the charging correlation vector. The charging correlation vector is
comprised of an access part and an IMS part, which is the IMS Charging
Identifier. For further information regarding the composition of the charging
correlation vector refer to the appropriate clause in TS 32.240 [1].
##### 5.1.3.1.18 GPRS Charging ID
This parameter holds the GPRS charging ID (GCID) which is generated by the
GGSN for a GPRS PDP context. There is a 1:1 relationship between the GCID and
the PDP context. If GPRS is used to access the IMS, the GCID is used together
with the GGSN address as the access part of the charging correlation vector
that is comprised of an access part and an IMS part, which is the IMS Charging
Identifier.
For further information regarding the composition of the charging correlation
vector refer to the appropriate clause in TS 32.240 [1].
##### 5.1.3.1.19 IMS Charging Identifier
This parameter holds the IMS charging identifier (ICID) as generated by the
IMS node for the SIP session/transaction. The value of the ICID parameter is
identical with the \'icid-value\' parameter defined in TS 24.229 [210]. The
\'icid-value\' is a mandatory part of the P-Charging-Vector and coded as a
text-based UTF-8 charset (as are all SIP messages). For further information
regarding the composition and usage of the P-Charging-Vector refer to TS
32.260 [20], TS 24.229 [210] and RFC 3455 [404].
The ICID value is globally unique across all 3GPP IMS networks for a time
period of at least one month, implying that neither the node that generated
this ICID nor any other IMS node reuse this value before the uniqueness period
expires. The one month minimum uniqueness period counts from the time of
release of the ICID, i.e. the ICID value no longer being used. This can be
achieved by using node specific information, e.g. high-granularity time
information and/or topology/location information. The exact method how to
achieve the uniqueness requirement is an implementation issue.
At each SIP session unrelated method, both initial and subsequent (e.g.,
REGISTER, NOTIFY, MESSAGE etc.), a new, session unrelated ICID is generated at
the first IMS network element that processes the method. This ICID value is
contained in the SIP request and response of that SIP transaction and must be
valid for the duration of the transaction.
At each SIP session establishment a new, session specific ICID is generated at

# 6 CDR encoding rules
TS 32.297 [52] specifies the file based protocol for the \"Bx\" interface
between the CDR generating node, i.e. the Charging Gateway Functionality, and
the operator's Billing Domain (BD) (refer to TS 32.240 [1] for details on the
charging architecture). The following subclauses define
\- the various CDR encodings that are standardised within 3GPP,
\- a method how to indicate the encoding applied to the CDRs,
\- a version indication of the encoded CDRs.
The latter two items can be used by the system(s) in the BD to easily detect
the encoding version used. See TS 32.297 [52] for a detailed description on
how this information is used on the Bx interface.
## 6.1 3GPP standardised encodings
The contents of the CDRs sent on the Bx interface are defined by the ASN.1
language clause 5. A number of transfer syntaxes, or encodings, is specified
for use in 3GPP systems as follows. For the CDR transfer via the Bx interface,
as defined in TS 32.297 [52], the Basic Encoding Rules (X.690 [301]) encoding
must be supported by all 3GPP systems. Optionally, other additional CDR
encodings, i.e. Packed Encoding Rules (Recommendation X.691 [302]) and XML
Encoding Rules (Recommendation on XER [303]) may also be offered.
The encoding applied to the CDRs is indicated by means of the \"Data Record
Format\" parameter. The following \"Data Record Format\" values are used:
\- \"1\" signifies the use of Basic Encoding Rules (BER);
\- \"2\" signifies the use of unaligned basic Packed Encoding Rules (PER);
\- \"3\" signifies the use of aligned basic Packed Encoding Rules (PER);
\- \"4\" signifies the use of XML Encoding Rules (XER).
## 6.2 Encoding version indication
An indication of the version of the CDR definition and encoding must be
included in the CDR files transferred via the Bx interface specified in TS
32.297 [52]. This version indication consists of a Release Identifier and a
Version Identifier.
