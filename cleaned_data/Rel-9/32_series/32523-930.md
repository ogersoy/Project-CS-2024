# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

# 1 Scope
The purpose of this SON Policy Network Resource Model IRP: CORBA Solution Set
is to define the mapping of the IRP information model (see TS 32.522 [4]) to
the protocol specific details necessary for implementation of this IRP in a
CORBA/IDL environment.
This Solution Set is related to 3GPP TS 32.522 v9.3.X.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in TS 32.522 [4], TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR
21.905 [1] , in that order.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1], TS 32.522 [4] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in TS 32.522 [4], TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR
21.905 [1], in that order.

# 4 Architectural Features
The overall architectural feature of Self Organizing Networks (SON) Policy
Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP is specified in 3GPP TS 32.522 [4]. This
clause specifies features that are specific to the CORBA SS.
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 General mapping
Attributes modelling associations as defined in the NRM (here also called
\"reference attributes\") are in this SS mapped to attributes. The names of
the reference attributes in the NRM are mapped to the corresponding attribute
names in the MOC. When the cardinality for an association is 0..1 or 1..1 the
datatype for the reference attribute is defined as an MOReference. The value
of an MO reference contains the distinguished name of the associated MO. When
the cardinality for an association allows more than one referred MO, the
reference attribute will be of type MOReferenceSet, which contains a sequence
of MO references.
