# 5 Information Object Classes
This specification does not define its own classes. It uses those defined in
Home Node B Subsystem (HNS) [14].
# 6 Interface Definition
This document does not define its own Interface definition. It re-uses Alarm
IRP [11], FT IRP [13], Basic CM IRP [6] and Bulk CM IRP [7].
# 7 Mapping Function
## 7.1 General
## 7.2 Configuration management
### 7.2.1 HNB provisioning support (O)
This subclause applies to HNB case.
IRPManager needs to create an HNBProfile instance. Before doing so, IRPManager
a) Creates a dataset holding information that will be referred to by > the to-
be-created HNBProfile.configuration. IRPManager names this > dataset using the
File Naming Convention of Annex A of [13]. The > file name shall contain the
specificIRP_extension field which is > set to "HNB". The file schema is
defined in subclause 4.2.2 of > [9].
b) Prepares the value of the attribute criterion and attribute > userLabel of
the to-be-created HNBProfile.
c) Creates the HNBProfile instance using Basic CM IRP IS createMO of > [6] or
using Bulk CM IRP IS BulkCmCreateMo (Create MO > Sub-operation) of [7]..
In case Basic CM IRP is used for the instance creation, IRPManager reception
of:
  * A createMO positive response or a notifyObjectCreation means:
```{=html}
``` \- The instance has been created successfully;
```{=html}
``` \- A createMO negative response means:
```{=html}
``` \- The instance has not been created and the response can include the
failure reason.
In case Bulk CM IRP is used for the instance creation, IRPManager reception
of:
  * A notifyObjectCreation means:
```{=html}
``` \- The instance has been created successfully;
It is noted that in case Bulk CM IRP is used for the instance creation, the
BulkCMIRP can record the outcome of the instance creation attempt in the
session log. The IRPManager can obtain the session log (see clause 7.3.6 of
[7]) if it wants to determine if the instance is created successfully or not.
The above description is part of interaction 1.
IRPManager should not remove the dataset referred to by
HNBProfile.configuration as long as the HNBProfile instance exists. This is
because an IRPAgent may not make a local copy of the dataset during HNBProfile
instance creation and therefore needs to read the dataset during the HNB
registration.
IRPManager should not modify the dataset referred to by
HNBProfile.configuration as long as the HNBProfile instance exists. This is to
guarantee an IRPAgent behaviour that is independent of the IRPAgent
implemention choices, such as:
  1. IRPAgent creates its local copy of the dataset when the HNBProfile > is in existence and uses the local copy during HNB registration;
  2. IRPAgent does not make a local copy of the dataset but reads the dataset during HNB registration.
Interaction 2 is the interactions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.3-bis and 5.4-bis of
Clause 5.2.1 of [5].
Via interaction 5.1 (see Clause 5.2.1 of [5]), HNB informs IRPAgent- Serving
HMS of the HNB location, the HNB ID, etc, called (in the context of this
document) the registration information.
IRPAgent- Serving HMS identifies a stored HNBProfile.criterion that
corresponds to the registration information. It then identifies the
corresponding HNBProfile.configuration.
In case IRPAgent- Serving HMS identifies more than one stored
HNBProfile.criterion that corresponds to the registration information. It then
identifies the corresponding HNBProfile.configuration, IRPAgent- Serving HMS
would decide which HNBProfile.configuration would be used.
Via interaction 5.3 or 5.4-bis (see Clause 5.2.1 of [5]), IRPAgent -- Serving
HMS configures the HNB using the identified HNBProfile.configuration.
### 7.2.2 HeNB provisioning support (O)
This subclause applies to HeNB case.
This subclause is identical to 7.2.1 except:
  * 'HNB' is replaced by 'HeNB'
  * 'HMS' is replaced by 'HeMS'
  * References [5] and [9] are replaced by [8] and [10].
## 7.3 Fault management
### 7.3.1 Handling of "Expedited handling" and "Queued handling" alarms
HNB raises alarms of various categories, two of which are called "Expedited
handling" and "Queued handling". HNB uses TR-069 RPC Methods to send the
"Expedited handling" and "Queue handling" categories of alarms (see Clause
6.2.4 of [12]). HNB does not use TR-069 RPC Methods to send other categories
of alarms.
On reception of the HNB alarms sent by TR-069 RPC Methods, the mapping
function (F) shall process the alarm and decide if
a) There exists no AlarmInformation [11] in AlarmList [11] corresponding to
the newly received alarm or
b) There exists an AlarmInformation in AlarmList corresponding to the newly
received alarm. There is a difference in value of perceivedSeverity of the
newly received alarm and that of the corresponding AlarmInformation and the
former value is not Cleared.
c) There exists an AlarmInformation in AlarmList corresponding to the newly
received alarm. There is a difference in value of perceivedSeverity of the
newly received alarm and that of the corresponding AlarmInformation and the
former value is Cleared.
In case of a), a new AlarmInformation is added in the AlarmList. The
IRPManager, who has a subscription with NotificationIRP, is notified via
notifyNewAlarm if the added AlarmInformation satisfies the subscription filter
constraint.
In case of b), the corresponding AlarmInformation perceivedSeverity is
changed. The IRPManager, who has a subscription with NotificationIRP, is
notified via notifyChangedAlarm if the subject AlarmInformation satisfies the
subscription filter constraint.
In case of c), the corresponding AlarmInformation is removed from the
AlarmList if it has been acknowledged; else its perceivedSeverity is changed
to Cleared. The IRPManager, who has a subscription with NotificationIRP, is
notified via notifyClearedAlarm if the subject AlarmInformation satisfies the
subscription filter constraint.
