# Introduction

Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named HNS
Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP, through which an IRPAgent can communicate
configuration management information to one or several IRPManagers concerning
HNS resources. The HNS NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications defining
Requirements, a protocol neutral Information Service and one or more Solution
Set(s).
The present document specifies the HNS Network Resources IRP: CORBA Solution
Set, which defines the mapping of the IRP information model (see TS 32.772
[5]) to the protocol specific details necessary for implementation of this IRP
in a CORBA/IDL environment.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
For terms and definitions please refer to 3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 32.102 [3],
32.600 [4] and 32.772 [5].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:
CORBA Common Object Request Broker Architecture
DN Distinguished Name
IS Information Service
IDL Interface Definition Language
IRP Integration Reference Point
MO Managed Object
MOC Managed Object Class
NRM Network Resource Model
OMG Object Management Group
SS Solution Set
HNS Home Node B Subsystem
# 4 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of HNS Network Resources IRP is specified in
3GPP TS 32.772 [5].\ This clause specifies features that are specific to the
CORBA SS.
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 General mappings
Attributes modelling associations as defined in the NRM (here also called
\"reference attributes\") are in this SS mapped to attributes.\ The names of
the reference attributes in the NRM are mapped to the corresponding attribute
names in the MOC.\ When the cardinality for an association is 0..1 or 1..1 the
datatype for the reference attribute is defined as an MOReference. The value
of an MO reference contains the distinguished name of the associated MO.\ When
the cardinality for an association allows more than one referred MO, the
reference attribute will be of type MOReferenceSet, which contains a sequence
of MO references.
## 5.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
This SS supports reference attributes for relations other than containment
relations between objects. Reference attributes are therefore introduced in
each MOC where needed.
