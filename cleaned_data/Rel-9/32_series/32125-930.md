# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**32.121: Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):**
**Requirements**
**32.122: Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Information Service (IS)**
32.123: **Advanced Alarm Management (AAM)** Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set
**32.125: Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format definition**
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of IRPs and a related Name
Convention, which realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The
basic structure of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
For the purpose of AAM IRP, see TS 32.121 [2]
# 1 Scope
The purpose of Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) IRP is to define an interface
through which an IRPManager can categorize alarm notifications.
The present document is the AAM IRP XML file format definition, whose
semantics are specified in AAM IRP Information Service (3GPP TS 32.122 [3]).
This file format definition specification is related to TS 32.122 v9.0.X.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions that, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document in the same Release as the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
**IRPAgent:** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
**IRPManager:** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
**Alike Alarm** : Two alarms are considered alike, if the corresponding alarm
notifications are issued by the same object instance with the same alarmType,
same perceivedSeverity, same probableCause and same specificProblem (if
present).
**Lower Edge of Time Window** : The point in time which determines the begin
of a time span.
**Upper Edge of Time Window** : The point in time which determines the end of
a time span.
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element
NOTE: See [4]; in the scope of the present document.
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used
NOTE: See [4].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements
NOTE: See [4].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag
NOTE: See [4].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element
NOTE: See [4].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element
NOTE: See [4].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element.
NOTE: See [4].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value
NOTE: See [4].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD
NOTE: See [4].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas
NOTE: See [5], [6] and [7].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas
NOTE: See [8], in the scope of the present document.
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content
NOTE: See [5], [6] and [7].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type
NOTE: See [5], [6] and [7].
