# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; Test management Integration Reference
Point (IRP), as identified below:
32.331 \"Notification Log (NL) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements\".
32.332 \"Notification Log (NL) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information
Service (IS)\".
32.333 \"Notification Log (NL) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Common
Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\".
32.335 \"Notification Log (NL) Integration Reference Point (IRP); eXtensible
Markup Language (XML) solution definitions\".
**32.337 \"Notification Log (NL) Integration Reference Point (IRP); SOAP
Solution Set (SS)\".**
The present document describes the requirements and information model
necessary for Telecommunication Management (TM). The TM principles and TM
architecture are specified in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
A communications system is composed of a multitude of Network Elements (NE) of
various types and, typically, different vendors, which inter-operate in a co-
ordinated manner in order to satisfy the network users\' communication
requirements.
The occurrence of faults in an NE may cause deterioration or loss of this
NE\'s function. Fault Management is the functional area, which allows the
operator to detect the occurrence of faults in the network in real-time.
Configuration Management and Performance Management are two more functional
areas, which require the operator to be alerted to certain conditions in the
network.
A standard general-purpose mechanism for the management of logs containing
selected notifications from the network is required to provide an ability to
perform historical analysis on faults and conditions, which occurred in the
network.\ The TS 32.33x-series, constituting the Notification log IRP, sets
forth such a mechanism - and the present document contains the IS definition.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the SOAP SS for the IRP whose semantics is
specified in Notification Log (NL) IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.332 [5]).
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.332 V9.0.X.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1], 3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 3GPP TS 32.102 [3], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4],
3GPP TS 32.332 [5] apply. A term defined in the present document takes
precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
**notification category:** it refers to the set of notifications of one 3GPP
IRP Information Service specification\ A Notification Category is identified
by the name of the IRP specification and the IRP specification version number.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1], in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 3GPP TS 32.102 [3], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4], and the
following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document takes
precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].

# 4 Architectural features
## 4.1 General
The overall architectural feature of the Notification Log (NL) IRP is
specified in 3GPP TS 32.332 [5]. This clause specifies features that are
specific to the SOAP solution set.
The SOAP 1.1 specification [7] and WSDL 1.1 specification [9] are supported.
The SOAP 1.2 specification [10] is supported optionally.
This specification uses \"document\" style in WSDL file.
This specification uses \"literal\" encoding style in WSDL file.
The filter language used in the SS is the XPath Language (see W3C XPath 1.0
specification [8]). IRPAgents may throw a FilterComplexityLimit fault when a
given filter is too complex.
Relevant definitions are imported from the Notification Log (NL) IRP XML
definitions of 3GPP TS 32.335 [6].
This specification uses a number of namespace prefixes throughout that are
listed in Table 4.1. 1.

The WSDL structure is depicted in Figure 4.1.1 below, depicting port type,
binding and service. The port type contains port type operations, which again
contains input, output and fault messages. The binding contains binding
operations, which have the same name as the port type operations. The binding
connects to a port inside the service.

# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 Operation and notification mapping
The Notification Log (NL) IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.332 [5]) defines semantics of
operation and notification visible across the Itf-N. Table 5.1.1 indicates
mapping of these operations and notifications to their equivalents defined in
this SS.
Table 5.1.1: Mapping from IS Operation to SS Equivalents
* * *

NotificationIRPNtfPort M notifyOccupancyLevelCrossed notify (note 1)
NotificationIRPNtfPort M notifyLoggingResumed notify (note 1)
NotificationIRPNtfPort M NOTE 1: The IS equivalent maps to an XML definition
specified in 3GPP TS 32.335 [6], and this being an input parameter to the
operation notify under the port type ntfIRPNtfSystem:NotificationIRPNtf and
under the binding ntfIRPNtfSystem:NotificationIRPNtf of 3GPP TS 32.307 [11].
* * *
## 5.2 Operation parameter mapping
The Notification Log (NL) IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.332 [5]) defines semantics of
parameters carried in the operations. The tables below show the mapping of
these parameters, as per operation, to their equivalents defined in this SS.
