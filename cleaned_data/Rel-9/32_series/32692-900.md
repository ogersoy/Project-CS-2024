# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.690: \"Inventory Management (IM): Requirements\".
32.691: \"Inventory Management (IM) network resources Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Requirements\".
**32.692: \"Inventory Management (IM) network resources Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Network Resource Model (NRM)\".**
32.695: \"Inventory Management (IM) network resources Integration Reference
Point (IRP): eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format definition\".
Inventory Management (IM), in general, provides the operator with the ability
to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it evolves. IM
actions have the objective to monitor the actual configuration on the Network
Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and they may be initiated by the
operator or by functions in the Operations Systems (OSs) or NEs. The final
goal of IM is the establishment of an accurate and timely model of the actual
inventory in the NEs or NRs.
IM actions may be requested to reflect changes initiated by Configuration
Management (CM) actions or to make sure that the inventory model is in synch
with the actual inventory. IM actions are initiated either as single actions
on single NEs of the 3G network or as part of a complex procedure involving
actions on many resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines an Integration Reference Point (IRP) through
which an \'IRPAgent\' (typically an Element Manager or Network Element) can
communicate Network Management related information to one or several
\'IRPManagers\' (typically Network Managers).
The present document specifies an Inventory Management Network Resource Model,
NRM (also referred to as a Management Information Model - MIM) with
definitions of Information Object Classes.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [4] and the
following apply:
**association:** in general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects\ Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) name bindings;
(2) reference attributes; and
(3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams). Currently however, all (non-containment)
associations are modelled by means of reference attributes of the
participating MOs.
**Managed Element (ME):** instance of the Managed Object Class Managed Element
defined in [6]
**Managed Object (MO):** in the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource\ The MO is
instance of a class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has _attributes_ that provide information used to
characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term \"attribute\" is
taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to CIM).
Furthermore, the IOC can have _operations_ that represent the behaviour
relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from TMN and
corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of _notifications_ that provide information about an event occurrence
within a network resource.
**Management Information Model (MIM):** also referred to as NRM (see the NRM
definition)
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP\ An NRM identifies and describes the IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 Void
## 4.2 Compliance rules
The following defines the meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and
associations between IOCs, in Solution Sets to the IRP defined by the present
specification:
  * The IRPManager shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. > The IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to > mandatory as well as optional attributes/associations without > failure; however the IRPManager does not have to support handling > of the optional attributes/associations.
  * The IRPAgent shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. It > may support optional attributes/associations.
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5‑compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional managed object classes, attributes, associations,
operations, parameters and notifications without requiring the IRPManager to
have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that:
  * rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified; > and
  * many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may > exist;
it is recognised that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.

### 6.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information relevant for
this service. This clause provides the overview of all information object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these information object classes.
NOTE: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios.
Figure 6.2.1: Inventory Management NRM Containment/Naming and Association
diagram
Each IOC instance is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to
3GPP TS 32.300 [7] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example,
the DN of a IOC representing a InventoryUnit could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden,meContext=MEC-Gbg-1,ManagedElement=RNC-
Gbg-1,InventoryUnit=Inv-1.
### 6.2.2 Inheritance
This subclause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.
Figure 6.2.2 shows the inheritance hierarchy for the IM NRM.
