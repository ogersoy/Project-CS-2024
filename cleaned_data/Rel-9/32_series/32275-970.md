# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of documents that specify charging
functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS networks. The GSM/UMTS core
network charging architecture and principles are specified in 3GPP TS 32.240
[1], which provides an umbrella for other charging management TSs that
specify:
\- the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging),
\- the content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem (online
charging);
\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
subsystems;
> \- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
> charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events)
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].
The present document specifies the Offline and Online Charging for MultiMedia
Telephony (MMTel) service and supplementary services, based on the functional
description of MMTel in 3GPP TS 22.173 [200]. Charging for the following
supplementary services is specified:
  * **Communications Diversion (CDIV)**
  * Communication Hold (HOLD)
  * **CONFerence (CONF)**
  * Message Waiting Indication (MWI)
  * Originating Identity Presentation (OIP) **/** Originating Identity Restriction (OIR)
  * Terminating Identity Presentation (TIP) **/** Terminating Identity Restriction (TIR)
  * Call Barring (CB)
  * Explicit Call Transfer (ECT)
  * Communication Wait (CW)
  * Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
  * Completion of Communications by No Reply (CCNR)
  * Malicious Communication Identification (MCID)
  * Customized Alerting Tone (CAT)
  * Closed User Group (CUG)
  * Personal Network Management (PNM)
  * Customized Ringing Signal (CRS)
  * Reverse Charging
Charging of these supplementary services is performed at the respective MMTel
AS. The MMTel charging aspects are an extension of the basic IMS charging
capabilities as specified in the TS 32.260 [20].
This charging description includes the offline and online charging
architecture and scenarios specific to the MMTel, as well as the mapping of
the common 3GPP charging architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1] onto the
MMTel. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for offline
charging, and the charging events for online charging.

(S-CSCF, MRFC...) reflected in IMS online architecture.
# 5 MMTel charging principles and scenarios
There are a variety of multimedia telephony supplementary services implemented
at different IMS nodes. All the services should support subscription based
charging, and some also consumption based charging. The subscription based
charging is out of the scope of the present specifications.

## 5.1 MMTel charging principles
The MMTel charging encompasses the Multimedia telephony service (e.g.
multimedia conversational communications between two or more users, with
speech as a typical usage, and also others combinations of media) together
with the associated supplementary services charging aspects.
Every Supplementary services described in TS 22.173 [202] are subject to be
involved in MMTel charging function description.
MMTel service and supplementary services charging function focuses on charging
information provided by the CTFs supporting MMtel specific service charging:
calling user identification, called user identification, media component
characteristics and usage (speech only, speech with other component,
add/retrieve components..), supplementary services applied ...It enables to
apply different flexible charging based on supplementary service type and
options.
All the CTFs supporting MMtel specific service charging (AS) pertain to IMS
domain, and as explained in TS 32.260 [20], it is possible to correlate
session/transaction related charging data generated from these different Nodes
(AS), and others IMS Nodes involved in the session used for MMTel service
handling , based on IMS Charging Identifier (ICID).
### 5.1.1 Supplementary services invocation
#### 5.1.1.1 OIP charging
The OIP service provides the terminating user with the possibility of
receiving trusted (i.e. network‑provided) identity information in order to
identify the originating user.
The charging of the OIP subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling OIP
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.2 OIR charging
The OIR service is a service offered to the originating user. It restricts
presentation of the originating user\'s identity information to the
terminating user.
The charging of the OIR subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling OIR
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.3 TIP charging
The **Terminating Identification Presentation** (**TIP)** service provides the
originating party with the possibility of receiving trusted information in
order to identify the terminating party.
The charging of the TIP subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling TIP
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.4 TIR charging
The **Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)** is a service offered to
the terminating party which enables the terminating party to prevent
presentation of the terminating identity information to originating party.
The charging of the TIP subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling TIR
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.5 HOLD charging
The Communication Hold supplementary service enables a user to suspend the
media stream(s) of an established IP multimedia session, and resume the media
stream(s) at a later time.
The charged parties may be any of the Hold parties. These roles are:
  * Calling Party;
  * **Called Party;**
Editor's note: When one of the parties originates a new call to a third party
and the new call overbooks the bearer resource reserved by the held call,
overbooking may be taken into account in charging. The solution for that is
ffs
#### 5.1.1.6 CB charging
The **Communication Barring (CB)** service offers the following services:
  * The Incoming Communications Barring (ICB) is a service that rejects incoming communications that fulfil certain provisioned or configured conditions on behalf of the terminating user.
  * The Anonymous Communication Rejection **(ACR)** is a particular case of the ICB service, that allows barring of incoming communications from an anonymous originator on behalf of the terminating user.
  * The **Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB)** is a service that rejects outgoing communications that fulfil certain provisioned or configured conditions on behalf of the originating user.
The charging of the CB subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling CB in
offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.7 CDIV charging
The **Communications Diversion (CDIV)** services enables the diverting user,
to divert the communications addressed to the diverting user to another
destination.
There are three actors active in a CDIV service of one diversion with the
following roles:
  * **Diverting user; the party that initiates the diversion of an > incoming communication.**
  * **Originating user; the party which has initiated the communication > and that stays in the communication which is diverted;**
  * **Diverted to user;**
**In case there is another diversion, the user that was first the diverting
user (user B), will be the originating user in the second diversion. The
diverted to user of the first diversion (user C) will be the diverting user of
the second diversion.**
The charging of the diverting user for the B-C leg is measured by the MMTel AS
handling the CDIV service, i.e. by the MMTel AS of the diverting user (user
B). For the diverting user a separate charging dialog (online and/or offline
charging) is needed. Charging of the originating and the terminating user
(user C) is done in alignment with the TS 32.260 [20].
Typically the diverting user is charged for the forwarded leg (B-C leg),
however, normal roaming charging principles apply for the diverted to user
also in case of communication diversion. If there is another diversion, the
user that performs the second diversion (user C) is charged (typically) for
the new forwarded leg (C-D leg).
Charging at the S-CSCF is done in alignment with the TS 32.260 [20] but the
S-CSCF has no knowledge of the CDIV service.
#### 5.1.1.8 CW charging
The CW (Communication Waiting) service enables the application server to
indicate to the subscriber, that there is at least one new communication is
requested, and that no resources are available for that incoming
communication. The user has then the choice of accepting, rejecting or
ignoring the incoming communication. The maximum number of communications that
may be waiting is a service provider option. If the current number of
communications waiting is equal to the maximum, then any new attempted
incoming communication request shall be rejected with a busy cause.
The charging of the CW subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling CW in
offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.9 ECT charging
The Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT) service provides a party involved in
a communication to transfer that communication to a third party.
There are three actors active in a transfer, they are acting in the following
roles:
  * **transferor: the party that initiates the transfer of the active > communication that it has with the transferee;**
  * **transferee: the party which stays in the communication which is > transferred;**
  * **transfer target: the party which the communication is transferred > to and which replaces the transferor in the communication.**
The charging of the Transferor is measured by the MMTel AS handling the ECT
service for the Transferor. The charging of the Transferee is measured by the
MMTel AS handling the ECT service for the Transferee.
#### 5.1.1.10 MWI charging
The MWI service enables the application server to indicate to the subscriber,
that there is at least one message waiting. The indication is delivered to the
subscriber\'s UE after successful subscription to the Message Waiting
Indication service as described in the present document.
The charging of the MWI subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling MWI
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.11 CONF charging
The **CONFerence (CONF)** service enables a user to participate in and control
a simultaneous communication involving a number of users.
CONF Charging for the conference owner could be based on:
  * establishment of the conference
  * number of participants
  * duration
CONF Charging for the conference participants could be based on:
  * duration
The charging of the conference owners and participants is measured by the SIP
AS and MRFC handling conference service. For each participant (call leg) a
separate charging dialog (online and/or offline charging) at the SIP AS is
needed.
#### 5.1.1.12 CCBS charging
The CCBS (Completion of Communication to Busy Subscriber) service enables user
A, encountering a busy destination B, to have the communication completed
without the user having to manually initiate a new communication attempt when
the destination B becomes not busy.
When user A requests the CCBS supplementary service, the network will monitor
for destination B becoming free again.
When destination B becomes free again, the network will wait a short time in
order to allow the resources to be re-used for originating a communication. If
the resources are not re-used by destination B within this time, the network
will automatically recall user A.
When user A accepts the CCBS recall, the network will automatically generate a
CCBS call to destination B.
The charging of the CCBS suscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling CCBS
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.13 CCNR charging
The CCNR (Completion of Communications on No Reply) service enables user A,
encountering a destination B which does not answer the communication (No
Reply), to have the communication completed without the user having to
manually initiate a new communication attempt when the destination becomes not
busy after having initiated and completed a new communication.
When user A encounters a destination B which does not answer the communication
(No Reply), user A can request the CCNR supplementary service.
When user A requests the CCNR supplementary service, the network will monitor
for destination B becoming not busy after having initiated and completed a new
communication.
When destination B becomes not busy after having initiated and completed a new
communication, the network will wait a short time (as defined by the
destination B idle guard timer) in order to allow the resources to be reused
for originating a communication. If the resources are not reused by
destination B within this time, the network will automatically recall user A.
When user A accepts the CCNR recall, then the network will automatically
generate a CCNR call to destination B.
The charging of the CCNR suscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling CCNR
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.14 Flexible Alerting charging
Flexible Alerting (FA) causes a call to a "Pilot Identity" to branch the call
into several legs to alert several termination addresses (FA group members)
simultaneously. Additional calls may be delivered to the FA Pilot Identity at
any time. The first leg to be answered is connected to the calling party. The
other call legs are abandoned.
The FA group, identified by the "Pilot Identity" consists of a list of FA
group members alerted through their the public addressable identity.
The charging of the "Pilot Identity" is measured by the MMTel AS handling
Flexible Alerting for the "Pilot Identity".
#### 5.1.1.15 MCID charging
The MCID service enables an incoming communication to be identified as
malicious and registered.
The Network shall register the communication related information (such as
Terminating Identity Information, Originator Identity Information, Local Time
and Date...), which shall be kept under Network Operator's control (i.e not
available to the terminating entity nor the originating entity).
This service has two modes: permanent mode and temporary mode. The permanent
mode is active for all incoming communications, and the temporary mode is
active only for the incoming communications declared by the served user.
The MCID service can be invoked during the active phase of the communication,
or after the active phase for a limited period (but never after communication
termination) by the served user, or, automatically invoked during the alerting
phase.
The charging of the MCID subscriber is measured by the MMTel AS handling MCID
service for the called subscriber in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.16 CAT charging
The Customized Alerting Tone Service (CAT service) is an operator specific
service by which an operator enables the subscriber to customize the alerting
tone which is played to the calling party.
The charging of the CAT subscriber is measured by the MMTel AS handling CAT
service for the called subscriber, in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.17 CUG charging
The CUG service enables users to form groups of members, whose communication
profile is restricted for incoming and outgoing communications. Members of a
specific CUG can communicate among themselves but not, in general, with users
outside the group.
Specific CUG members can have additional capabilities that allow them to
initiate outgoing communications to users outside the group, and/or to accept
incoming communications from users outside the group. Specific CUG members can
have additional restrictions that prevent outgoing communications to other
members of the CUG, or prevent incoming communications from other members of
the CUG.
A specific user may be a member of one or more CUGs.
The charging of the CUG subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling CUG
service for offline and online charging.
#### 5.1.1.18 Personal Network Management Charging
The Personal Network Management (PNM) service allows a user to manage his UEs
in regard to terminating services according to preferences set by the user,
capabilities and availabilities of devices. Charging for the "PN UE
redirection" functionality of the defined PNM service, is considered in the
scope of MMTel supplementary service charging, and applies to the active UE
the terminating services are delivered to.
The charging of the PNM subscribers is measured by the MMTel AS handling PNM
in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.19 Customized Ringing Signal Charging
The Customized Ringing Signal (CRS service) is an operator specific service by
which an operator enables the subscriber to customize the ringing signal which
is played to the called party.
The charging of the CRS subscriber is measured by the MMTel AS handling CRS
service for the called or the calling subscriber, in offline charging only.
#### 5.1.1.20 Reverse Charging
The Reverse Charging at communication set up time service allows the
terminating party to be charged for the entire communication. The service,
requested by the originating party at communication set up time, is explicitly
indicated to the terminating party so he can accept or deny the reverse charge
communication request.
Editor's Note: no stage 3 description for Reverse Charging in this Release:
ffs
### 5.1.2 Supplementary services management by User
When an IMS supplementary service control can be provided to the UE as a
subscription option, every action performed by the user for this service
(Provision/Withdrawal, Registration/Erasure, Activation/Deactivation,
interrogation) may be subject to produce charging information, but this aspect
is out of the scope of the present specification.
## 5.2 MMTel offline charging scenarios
5.2.1 Basic principles
The MMTel offline charging functionality is based on the CTFs reporting
accounting information, by sending Diameter _Accounting Requests_ (ACR)
[start, interim, stop and event] to the CDF.
The circumstances on which the Diameter client uses ACR start, interim and
stop, or Events depend on the supplementary service type and is determined for
each of them. Further details are specified in clause 5.2.2.
These Diameter Accounting Request triggers may be configured in such a way
several MMTel supplementary services can be regrouped. Providing this
flexibility will allow to improve situations where several MMTel supplementary
services are handled within the same AS for complying with interactions
requirements associated to these MMTel supplementary services.
### 5.2.2 Diameter message flows
The flows described in the present document specify the charging
communications between the different CTF entities and the charging functions
for different charging scenarios. The SIP messages and Diameter transactions
associated with these charging scenarios are shown primarily for general
information and to illustrate the charging triggers. They are not intended to
be exhaustive of all the SIP message flows discussed in TS 24.228 [200] and
they depend on the Diameter Accounting Requests triggers configured by the
operator.
Although each MMTel supplementary service is described by separated flows
illustrating the dedicated trigger(s) for this MMTel supplementary service,
the Diameter Accounting Request triggers (as stated in 5.2.1), may be
configured with several MMtel supplementary services information.
#### 5.2.2.1 Message Flows - Successful Cases and Scenarios
Following message flows are defined in TS 32.260 [20], and can be re-used for
charging the basic multimedia telephony capabilities:
  * Session Establishment - IMS Origination
  * Session Establishment -- IMS Termination
  * Mid-Session Procedures
  * Session Release - Mobile Initiated

Application Server, implementing the CDIV service and CDF for a successful
communication forwarding on no reply.
Figure 5.2.2.1.7.1-1 : Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of CDIV
service - establishment
A communication is requested towards User B, user B has activated the CFNR
1) INVITE request incoming for User B. Based on the Initial Filter Criteria
(IFC) Rules, indicating that User B is subscribed to the CDIV supplementary
services, the communication is forwarded to an AS implementing AS implementing
CDIV. Then INVITE is forwarded to User B.
2) 180 ringing is sent back from User B.
3) The non-reply timer in the AS is started .
4) The timer expires.
5 to 7) The AS implementing the CDIV service performs the Call Forwarding No
Reply logic :release the communication to User B, and forward the call towards
user C (INVITE request including URI-C as destination).
8) The destination User C party answers and a final response is received.
9) Upon reception of the final response, the AS implementing the CDIV service
sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_ indicating
START_RECORD/EVENT_RECORD to record call forwarding execution (start of the
forwarded leg from User B to User C): basic communication information are
transferred with specific call forwarding information ( service mode= "CFNR",
associated number = " user B" as the user who invoked the call forwarding).
10) The CDF acknowledges the reception of the data and opens/creates an AS CDR
to record the forwarded leg from User B to User C.
NOTE : Although only the "call forwarding on no reply" case is depicted here ,
it serves as a basis for all other call forwarding modes description (Call
Forwarding Unconditional, Call Deflection, Call Forwarding on Busy, Call
Forwarding Not Logged-in ) for ACR generation : In all these cases, the AS AS
implementing the CDIV service sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-
Record-Type_ indicating START_RECORD to record call forwarding execution
(whatever the mode), when the final response is received from user-C.
###### 5.2.2.1.7.2 Communications Diversion (CDIV) -- release

record stop the call for which User B has been forwarded. The AS CDR is
closed.
##### 5.2.2.1.8 Communication Waiting (CW) Charging
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Server, which implements the CW service and CDF for the callee
(subscriber of CW).
Figure 5.2.2.1.8-1: Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of CW service

Request URI will include the URI of UE-B. After IFC evaluation in the S-CSCF
the INVITE request is routed to the CW AS.
2a). The AS detects the CW condition and inserts a CW indication into the
INVITE request per procedures.
3-4). The INVITE is routed to UE-B.
5). UE-B recognizes the CW indication per procedures.
6). UE-B sends back a 180 (Ringing) response.
6a). out of scope: user B uses the HOLD service or releases a session in order
to free resources]
7-8). The 180 (Ringing) response is routed back to the AS.
8a). The AS optionally inserts a Alert-Info with a \'CW\' URN into the 180
(Ringing) response.
9-10). The 180 (Ringing) response is routed back to the communication origin.
9a). The AS may initiate an announcement to the calling user that the
communication is a waiting communication, in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.628
[4].]
11-14). UE-B sends back a 200 (OK) response to the CW AS and CW AS sends it to
the S-CSCF.
15-17). The CW AS sends an Accounting-Request[Start]/Accounting-Request[Event]
to CDF, then the CDF opens/creates an AS CDR for the Communication Waiting
with CW indication on the AS CDR and returns Accounting Answer to the CW AS.
18). S-CSCF sends back a 200(OK) response to UE-A.
##### 5.2.2.1.9 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT)
###### 5.2.2.1.9.1 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT) : Blind Transfer
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Servers implementing the ECT service for the transferor and for
the transferee, and CDF: a successful Blind Transfert from User A to User C,
initiated by User B
For diagram simplification, only one CDF is shown.
Figure 5.2.2.1.9.1-1 : Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of ECT
service -- Blind Transfer (part1)
Figure 5.2.2.1.9.1-2 : Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of ECT
service -- Blind Transfert (part 2)
In this scenario User A is the transferee, User B is the transferor, and User
C is the transfer target.
User A and User B are in an established communication for which, based on the
Initial Filter Criteria (IFC) Rules indicating that User B is subscribed to
the ECT supplementary service, the INVITE was forwarded to an AS implementing
ECT (for User A and User B).
User B puts User A on Hold
1) User B sends REFER request in the existing A-B dialog, to initiate transfer
User A to User C.
2) this subsequent request is forwarded to the AS implementing ECT.
3) AS generates an "ECT Session Identifier" replacing User C as the new
destination information, for remaining in the loop, for transferor's role.
4) On REFER receipt, this request is forwarded the AS implementing ECT.
5) The REFER is accepted by User A, and 202 Accepted is transferred from User
A to User B.
6-9) User B sends BYE for terminating original INVITE with User A,
acknowledged by 200 OK from User A. AS B releases the media between User A and
User B which are on hold, then sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-
Record-Type_ indicating STOP_RECORD to record termination of the dialogue
between User A and User B.
10) More signalling between (User A,x-CSCF,AS-A ) and (x-CSCF,AS-B,User B) :
User A sends NOTIFY(100 Trying) associated to the received REFER, and User B
acknowledges by 200 OK
11) User A initiates a new session by sending an INVITE request with " ECT
Session Identifier" .
12) AS implementing the ECT service correlates this INVITE to the initial
session to be transferred and replaces "ECT Session Identifier" with User C
for creating an INVITE towards UE-C.
13) The destination User C party answers and a final response is received.
14) Upon reception of the final response, the AS implementing the ECT service
for the transferor, sends an Accounting-Request with Accounting-Record-Type
indicating START_RECORD/EVENT_RECORD to record Transfer execution.
15) The CDF acknowledges the reception of the data and opens/creates an AS
CDR.
16) Upon reception of the final response, the AS implementing the ECT service
for the transferee, sends an Accounting-Request with Accounting-Record-Type
indicating START_RECORD/EVENT_RECORD to record User A is transferred, with
specific indicator on the transferee's "subscriber role" (whether the
transferee was engaged in an originating call or in a terminating call) before
the transfer execution.
17) The CDF acknowledges the reception of the data and opens/creates an AS
CDR.
NOTE : The \"Consultative Transfer\" scenario mainly differs from the \"Blind
transfer\" on the transfer establishment phase : when User B has put User A on
Hold, User B establishes a communication towards User C and puts User C on
Hold, then User B initiates the REFER for the transfer triggering. The
Accounting-Record-Type indicating START_RECORD for recording Transfer
execution occurs at the same steps for both scenario: on the final response
associated to INVITE towards User C for the transferor and for the transferee.
###### 5.2.2.1.9.2 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT)) : Release
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Servers implementing the ECT service for the transferor and for

Transfer from User A to User C, initiated by User B.
Figure 5.2.2.1.9.2-1 : Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of ECT
service -- Release
1) User A initiates release of the communication
2-3) At session termination the AS implementing the ECT service for the
transferee, sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_
indicating STOP_RECORD to record stop the call for which User A has been
transferred.
4-5) At session termination the AS implementing the ECT service for the
transferor, sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_
indicating STOP_RECORD to record stop the call transferred by User B. The AS
CDR is closed.

Criteria (IFC) Rules, indicating that User B is subscribed to the CUG
supplementary services, the communication is forwarded to an AS implementing
CUG.
2) AS performs checks from the request received regarding User B CUG
subscription profile, and determines the CUG-communication is allowed for CUG
member User-B from User A: AS forwards INVITE towards User-B.
Note: In case the result from AS checks indicates non-CUG communication
behaviour (incoming access from non-CUG member...), non-CUG communication
charging applies.
3) SIP signalling for communication establishment.
4-6) 200 OK answer received from User B, and AS sends _Accounting-Request_
[Start/Event] message to CDF to record start of the CUG-communication for User
B CUG member. The CDF opens/creates an AS CDR and returns Accounting Answer.
#### 5.2.2.1.18 Personal Network Management
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Server implementing the "Personal Network Management" service and
CDF for a successful "PN UE redirection" for a terminating communication, as
described in TS 23.259 [218].
.
**Figure 5.2.2.1.18-1: Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of "PNM-
redirection" service.**
1) Incoming INVITE request for UE-1 of User B. Based on the Initial Filter
Criteria (IFC) Rules, for UE-1, the communication is forwarded to the AS
implementing PNM. From PN-user's PN configuration, the PNM AS determines the
initial request is to be redirected to the default UE of the PN, i.e. to the
UE-2.
2) INVITE is forwarded towards UE-2.
3) Based on the Initial Filter Criteria (IFC) Rules, for UE-2, the
communication is forwarded to the AS implementing PNM.
4) From PN-user's PN configuration, the PNM AS determines the initial request
is to be sent to the default UE of the PN, i.e. to the UE-2. INVITE is
forwarded towards UE-2.
5) The destination UE-2 party answers and a final response is received.
5) Upon reception of the final response, the AS implementing the PNM service
sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_ indicating
[START_RECORD/EVENT_RECORD] to record "PN UE redirection" execution to CDF.
6) The CDF acknowledges the reception of the data and opens/creates an AS CDR.
#### 5.2.2.1.19 Customized Ringing Signal (CRS)
Although CRS Supplementary services may be delivered according to different
models (download and play model, DTMF...) as described in TS 24.183 [219],
only one scenario is depicted here, and serves as a basis for CRS charging
description, as the same principle applies.
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Server implementing the CRS service and CDF for a successful
communication establishment with CRS delivery.
**Figure 5.2.2.1.19-1: Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of "CRS"
service delivery.**
A communication is requested towards User B, user B has subscribed to CRS
service.
1) INVITE request incoming for User B. Based on the Initial Filter Criteria
(IFC) Rules, indicating that User B is subscribed to the CRS supplementary
service, the communication is forwarded to an AS implementing CRS. The INVITE
is forwarded towards User B.
2) 180 ringing is sent back from User B.
3 to 4) Upon acknowledgment from User A (PRACK), the AS reserves CRS media,
and forwards PRACK towards User B.
5-6) Upon 200 OK(PRACK acknowledgment) from User B, the AS starts CRS media
playing, and forwards 200 OK towards User A.
7-10) Upon 200 OK answer received from User B, the AS stops CRS media playing,
and sends an Accounting-Request [Start/Event] message to CDF, CDF
opens/creates an AS CDR and returns Accounting Answer. The AS forwards 200 OK
towards User A.
NOTE: The same following principle applies for all others CRS delivery
scenarii: an _Accounting-Request_ [Start/Event] is sent from AS to record CRS
service delivery.
### 5.2.3 GTP' record transfer flows
As in IMS offline charging, GTP' is not used between CDF and CGF for MMTel
offline charging, because CDF and CGF are combined into CCF.
### 5.2.4 B~I~ CDR file transfer
For further details on the Bi protocol application refer to 3GPP TS 32.297
[52].
## 5.3 MMTel online charging scenarios
### 5.3.1 Basic principles
Online charging of MMTel services is done according to the general principles
of Diameter Credit-Control Applications (DCCA) as specified in TS 32.299 [50].
The CTFs implementing the MMTel online charging functionality may apply:
  * Immediate Event Charging (IEC) with CCR [event] generated, or
  * Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR), or Session Charging > with Unit Reservation (SCUR), both with CCR [Initial or > Termination] generated.
The circumstances on which IEC, ECUR or SCUR are applied, depend on the MMTel
supplementary service and/or operator\'s policy. Further details are specified
in clause 5.3.2.
### 5.3.2 Diameter message flows
The flows described in the present document specify the charging
communications between the different CTF entities and the charging functions
for different online charging scenarios. The SIP messages and Diameter
transactions associated with these online charging scenarios are shown
primarily for general information and to illustrate the charging triggers.
They are not intended to be exhaustive of all the SIP message flows discussed
in TS 24.228 [200] and they depend on the Diameter Credit Control Request
triggers configured by the operator.
Each MMTel supplementary service is described by specific flows illustrating
the dedicated trigger(s) for this MMTel supplementary service.
Following message flows are defined in TS 32.260 [20], and can be re-used for
charging the basic multimedia telephony capabilities:
  * Successful Session Establishment
  * Successful Session Establishment with Early Media Negotiation
  * Mid-Session Procedures
  * Session Release
#### 5.3.2.1 Message Flows - Successful Cases and Scenarios
##### 5.3.2.1.0 Interaction with IMS-GWF
As an MMTel principle, when Online Charging has to be applied for an MMTel
supplementary service, and the trigger list includes IMS-GWF together with
MMTel AS (implementing the MMTel supplementary service), filter criteria
should be configured to have the MMTel AS triggered before IMS-GWF, in order
to prevent improper charging.
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
MMTel AS, IMS-GWF and OCS, when online charging is applied for MMTel
supplementary service.
Figure 5.3.2.1.0-1: Message Sequence Chart for Online charging -- IMS-GWF,
MMTel AS and OCS
1) User-A initiates a session by sending INVITE request. Based on the Initial
Filter Criteria (IFC) Rules, indicating that User A is subscribed to the MMTel
supplementary service X, the communication is forwarded to an AS implementing
this service.
2-3) As "online charging" is activated for User A, the AS sends a Credit-
Control-Request (INITIAL_REQUEST, service X, ICID.) to the OCS for requesting
units for the X supplementary service.The OCS grants units in the Credit-
Control-Answer response for this request. The AS forwards INVITE via the
S-CSCF.
4) As "online charging" is activated for User A, IMS-GWF is triggered by the
S-CSCF, and IMS-GWF sends a Credit-Control-Request (INITIAL_REQUEST, ICID.) to
the OCS for requesting units for the session identified by ICID.
> 5-6) The OCS detects this request is within a session for which there is
> already an ongoing online credit control Diameter session (same ICID). Based
> on operator policy the OCS can use either Credit_Control_not_applicable to
> supersede online charging in S-CSCF or grant appropriate service units
> (GSU).
##### 5.3.2.1.1 Communications Diversion (CDIV)
###### 5.3.2.1.1.1 Communications Diversion (CDIV) -- successful establishment

Request (INITIAL_REQUEST, service CDIV, ICID..) to the OCS for requesting
units for the CDIV (CFU) supplementary service.
3) The OCS grants units in the Credit-Control-Answer response for this
request.
4) The CDIV (CFU) can now be delivered: an Invite is sent towards user C via
the S-CSCF.
5-6) On answer from User-C (200 OK), the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request
(UPDATE, USU) with possible already used units and requests new units to
continue.

FA supplementary service.
4) The OCS grants units in the Credit-Control-Answer response for this
request.
> 5) INVITE is sent towards User B via the S-CSCF.
>
> 6) Alerting phase signalling occurs with UE-A.
7) A parallel (from step 3 to step 6) scenario occurs towards User-C with
session identified by ICID-C.
8-9) Upon reception of the 200 OK answer from UE-C, AS sends CANCEL to other
FA group member being alerted (UE-B).
10) More signalling for CANCEL transactions
11-13) When the last CANCEL transaction is terminated, AS sends a Credit-
Control-Request (UPDATE, USU) with possible already used units, and requests
new units to continue the communication between User A and User C.
14) New units are granted via Credit-Control-Answer
15) 200 OK is propagated towards User A.

##### 5.3.2.1.5 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT)
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Server implementing the ECT service and OCS, when online charging
is applied to a successful Blind Transfert from User A to User C, initiated by
User B.
For diagram simplification, only one OCS is shown.
###### 5.3.2.1.5.1 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT): Blind Transfer with
sending REFER
Figure 5.3.2.1.5.1-1: Message Sequence Chart for online charging of ECT
service establishment -- Blind Transfer (part 1)
Figure 5.3.2.1.5.1-2: Message Sequence Chart for online charging of ECT
service establishment -- Blind Transfer (part 2)
In this scenario User A is the transferee, User B is the transferor, and User
C is the transfer target.
User A and User B are in an established communication, User B puts User A on
Hold.
1) User B sends REFER request in the existing A-B dialog, to initiate transfer
User A to User C. Based on the iFC, indicating that User B is subscribed to
the ECT supplementary service, the communication is forwarded to AS
implementing ECT.
2-3) As "online charging" is activated, the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request
(INITIAL_REQUEST, service ECT) to the OCS for requesting units for the ECT
supplementary service. The OCS grants units in the Credit-Control-Answer
response for this request. The AS generates an "ECT Session Identifier"
replacing User C as the new destination information and forwards REFER towards
User A.
4-5) As "online charging" is activated for User A, the AS sends a Credit-
Control-Request (INITIAL_REQUEST, service ECT) to the OCS for requesting units
for the ECT supplementary service for the transferee. The OCS grants units in
the Credit-Control-Answer response for this request. The AS forwards REFER
towards User-A.
6) More signalling between (User A, x-CSCF, AS-A) and (x-CSCF, AS-B, User B)
for REFER acceptation sequence and terminating previous media between User A
and User B.
7) User A initiates a new session by sending an INVITE request with "ECT
Session Identifier".
8-9) AS implementing the ECT service for the transferee correlates this INVITE
to the transfer being processed, and new units are requested by sending
Credit-Control-Request (UPDATE, USU) with already used units, for continuing
the service. The AS forwards INVITE request.
10-11) AS implementing the ECT service for the transferor correlates this
INVITE to the initial session to be transferred and new units are requested by
sending Credit-Control-Request (UPDATE, USU) with already used units, for
continuing the service, prior to forwarding INVITE towards UE-C.
12) The destination User C party answers, and a final response is received.
13-14) On transfer execution, the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request (UPDATE,
USU) with possible already used units and requests new units for transferor to
continue.
15-16) On transfer execution, the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request (UPDATE,
USU) with possible already used units and requests new units for transferee to
continue.
NOTE: For \"Consultative Transfer\" scenario, the same steps apply for
interactions with OCS for transferee and transferor: Credit-Control-Request
(INITIAL_REQUEST ...) on REFER initiating, intermediate Credit-Control-Request
(UPDATE...) for more units on INVITE for new session, and Credit-Control-
Request (UPDATE...) for more units on transfer execution when User C answers.
###### 5.3.2.1.5.2 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT): Blind Transfer with
3PCC
Figure 5.3.2.1.5.2-1: Message Sequence Chart for online charging of ECT
service establishment -- Blind Transfer with 3PCC
In this scenario User A is the transferee, User B is the transferor, and User
C is the transfer target, and the User B's AS acts as a 3PCC (Third Party Call
Control) initiating B2BUA:
User A and User B are in an established communication, User B puts User A on
Hold.
1) User B sends REFER request in the existing A-B dialog, to initiate transfer
User A to User C. Based on the iFC, indicating that User B is subscribed to
the ECT supplementary service, the communication is forwarded to AS
implementing ECT in a 3PCC mode.
2-3) As "online charging" is activated, the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request
(INITIAL_REQUEST, service ECT) to the OCS for requesting units for the ECT
supplementary service. The OCS grants units in the Credit-Control-Answer
response for this request.
4-5) AS B performs the REFER procedure with User B, and sends INVITE towards
User C.
6-8) On Provisionnal response from User C, the AS sends a Credit-Control-
Request (UPDATE, USU) with possible already used units and requests new units
for transferor to continue.
9) AS B sends Re-INVITE towards User A on existing dialog. From User A side,
the basic Re-INVITE procedure applies (ECT service not invoked).
10-13) On 200 OK response from User A, the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request
(UPDATE, USU) with possible already used units and requests new units for
transferor to continue, and sends ACK back to User A.
14-16) On 200 OK response from User C, the AS sends a Credit-Control-Request
(UPDATE, USU) with possible already used units and requests new units for
transferred communication to continue.
###### 5.3.2.1.5.3 Explicit Communication transfer (ECT): Release
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required between
Application Servers implementing the ECT service for the transferor and for
the transferee, and OCS: release from User A, after a successful Blind
Transfer from User A to User C, initiated by User B.
Figure 5.3.2.1.5.3-1: Message Sequence Chart for Offline charging of ECT
service -- Release
1) User A initiates release of the communication
2-3) At session termination the AS implementing the ECT service for the
transferee, sends a Credit-Control-Request (TERMINATION_REQUEST, USU) with
used units, for ending credit control.
4-5) At session termination the AS implementing the ECT service for the
transferor, sends a Credit-Control-Request (TERMINATION_REQUEST, USU) with
used units, for ending credit control.
NOTE: For \"Blind Transfer with 3PCC\" release scenario, only interactions
between AS-B and OCS apply for ECT service.

The content of MMTel CDR type is defined in the table in clause 6.1.3.3. The
field definition includes the field name, category and description. The
detailed field descriptions are provided in TS 32.298 [51].
The CDF provides the CDRs at the Bi interface in the format and encoding
described in TS 32.298 [51]. Additional CDR formats and contents may be
available at the interface to the billing system to meet the requirements of
the billing system, these are outside of the scope of 3GPP standardisation.
#### 6.1.3.2 CDR Triggers
Accounting information for MMTel services charging is transferred from the
CTFs supporting MMtel service charging to the CDF, using Charging Data Request
start, interim stop or Event messages, depending on MMTel service behaviour
(detailed in clause 5.2.2). Within the CDF, the CDRs triggering follows the
same principle as described for SIP sessions in _TS 32.260_[20] _: MMTel CDR
is opened upon_ reception of a Charging Data Request [start] message, closed
_upon_ reception of a Charging Data Request [stop] message, updated _upon_
reception of a Charging Data Request [Interim], and created _upon_ reception
of a Charging Data Request [event].
