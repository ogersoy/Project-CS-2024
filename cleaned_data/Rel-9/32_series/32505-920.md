# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.501: Self-Configuration of Network Elements; Concepts and Integration
Reference Point (IRP) Requirements
32.502: Self-Configuration of Network Elements Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Information Service (IS)
32.503: Self-Configuration of Network Elements Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)
**32.505: Self-Configuration of Network Elements Integration Reference Point
(IRP); eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format definition.**
# 1 Scope
The present document is the \"XML file format definition\" of Self-
Configuration IRP (SCIRP) for the IRP whose semantics are specified in Self-
Configuration IRP Information Service (3GPP TS 32.502 [2]).
This file format definition specification is related to TS 32.502 V9.0.X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
**IRPAgent:** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
**IRPManager:** See 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
**Self Configuration:** The process which brings a network element into
service requiring minimal human operator intervention or none at all.
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element
NOTE: See [3]; in the scope of the present document.
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used
NOTE: See [3].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements
NOTE: See [3].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag
NOTE: See [3].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element
NOTE: See [3].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element
NOTE: See [3].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element.
NOTE: See [3].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value
NOTE: See [3].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD
NOTE: See [3].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas
NOTE: See [4], [5] and [6].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas
NOTE: See [7], in the scope of the present document.
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content
NOTE: See [4], [5] and [6].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type
NOTE: See [4], [5] and [6].
