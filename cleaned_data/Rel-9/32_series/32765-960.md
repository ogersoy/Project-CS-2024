# 1 Scope
The present document provides the XML definitions for the E-UTRAN Network
Resource Model IRP IS [2].
An application of these XML definitions is to build a configuration file for
transfer with the Bulk CM IRP using either CORBA Solution Set of 3GPP TS
32.613 [3] or the SOAP Solution Set of 3GPP TS 32.617 [5]. For this
application, the basic part of the XML file format definition is provided by
3GPP TS 32.615 [4].
Other applications of these XML definitions are the SOAP solution sets of
other IRPs that perform operations on managed objects, for example the Basic
CM IRP SOAP SS of 3GPP TS 32.607 [6].
This specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.762 V9. 5.X.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element
NOTE: See [7]; in the scope of the present document.
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used
NOTE: See [7].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements
NOTE: See [7].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag
NOTE: See [7].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element
NOTE: See [7].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element
NOTE: See [7].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element
NOTE: See [7].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value
NOTE: See [7].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD
NOTE: See [7].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas
NOTE: See [8], [9] and [10].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas
NOTE: See [11], in the scope of the present document.
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content
NOTE: See [8], [9] and [10].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type
NOTE: See [8], [9] and [10].

## 3.3 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR
21.905 [1].
CM Configuration Management
GSM Global System for Mobile communication
IRP Integration Reference Point
IS Information Service
NRM Network Resource Model
XML eXtensible Markup Language
XSD XML Schema Definition
# 4 Architectural Features
The overall architectural feature of E-UTRAN Network Resource Model IRP is
specified in 3GPP TS 32.762 [2]. This clause specifies features that are
specific to the XML definitions.
The XML definitions of this document specify the schema for a configuration
content.
When using the XML definitions for a configuration file transfer with the Bulk
CM IRP, using either CORBA Solution Set of 3GPP TS 32.613 [3] or SOAP Solution
Set of 3GPP TS 32.617 [5], the basic part of the XML file format definition is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.615 [4]. The XML definitions of this document provide
the schema for the configuration content to be included in such a
configuration file.
When using the XML definitions with a SOAP solution set of any interface IRP
that perform operations on managed objects, for example the Basic CM IRP SOAP
SS of 3GPP TS 32.607 [6], the XML definitions of this document provides the
schema for the configuration content operated on by the interface IRP. Such
configuration content can be name of managed object and, if applicable, IOC
attributes.
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 General
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the IS.
An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding IOC\'s XML
element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the attribute\'s name
in the IS.
## 5.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
Annex A of the present document defines the NRM-specific XML schema
eutranNrm.xsd for the E-UTRAN Network Resources IRP NRM defined in 3GPP TS
32.762 [2].
XML schema eutranNrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types
for the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.615 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): XML schema (file name \"eutranNrm.xsd\")
The following XML schema eutranNrm.xsd is the NRM-specific schema for the
E-UTRAN Network Resource Model IRP NRM defined in 3GPP TS 32.762 [2]:
