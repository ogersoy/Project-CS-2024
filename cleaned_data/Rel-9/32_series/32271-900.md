# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of documents that specify charging
functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS networks. The GSM/UMTS core
network charging architecture and principles are specified in 3GPP TS 32.240
[1], which provides an umbrella for other charging management documents that
specify
  * the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);
  * the content of real-time charging events per domain / subsystem > (online charging);
  * the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains > and subsystems;
  * the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer > the charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.240
[1].
The present document specifies the LCS Offline and Online Charging description
for the LCS domain, based on the functional stage 2 description of the LCS in
3GPP TS 23.071 [201]. This charging description includes the offline and
online charging architecture and scenarios specific to the LCS, as well as the
mapping of the common 3GPP architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1] onto the
LCS domain. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for
offline charging and the charging events for online charging. The present
document is related to other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:
  * The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240 [1];
  * The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for these CDR types are specified in TS 32.298 [51].
  * A transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the network is specified in TS 32.295 [54].
  * The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network to the operator's billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation device) is specified in TS 32.297 [52].
  * The 3GPP Diameter application that is used for LCS domain offline and online charging is specified in TS 32.299 [50].
All terms, definitions and abbreviations, used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in 3GPP TR 21.905 [100]. Those that
are common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains, services, or
subsystems are provided in the umbrella document 3GPP TS 32.240 [1] and are
copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally,
those items that are specific to the present document are defined exclusively
in the present document.
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in 3GPP
TS 22.115 [102].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions defined in
3GPP TR 21.905 [100] and 3GPP TS 32.240 [1], and the following apply:
**accounting:** process of apportioning charges between the Home Environment,
Serving Network and Subscriber.
**billing:** function whereby CDRs generated by the charging function(s) are
transformed into bills requiring payment.
**Billing Domain:** part of the operator network, which is outside the
telecommunications network, that receives and processes CDR files from the
network charging functions. It includes functions that can provide billing
mediation and billing or other (e.g. statistical) end applications. It is only
applicable to offline charging (see "Online Charging System" for equivalent
functionality in online charging).
**CDR field categories:** the CDR fields are defined in the present document.
They are divided into the following categories:
  * Mandatory (**M**): field that shall always be present in the CDR.
  * Conditional (**C**): field that shall be present in a CDR if certain > conditions are met.
  * Operator Provisionable: Mandatory (**O~m~**): A field that operators > have provisioned to always be included in the CDR.
  * Operator Provisionable: Conditional (**O~c~**): A field that > operators have provisioned to be included in the CDR if certain > conditions are met.
**chargeable event:** activity utilizing telecommunications network resources
and related services for:
  * user to user communication (e.g. a single call, a data communication > session or a short message); or
  * user to network communication (e.g. service profile administration); > or
  * inter-network communication (e.g. transferring calls, signalling, or > short messages); or
  * mobility (e.g. roaming or inter-system handover); and
  * that the network operator may want to charge for.
As a minimum, a chargeable event characterises the resource / service usage
and indicates the identity of the involved end user(s).**charging:** a
function within the telecommunications network and the associated OCS/BD
components whereby information related to a chargeable event is collected,
formatted, transferred and evaluated in order to make it possible to determine
usage for which the charged party may be billed.
**Charging Data Record (CDR):** a formatted collection of information about a
chargeable event (e.g. time of call set-up, duration of the call, amount of
data transferred, etc) for use in billing and accounting. For each party to be
charged for parts of or all charges of a chargeable event a separate CDR shall
be generated, i.e. more than one CDR may be generated for a single chargeable
event, e.g. because of its long duration, or because more than one charged
party is to be charged.
**charging event: a set of charging information forwarded by the CTF towards
the CDF (offline charging) or towards the OCS (online charging). Each charging
event matches exactly one chargeable event.**
**charging function:** entity inside the network domain, subsystem or service
that is involved in charging for that domain, subsystem or service.
**circuit switched domain:** domain within GSM / UMTS in which information is
transferred in circuit switched mode.
**credit control:** Editor\'s note: FFS.
**domain:** part of a communication network that provides network resources
using a certain bearer technology.
**Fully Qualified Partial CDR (FQPC):** partial CDR that contains a complete
set of the fields specified in the present document. This includes all the
mandatory and conditional fields as well as those fields that the PLMN
operator has provisioned to be included in the CDR. The first Partial CDR
shall be a Fully qualified Partial CDR.
**LCS Client:** software and/or hardware entity that interacts with a LCS
Server for the purpose of obtaining location information for one or more
Mobile Stations\ LCS Clients subscribe to LCS in order to obtain location
information. LCS Clients may or may not interact with human users. The LCS
Client is responsible for formatting and presenting data and managing the user
interface (dialogue). The LCS Client may reside in the Mobile Station (UE).
**LCS Server:** software and/or hardware entity offering LCS capabilities. The
LCS Server accepts requests, services requests, and sends back responses to
the received requests\ The LCS server consists of LCS components, which are
distributed to one or more PLMN and/or service provider.
**Location Based Service (LBS):** service provided either by teleoperator or a
3^rd^ party service provider that utilizes the available location information
of the terminal\ Location Application offers the User Interface for the
service. LBS is either a pull or a push type of service (see Location
Dependent Services and Location Independent Services). In ETSI/GSM
documentation of SoLSA, LBS is called \"Location Related Service\". ETSI
and/or 3GPP -wide terminology harmonization is expected here.
**location estimate:** geographic location of an UE and/or a valid Mobile
Equipment (ME), expressed in latitude and longitude data\ The Location
Estimate shall be represented in a well-defined universal format. Translation
from this universal format to another geographic location system may be
supported, although the details are considered outside the scope of the
primitive services.
**middle tier (charging) TS: used for the 3GPP charging TSs that specify the
domain / subsystem / service specific, online and offline, charging
functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from 3GPP TS
32.250 to 3GPP TS 32.279, e.g. 3GPP TS 32.250 [10] for the CS domain, or 3GPP
TS 32.270 [30] for the MMS service. Currently, there is only one \"tier 1\" TS
in 3GPP, which is TS 32.240 [1] that specifies the charging architecture and
principles. Finally, there are a number of top tier TSs in the 32.29x
numbering range ([50] ff) that specify common charging aspects such as
parameter definitions, encoding rules, the common billing domain interface or
common charging applications.**
**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **does
not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered.
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the
charging mechanism with bearer/session/service control is required.
**Online Charging System:** Editor\'s note: FFS.
**packet switched domain:** domain within GSM / UMTS in which data is
transferred in packet switched mode. Corresponds to the term \"GPRS\".
**partial CDR:** CDR that provides information on part of a subscriber
session. A long session may be covered by several partial CDRs. Two formats
are considered for Partial CDRs. One that contains all of the specified fields
_(FQPC)_ ; the second has a reduced format _(RPC)_.
**Positioning method (/locating method):** method or technical solution, which
is used to get an estimate of the target mobile\'s geographical location
EXAMPLE: Positioning methods based on radio cell coverage, GPS or Assisted GPS
methods, which are based on the Time-Of-Arrival (TOA) algorithm, and OTDOA or
E-OTD methods, which are based on the Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA)
algorithm. The positioning methods are further described in UTRAN Stage 2,
3GPP TS 25.305 [203] and GERAN Stage 2, 3GPP TS 43.059 [204].
**target UE:** UE being positioned
**user:** an entity, not part of the 3GPP System, that uses **network
resources by means of a subscription. The user may or may not be identical to
the subscriber holding that subscription.**
**User Equipment (UE):** a device allowing a user access to network services.
For the purpose of 3GPP specifications the interface between the UE and the
network is the radio interface. A User Equipment can be subdivided into a
number of domains, the domains being separated by reference points. Currently
defined domains are the USIM and ME Domains. The ME Domain can further be
subdivided into several components showing the connectivity between multiple
functional groups. These groups can be implemented in one or more hardware
devices. An example of such a connectivity is the TE -- MT interface. Further,
an occurrence of a User Equipment is an MS for GSM as defined in GSM TS
04.02.UE in the present document may also refer to a Mobile Equipment or User
Equipment used for emergency calls, that do not have valid SIM or USIM.

# 4 Architecture considerations
## 4.1 High level LCS architecture
Figure 4.1 depicts the logical LCS architecture, as described in3GPP TS 23.271
[201].
Figure 4.1: LCS logical architecture with inter-GMLC [Lr] interface
As can be seen in figure 4.1, the following LCS elements are relevant for
charging:
\- VGMLC,
\- HGMLC
\- RGMLC.
Editor\'s note: Add a statement stating that the SGSN and the MSC have also a
role in the LCS Charging and that the associated LCS Charging functionality is
described in TS 32.250 and TS 32.251
## 4.2 LCS offline charging architecture
As described in TS 32.240 [1], the CTF (an integrated component in each
charging relevant NE) generates charging events and forwards them to the CDF.
The CDF, in turn, generates CDRs which are then transferred to the CGF.
Finally, the CGF creates CDR files and forwards them to the Billing Domain.
In LCS, all charging functions (CTF, CDF and CGF) reside within the LCS R/S.
I.e. the GMLC is connected directly to the Billing Domain via the Bl
interface. Bl is the LCS specific variant of the common Bx interface. This
architecture implies that there exists no separate CDF and CGF for LCS, i.e.
no corresponding open interfaces between any such functions, within the 3GPP
standards.
Figure 4.2 depicts the mapping of the 3GPP common charging architecture, as
laid down in 3GPP TS 32.240 [1], onto the LCS.
Editor\'s note: A clarification for the LCS offline charging reference point
is in discussion
Figure 4.2: LCS offline charging architecture
In addition to the standard approach depicted in figure 4.2, vendors may
choose to implement separate CDF and CGF for LCS. In that case, the interfaces
between these functions should comply with the definition of the Rf and Ga
interfaces (3GPP TS 32.299 [50] and 3GPP TS 32.295 [54], respectively) as much
as possible.
## 4.3 LCS online charging architecture
LCS online charging is based on GMLC functionality that is further specified
in the present document. For online charging, the GMLC utilises the Ro
interface and application towards the OCS as specified in TS 32.299 [50]. The
Ro reference point covers all online charging functionality required for LCS.
The LCS online charging architecture is depicted in figure 4.3.
Figure 4.3: LCS online charging architecture
Details on the interfaces and functions can be found in TS 32.240 [1] for the
general architecture components, TS 32.296 [53] for the OCS, and TS 32.299
[50] for the Ro application.
# 5 LCS charging principles and scenarios
Editor\'s note: Include a brief introduction statement saying that this clause
contains the CDR and charging event types and their trigger conditions.
## 5.1 LCS charging principles
Charging information in the Service domain for LCS is collected for inter-
operator charging purpose by the GMLC. The basic principle is that a network
requesting location information may be charged by the network that provides
the location information.
The GMLC shall collect the following charging information:
  * Identity of the mobile subscriber to be located and of the entity > requesting the location;
  * Identity of the GMLC or PLMN serving the LCS Client;
  * QoS Requested/Delivered: the charging information shall describe the > quality of the location requested and delivered to the LCS client;
  * Request Timestamp: the charging information shall record the date > and time the location procedure was requested by the LCS client;
  * Location services requested: the charging information shall describe > the service types for which the LCS client is allowed to locate > the particular UE;
  * Usage of continuous/periodic tracking;
  * Charging for Location Based Services (LBS): the charging information > shall describe the service specific information in addition to the > above location resource information.
The information listed above is captured for use cases in relation to:
  * Mobile Originated Location Request;
  * Mobile Terminated Location Request;
  * Network Induced Location Request;
Refer to TS 23.271 [201] for further details on the above LCS transactions.
## 5.2 LCS offline charging scenarios
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
Editor\'s note: TBD.
### 5.2.2 Rf message flows
Not applicable, as the separation of the CTF and CDF is not in the scope of
the LCS charging standards. Refer to clause 4.2 for further information.
Note: Vendors may nevertheless implement a separate CTF and CDF for LCS
charging. In this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen conforms to
the principles and protocol applications specified in TS 32.299 [50].
### 5.2.3 CDR Generation
Editor\'s note: This section shall also include the triggers of the CDR
generation, the CDR types
The flows described in the present document specify the charging
communications between the GMLC and the billing function for different
charging scenarios. The LCS related messages associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to illustrate the
charging triggers.
For the purpose of these examples, the following assumptions have been made:
  * that the RAN location procedures are not depicted;
  * that the CS and PS location procedures are not distinguished;
  * that the LCS client has no privacy override capability;
  * that the LCS charging procedures in the CS and the PS domains are > not depicted
#### 5.2.3.1 Mobile originated location request (MO-LR)
Mobile Originated location request allows the UE to obtain its own
geographical location or have its location information transferred to another
LCS client. In this procedure, the R-GMLC, H-GMLC and V-GMLC are the same as
no privacy checking is performed.
Figure 5.2.3.1 illustrates a Mobile Originated Location Request that allows a
UE to request its own location.
Figure 5.2.3.1: Record trigger overview for MO-LR
1\. The MSC (or SGSN) receives a Location Service Invoke from the UE
2\. The MSC (or SGSN) forwards the Location result to the GMLC by sending a
MAP Subscriber Location Report
3\. The GMLC transfers the location information to the LCS client.
4\. The LCS Client sends to the GMLC the Location Information ack message
signalling the result.
5\. The GMLC acknowledges the MAP Subscriber Location Report and the
associated MO-LR CDR is processed as specified in TS 32.297 [52].
6\. The MSC (or SGSN) returns a Service Response message to the UE carrying
any location estimate requested by the UE
The record trigger associated to the MO-LR is called \'LCS GMLC Mobile
Originated\' (LCS-GMO)
#### 5.2.3.2 Mobile terminated location request (MT-LR)
Mobile terminated location request allows an external LCS client to ask for
the location of a mobile subscriber (target UE).
Figure 5.2.3.2 illustrates a Mobile Terminated Location Request scenario:
Figure 5.2.3.2: Record trigger overview for MT-LR
1\. The external LCS client requests the location of a target UE from the
R-GMLC
2\. The R-GMLC requests the H-GMLC address by sending a MAP Send Routing Info
for LCS message to the home HLR/HSS of the target UE to be located
3\. The HLR/HSS returns a MAP Send Routing Info for LCS ack message that
contains the H-GMLC address
4\. The R-GMLC forwards the Location Service Request to the H-GMLC
5\. After performing privacy check, the H-GMLC requests the V-GMLC address by
sending a MAP Send Routing Info for LCS message to the home HLR/HSS
6\. The HLR/HSS returns a MAP Send Routing Info for LCS ack message that
contains the V-GMLC address
7\. The H-GMLC forwards the Location Service Request to the V-GMLC
8\. The V-GMLC forwards the Location request to the MSC or SGSN by sending a
MAP Provider Subscriber Location Report
9\. After either a CS-MT-LR or PS-MT-LR was processed, the MSC or SGSN sends
the acknowledgement of the MAP Provider Subscriber Location Report
> The associated LCS VGMT CDR is processed as specified in TS 32.297 [52]
10\. The V-GMLC sends the location service response to the H-GMLC. After the
H-GMLC has performed privacy check, the associated LCS HGMT CDR is processed
as specified in TS 32.297 [52]
11\. The H-GMLC sends the location service response to the R-GMLC and the
associated LCS RGMT CDR is processed as specified in TS 32.297 [52].
12\. The R-GMLC returns a Service Response message to the LCS client carrying
any location estimate requested by the LCS client
#### 5.2.3.3 Network induced location request (NI-LR)
Network induced location request allows positioning for an emergency service
call.
Figure 5.2.3.3 illustrates a Network Induced Location Request scenario:
Figure 5.2.3.3: Record trigger overview for NI-LR
1\. An emergency call procedure is initiated between the UE and the LCS client
2\. Positioning procedures are instigated
3\. The MSC (or SGSN) forwards the Location request to the GMLC by sending a
MAP Subscriber Location Report
4\. The GMLC acknowledges the MAP Subscriber Location Report
5\. The GMLC transfers the location information to the LCS client and the
associated LCS-GNI-CDR is processed as specified in TS 32.297 [52].
6\. At some later time, the emergency services call is released.
### 5.2.4 Ga record transfer flows
Not applicable, as the separation of the CDF and CGF is not in the scope of
the LCS charging standards. Refer to clause 4.3 for further information.
NOTE: Vendors may nevertheless implement a separate CDF and CGF for LCS
charging. In this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen conforms to
the principles and protocol applications specified in TS 32.295 [54].
### 5.2.5 B~L~ CDR file transfer
The integrated CGF of the GMLC transfers the CDR files to the BD as described
in TS 32.297 [52]. In LCS, both fully qualified partial CDRs (FQPC) and
reduced partial CDRs (RPC), as specified in TS 32.240 [1] may be supported on
the Bl interface. In line with TS 32.240 [13], the support of FQPCs is
mandatory, the support of RPCs is optional. For further details on the Bl
protocol application refer to TS 32.297 [52].
## 5.3 LCS online charging scenarios
LCS online charging uses the credit control application as specified in TS
32.299 [50].
### 5.3.1 Basic principles
Editors Note: This section should be updated and aligned with 32.299. Some of
this text will go into 32.299 and removed from this TS.
Two cases for online charging are distinguished:
â€¢ Immediate Event Charging (IEC); and
â€¢ event charging with unit reservation (ECUR).
In the case of Immediate Event Charging (IEC), granting units to the GMLC is
performed in a single operation that also includes the deduction of the
corresponding monetary units from the subscriber\'s account. The charging
process is controlled by the corresponding credit control request which is
sent for a given credit control event.
In contrast, Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) also includes the
process of requesting, reserving units and releasing and returning unused
units. The deduction of the corresponding monetary units then occurs upon
conclusion of the ECUR transaction. In this case, the credit control request
is used to control the credit control session.
The GMLC may apply either IEC, where CCR event messages are generated, or
ECUR, using CCR Initial, Termination and Update. The decision whether to apply
IEC or ECUR is based on the service and/or operator\'s policy.
NOTE: To the extent possible alignment with IETF RFC 4006 [402] is planned.
Editor\'s note: Modify the text above with LCS specific description on what
the GMLC requests from the ECF
### 5.3.2 Ro message flows
The message flows described in the present document specify the charging
communications between the GMLC and the Online Charging System (OCS) for
different charging scenarios. The LCS messages associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to illustrate the
charging triggers that are also used for LCS offline charging.
#### 5.3.2.1 Mobile originated Location Request (MO-LR)
Figure 5.3.2.1 shows the credit control transactions that are required between
GMLC and OCS during the mobile originated location request. In this scenario
the UE is the party to charge for the location request.
Figure 5.3.2.1: LCS Online charging scenario for MO-LR
#### 5.3.2.2 Mobile Terminated Location Request (MT-LR)
Figure 5.3.2.2 shows the credit control transactions that are required between
GMLC and OCS during the mobile terminated location request.
Figure 5.3.2.2: LCS Online charging scenario for MT-LR
# 6 Definition of charging information
This clause provides Stage 3 specifications of the CDR type and content in
line with the CDR type definitions provided in clause 5.2.3 and Diameter
Credit Control messages for LCS
## 6.1 Data description for LCS offline charging
Dedicated types of CDRs can be generated for LCS by the GMLC. The content of
each CDR type is defined in one of the tables that are part of this clause.
For each CDR type the parameter definition includes the parameter name,
description and category.
Equipment vendors shall be able to provide all of the parameters listed in the
CDR content table in order to claim compliance with the present document.
However, since CDR processing and transport consume network resources,
operators may opt to eliminate some of the parameters that are not essential
for their operation. This operator provisionable reduction is specified by the
parameter category.
A parameter category can have one of two primary values:
> **M** This parameter is **M** andatory and shall always be present in the
> Diameter messages/CDR.
>
> **C** This parameter shall be present in the Diameter message/CDR only when
> certain Conditions are met. These Conditions are specified as part of the
> parameter definition.
Some of these parameters are designated as Operator provisionable (**O**).
Using TMN management functions or specific tools provided by an equipment
vendor, operators may choose to include or omit the parameter from the
charging event/CDR. Once omitted, this parameter is not generated in a CDR of
the particular type.. To avoid any potential ambiguity, the CTF/CDF/CGF MUST
be able to provide all these parameters. Only an operator can choose whether
or not these parameters should be generated in its system, i.e. included in
the charging Diameter message/CDR.
Those parameters that the operator configures to be present or absent are
further qualified with the \"Operator provisionable\" indicator as follows:
> **Om** This is a parameter that, if provisioned by the operator to be
> present, shall always be included in the Diameter messages/CDRs. In other
> words, an **Om** parameter that is provisioned to be present is a mandatory
> parameter.
