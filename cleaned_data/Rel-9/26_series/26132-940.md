# Introduction
The present document specifies test methods to allow the minimum performance
requirements for the acoustic characteristics of GSM and 3G terminals when
used to provide narrow-band or wideband telephony to be assessed.
The objective for narrow-band services is to reach a quality as close as
possible to ITU-T standards for PSTN circuits. However, due to technical and
economic factors, there cannot be full compliance with the general
characteristics of international telephone connections and circuits
recommended by the ITU-T.
The performance requirements are specified in TS 26.131; the test methods and
considerations are specified in the main body of the text.
# 1 Scope
The present document is applicable to any terminal capable of supporting
narrow-band or wideband telephony, either as a stand-alone service or as the
telephony component of a multimedia service. The present document specifies
test methods to allow the minimum performance requirements for the acoustic
characteristics of GSM and 3G terminals when used to provide narrow-band or
wideband telephony to be assessed.

# 4 Interfaces
Access to terminals for acoustic testing is always made via the acoustic or
air interfaces. The Air Interface is specified by the GSM 05 or 45 and the 3G
25 series specifications and is required to achieve user equipment (UE)
transportability. Measurements can be made at this point using a system
simulator (SS) comprising the appropriate radio terminal equipment and speech
transcoder. The losses and gains introduced by the test speech transcoder will
need to be specified.
The POI with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) is considered to
have a relative level of 0 dBr, where signals will be represented by 8-bit
A-law, according to ITU-T Recommendation G.711. Measurements may be made at
this point using a standard send and receive side, as defined in ITU-T
Recommendations.
Five classes of acoustic interface are considered in this specification:
\- Handset UE including softphone UE used as a handset;
\- Headset UE including softphone UE used with headset;
\- Vehicle Mounted Hands-free UE including softphone UE mounted in a vehicule;
\- Desktop-mounted hands-free UE including softphone UE with external
loudspeaker(s) used in handsfree mode;
\- Handheld hands-free UE including softphone UE with internal loudspeaker(s)
used in handsfree mode.
(See definition of softphone in Clause 3.1)
NOTE: The test setup for a softphone UE shall be derived according to the
following rules:
\- When using a softphone UE as a handset: the test setup shall correspond to
handset mode.
\- When using a softphone UE with headset: the test setup shall correspond to
headset mode.
\- When a softphone UE is mounted in a vehicle: the test setup shall
correspond to Vehicle-mounted handsfree mode.
\- When using a softphone UE in handsfree mode:
\- When using internal loudspeaker(s), the test setup shall correspond to
handheld hands-free.
\- When using external loudspeaker(s), the test setup shall correspond to
desktop-mounted hands-free.
# 5 Test configurations
This section describes the test setups for terminal acoustic testing.
NOTE: If the terminal has several mechanical configurations (e.g. sliding
design open or closed), all manufacturer-defined configurations shall be
tested.
## 5.1 Setup for terminals
The general access to terminals is described in Figure 1. The preferred
acoustic access to GSM and 3G terminals is the most realistic simulation of
the "average" subscriber. This can be made by using HATS (head and torso
simulator), with appropriate ear simulation and appropriate mountings for
handset terminals in a realistic but reproducible, way to the HATS. Hands-free
terminals shall use the HATS or free field microphone techniques in a
realistic but reproducible way. Headset measurement methods are for further
study, awaiting input from ETSI TC-STQ.
HATS is described in ITU-T Recommendation P.58, appropriate ears are described
in ITU-T Recommendation P.57 (type 3.3 and type 3.4 ear), a proper positioning
of handsets in realistic conditions is found in ITU-T Recommendation P.64 ,
the test setups for various types of hands-free terminals can be found in
ITU-T Recommendation P.581.
The preferred way of testing is the connection of a terminal to the system
simulator with exact defined settings and access points. The test sequences
are fed in either, electrically using a reference codec or using the direct
signal processing approach or acoustically using ITU-T specified devices.
### 5.1.1 Setup for handset terminals
HATS Method : When using a handset telephone the handset is placed in the HATS
position as described in ITU-T Recommendation P.64 . The artificial mouth
shall conform with P.58 when HATS is used. The artificial ear shall conform
with Rec. P.57, type 3.3 or type 3.4 ears shall be used.
### 5.1.2 Setup for headset terminals
For further study.
NOTE 1: Includes DTX functionality.
NOTE 2: Connection to PSTN should include electrical echo control (EEC).
Figure 1: GSM/3G Interfaces for specification and testing of terminal narrow-
band acoustic characteristics
### 5.1.3 Setup for hands-free terminals
#### 5.1.3.1 Vehicle mounted hands-free
Vehicle mounted hands-free may be measured either in a vehicle or in an
anechoic room. For both of these two types of test environments, the setup
will depend on whether HATS or a discrete artificial mouth and discrete
microphone are used as the acoustic test equipment.
For in-vehicle measurements, if HATS test equipment is used, it should be
positioned in the car as per ITU-T Recommendation P. 581. If in-vehicle
measurements are made with a discrete microphone and discrete artificial
mouth, they should be positioned in the car as per Figure 2 and Figure 3,
respectively. The artificial mouth should comply with ITU-T Recommendation P.
51. The microphone should be a pressure-field microphone complying with IEC
60651. The microphone should preferably be fitted with a random incidence
corrector. A vehicle simulator may be used instead of an actual car. A
standard vehicle simulator is described in ETSI 0358 601 (TR101110) Digital
Cellular Telecommunications System (Phase 2+) Charactersation test methods and
quality assessment for hands-free mobiles.
The hands-free equipment is mounted in the car as specified by the
manufacturer.

Specification testing of vehicle-mounted hands-free equipment in an anechoic
room is for further study.
#### 5.1.3.2 Desktop mounted hands-free
For HATS test equipment, definition of hands-free terminals and setup for
desktop hands-free terminals can be found in ITU-T Recommendation P.581.
Measurement setup using a free field microphone and a discrete P.51 artificial
mouth for desktop hands-free terminals can be found in ITU-T Recommendation
P.340.
#### 5.1.3.3 Handheld hands-free
Either HATS or a free-field microphone with a discrete P. 51 artificial mouth
may be used to measure Hand-Held Hands-free type UE.
If HATS measurement equipment is used, it should be configured to the Hand-
Held Hands-free UE according to Figure 4. The HATS should be positioned so
that the HATS Reference Point is at a distance _d_ ~HF~ from the centre point
of the visual display of the Mobile Station. The distance _d_ ~HF~ is
specified by the manufacturer. A vertical angle Î¸~HF~ may be speicfied by the
manufacturer. In case it is not specified the distance _d_ ~HF~ shall be 42 cm
and Î¸~HF~ shall be 0.
NOTE: The nominal distance of 42 cm corresponds to lip plane-HATS reference
point distance (12 cm) with an additional 30 cm giving a realistic figure as a
reference usage of handheld terminals.

If a free-field microphone with a discrete P. 51 mouth are used, they should
be configured to the Hand-Held Hands-free UE as per Figure 5 for receiving
measurements and Figure 6 for sending measurements. The measurement instrument
should be located at a distance _d_ ~HF~ from the centre of the visual display
of the Mobile Station. The distance _d_ ~HF~ is specified by the manufacturer.

### 5.1.4 Position and calibration of HATS
The horizontal positioning of the HATS reference plane shall be guaranteed
within Â± 2Â° for testing hands-free equipment.
The HATS shall be equipped with either Type 3.3 or 3.4 Artificial Ear. For
hands-free measurements the HATS shall always be equipped with two artificial
ears. The pinnas are specified in Recommendation P.57 for Types 3.3 and 3.4
artificial ears. The pinna shall be positioned on HATS according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.58 .
The exact calibration and equalization procedures as well as the combination
of the two ear signals for the purpose of measurements can be found in ITU-T
Recommendation P.581. For Handheld hands-free UE, the set-up corresponding to
\'portable hands-free\' in P. 581 should be used.
## 5.2 Setup of the electrical interfaces
### 5.2.1 Codec approach and specification
**Codec approach:** In this approach, a codec is used to convert the companded
digital input/output bit-stream of the system simulator to the equivalent
analogue values. With this approach a system simulator, simulating the radio
link to the terminal under controlled and error free conditions is required.
The system simulator has to be equipped with a high-quality codec whose
characteristics are as close as possible to ideal.
Definition of 0 dBr point:
D/A converter - a Digital Test Sequence (DTS) representing the codec
equivalent of an analogue sinusoidal signal whose rms value is 3,14 dB below
the maximum fullâ€‘load capacity of the codec shall generate 0 dBm across a 600
ohm load;
A/D converter - a 0 dBm signal generated from a 600 ohm source shall give the
digital test sequence (DTS) representing the codec equivalent of an analogue
sinusoidal signal whose RMS value is 3,14 dB below the maximum fullâ€‘load
capacity of the codec.
**Narrow band telephony testing**
For testing a GSM or 3G terminal supporting narrow-band telephony, the system
simulator shall use the AMR speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS 26 series
specifications, at the source coding bit rate of 12,2kbit/s. The transcoding
from the output of the AMR speech coding in the system simulator to analogue
signals shall be carried out using an ITU-T G.711 codec performing to ITU-T
G.712 (4-wire analogue).
**Wide band telephony testing**
For testing a GSM or 3G terminal supporting wide-band telephony, the system
simulator shall use the AMR-WB speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS26 series
specifications, at the source coding bit rate of 12.65 kbit/s. The transcoding
from the output of the AMR-WB speech coding in the system simulator to
analogue signals shall be carried out using an ITU-T G.711 codec performing to
ITU-T G.712 (4-wire analogue).
### 5.2.2 Direct digital processing approach
In this approach, the companded digital input/output bit-stream of the
terminal connected through the radio link to the system simulator is operated
upon directly. For the purposes of GSM/3G acoustic testing, the direct digital
processing shall use the default speech codec, the AMR speech codec as defined
in 3GTS26 series specifications, at it's highest source coding bit rate of
12,2kbit/s.
**Narrow** **band telephony testing**
For testing a GSM or 3G terminal supporting narrow-band telephony, the system
simulator shall use the AMR speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS 26 series
specifications, at the source coding bit rate of 12,2kbit/s.
**Wide band telephony testing**
For testing a GSM or 3G terminal supporting wide-band telephony, the system
simulator shall use the AMR-WB speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS26 series
specifications, at the source coding bit rate of 12.65 kbit/s.

## 7.7 Acoustic echo control
### 7.7.1 General
The echo loss (EL) presented by the GSM or 3G network at the POI should be at

is likely to be used in a wide range of noise environments.
### 7.7.2 Acoustic echo control in a Hands-free UE
TCLw:
The hands-free is setup in a room where it is intended to be used, eg. for an
office type hands-free UE a typical "office-type" room should be used; a
vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested in a vehicle or vehicle
simulator, as specified by the UE manufacturer. [For reference on a suitable
vehicle simulator see ETSI 0358 601 (TR101110) Digital Cellular
Telecommunications System (Phase 2+) .] The ambient noise level shall be less
than -70 dBPa(A). The attenuation from reference point input to reference
point output shall be measured using a speech like test signal .
Before the actual test a training sequence consisting of 10 s artificial voice
male and 10 s artificial voice female according to ITU-T Recommendation P.50
is altered.
Either a logarithmically spaced multi-sine or PN-sequence test signal shall be
used.
When using a logarithmically spaced multi-sine test signal, it is defined as:

rule). For the calculation the averaged measured echo level at each frequency
band is referred to the averaged test signal level measured in each frequency
band. The length of the test signal shall be at least one second (1,0 s).
Note:
Full scale of coder input signal corresponds to +3,14 dBm0 with sinusoidal
signal, CF= 3dB. A test signal with a CF of maximum 15 dB can thus have a
level of up to --8,86 dBm0 without overloading the codec. In order to get best
dynamic range the signal amplitude should be as high as possible.
When using a PN-sequence, it should comply with ITU-T Recommendation P.501
with a length of 4096 points (for the 48 kHz sampling rate) and a crest factor
of 6 dB. The duration of the test signal is 250ms. The test signal level is
--3 dB~m0~. The low-crest factor is achieved by random-alternation of the
phase between -180Â° and 180Â°.
The training sequence level shall be --16 dBm0 in order not to overload the
codec. The TCLw is calculated according to ITU-T Recommendation G.122 [8],
annex B, clause B.4 (trapezoidal rule). For the calculation the averaged
measured echo level at each frequency band is referred to the averaged test
signal level measured in each frequency band.

## 7.8 Distortion
### 7.8.1 Sending Distortion
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5.
The signal used is a sineâ€‘wave signal with a frequency of 1020 Hz. The sine-
wave signal level shall be calibrated to the following RMS levels at the MRP:
+5, 0, -4.7, -10, -15, -20 dBPa. The test signals have to be applied in this
sequence, i.e. from high levels down to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 second. The
measured part of the signal shall be 170.667 ms (equals 2*4096 samples in a 48
kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in
order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation
signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 or P.50. A
recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement
is defined in Figure 16. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation
signal is recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level. In
practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction
of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify
disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation
signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation
signal, as specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signal to total distortion power of the signal output of the
SS shall be measured with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITUâ€‘T
Recommendations G.712, O.41 and 0.132). The psophometric filter shall be
normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T O.41. The weighting
function shall be applied to the total distortion component only (not to the
signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0.7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1.4142 * f~S~ with f~S~ being
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be less than 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be at least 60 dB. Alternatively the described characteristics
can be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from
an FFT ("Fast Fourier Transform"). The total distortion component is defined
as the measured signal within the frequency range 200-4000 Hz, after applying
psophometric and stop filters (hence no correction for the lost power due to
the stop filter, known as "bandwidth correction", shall be applied).
To increase the repeatability, considering the variability introduced by
speech coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation + test
signal) may be repeated n times. The thus obtained single signal-to-total-
distortion power ratios shall be averaged. The total result shall be
10*log~10~ of this average in dB.

Figure 16: Recommended activation sequence and test signal.
The activation signal consists of a P.501 "Bandlimited composite source signal
with speech-like power density spectrum" signal with 48.62 ms voiced part (1),
200 ms unvoiced part (2) and 101.38 ms pause (3), followed by the same signal
but polarity inverted (4, 5, 6), followed by the voiced part only (7). The
pure test tone is applied and after 50 ms settling time (8), the analysis is
made over the following 170.667 ms (9).
NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: In order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed,
the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the
measurement.
NOTE 3: For handsfree terminals tested in environments defined in clause
6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by
the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable
degree, refer to clause 5.3.
### 7.8.2 Receiving
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5.
The signal used is a sineâ€‘wave signal with frequency of 1020 Hz..
The signal shall be applied at the signal input of the SS at the following
levels: 0, -3, -10, -16, -20, -30, -40, -45 dBm0. The test signals have to be
applied in this sequence, i.e. from high levels down to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 second. The
measured part of the signal shall be 170.667 ms (equals 2*4096 samples in a 48
kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in
order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation
signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 or P.50. A
recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement
is defined in Figure 17. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation
signal is for low and medium test levels recommended to be equal to the
subsequent test tone RMS level. To avoid saturation of the SS speech encoder,
it is for high test levels recommended that the activation signal level is
adjusted so that its peak level equals the peak level of the test tone. In
practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction
of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify
disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation
signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation
signal, as specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signalâ€‘toâ€‘total distortion power shall be measured at the
applicable acoustic measurement point (ERP for handset mode, freefield for
handsfree modes) with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITUâ€‘T
Recommendations G.712, O.41 and 0.132). The psophometric filter shall be
normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T O.41. The weighting
function shall be applied to the total distortion component only (not to the
signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0.7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1.4142 * f~S~ with f~S~ being
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be less than 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be at least 60 dB. Alternatively the described characteristics
can be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from
an FFT ("Fast Fourier Transform"). The total distortion component is defined
as the measured signal within the frequency range 200-4000 Hz, after applying
psophometric and stop filters (hence no correction for the lost power due to
the stop filter, known as "bandwidth correction", shall be applied).
To increase the repeatability, considering the variability introduced by
speech coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation + test
signal) may be repeated n times. The thus obtained single signal-to-total-
distortion power ratios shall be averaged. The total result shall be
10*log~10~ of this average in dB.

made over the following 170.667 ms (9).
NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: In order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed,
the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the
measurement.
NOTE 3: For handsfree terminals tested in environments defined in clause
6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by
the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable
degree, refer to clause 5.3.
## 7.9 Ambient Noise Rejection
**Handset and Headset UE** :
NOTE: This section applies to terminals providing narrow- and wide-band
telephony. However, the procedure for measuring ambient noise rejection is
defined only over narrow-band frequency range. Thus the test method for
ambient noise rejection is the same for either narrow- or wide-band telephony.
a) A 1/2 inch pressure microphone is calibrated using a known sound source and
mounted at the MRP, without the HATS present. A frequency analyser is
calibrated to enable the sound pressure levels at the microphone to be
determined in 1/3rd Octave bands.
b) Flood the room in which the measurement is to be made with a band limited
(100 Hz to 8 kHz) pink noise to within Â±3 dB. The level at MRP shall be
adjusted to 70 dB(A) (-24 dBPa(A)). The tolerance on this level is +/-1 dB.
The resulting sound spectrum is Prn dBPa, measured in 1/3rd Octave bands.
To ensure that the sound field is diffuse enough, the following apply:
The diffuse sound field is calibrated in the absence of any local obstacles.
The averaged field shall be uniform to within +/â€‘ 3 dB within a radius of 0,15
m of the MRP, when measured in oneâ€‘third octave bands from 100 Hz to 3,15 kHz.
NOTE 1: The pressure intensity index, as defined in ISO 9614, may prove to be
a suitable method for assessing the diffuse field.
NOTE 2: Where more than one loudspeaker is used to produce the desired sound
field, the loudspeakers must be fed with nonâ€‘coherent electrical signals to
eliminate standing waves and other interference effects.
c) Position the HATS test head in the correct relative position to the MRP and
mount the MS under test, according to clause 5.1.1. Recalibrate the 1/3rd
Octave frequency analyser using a known voltage source to facilitate the
analysis of the voltage Vrn, where V~rn~ is the voltage at the audio output of
the SS due to the noise spectrum input.
d) Set up a speech path between the MS and the System Simulator (SS).
e) Determine, as a function of frequency, using the frequency analyser, in
1/3rd Octave bands (index j), the electrical output V~jrn~, (expressed as dB
rel . 1V) at the audio output of the SS for the applied acoustic pressure
P~jrn~ (expressed as dB rel 1Pa) at the MRP. Since, the MS sending sensitivity
is not defined above 3,4 kHz the measurement shall be cut off at 3,4 kHz. For
the bands below 315 Hz, the noise level shall be referenced to the speech
level at 315 Hz to yield the DELSM.
The room noise sensitivity is expressed as:â€‘ Sm jrn= Vjrn (dBV) â€‘ Pjrn (dBPa).
The MS ambient noise send sensitivity has now been determined.
f) The MS speech send sensitivity is now required. The required sensitivity is
defined as the electrical output from the MS, measured at the audio output of
the SS, as a function of the free field sound pressure at the MRP of the
artificial mouth.
The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the artificial voice
according to ITU-Recommendation P.50 or a speech like test signal as described
in ITU-T Recommendation P.501. The type of test signal used shall be stated in
the test report. The 1/2 inch pressure microphone is calibrated using a known
sound source. The frequency analyser is calibrated to measure in 1/3rd Octave
bands. The spectrum of acoustic signal produced by the artificial mouth is
calibrated under free field conditions at the MRP. The test signal level shall
be --4,7 dBPa, measured at the MRP. The resulting sound spectrum is Po dBPa,
measured in 1/3rd Octave bands. The 1/3^rd^ Octave frequency analyser should
be reâ€‘calibrated, using a known voltage source, to facilitate the analysis of
the voltage Vj.Where Vj is the voltage in each 1/3^rd^ octave band at the
audio output of the SS due to the test signal input. Set up a speech path
between the MS and the SS. Determine the function of frequency, using the
frequency analyser, and in 1/3rd Octave bands, the electrical output, V~j~,
(expressed as dB rel. 1V), at the audio output of the SS for the applied
acoustic pressure, P~j0~, (expressed as dB rel. 1Pa/V), at the MRP.
The speech sending sensitivity is expressed as:
Smjs (dB) = Vj (dBV) â€‘ Pjo (dBPa) dBrel. 1V/Pa.
g) The difference of the room noise sensitivity and the speech sending
sensitivity DELSM (âˆ†jSM) in each 1/3rd Octave band for the MS is determined
as:
Sm~jrn~ - Sm~js~ (dB) ( for j = 1 to 2, Smjs = Sm3s).
h) The Ambient noise rejection ANR is calculated as the single figure value
according to the following formula, the ANR shall be â‰¥ 0dB.
$\text{ANR} = - \frac{4}{5}\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{13}}\Delta_{\text{jSM}} \cdot
\text{10}^{- 0\text{.}\text{0175}W_{\text{jsi}}}$
j = The index of third octave bands centered at frequencies from 200 Hz to 3
150 Hz inclusive.
Wjsi = The sending weighting factors from ITU-T Recommendation P.79 [16],
table 1 for the jth 1/3rd Octave band centre frequency.

No test method for hands-free operations.

In practice, it is convenient to specify loudness ratings to the Air
Interface. For the normal case, where the GSM or 3G network introduces no
additional loss between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to
the PSTN boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at
the Air Interface.

voltage with a bandwidth limitation to 22 kHz. The impulse may be repeated
with sufficient time distance. To avoid adaptation of potential noise
reduction algorithms, the repetition should not be periodic but with randomly
varied time distance.
The peak voltage of the impulse at the artificial mouth corresponds to
approximately 10 Pa when calculated with the mouth sensitivity at 1 kHz.
However, the rectangular voltage impulse is applied to the artificial mouth
without equalization of the mouth response.
The signal from the artificial mouth is acquired as absolute peak over time
with an aperture of 0.21 ms (10/48000 seconds). The origin of the time axis is
set to the start of the impulse at the electric input of the artificial mouth.
A high pass filter may be applied to suppress low frequency noise. However,
such a high pass filter must be applied to the signal from the artificial ear
and to the trigger signal from the electric input to the artificial mouth at
the same time.
Several curves acquired in the way described above may be averaged in order to
reduce the influence of noise.
The following algorithm shall be used to obtain a value for the sidetone
delay:
a) The first relative maximum is searched in the first 2 ms, and the level and
time of this peak is noted.
b) Starting from the maximum investigated delay time (e.g. 200 ms or 500 ms)
going downwards to 8 ms, the first local maximum in the curve is searched
which has a level difference of more than 20 dB to the last preceding minimum.
This is to define a kind of minimum S/N for the found delayed component. If
such a maximum is found, the sidetone delay is defined as the time difference
between the time of the maximum found in b and the time of the maximum found
in a.
c) If no maximum is found in step b, the first 8 ms are searched for the last
occurring maximum which is higher in level as the one found in step a. If such
a maximum is found, the sidetone delay is defined as the time difference
between the time of the maximum found in c and the time of the maximum found
in a.
d) If no maximum is found neither in step b nor in step c, the sidetone delay
is defined to be \< 8 ms.
NOTE: In step b), if the signal to noise is enhanced by averaging, a lower
value than 20 dB may be allowe for the minimum difference between the searched
maximum peak level and the closest minimum preceding it on the time scale.
## 8.6 Stability loss
Where a user controlled volume control is provided it is set to maximum.
**Handset UE:** The handset is placed on a hard plane surface with the
transducers facing the surface.
**Headset UE:** for further study
**Hands-free UE (all categories):** no requirement other than echo loss.
A gain equivalent to the minimum stability margin is inserted in the loop
between the go and return paths of the reference speech coder in the SS and
any acoustic echo control is enabled.
A test signal according to ITU-T O.131 is injected into the loop at the
analogue or digital input of the reference speech codec of the SS and the
stability is measured. The test signal has a level of â€‘10 dBm0 and a duration
of 1 s.
No continuous audible oscillation shall be detected after the test signal is
switched off.
## 8.7 Acoustic echo control
### 8.7.1 General
The echo loss (EL) presented by the GSM or 3G network at the POI should be at
least 46 dB during single talk. This value takes into account the fact that UE
is likely to be used in a wide range of noise environments.
### 8.7.2 Acoustic echo control in a hands-free UE
TCLw:
The hands-free is setup in a room where it is intended to be used, eg. for an
office type hands-free UE a typical "office-type" room should be used; a
vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested in a vehicle or vehicle
simulator, as specified by the UE manufacturer. [For reference on a suitable
vehicle simulator see ETSI 0358 601 (TR101110) Digital Cellular
Telecommunications System (Phase 2+) .] The ambient noise level shall be less
than -70 dBPa(A). The attenuation from reference point input to reference
point output shall be measured using a speech like test signal .
Before the actual test a training sequence consisting of 10 s artificial voice
male and 10 s artificial voice female according to ITU-T Recommendation P.50
is altered.
Either a logarithmically spaced multi-sine or PN-sequence test signal shall be
used.
When using a logarithmically spaced multi-sine test signal, it is defined as:
$s(t) = \sum_{i}^{}\left\lbrack \left\lbrack A +

rule). For the calculation the averaged measured echo level at each frequency
band is referred to the averaged test signal level measured in each frequency
band. The length of the test signal shall be at least one second (1,0 s).
Note:
Full scale of coder input signal corresponds to +3,14 dBm0 with sinusoidal
signal, CF= 3dB. A test signal with a CF of maximum 15 dB can thus have a
level of up to --8,86 dBm0 without overloading the codec. In order to get best
dynamic range the signal amplitude should be as high as possible.
When using a PN-sequence, it should comply with ITU-T Recommendation P.501
with a length of 4096 points (for the 48 kHz sampling rate) and a crest factor
of 6 dB. The duration of the test signal is 250ms. The test signal level is
--3 dB~m0~. The low-crest factor is achieved by random-alternation of the
phase between -180Â° and 180Â°.
The training sequence level shall be --16 dBm0 in order not to overload the
codec. The TCLw is calculated according to ITU-T Recommendation G.122 [8],
annex B, clause B.4 (trapezoidal rule). For the calculation the averaged
measured echo level at each frequency band is referred to the averaged test
signal level measured in each frequency band.

a speech-like signal.
### 8.7.3 Acoustic echo control in a handset UE

be used. The ambient noise level shall be less than -64 dBPa(A). The
attenuation from reference point input to reference point output shall be
measured using the speech like test signal defined below.
Before the actual test a training sequence consisting of 10 s artificial voice
male and 10 s artificial voice female according to ITU-T Recommendation P.50

Care should be taken that the terminal under test considers the test signal as

## 8.8 Distortion
### 8.8.1 Sending Distortion
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5.
The signal used is a sineâ€‘wave signal with frequencies specified in clause 6.8
of TS 26.131. The sine wave signal level shall be calibrated to -4,7 dBPa at
the MRP for all frequencies, except for the sine wave with frequency 1020 Hz
which shall be applied at the following levels at the MRP: +5, 0, -4.7, -10,
-15, -20 dBPa. The test signals have to be applied in this sequence, i.e. from
high levels down to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 second. The
measured part of the signal shall be 170.667 ms (equals 2*4096 samples in a 48
kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in
order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation
signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 or P.50. A
recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement
is defined in Figure 18. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation
signal is recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level. In
practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction
of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify
disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation
signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation
signal, as specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signal to total distortion power of the signal output of the
SS shall be measured with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITUâ€‘T
Recommendations G.712, O.41 and O.132). The psophometric filter shall be
normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T O.41. The weighting
function shall be applied to the total distortion component only (not to the
signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0.7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1.4142 * f~S~ with f~S~ being
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be less than 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be at least 60 dB. Alternatively the described characteristics
can be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from
an FFT ("Fast Fourier Transform"). The total distortion component is defined
as the measured signal within the frequency range 100-6000 Hz, after applying
psophometric and stop filters (hence no correction for the lost power due to
the stop filter, known as "bandwidth correction", shall be applied).
To increase the repeatability, considering the variability introduced by
speech coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation + test
signal) may be repeated n times. The thus obtained single signal-to-total-
distortion power ratios shall be averaged. The total result shall be
10*log~10~ of this average in dB.
{width="3.738888888888889in" height="1.9743055555555555in"}
Figure 18: Recommended activation sequence and test signal.
The activation signal consists of a P.501 "Bandlimited composite source signal
with speech-like power density spectrum" signal with 48.62 ms voiced part (1),
200 ms unvoiced part (2) and 101.38 ms pause (3), followed by the same signal
but polarity inverted (4, 5, 6), followed by the voiced part only (7). The
pure test tone is applied and after 50 ms settling time (8), the analysis is
made over the following 170.667 ms (9).
NOTE 1: Depending on the type of codec the test signal used may need to be
adapted. If a sine wave is not usable, an alternative test signal could be a
band limited noise signal centered on the above frequencies.
NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: Void.
NOTE 4: In order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed,
the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the
measurement.
NOTE 5: For handsfree terminals tested in environments defined in clause
6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by
the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable
degree, refer to clause 5.3.
### 8.8.2 Receiving
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5.
The signal used is a sineâ€‘wave signal with frequencies specified in clause 6.8
of TS 26.131. The signal level shall be -16 dBm0, except for the sineâ€‘wave
signal with a frequency 1020 Hz that shall be applied at the signal input of
the SS at the following levels: 0, -3, -10, -16, -20, -30, -40, -45 dBm0. The
test signals have to be applied in this sequence, i.e. from high levels down
to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 second. The
measured part of the signal shall be 170.667 ms (equals 2*4096 samples in a 48
kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in

It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation
signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 or P.50. A
recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement
is defined in Figure 19. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation
signal is for low and medium test levels recommended to be equal to the
subsequent test tone RMS level. To avoid saturation of the SS speech encoder,
it is for high test levels recommended that the activation signal level is
adjusted so that its peak level equals the peak level of the test tone. In
practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction
of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify
disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation
signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation
signal, as specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signalâ€‘toâ€‘total distortion power shall be measured at the
applicable acoustic measurement point (ERP for handset mode, freefield for
handsfree modes) with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITUâ€‘T
Recommendations G.712, O.41 and O.132). The psophometric filter shall be
normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T O.41. The weighting
function shall be applied to the total distortion component only (not to the
signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0.7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1.4142 * f~S~ with f~S~ being
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be less than 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be at least 60 dB. Alternatively the described characteristics
can be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from
an FFT ("Fast Fourier Transform"). The total distortion component is defined
as the measured signal within the frequency range 100-6000 Hz, after applying

speech coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation + test
signal) may be repeated n times. The thus obtained single signal-to-total-
distortion power ratios shall be averaged. The total result shall be

the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable

## 8.9 Ambient Noise Rejection
**Handset and Headset UE** :
NOTE: This clause applies to terminals providing narrow- and wide-band
telephony. However, the procedure for measuring ambient noise rejection is
defined only over narrow-band frequency range. Thus the test method for
ambient noise rejection is the same for either narrow- or wide-band telephony.
a) A 1/2 inch pressure microphone is calibrated using a known sound source and
mounted at the MRP, without the HATS present. A frequency analyser is
calibrated to enable the sound pressure levels at the microphone to be
determined in 1/3rd Octave bands.
b) Flood the room in which the measurement is to be made with a band limited
(100 Hz to 8 kHz) pink noise to within Â±3 dB. The level at MRP shall be
adjusted to 70 dB(A) (-24 dBPa(A)). The tolerance on this level is +/-1 dB.
The resulting sound spectrum is Prn dBPa, measured in 1/3rd Octave bands. To
ensure that the sound field is diffuse enough, the following apply: the
diffuse sound field is calibrated in the absence of any local obstacles. The
averaged field shall be uniform to within +/â€‘ 3 dB within a radius of 0,15 m
of the MRP, when measured in oneâ€‘third octave bands from 100 Hz to 6,3 kHz.
NOTE 1: The pressure intensity index, as defined in ISO 9614, may prove to be
a suitable method for assessing the diffuse field.
NOTE 2: Where more than one loudspeaker is used to produce the desired sound
field, the loudspeakers must be fed with nonâ€‘coherent electrical signals to
eliminate standing waves and other interference effects.
c) Position the HATS test head in the correct relative position to the MRP and
mount the MS under test, according to clause 5.1.1. Recalibrate the 1/3rd
Octave frequency analyser using a known voltage source to facilitate the
analysis of the voltage Vrn, where V~rn~ is the voltage at the audio output of
the SS due to the noise spectrum input.
d) Set up a speech path between the MS and the System Simulator (SS).
e) Determine, as a function of frequency, using the frequency analyser, in
1/3rd Octave bands (index j), the electrical output V~jrn~, (expressed as dB
rel . 1V) at the audio output of the SS for the applied acoustic pressure
P~jrn~ (expressed as dB rel 1Pa) at the MRP. Since, the MS sending sensitivity
is not defined above 6,3 kHz the measurement shall be cut off at 6,3 kHz. For
the bands below 315 Hz, the noise level shall be referenced to the speech
level at 315 Hz to yield the DELSM. The room noise sensitivity is expressed
as: Sm jrn= Vjrn (dBV) â€‘ Pjrn (dBPa). The MS ambient noise send sensitivity
has now been determined.
f) The MS speech send sensitivity is now required. The required sensitivity is
defined as the electrical output from the MS, measured at the audio output of
the SS, as a function of the free field sound pressure at the MRP of the
artificial mouth. The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the
artificial voice according to ITU-Recommendation P.50 or a speech like test
signal as described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501. The type of test signal
used shall be stated in the test report. The 1/2 inch pressure microphone is
calibrated using a known sound source. The frequency analyser is calibrated to
measure in 1/3rd Octave bands. The spectrum of acoustic signal produced by the
artificial mouth is calibrated under free field conditions at the MRP. The
test signal level shall be --4,7 dBPa, measured at the MRP. The resulting
sound spectrum is Po dBPa, measured in 1/3rd Octave bands. The 1/3^rd^ Octave
frequency analyser should be reâ€‘calibrated, using a known voltage source, to
facilitate the analysis of the voltage Vj.Where Vj is the voltage in each
1/3^rd^ octave band at the audio output of the SS due to the test signal
input. Set up a speech path between the MS and the SS. Determine the function
of frequency, using the frequency analyser, and in 1/3rd Octave bands, the
electrical output, V~j~, (expressed as dB rel. 1V), at the audio output of the
SS for the applied acoustic pressure, P~j0~, (expressed as dB rel. 1Pa/V), at
the MRP. The speech sending sensitivity is expressed as:
Smjs (dB) = Vj (dBV) â€‘ Pjo (dBPa) dBrel. 1V/Pa.
g) The difference of the room noise sensitivity and the speech sending
sensitivity DELSM (âˆ†jSM) in each 1/3rd Octave band for the MS is determined
as:
Sm~jrn~ - Sm~js~ (dB) ( for j = 1 to 2, Smjs = Sm3s).
h) The Ambient noise rejection ANR is calculated as the single figure value
according to the following formula, the ANR shall be â‰¥ 0dB.
$\text{ANR} = - \frac{4}{5}\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{16}}\Delta_{\text{jSM}} \cdot
\text{10}^{- 0\text{.}\text{0175}W_{\text{jsi}}}$
j = The index of third octave bands centered at frequencies from 200 Hz to 6
300 Hz inclusive.
Wjsi = The sending weighting factors from ITU-T Recommendation P.79 Annex G
[16], table G.1 for the jth 1/3rd Octave band centre frequency.
**Hands-free UE (all categories):**
No test method for hands-free operations.
