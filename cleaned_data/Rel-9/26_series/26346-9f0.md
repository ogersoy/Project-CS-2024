# Introduction
MBMS is a point-to-multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a
single source entity to multiple recipients. Transmitting the same data to
multiple recipients allows network resources to be shared.
The MBMS bearer service offers two modes:
  * Broadcast Mode.
  * Multicast Mode.
MBMS user services can be built on top of the MBMS bearer service. Further,
the MBMS User Services may use other UMTS bearer services to deliver data. The
present document specifies two delivery methods for the MBMS user services:
download and streaming. Examples of applications using the download delivery
method are news and software upgrades. Delivery of live music is an example of
an application using the streaming delivery method.
There can be several MBMS user services. The objective of the present document
is the definition of a set of media codecs, formats and transport/application
protocols to enable the deployment of MBMS user services. The present document
takes into consideration the need to maximize the reuse of components of
already specified services like PSS and MMS.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines a set of media codecs, formats and
transport/application protocols to enable the deployment of MBMS user services
either over the MBMS bearer service or other UMTS Bearer Services within the
3GPP system.
In this version of the specification, only MBMS download and streaming
delivery methods are specified. The present document does not preclude the use
of other delivery methods.
The present document includes information applicable to network operators,
service providers and manufacturers.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
**Broadcast session:** See 3GPP TS 22.146 [2].
**Forward Error Correction (FEC):** in the context of MBMS, a FEC mechanism is
used at the application layer to allow MBMS receivers to recover lost SDUs
**FLUTE channel:** equivalent to an ALC/LCT channel\ An ALC/LCT channel is
defined by the combination of a sender and an address associated with the
channel by the sender (RFC 3926 [9]).
**Multicast joining:** See 3GPP TS 22.146 [2].
**Multicast session:** See 3GPP TS 22.146 [2].
**Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS):** See 3GPP TS 22.146 [2].

Broadcast/Multicast Service (bearer service) and more than one Broadcast
and/or Multicast session
See 3GPP TS 22.246 [3].
**MBMS user service discovery/announcement:** user service discovery refers to
methods for the UE to obtain the list of available MBMS user services along
with information on the user service and the user service announcement refers
to methods for the MBMS service provider to make the list of available MBMS
user services along with information on the user service available to the UE
**MBMS user service initiation:** UE mechanisms to setup the reception of MBMS
user service data\ The initiation procedure takes place after the discovery of

**MBMS download session:** time, protocols and protocol state (i.e.
parameters) which define sender and receiver configuration for the download of
content files
**MBMS streaming session:** time, protocols and protocol state (i.e.
parameters) which define sender and receiver configuration for the streaming
of content
**RTP Session** : The RTP and RTCP traffic sent to a specific IP multicast
address and port pair (one port each for RTP and RTCP) during the time period
the session is specified to exist. An RTP session is used to transport a

# 4 MBMS system description
## 4.1 MBMS functional layers
Three distinct functional layers are defined for the delivery of MBMS-based
service. They are Bearers, Delivery method and User service. Figure 1 depicts
these layers with examples of bearer types, delivery methods and applications.
> **Bearers:** Bearers provide the mechanism by which IP data is transported.
> MBMS bearers as defined in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4] and 3GPP TS 22.146 [3] are
> used to transport multicast and broadcast traffic in an efficient one-to-
> many manner and are the foundation of MBMS-based services. MBMS bearers may
> be used jointly with unicast PDP contexts in offering complete service
> capabilities.
>
> **Delivery Method:** When delivering MBMS content to a receiving application
> one or more delivery methods are used. The delivery layer provides
> functionality such as security and key distribution, reliability control by
> means of forward-error-correction techniques and associated delivery
> procedures such as file-repair, delivery verification. Two delivery methods
> are defined, namely download and streaming. Delivery methods may be added
> beyond the current release. Delivery methods may use MBMS bearers and may
> make use of point-to-point bearers through a set of MBMS associated
> procedures.
>
> **User service:** The MBMS User service enables applications. Different
> applications impose different requirements when delivering content to MBMS
> subscribers and may use different MBMS delivery methods. As an example a
> messaging application such as MMS would use the download delivery method
> while a streaming application such as PSS would use the streaming delivery
> method.
Figure 1: Functional Layers for MBMS User Service
## 4.2 MBMS User Service Entities
Figure 2 shows the MBMS user service entities and their inter-relations.
Relation cardinality is depicted as well.
Figure 2: Entities and Relations
An MBMS user service is an entity that is used in presenting a complete
service offering to the end-user and allowing him to activate or deactivate
the service. It is typically associated with short descriptive material
presented to the end-user, which would potentially be used by the user to
decide whether and when to activate the offered service.
A single service entity can contain multiple distinct multimedia objects or
streams, which may need to be provided over various MBMS download or MBMS
streaming sessions. A download session or a streaming session is associated
with either an unicast bearer or one or more MBMS bearers and a set of
delivery method parameters specifying how content is to be received on the
mobile side. The MBMS User Service Session may be mapped either on MBMS Bearer
Services or on unicast bearer services.
A set of one or more MBMS bearers can be used for delivering data as part of
an MBMS download or streaming session. As an example, the audio and visual
parts can be carried on separate MBMS bearers. However, it is recommendated to
transfer MBMS download and/or streaming sessions, which belong to the same
MBMS user service on the same MBMS bearer service.
An MBMS bearer service (identified by TMGI) may be used to transport data for
one or more MBMS download or streaming sessions (3GPP TS 22.246 [3], clause
5).
## 4.3 MBMS bearer service architecture
The MBMS Bearer Service Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4]. The
MBMS User Service interfaces to the MBMS system via 3 entities.
  * The BM-SC.
  * The GGSN (for GPRS) or MBMS-GW (for EPS).
  * The UE.
The BM-SC provides functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery
to the content provider. It can also serve as an entry point for IP MBMS data
traffic from the MBMS User Service source.
The GGSN (for GPRS) or MBMS-GW (for EPS) serves as an entry point for IP
multicast traffic as MBMS data from the BM-SC.
## 4.4 Functional Entities to support MBMS User Services
### 4.4.1 MBMS User Service Architecture
Figure 3 depicts the MBMS network architecture showing MBMS related entities
involved in providing MBMS user services.

Figure 3: MBMS network architecture model for GPRS
{width="5.395138888888889in" height="3.575in"}
Figure 3b: MBMS network architecture model for EPS
MBMS User Service architecture is based on an MBMS receiver on the UE side and
a BM-SC on the network side.
The use of the Gmb / SGmb and Gi / SGi-mb interface in providing IP multicast
traffic and managing MBMS bearer sessions is described in detail in 3GPP TS
23.246 [4].
Details about the BM-SC functional entities are given in figure 4.
{width="6.46875in" height="5.003472222222222in"}
Figure 4: BM-SC sub-functional structure
The Session and Transmission function is further subdivided into the MBMS
Delivery functions and the Associated Delivery functions.
The BM-SC and UE may exchange service and content related information either
over point-to-point bearers or MBMS bearers whichever is suitable. To that end
the following MBMS procedures are provided:
  * User Service Discovery / Announcement providing service description > material to be presented to the end-user as well as application > parameters used in providing service content to the end-user.
  * MBMS-based delivery of data/content from the BM-SC to the UE over IP > multicast or over IP unicast.
\- The data/content is optionally confidentiality and/or integrity protected
\- The data/content is optionally protected by an forward error correction
code
  * Key Request and Registration procedure for receiving keys and key > updates.
  * Key distribution procedures whereby the BM-SC distributes key > material required to access service data and delivered content.
  * Associated Delivery functions are invoked by the UE in relation to > the MBMS data transmission. The following associated delivery > functions are available:
\- File repair for download delivery method used to complement missing data.
\- Delivery verification and reception statistics collection procedures.
The interfaces between internal BM-SC functions are outside the scope of the
present document.
A \"Proxy and Transport function\" may be located between the \"Session and
Transmission Function\" and the GGSN (for GPRS) or MBMS-GW (for EPS). The
\"Proxy and Transport function\" is transparent to the \"Session and
Transmission function\". The "Proxy and Transport" function is defined in sub-
clause 5.1.3 of [4].
### 4.4.1a Content Provider / Multicast Broadcast Source
The Content Provider/Multicast Broadcast Source may provide discrete and
continuous media, as well as service descriptions and control data, to the BM-
SC to offer services at a time. An MBMS User Service may use one or several
MBMS delivery methods simultaneously. The Content Provider/Multicast Broadcast
Source may also be a 3rd Party Content Provider/Multicast Broadcast Source.
The Content Provider/Multicast Broadcast Source function may reside within the
operator\'s network or may be provided from outside the operator\'s network.
The Content Provider/Multicast Broadcast Source can also configure the Session
and Transmission functions (e.g. delivery or associated delivery). The
interface between the Content Provider/Multicast Broadcast Source and the BM-
SC is outside the scope of the present document.
### 4.4.2 MBMS Key Management Function
The MBMS Key Management function is used for distributing MBMS keys (Key
Distribution subfunction) to authorized UEs. Before the UE can receive MBMS
keys, the UE needs to register to the Key Request subfunction of the Key
Management function by indicating the MBMS User Service Id. Once registered,
the UE can request missing MBMS keys from the BM-SC by indicating the specific
MBMS key Id. In order for the UE to stop the BM-SC to send MBMS key updates a
deregistration with the MBMS User Service Id is needed.
If the MBMS User Service does not require any MBMS data protection, then the
UE shall not register for key management purposes.
A detailed description of all key management procedures is provided in 3GPP TS
33.246 [20].
### 4.4.3 MBMS Session and Transmission Function
The MBMS Session and Transmission function transfers the actual MBMS session
data to the group of MBMS UEs using either MBMS Bearer Services or unicast
bearer services. The MBMS Session and Transmission function interacts with the
GGSN (for GPRS) through the Gmb Proxy function to activate and release the
MBMS transmission resources. The MBMS Session and Transmission function
interacts with the MBMS-GW (for EPS) through the SGmb Proxy function to
activate and release the MBMS transmission resources.
The session and transmission function may compress headers of MBMS data in
some cases. Further, the session and transmission function may need to add
synchronization information for the MBMS payload e.g. in case of MBSFN
transmissions. For details on usage of synchronization and header compression
see 3GPP TS 23.246 [4] and 3GPP TS 25.346 [5].
The function contains the MBMS delivery methods, which use the MBMS bearer
service for distribution of content. Further this function contains a set of
Associated-Delivery Functions, which may be invoked by the UE in relation to
the MBMS data transmission (e.g. after the MBMS data transmission).
The BM-SC Session and Transmission function is further described in later
clauses of the present document as well as in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4].
MBMS user services data may be integrity and/or confidentiality protected as
specified within 3GPP TS 33.246 [20], and protection is applied between the
BM-SC and the UE. This data protection is based on symmetric keys, which are
shared between the BM-SC and the UEs accessing the service.
MBMS user services may also be protected against packet loss between BM-SC and
UE using a forward error correction code.
### 4.4.4 User Service Discovery / Announcement function
The User Service Discovery / Announcement provides service description
information, which may be delivered via the Session and Transmission function
or via the Interactive Announcement function. This includes information, which
is necessary to initiate an MBMS user service as described in sub-clause
5.3.1. Metadata for the service descriptions are described in sub-clause 5.2.
### 4.4.5 Interactive Announcement Function
An Interactive Announcement Function may offer alternative means to provide
service descriptions to the UE using HTTP or be distributed through other
interactive transport methods.
### 4.4.6 MBMS UE
The MBMS UE hosts the MBMS User Services receiver function. The MBMS receiver
function may receive data from MBMS bearer services or from unicast bearer
services. The MBMS receiver function may receive data from several MBMS User
Services simultaneously. According to the MBMS UE capabilities, some MBMS UEs
may be able to receive data belonging to one MBMS User Service from several
MBMS Bearer Services simultaneously. The MBMS receiver function uses
interactive bearers for user service initiation / termination, user service
discovery and associated delivery procedures.
In case the MBMS user service is secured, the UE needs one or more
cryptographic MBMS service keys, therefore the UE requests the relevant
cryptographic MBMS service keys using the BM-SC Key Request function. The
received keys (i.e. MSK) are then used for securing the MBMS session.
## 4.5 Usage of identity of MBMS session
The Session Identity of the MBMS session is provided with the MBMS session
start procedure from the BM-SC to the GGSN (for GPRS) or MBMS-GW (for EPS) via
the Gmb (for GPRS) or SGmb (for EPS) protocol in the MBMS Session Identity
information element. The "MBMS Session Identity" information element is
specified in [96]. The size of the Session Identity field is 1 octet. The MBMS
Session Identity is forwarded with the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message
through the system and received by the MBMS UE with the paging message.
The usage of the MBMS Session Identity is optional. The MBMS Session Identity
is only applicable to MBMS download delivery sessions. The MBMS transmission
resources are activated as described in sub-clause 5.4. Each MBMS session of
the MBMS User Service may be activated using a different MBMS Session
Identity. The MBMS UE determines, based on the MBMS Session Identity value,
whether the files of the upcoming MBMS download session were already received.
If the files have already been completely received, the MBMS UE does not
respond to the notification of the MBMS Session.
The association of MBMS Session Identities to files is determined by the BM-SC
and communicated within the File Delivery Table. This association of a MBMS
Session Identity to files is valid until a particular expiry time, also
signalled within the File Delivery Table. If a UE has not received a File
Delivery Table associating a given MBMS Session Identity to a specific file or
set of files, or a previously received association has expired, then the UE
shall assume that the MBMS Session Identity value is associated to new files
which has not yet been received and shall respond as normal to MBMS
notifications with that Session Identity value.
A single MBMS Session Identity value may be associated with a single file or
with a set of files. Once a MBMS Session Identity value has been associated
with a particular file or a set of files, this association shall not be
changed before the expiry of the validity time for that MBMS Session Identity
value. In particular, a File Delivery Table including some files that has
previously been associated with a particular Session Identity value must
include all files previously associated with that value, even if it is not
intended to include all the files within the MBMS transmission session.
An FDT instance includes the MBMS Session Identity expiry time and associates
the MBMS Session Identity expiry times with particular MBMS Session Identity
values.
If the MBMS Session Identity is used by the BM-SC, the BM-SC shall also
provide the session repetition number of that MBMS transmission session on the
Gmb (for GPRS) or SGmb (for EPS) interface.
If the BM-SC starts using the MBMS Session Identity for one MBMS Bearer
Service, the BM-SC may still decide not to use the MBMS Session Identity for a
later MBMS transmission on that MBMS bearer service (e.g. when an MBMS session
is transmitted only once).
After determining that all files for a MBMS Session Identity value has been
received, the UE shall not respond to MBMS notifications for the MBMS Bearer
Service with that MBMS Session Identity value until the MBMS Session Identity
is expired. Once the MBMS Session Identity has expired, the content is no
longer guaranteed to be repeated, and therefore the UE may begin to respond to
MBMS notifications for the associated MBMS Bearer Service.
The BM-SC may send FDT instances on a separate transmission session or
interleaved with other data packets of the same transmission session. An FDT
instance may describe more files than the files to be transmitted over the
same transmission session as that FDT instance.
## 4.6 Time Synchronization between the BM-SC and MBMS UEs
A number of MBMS metadata fragments and File Delivery Table (FDT) contain NTP
encoded time values. NTP uses UTC as reference time and is independent from
time zones. In order to process the time information from the BM-SC correctly,
the MBMS UEs shall be time synchronized with the BM-SC with a tolerance of +/-
1 second. The BM-SC shall offer an SNTP [84] time server. The MBMS UEs should
use SNTP to synchronize the time with the BM-SC. It is expected that the MBMS
UE periodically requests SNTP time synchronization in order to keep the +/- 1
second tolerance.However the MBMS UE should use the SNTP time synchronization
service only as necessary to keep +/-1 second accuracy, and should at most use
the SNTP time synchronization once every 24 hours to avoid scalability issues.
To further prevent scalability issues, the MBMS UE should randomize its
periodic SNTP requests over 1 hour just preceeding its determined periodic
SNTP request time.
SNTP time synchronization may be achieved either by using SNTP anycast [84],
or SNTP unicast [84], depending on network support.
For network deployment where intermediate router nodes between the UE and BM-
SC have anycast enabled, the BM-SC shall support the SNTP anycast mode. The
MBMS UE sends a request to a designated IPv4 or IPv6 local broadcast address
or multicast group address. One or more SNTP anycast servers reply and include
a timestamp with their current time and its precision. BM-SC SNTP servers
shall only respond if they have a valid synchronization time and shall not
leave the timestamp blank, such that the SNTP Leap Indicator (LI) field shall
not use the value 3 (warning: unsynchronised). The MBMS UE does not need to
keep server address state data and changes in the SNTP server addressing will
not affect each subsequent synchronization operation.
For IPv4, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned the
multicast group address 224.0.1.1 for NTP, which is used by both multicast
servers and anycast clients. For IPv6, the IANA has assigned the multicast
group address FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:101. These NTP assignments apply to SNTP usage
as well. The SNTP server will join these IP multicast groups.
For network deployment where intermediate router nodes between the UE and the
SNTP servers do not have anycast enabled, the SNTP server(s) shall support
unicast mode. The MBMS UE sends a request to its pre-configured SNTP server
address FQDN [104]. The network may distribute the SNTP request traffic load
to a pool of SNTP servers in the network, as long as the UE pre-configured
SNTP FQDN address is unchanged. The way the network performs this load
distribution is out of scope of this specification. SNTP servers shall only
respond if they have a valid synchronization time and shall not leave the
timestamp blank, such that the SNTP Leap Indicator (LI) field shall not use
the value 3 (warning: unsychronized).
An MBMS UE shall select the SNTP mode to use as follows:
  * Attempt time synchronization using SNTP anycast;
  * If SNTP anycast procedure is successful then the UE should use SNTP anycast and continue using anycast for future periodic SNTP time synchronization over the same access network;
  * If the SNTP anycast procedure fails then it should use SNTP unicast and continue using unicast for future periodic SNTP time synchronization over the same access network.
  * In case of access network change detected by the UE, the UE should go to step 1 for its next periodic SNTP time synchronization.
# 5 Procedures and protocols
## 5.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the MBMS User service procedures and protocols.
## 5.2 User Service Discovery/Announcement
### 5.2.1 Introduction
User service discovery refers to methods for the UE to obtain a list of
available MBMS user services or user service bundles along with information on
the user services. Part of the information may be presented to the user to
enable service selection.
User service announcement refers to methods for the MBMS service provider to
announce the list of available MBMS user services and user service bundles,
along with information on the user services, to the UE.
In order for the user to be able to initiate a particular service, the UE
needs certain metadata information. The required metadata information is
described in sub-clause 5.2.2.
According to 3GPP TS 23.246 [4], in order for this information to be available
to the UE operators/service providers may consider several service discovery
mechanisms. User service announcement may be performed over a MBMS bearer or
via other means. The download delivery method is used for the user service
announcement over a MBMS bearer. The user service announcement mechanism based
on the download delivery method is described in sub-clause 5.2.3. The user
service announcement using interactive announcement function is described in
sub-clause 5.2.4. Other user service announcement and discovery mechanisms by
other means than the download delivery method are out of scope of the present
document.
### 5.2.2 MBMS User Service Description Metadata Fragments
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
MBMS User Service Discovery/ Announcement is needed in order to advertise MBMS
Streaming and MBMS Download User Services and User Service Bundles in advance
of, and potentially during, the User Service sessions described. The User
Services are described by metadata (objects/files) delivered using the
download delivery method as defined in clause 7 or using interactive
announcement functions.
MBMS User Service Discovery/Announcement involves the delivery of fragments of
metadata to many receivers in a suitable manner. The metadata itself describes
details of services. A _metadata fragment_ is a single uniquely identifiable
block of metadata. An obvious example of a metadata fragment would be a single
SDP file ([14]).
The metadata consists of:
  * a metadata fragment object describing details of a single or a > bundle of MBMS user services (defined in sub-clause 11.2);
  * a metadata fragment object(s) describing details of MBMS user > service sessions (defined in sub-clause 7.3 and 8.3);
  * a metadata fragment object(s) describing details of Associated > delivery methods (defined in sub-clause 9.5);
  * a metadata fragment object(s) describing details of service > protection (defined in sub-clause 11.3);
```{=html}
``` \- a metadata fragment object describing details of the FEC repair data >
stream;
  * a metadata fragment object(s) providing a Schedule information > description (defined in sub-clause 11.2A).
  * a metadata fragment object providing a Media Presentation > Description (defined in sub-clause 11.2);
  * a metadata fragment object(s) providing Initialisation Segments > (defined in sub-clause 11.2).
Metadata management information consists of:
  * a metadata envelope object(s) allowing the identification, > versioning, update and temporal validity of metadata fragment > objects (defined in sub-clause 11.1).
A metadata envelope may have multiple metadata envelope instances. The
metadata envelope and metadata fragment objects are transported as file
objects in the same download session either as separate referencing files or
as a single embedding file - see sub-clause 5.2.3.3. A single metadata
envelope instance shall describe a single metadata fragment, and thus
instances of the two are paired. A service announcement sender shall make a
metadata envelope instance available for each metadata fragment instance. The
creation and use of both an embedded envelope instance and a referenced
envelope instance for a particular fragment instance is not recommended.
The metadata envelope and metadata fragment objects may be compressed using
the generic GZip algorithm specified in RFC 1952 [42] as content/transport
encoding for transmission. Where used over an MBMS bearer, this shall be
according to Download delivery content encoding using FLUTE - see sub-clause
7.2.5.

Figure 5: Simple Description Data Model
Figure 5 illustrates the simple data model relation between these description
instances using UML [21] for a single User Service Bundle Description.
NOTE: \"N\" means any number in each instance.
One MBMS User Service Bundle Description shall contain at least one User
Service Description instance and may contain several. The User Service Bundle
Description may refer to a single FEC Repair Stream Description.
In the event a MBMS User Service carries AHS-formatted contents, the MBMS User
Service Description fragment shall contain a _mediaPresentationDescription_
element. The _mediaPresentationDescription_ element shall in turn contain a
reference to the MPD (Media Presentation Description) as defined in [47], as a
metadata fragment. Furthermore, the MPD may refer to one or more
Initialisation Segments as defined in [47], as the Initialisation Segment
Description (ISD) metadata fragment. Also, when AHS-formatted contents are
delivered by MBMS, at least one of the delivery methods shall be the download
delivery method.
One MBMS User Service Description instance shall include at least one delivery
method description instance. The delivery method description shall refer to
one session description instance.
The delivery method description may contain references to a service protection
description and an associated delivery procedure description. Several delivery
methods may reference the same service protection description.
If the associated delivery procedure description is present in the user
service description instance, it may be referenced by one or more delivery
methods.
An MBMS user service description allows the association of delivery methods to
one or more access systems. The association is used to describe the use of
separate access systems for the same MBMS user service. One delivery method
may be offered throughout one or more radio access systems. The use of
separate MBMS bearer services for the same MBMS user service is described in
sub-clause 5.1.5.2 of [4].
Multipart MIME [37] may be used to concatenate the descriptions into one
document for transport.
#### 5.2.2.2 Session Description
One or more session descriptions are contained in one session description
object. The session description instance shall be formatted according to the
Session Description Protocol (SDP) [14]. Each session description instance
must describe either one Streaming session or one FLUTE Download session. A
session description for a Streaming session may include multiple media
descriptions for RTP sessions. The _sessionDescriptionURI_ references the
session description object. The session description is specified in sub-clause
7.3 for the MBMS download delivery method and in subclause 8.3 for the MBMS
streaming delivery method.
#### 5.2.2.3 Associated Delivery Procedure Description
The description and configuration of associated delivery procedures is
specified in clause 9. The _associatedProcedureDescriptionURI_ references the
associated delivery procedure instance.
An associated delivery procedure description may be delivered on a dedicated
announcement channel and updated on a dedicated announcement channel as well
as in-band with an MBMS download session.
If an associated delivery procedure description for File-Repair operations is
available, then the MBMS receiver may use the file repair service as specified
in sub-clause 9.3.
If an associated delivery procedure description for reception reporting is
available, then the MBMS receiver shall provide reception reports as specified
in sub-clause 9.4.
#### 5.2.2.4 Service Protection Description
The security description fragment contains the key identifiers and procedure
descriptions for one delivery method. When different delivery methods use the
same security description, the same security description document is
referenced from the different delivery method elements.
The security description contains key identifiers and the server address to
request the actual key material. To avoid overload situations, the same load
balancing principles as in the associated delivery procedures are used. The
key management server shall be selected as defined in sub-clause 9.3.5. The
back-off time shall be determined as defined in sub-clause 9.3.4.
The XML schema for the service protection description is defined in sub-clause
11.3.
#### 5.2.2.5 FEC Repair Stream Description
The streaming delivery method's FEC has separate stream for repair data, which
is described by the FEC Repair Stream Description. The FEC Repair Stream
Description shall be done using SDP [14]. This SDP file is referenced by the
_bundleDescription_ element in the service description. The FEC Repair Stream
described is common for all FEC protected packet flows within the MBMS User
Service Bundle Description instance.
#### 5.2.2.6 Schedule Description
The schedule description is specified in sub-clause 11.2A.
The schedule description information may describe the schedule of an MBMS User
Service in terms of
  * start/stop lists, or
  * reoccurring events
  * The service ID or service Class to which the file schedule may apply,
The UE can expect to receive MBMS data during the described time periods when
the session for the User Service is active.
The schedule description fragement may also include the schedule for when the
files of a download delivery MBMS User Service are to be transmitted. The file
schedule information is defined in terms of:
  * The service ID or service Class to which the file schedule may apply,
  * The list of file delivery schedule information consisting of:
    * A file URI to identify a given file being transmitted,
    * A list of broadcast delivery start and end times,
Note that such file schedule information would not be useful for download
delivery services transporting DASH segments.
When including file delivery schedule, the schedule description fragment may
capture the file transmission schedule for multiple User Services.
The schedule information contains a schedule update time, allowing the UE to
know when to update its current schedule.
A Schedule Description fragment may be delivered as a metadata fragment on the
service announcement channel and may be updated in-band with an MBMS download
session. When describing the file delivery schedule for multiple user
services, the Schedule Description fragment may be carried on an MBMS download
delivery session dedicated to the transport of file schedule information. The
mechanism UEs use to discover this file delivery schedule session is outside
the scope of this specification.
#### 5.2.2.7 Media Presentation Description
The Media Presentation Description fragment shall be a Media Presentation
Description as specified in [47], containing descriptive information on the
media presentation. This information will be used by the AHS client to
construct the associated media presentation as a streaming service to the end
user.
Availability of this metadata fragment is indicated by the presence of the
_mediaPresentationDescription_ element in the MBMS User Service Description
fragment. In that case, at least one of the delivery methods shall be a
download delivery method. The actual URI to the Media Presentation Description
fragment is provided by the element _mpdURI_ in the
_mediaPresentationDescription_ element.
### 5.2.3 User Service Announcement over a MBMS bearer
#### 5.2.3.1 General
Both the metadata envelope and metadata fragment objects are transported as
file objects in the same download session.
To receive a Service Announcement User Service the client shall obtain the
session parameters for the related MBMS download session transport. This may
be achieved by pre-storing the related session parameters in the MBMS UE or
via delivery over OMA PUSH[79].
NOTE: The user service announcements are not protected when sent over MBMS
bearer. See 3GPP TS 33.246 [20]
#### 5.2.3.2 Metadata Envelope Transport
The metadata envelope object is transported as a file object in the same MBMS
service announcement download session as its metadata fragment file object
(i.e. in-band with the metadata fragment session).
#### 5.2.3.3 Metadata Envelope and Metadata Fragment Association with FLUTE
The MBMS Download service announcement session FDT Instances provide URIs for
each transported object. The metadata envelope instance _metadataURI_ field
shall use the same URI for the metadata fragment as is used in the FDT
Instances for that metadata fragment file. Thus, the fragment can be mapped to
its associated envelope in-band of a single MBMS download session.
In the referencing case, each metadata envelope and corresponding metadata
fragment shall be grouped together by the FDT using the grouping mechanism
described in sub-clause 7.2.6. This reduces the complexity of requesting both
fragment and envelope for each pair, thus it is recommended that only the
metadata fragment (fileURI) be requested from the download client (which will
result in both fragment and envelope being received using the grouping
mechanism).
### _5.2.4_ User Service Announcement using Interactive Announcement Function
User service descriptions may be transported to the UE using HTTP and other
interactive transport methods. A BM-SC may provide the service descriptions on
request. Further protocol specifications of interactive announcement functions
are outside of the scope of this specification.
Aggregated MBMS service announcement documents as specified in sub-clause
5.2.5 may be used with the interactive announcement functions. UEs shall
support the disassembly of aggregated MBMS service announcement documents. UEs
shall support Gzip decoding of MBMS service description objects for
interactive transport (BM-SC use of Gzip is optional in accordance with sub-
clause 5.2.2).
The BM-SC may use Metadata Envelopes as described in clause 11.1, and UEs
shall support their use with the Interactive Announcement Function. Where
metadata envelopes are not used, only the latest delivery of a metadata
fragment shall be used by the UE, and the BM-SC shall ensure timely,
consistent, size-limited and secure delivery of metadata by means outside the
scope of this document.
### 5.2.5 User Service Announcement over point-to-point push bearers.
#### 5.2.5.1 General
User service announcement over point-to-point push bearers have several
characteristics that differ from user service announcement over a MBMS bearer.
It is not essential that the metadata envelope made available by the service
announcement sender is transmitted to the MBMS terminal. In the case that both
the metadata envelope and metadata fragment objects are transported, it is a
limitation of the solution that the metadata fragment must either be embedded
within the metadata envelope, or that the metadata fragment must be referenced
by the metadata envelope and they are both contained within a multipart MIME
container [37]. In either configuration, both the metadata envelope and the
metadata fragment objects are transported as file objects in the same download
session.
This sub-clause covers both metadata transport and metadata fragmentation
aspects of Service Announcement. Service Announcement over point-to-point push
bearers is specified.
NOTE: The user service announcements are not protected when sent over point-
to-point push bearers. See 3GPP TS 33.246 [20].
#### 5.2.5.2 Supported Metadata Syntaxes
The supported metadata syntaxes are as defined in sub-clause 11.1 of this
document.
#### 5.2.5.3 Consistency Control and Syntax Independence
The consistency control and syntax independence is as defined in sub-clause
11.1 of this document.
#### 5.2.5.4 Metadata Envelope Definition
The metadata envelope definition is as defined in sub-clause 11.1 of this
document.
#### 5.2.5.5 Delivery of the Metadata Envelope
An instance of metadata fragment shall either be embedded within the metadata
envelope or be included in a multipart MIME container together with the
envelope. The envelope and fragment are, by definition, transported together
and in-band of the same transport session.
The Metadata Envelope includes a reference (_metadataURI_) to the associated
metadata fragment using the same URI as the fragment file is identified by in
the Service Announcement. Thus, Metadata Envelope can be mapped to its
associated metadata fragment.
#### 5.2.5.6 Metadata Envelope Transport
The metadata envelope object is transported as a file object in the same MBMS
service announcement download session as its metadata fragment file object
(i.e. in-band with the metadata fragment session).
#### 5.2.5.7 User service announcement over SMS bearers
User service announcements over SMS bearers are formatted according to the OMA
Push OTA specification [79].
OTA-WSP shall be used over the SMS bearer. Application port addressing shall
be used as specified in [79]. The application ID to be used is 0x9023 as
allocated by OMNA [85].
Either confirmed or unconfirmed push may be used. In either case, the
primitive shall contain the Push Headers parameter. Within this parameter, the
Content-Type header shall be included and the Content-Encoding header shall be
included if GZip is used.
#### 5.2.5.8 User service announcement over HTTP push bearers
User service announcements over HTTP push bearers are formatted according to
the OMA Push OTA specification [79].
OTA-HTTP shall be used over the HTTP push bearer. Application port addressing
shall be used as specified in [79]. The application ID to be used is 0x9023 as
allocated by OMNA [85].
The Content-Encoding header shall be included if GZip is used.
### _5.2.6 Metadata Fragment Encapsulation to aggregate Service Announcement
Documents_
The present document defines a number of metadata fragments to describe MBMS
user services. A metadata fragment is a single uniquely identifiable block of
metadata. Generally, more than one metadata fragment is necessary to provide
all necessary parameters to initiate an MBMS User Service. Typically, metadata
fragments are provided in separate documents. Each metadata fragment is
labelled with its MIME type.
Multipart MIME may be used to encapsulate metadata fragments into an aggregate
service announcement document. The aggregate document may contain metadata
fragments of several MBMS user services. It is recommended, that any such
aggregate service announcement document contains all the referenced metadata
fragments of each MBMS user service description it contains (i.e. in the same
multipart MIME structure).
An aggregate service announcement document shall encapsulate metadata
fragments according to RFC 2557 [37]. The first encapsulated file of an
aggregate service announcement document is the root resource. The root
resource shall be either an MBMS user service description or a metadata
envelope (as a referencing index). The service description metadata is
described in sub-clause 5.2.2 and defined in sub-clause 11.2. The metadata
envelope is defined in sub-clause 11.1.
The type field of the multipart/related header shall be set to
application/mbms-user-service-description-parameter in case the root resource
is a user service description instance. The type field of the
multipart/related header shall be set to application/mbms-envelope in case the
root resource is a metadata envelope.
### _5.2.7 Registration and Deregistration Procedure for MBMS User Service
Consumption_
The MBMS User Service Description Fragment may include a registration
description. If the registration description is present in the MBMS User
Service Description Fragment, then the UE shall use the registration and
deregistration procedures as defined in this section.
A registration request is then initiated by the UE, in order to receive the
complete user service description. The registration procedure is performed
using HTTP 1.1 [18] POST message towards the indicated RegistrationURL.
A successful registration response shall start with a 200 OK status line in
the response header and shall contain in the body the metadata fragments that
are referenced by the USD in a multipart MIME container.
The registration request shall be formatted according to the following XML
schema and using the RegistrationRequest element.
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
A de-registration procedure is used by the UE to de-register at the end of the
user service consumption, in case a registration procedure has been performed.
The de-registration request shall be sent to a registration server (preferably
the one with which the registration procedure has been performed). The de-
registration procedure consists of sending an HTTP 1.1 POST request with an
XML body formatted according to the XML schema above, using the
DeregistrationRequest element.
The MIME type of the message body of the registration and deregistration
request shall be set to "text/xml".
The _IMEI_ element contains, if present, the International Mobile Equirment
Identifier as defined in [77].
The _MSISDN_ element contains the Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number as defined in
[77].
The _ServiceID_ element contains the unique MBMS User Service Identifier as
defined in clause 11.2.1.1.
## 5.3 User Service Initiation/Termination
### 5.3.1 Initiation of MBMS Bearer Service based Services
MBMS User Service initiation refers to UE mechanisms to set-up the reception
of MBMS user service data. During the User Service Initiation procedure, a set
of MBMS Bearers may be activated. The User Service Initiation procedure takes
place after the discovery of the MBMS user service.
Figure 6: Initiation of an MBMS User Service
> 1\. The User Service Initiation Procedure is triggered and takes a User
> Service Description as input that has been obtained e.g. by executing the

### 5.3.2 Termination of MBMS Bearer Service based Services
MBMS user service termination refers to the UE mechanisms to terminate the
reception of MBMS user services. A set of MBMS Bearers may be deactivated
during this procedure.

### 5.3.3 Initiation of Unicast Bearer Service based Services
Unicast Bearer Service based MBMS User Service initiation refers to the
mechanisms to set-up the reception of MBMS user service data via a UMTS/EPS
Bearer Service with interactive and/or streaming straffic class.
In case of the initiation of a MBMS Streaming delivery method or a combined
MBMS Streaming and MBMS Download delivery method, the Packet Switched
Streaming Service (PSS) as defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [47] shall be used. The
establishement of a PSS session is described in clause 5.1 of 3GPP TS 26.234
[47].
In case of the initiation of a MBMS Download delivery method, the MBMS UE is
registered in the BM-SC for OMA-PUSH based reception of the files with the BM-
SC.
### 5.3.4 Termination of Unicast Bearer Service based Services
Unicast Bearer Service based MBMS user service termination refers to the
mechanisms to terminate the reception of MBMS user service data via a UMTS/EPS
Bearer Service with interactive and/or streaming straffic class.
In case of the termination of a MBMS Streaming delivery method or a combined
MBMS Streaming and MBMS Download delivery method, the Packet Switched
Streaming Service (PSS) as defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [47] shall be used. The
termination of a PSS session is described in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 26.234
[47].
In case of the termination of a MBMS Download delivery method, the MBMS UE is
deregistered in the BM-SC so that the OMA-PUSH based reception of the files
with the BM-SC will be terminated.
### 5.3.5 Scalable Service Initiation and Termination for MBMS Services
#### 5.3.5.1 General
MBMS service initiation and termination as defined in clauses 5.3.1 to 5.3.4
may consist of network interactions such as sending an IGMP Join or Leave
message to the network as described in sections 8.2 and 8.7 of 3GPP TS 23.246
[4]. Initiation and termination procedures may be triggered at the MBMS UE by
the user or be scheduled to happen automatically. Upon (or after) receiving a
user service announcement, the MBMS UE may render the information about the
advertised services to the user to assist him in the service selection. The
user may decide to receive a given service and hence trigger the service
initiation procedure. Alternatively, the user may declare his interest in a
specific service a-priori and upon receiving the service announcement for that
specific service, the MBMS UE may schedule the initiation procedure at or
around the start time of the session. Similarly, the MBMS UE may schedule the
termination procedure at or around the session end time.
As a consequence, MBMS UEs may be oriented to start their service initiation
and termination procedures at the same time or during a relatively short
period. This may cause network congestion, especially during the multicast of
a popular service, as all MBMS UEs may be time synchronized.
#### 5.3.5.2 Randomization of Service Initiation over Time
The MBMS User Service description may contain parameters to uniformly
randomize the User Service Initiation procedures of the MBMS UEs. Security
functions may be part of the User Service Initiation procedure as defined in
clause 5.3.1. If a user service initiation randomization is defined for a user
service, then the overload prevention definition in the service protection
description shall be ignored for the service initiation. For randomizing the
time of the initiation procedure, the MBMS UE shall understand the following
parameters, which may be signalled by the BM-SC in the MBMS user service
description as described in section 11.2.1:
  1. _initiationStartTime_ parameter is used by the BM-SC to signal to the MBMS UE the start time for the User Service Initiation procedure randomization period. If the _initiationStartTime_ parameter is not present, the MBMS UE uses the time of the Service Annoucement reception as the start time.
  2. _protectionPeriod_ parameter is used by the BM-SC to signal to the MBMS UE the duration of the critical time periods, during which congestion shall be avoided. The MBMS UEs shall randomly spread the initiation procedure using the _randomTimePeriod_ during this protection period.
  3. _randomTimePeriod_ parameter is used by the BM-SC to signal to the MBMS UE the duration of an interval over which initiation procedures shall be randomly deferred. The MBMS UE calculates a random time out of the _randomTimePeriod interval to defer_ the execution of the initiation procedure.
The MBMS UE shall start its initiation procedure immediately if the procedure
is triggered outside of protection periods.
#### 5.3.5.3 Randomization of Service Termination over Time
The MBMS User Service description may contain parameters to uniformly
randomize the User Service Termination procedures of the MBMS UEs. For
randomizing the time of the termination procedure, the MBMS UE shall
understand the following parameters, which may be signalled by the BM-SC in
the MBMS USD as described in section 11.2.1:
  1. _protectionPeriod_ parameter is used by the BM-SC to signal to the MBMS UE the duration of the critical time period, during which congestion needs to be avoided. The MBMS UEs shall randomly spread the termination procedure using the _randomTimePeriod_ during this period and starting from the session end time.
  2. _randomTimePeriod_ parameter is used by the BM-SC to signal to the MBMS UE the duration of an interval over which termination procedures shall be randomly deferred. The termination procedure is only randomized during the _protectionPeriod._
If the termination procedure is triggered before the session end time or after
the protection period end time, the MBMS UE shall start its termination
procedure immediately. If it is in a protection period, the MBMS UE shall
defer its termination procedure to a random time spread over an interval of
duration _randomTimePeriod_.
## 5.4 MBMS Data Transfer Procedure
### 5.4.1 MBMS Data Transfer Procedure using MBMS Bearer Services
MBMS Data Transfer procedure using MBMS Bearer Services refers to the network
(and UE) mechanism to transfer (and receive) data for one MBMS User Service on
one or several MBMS Bearer Services.
{width="6.013194444444444in" height="3.426388888888889in"}
NOTE: Security related interactions are not depicted in the sequence.
Figure 8: Procedure of MBMS Data Transfer
> 1\. The MBMS Delivery Method for the MBMS User Service is triggered by the
> MBMS User Service Provider. Note, details of the trigger are beyond of the

> identified by the TMGI.
Note. MBMS Bearer services might be activated only to a subset of the
available access systems (see 3GPP TS 23.246 [4]). In case MBMS User Services
or delivery methods are not available throughout all access systems, the BM-SC
describes this transmission strategy in the MBMS User Service Description (see
sub-clause 5.2.2).
> 3\. - 3n. The data of the MBMS user service are transmitted to all listening

> confidentiality protected, MBMS traffic keys are delivered simultaneously on
> the same or a different MBMS bearer. Optionally, syncronization information
> for MBSFN may be added to the MBMS User Data. The headers of MBMS User data

> before it starts the associated delivery procedure according to clause 9.
### 5.4.2 MBMS Data Transfer Procedure using other UMTS Bearer Services
MBMS Data Transfer procedure using other UMTS Bearer Services refers to the
network (and UE) mechanism to transfer (and receive) data for one MBMS User
Service on one or more Unicast Bearer Services.
In case the MBMS Data belong to a MBMS Streaming delivery session or a
combined MBMS Streaming and MBMS Download delivery session, the Packet
Switched Streaming Service (PSS) as defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [47] shall be
used.
In case the MBMS Data belong to a MBMS Download delivery session, the MBMS
data is transferred using OMA-PUSH.
## 5.5 MBMS Protocols
Figure 9 illustrates the protocol stack used by MBMS User services. The grey-
shaded protocols and functions are outside of the scope of the present
document. MBMS security functions and the usage of HTTP-digest and SRTP are
defined in 3GPP TS 33.246 [20].
Figure 9: Protocol stack view of the MBMS User Services
## 5.6 HTTP Streaming and MBMS
The 3GPP adaptive HTTP-Streaming protocol as defined in [47] specifies formats
and methods that enable the delivery of streaming service(s) from standard
HTTP servers to an HTTP-Streaming client. It involves the description of a
collection of media segments and auxiliary metadata (all referenced by HTTP-
URLs) through a Media Presentation Description (MPD). In the case of real-time
streaming services delivery of AHS formatted contents over MBMS bearers,
MPD\@type (attribute 'type' of the MPD) shall be set to "Live". When
MPD\@minimumUpdatePeriod (attribute 'minimumUpdatePeriod' of the MPD) is
present, then the UE should expect MPD updates to be sent inband with the
media segments
MBMS is designed to serve large receive groups with same content. The MBMS
Download Delivery Method is designed to deliver an arbitrary number of objects
via MBMS to a large receiver population. MBMS Download defines several methods
to increase reliability such as FEC and file repair. The download delivery
method allows the delivery of AHS segments and Media Presentation Descriptions
as defined in [47]. Segment URIs are described using FLUTE.
The network may announce the usage of MBMS download delivery method for
providing the media segments for AHS through the MBMS User Service
Description. In such an event, the MBMS User Service Description fragment
shall include a mediaPresentationDescription element. This element contains a
reference to a Media Presentation Description fragment as defined in [47].
Consequently, the UE can expect that the files provided with the MBMS download
delivery method are formatted according to the 3GP file format for adaptive
HTTP streaming as specified in [32]. Furthermore, the Media Presentation
Description fragment may contain reference(s) to Initialisation Segment
Description fragment(s) as defined in [47].
Clause 4.4.3 of this specification enables integrity and/or confidentiality
protection of MBMS user services data according to 3GPP TS 33.246 [20]. In
this case each AHS formatted file is protected using the Protection of
Download Data as described in 3GPP TS 33.246 [20].
As this protection mechanism is performed in the underlying layer of the AHS
client it is transparent to AHS client and not reflected in the MPD associated
to the AHS representation.
For HTTP streaming, QoE reporting on MBMS level can be activated as described
in section 8.3.2.1 or 8.3.2.2, and QoE reporting shall in such case be done as
specified in section 8.4. The Network Resource and Loss of Objects QoE metrics
are relevant to HTTP Streaming over MBMS.
QoE reporting can also be activated on AHS level as specified in [47], section
5.3.3.8, with the metrics defined in [47], section 11.2, and reporting shall
in such case be done according to [47], section 5.3.2.3.3.
# 6 Introduction on Delivery Methods
Two delivery methods are defined in the present document - the download
delivery method and the streaming delivery method. MBMS delivery methods make
use of MBMS bearers for content delivery but may also use the associated
procedures defined in clause 9.
Use of MBMS bearers by the download delivery method is described in clause 7.
The File Repair Procedure and the Reception Reporting Procedure (described in
clause 9) may be used by the download delivery method.
Use of MBMS bearers by the streaming delivery method is described in clause 8.
# 7 Download Delivery Method
## 7.1 Introduction
MBMS download delivery method uses the FLUTE protocol (RFC 3926 [9]) when
delivering content over MBMS bearers. MBMS download delivery method may use
OMA PUSH [79] when delivering content over other UMTS/EPS bearers. Usage of
FLUTE protocol is described in clause 7.2. The Usage of OMA Push is described
in clasue 7.4. The FLUTE session set-up with RTSP is defined in clause 7.5.
FLUTE is built on top of the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) protocol
instantiation (RFC 3450 [10]). ALC combines the Layered Coding Transport (LCT)
building block [11], a congestion control building block and the Forward Error
Correction (FEC) building block ([12]) to provide congestion controlled
reliable asynchronous delivery of content to an unlimited number of concurrent
receivers from a single sender. As mentioned in (RFC 3450 [10]), congestion
control is not appropriate in the type of environment that MBMS download
delivery is provided, and thus congestion control is not used for MBMS
download delivery. See figure 10 for an illustration of FLUTE building block
structure. FLUTE is carried over UDP/IP, and is independent of the IP version
and the underlying link layers used.
Figure 10: Building block structure of FLUTE
ALC uses the LCT building block to provide in-band session management
functionality. The LCT building block has several specified and under-
specified fields that are inherited and further specified by ALC. ALC uses the
FEC building block to provide reliability. The FEC building block allows the
choice of an appropriate FEC code to be used within ALC, including using the
no-code FEC code that simply sends the original data using no FEC coding. ALC
is under-specified and generally transports binary objects of finite or
indeterminate length. FLUTE is a fully-specified protocol to transport files
(any kind of discrete binary object), and uses special purpose objects - the
File Description Table (FDT) Instances - to provide a running index of files
and their essential reception parameters in-band of a FLUTE session.
## 7.2 FLUTE usage for MBMS download
The purpose of download is to deliver content in files. In the context of MBMS
download, a file contains any type of MBMS data (e.g. 3GPP file (Audio/Video),
Binary data, Still images, Text, Service Announcement metadata).
In the present document the term \"file\" is used for all objects carried by
FLUTE (with the exception of the FDT Instances).
UE applications for MBMS user services built upon the download delivery method
have three general approaches to getting files from the FLUTE receiver for a
joined session:
  * **Promiscuous:** Instruct FLUTE to promiscuously receive all files > available. Promiscuous reception can be suitable for single > purpose sessions (generally with limited number and/or size of > files) although uncertainty over the quality and content of files > makes this approach generally undesirable.
  * **One-copy:** Instruct FLUTE to receive a copy of one or more > specific files (identified by the fileURI) - and potentially > leaving the session following reception of one copy of all the > specified files. Specifying the download file ensures that the UE > has an upper bound to the quantity of files downloaded. One-copy > reception requires prior knowledge of the file identifiers > (fileURIs).
  * **Keep-updated:** Instruct FLUTE to receive one or more specific > files and continue to receive any updates to those files. As with > one-copy, the keep-updated approach bounds the quantity of files > downloaded and requires prior knowledge of the file identifiers.
NOTE: The present document does not prevent or endorse changing download
reception approach, and any related file list, during the life of the download
session. Discovery of session content lists (including file lists) out-of-band
of the delivery method sessions is beyond the scope of the present document.
The interaction of these file download modes and the caching directives is
defined in section 7.2.13.
MBMS clients and servers supporting MBMS download shall implement the FLUTE
specification (RFC 3926 [9]), as well as ALC (RFC 3450 [10]) and LCT (RFC 3451
[11]) features that FLUTE inherits. In addition, several optional and extended
aspects of FLUTE ,as described in the following clauses, shall be supported.
One FDT instance is typically bound to one MBMS transmission session. It is
therefore recommended, that each MBMS transmission session should contain one
or more repetitions of the same FDT instance.
### 7.2.1 Fragmentation of Files
Fragmentation of files shall be provided by a blocking algorithm (which
calculates source blocks from source files) and a symbol encoding algorithm
(which calculates encoding symbols from source blocks).
### 7.2.2 Symbol Encoding Algorithm
The \"Compact No-Code FEC scheme\" - [12] (FEC Encoding ID 0, also known as
\"Null-FEC\") shall be supported.
The Raptor FEC scheme is described in sub-clause 7.2.12.
A UE that supports MBMS User Services shall support a decoder for the Raptor
FEC scheme.
If a UE that supports MBMS User Services receives a mathematically sufficient
set of encoding symbols generated according to the encoder specification in
[91] for reconstruction of a source block then the decoder shall recover the
entire source block. Note that the example decoder described in [91] clause
5.5 fulfils this requirement.
### 7.2.3 Blocking Algorithm
In the case of the Compact No-Code FEC scheme [12] (FEC Encoding ID 0), then
the \"Algorithm for Computing Source Block Structure\" described within the
FLUTE specification (RFC 3926 [9]) shall be used.
In the case of Raptor forward error correction, then the algorithm defined in
[91] shall be used.
The values of _N_ , _Z_ , _T_ and _A_ shall be set such that the sub-block
size is less than 256KB.
### 7.2.4 Congestion Control
For simplicity of congestion control, FLUTE channelization shall be provided
by a single FLUTE channel with single rate transport.
### 7.2.5 Content Encoding of Files for Transport
Files may be content encoded for transport, as described in [9], in the
Download delivery method using the generic GZip algorithm as specified in RFC
1952 [42]. UEs shall support GZip content decoding of FLUTE files (GZIP RFC
1952 [42], clause 9).
### 7.2.6 Transport File Grouping
Files downloaded as part of a multiple-file delivery are generally related to
one another. Examples include web pages, software packages, and the
referencing metadata envelopes and their metadata fragments. FLUTE clients
analyse the XML-encoded FDT Instances as they are received, identify each
requested file, associate it with FLUTE packets (using the TOI) and discover
the relevant in-band download configuration parameters of each file.
An additional \"group\" field in the FLUTE FDT instance and file elements
enables logical grouping of related files. A FLUTE receiver should download
all the files belonging to all groups where one or more of the files of those
groups have been requested. However, a UE may instruct its FLUTE receiver to
ignore grouping to deal with special circumstances, such as low storage
availability.
The group names are allocated by the FLUTE sender and each specific group name
shall group the corresponding files together as one group, including files
describes in the same and other FDT Instances, for a session.
Group field usage in FDT Instances is shown in the FDT XML schema (clause
7.2.10). Each file element of an FDT Instance may be labelled with zero, one
or more group names. Each FDT Instance element may be labelled with zero, one
or more group names which are inherited by all files described in that FDT
Instance.
### 7.2.7 Signalling of Parameters with Basic ALC/FLUTE Headers
FLUTE and ALC mandatory header fields shall be as specified in [9, 10] with
the following additional specializations:
  * The length of the CCI (Congestion Control Identifier) field shall be > 32 bits and it is assigned a value of zero (C=0).
  * The Transmission Session Identifier (TSI) field shall be of length > 16 bits (S=0, H=1, 16 bits).
  * The Transport Object Identifier (TOI) field should be of length 16 > bits (O=0, H=1).
  * Only Transport Object Identifier (TOI) 0 (zero) shall be used for > FDT Instances.
  * The following features may be used for signalling the end of session > and end of object transmission to the receiver:
\- The Close Session flag (A) for indicating the end of a session.
\- The Close Object flag (B) for indicating the end of an object.
In FLUTE the following applies:
  * The Sender Current Time present flag (T) shall be set to zero.
  * The Expected Residual Time present flag (R) shall be set to zero.
  * The LCT header length (HDR_LEN) shall be set to the total length of > the LCT header in units of 32-bit words.
  * For \"Compact No-Code FEC scheme\" [12], the FEC Payload ID shall > be set according to RFC 3695 [13] such that a 16 bit SBN (Source > Block Number) and then the 16 bit ESI (Encoding Symbol ID) are > given.
  * For "MBMS FEC scheme", the FEC Payload ID shall be set according to > Clause 7.2.12.1.
### 7.2.8 Signalling of Parameters with FLUTE Extension Headers
The FLUTE sender shall use FLUTE extension header fields EXT_FDT, EXT_FTI ,
EXT_CENC [9] as follows:
  * EXT_FTI shall be included in every FLUTE packet carrying symbols > belonging to any FDT Instance.
  * FLUTE packets carrying symbols of files (not FDT Instances) shall > not include an EXT_FTI.
  * FDT Instances shall not be content encoded and therefore EXT_CENC > shall not be used.
According to FLUTE [9] the following rules apply for a FLUTE sender:
  * EXT_FDT is in every FLUTE packet carrying symbols belonging to any > FDT Instance.
  * FLUTE packets carrying symbols of files (not FDT instances) do not > include the EXT_FDT.
Note: As an MBMS client conforms to a FLUTE receiver the receiver side
treatment of LCT extension headers is covered by RFC3451 and RFC3926. The
actions when receiving EXT_FDT and EXT_FTI are defined in RFC3926. The default
action for unrecognized header extensions is to ignore them.
### 7.2.9 Signalling of Parameters with FDT Instances
The extended FLUTE FDT instance schema defined in clause 7.2.10.1 (based on
the one in RFC 3926 [9]) shall be used. In addition, the following applies to
both the session level information and all files of a FLUTE session.
The inclusion of these FDT Instance data elements is mandatory according to
the FLUTE specification:
  * Content-Location (URI of a file).
  * TOI (Transport Object Identifier of a file instance).
  * Expires (expiry data for the FDT Instance).
For MBMS operation, the UE shall not use a received FDT Instance to interpret
packets received beyond the expiration time of the FDT Instance.
  * NOTE 1: This requirement is strengthened for MBMS compared to RFC 3926 [9], where it is mentioned that "the receiver SHOULD NOT use a received FDT Instance to interpret packets received beyond the expiration time of the FDT Instance."
  * NOTE 2: It is expected that a TOI value may be reused after the highest expiry time of the FDT instances containing that TOI value.
NOTE 3: Since the expiry time corresponds to the end of transmission. A UE can
either clean up its memory in case not sufficient symbols are received, or
perform file repair if enabled in the system.Additionally, the inclusion of
these FDT Instance data elements is mandatory. Note the following elements are
optional in the FDT schema to stay aligned with the IETF RFC defined schema:
  * Content-Length (source file length in bytes).
  * Content-Type (content MIME type).
  * FEC Encoding ID.
Other FEC Object Transmission Information specified by the FEC scheme in use:
NOTE: The FEC Object Transmission Information elements used are dependent on
the FEC scheme, as indicated by the FEC Encoding ID.
  * FEC-OTI-Maximum-Source-Block-Length.
  * FEC-OTI-Encoding-Symbol-Length.
  * FEC-OTI-Max-Number-of-Encoding-Symbols.
  * FEC-OTI-Scheme-Specific-Info.
NOTE 1: RFC 3926 [9] describes which part or parts of an FDT Instance may be
used to provide these data elements.
These optional FDT Instance data elements may or may not be included for FLUTE
in MBMS:
  * Complete (the signalling that an FDT Instance provides a complete, > and subsequently unmodifiable, set of file parameters for a FLUTE > session may or may not be performed according to this method).
  * Content-Encoding.
  * Content-MD5: represents a digest of the transport object. The file > server should indicate the MD5 hash value whenever multiple > versions of the file are anticipated for the download session.
NOTE 2: The values for each of the above data elements are calculated or
discovered by the FLUTE sender.
The FEC-OTI-Scheme-Specific-Info FDT Instance data element contains
information specific to the FEC scheme indicated by the FEC Encoding ID
encoded using base64.
### 7.2.10 FDT Schema
#### 7.2.10.1 Extended FLUTE FDT Schema
The below XML Schema shall be use for the FDT Instance.
This schema extends the schema defined in clause 7.2.10.3 by importing the
3GPP extensions specified in clauses 7.2.10.2, 7.2.10.5, 7.2.14 and 7.2.15.
The various schema file names are as follows:
  * Schema in clause 7.2.10.1: FLUTE-FDT-3GPP-Main.xsd
  * Schema in clause 7.2.10.2: FLUTE-FDT-3GPP-2005-Extensions.xsd
  * Schema in clause 7.2.10.5: FLUTE-FDT-3GPP-2007-Extensions.xsd
  * Schema in clause 7.2.14: FLUTE-FDT-3GPP-2008-Extensions.xsd
  * Schema in clause 7.2.15: FLUTE-FDT-3GPP-2009-Extensions.xsd
  * Schema in clause J.2: schema-version.xsd
In this version of the specification the network shall set the _schemaVersion_
element, defined as a child of _FDT-Instance_ element, to 1.
The schema _version_ attribute (part of the schema instruction) shall be
included in the UE schema and the network schema.
Note: The value of the _schemaVersion_ element and _version_ attribute is
intended to be increased by 1 in every future releases where new element(s) or
attribute(s) are added.
When a UE receives an instantiation of an FDT compliant to this schema, it
shall determine the schema version required to parse the instantiation as
follows:
  * If the UE supports one or more versions of the FDT schema with the schema _version_ attribute, then the UE shall use the schema that has the highest schema _version_ attribute value that is equal to or less than the value in the received _schemaVersion_ element.

#### 7.2.10.3 IETF FDT Schema
Below is the IETF based FDT XML schema that has been extended to define the
main FDT schema in sub-clause 7.2.10.1.
NOTE 1: As the schema in RFC 3926 is not valid there exist no stable

### 7.2.11 MBMS Session Identity
The _MBMS-Session-Identity_ element associates the file to the identity of the
MBMS session. If the file will be part of several MBMS transmission sessions,
then a list of MBMS session identities is defined.
The _MBMS-Session-Identity-Expiry_ element associates an expiration time with
a MBMS session identity value. Similar to the FLUTE FDT expiration time, the
MBMS session identity expiration time (_value_ attribute) is expressed within
the FDT Instance payload as a 32 bit data field. The value of the data field
represents the 32 most significant bits of a 64 bit Network Time Protocol
(NTP) [78] time value. These 32 bits provide an unsigned integer representing
the time in seconds relative to 0 hours 1 January 1900.
### 7.2.12 FEC Scheme definition
#### 7.2.12.1 General
This clause defines an FEC encoding scheme for the MBMS forward error
correction code defined in [91] for the download delivery method. This scheme
is identified by FEC Encoding ID 1. The FEC Payload ID format and FEC Object
Transmission Information format are as defined in [91], sub-clauses 3.1 and
3.2 respectively.
### 7.2.13 Caching Directives
A file download service may indicate the caching recommendations for a
specific file or set of files that are delivered using FLUTE. The caching
directives are to be used with the file download modes as follows:
  * Promiscuous mode: it is recommended to use the caching directives > with the promiscuous mode as it enables improved management of the > storage at the UE. Applications make use of available copies of > files as long as their respective caching time is still valid. In > case one or several files have expired and the download session is > still available, the UE should join the FLUTE session and download > the expired files. Alternatively, the UE may attempt to retrieve > the file using HTTP and the file URL.
  * One-Copy mode: Caching directives may be used with the one-copy mode > to indicate the validity of a certain file. Applications > requesting the file will receive the cached file as long as it is > still valid. A file that is not expected to be static may indicate > a long expiry time or permanent validity.
  * Keep-Updated mode: it is recommended to use the caching directives > with the keep-updated mode to indicate the validity of a certain > file. Applications requesting the file will receive the cached > file as long as it is still valid.
The caching functionality defines three different caching directives:
  * **no-cache** : this directive is used to indicate to the receiver not > to cache a specific file (or set of files). This is probably > useful in the case where the file is expected to be highly dynamic > (changes to the file occur quite often) or if the file will be > used only once by the receiver application.
```{=html}
``` \- **max-stale** : this directive indicates to the FLUTE receiver that a >
specific file (or set of files) should be cached for an indefinite > period of
time, if possible. The file has no expiry date.
```{=html}
``` \- **Expires** : this directive is used by the server to indicate the >
expected expiry time of a specific file (or set of files). It > indicates a
date and time value expressed as the 32 most > significant bits of the NTP
[78] 64-bit timestamp format. These > 32 bits provide an unsigned integer
representing the time in > seconds relative to 0 hours 1 January 1900.
The syntax of the caching directives is described in section 7.2.10.5.
### 7.2.14 Indicating a full FDT snapshot
If the server wants to inform the client about the current FDT snapshot, the
server shall set the "FullFDT" attribute in the FLUTE FDT instance file. If
the "FullFDT" attribute is set, the FDT instance shall be equivalent to the
full File Delivery Table. Note FDT instances with a higher FDT instance ID may
again extend the File Delivery Table.
A new attribute \"FullFDT\" is created within the element \"FDT-Instance\" of
the FDT to indicate to the receivers that the FDT Instance contains the exact
set of Transport Objects that are currently scheduled for transmission by the
sender, in the actual FLUTE session.
The XML syntax of the \"FullFDT\" attribute within the FLUTE FDT is the
following.
\
\
\
\
This attribute differs from the existing \"Complete\" attribute in that the
\"Complete\" attribute indicates that no new objects description will be
provided in future FDT Instances within this session.
No assumption shall be made about the fact that a given FDT instance for which
the attribute \"FullFDT\" is absent or set to FALSE, contains the exact set of
Transport Objects that are currently scheduled for transmission by the sender,
in the actual FLUTE session.
When two FDT instances with attribute \"FullFDT\" is equal to TRUE are
received by a receiver and valid in a given time (that is to say they have not
expired), the FDT instance with the highest FDT Instance ID shall be used by
the terminal.
### 7.2.15 Decryption key indicating of protected download data
A MBMS download service may indicate relevant decryption key file for
protected download file in FLUTE FDT instance. A new attribute \"Decryption-
KEY-URI\" is created within element \"file\" of the FDT to indicate the
association between protected download file and relevant decryption key file.
The value of \"Decryption-KEY-URI\" in \"file\" element shall be equal to the
content-location of the MIKEY file that contains the decryption key file.
When the server delivers a protected download file, the server should set a
\"Decryption-KEY-URI\" field in the corresponding file element in the FLUTE
FDT instance. When a UE receives a protected file, the UE may instruct its
FLUTE receiver to download the relevant decryption key file according to
\"Decryption-KEY-URI\" field in file element of FDT instance.
The XML syntax of the \"Decryption-KEY-URI\" attribute within the FLUTE FDT is
the following.
\
\

## 7.3 SDP for Download Delivery Method
### 7.3.1 Introduction
RFC 3926 [9] describes required and optional parameters for FLUTE session and
media descriptors. This clause specifies SDP for FLUTE session that is used
for the MBMS download and service announcement sessions. The formal
specification of the parameters is given in ABNF ([23]).
### 7.3.2 SDP Parameters for MBMS download session
The semantics of a Session Description of an MBMS download session includes
the following parameters:
  * The sender IP address.
  * The number of channels in the session.
  * The destination IP address and port number for each channel in the > session per media.
  * The Transport Session Identifier (TSI) of the session.
  * The start time and end time of the session.
  * The protocol ID (i.e. FLUTE/UDP).
  * Media type(s) and fmt-list.
  * Data rate using existing SDP bandwidth modifiers.
  * Mode of MBMS bearer per media.
  * FEC capabilities and related parameters.
  * Service-language(s) per media.
This list includes the parameters required by FLUTE - RFC 3926 [9]
These shall be expressed in SDP ( [14] and [15]) syntax according to the
following clauses.
#### 7.3.2.1 Sender IP address
There shall be exactly one IP sender address per MBMS download session, and
thus there shall be exactly one IP source address per complete MBMS download
session SDP description. The IP source address shall be defined according to
the source-filter attribute (\"a=source-filter:\") ( [14] and [15]) for both
IPv4 and IPv6 sources, with the following exceptions:
1\. Exactly one source address may be specified by this attribute such that
exclusive-mode shall not be used and inclusive-mode shall use exactly one
source address in the \.
2\. There shall be exactly one source-filter attribute per complete MBMS
download session SDP description, and this shall be in the session part of the
session description (i.e. not per media).
3\. The * value shall be used for the \ subfield, even when the
MBMS download session employs only a single LCT (multicast) channel.
#### 7.3.2.2 Number of channels
Only one FLUTE channel is allowed per FLUTE session in the present document
and thus there is no further need for a descriptor of the number of channels.
#### 7.3.2.3 Destination IP address and port number for channels
The FLUTE channel shall be described by the media-level channel descriptor.
These channel parameters shall be per channel:
  * IP destination address.
  * Destination port number.
The IP destination address shall be defined according to the \"connection
data\" field (\"c=\") of SDP ( [14]). The destination port number shall be
defined according to the \ sub-field of the media announcement field
(\"m=\") of SDP ( [14]).
The presence of a FLUTE session on a certain channel shall be indicated by
using the \"_m-_ line\" in the SDP description as shown in the following
example:
_m=application 12345 FLUTE/UDP 0_
_c=IN IP6 FF1E:03AD::7F2E:172A:1E24/1_
In the above SDP attributes, the _m_ -line indicates the media used and the
_c_ -line indicates the corresponding channel. Thus, in the above example, the
_m_ -line indicates that the media is transported on a channel that uses FLUTE
over UDP. Further, the _c_ -line indicates the channel address, which, in this
case, is an IPv6 address.
#### 7.3.2.4 Transport Session Identifier (TSI) of the session
The combination of the TSI and the IP source address identifies the FLUTE
session. Each TSI shall uniquely identify a FLUTE session for a given IP
source address during the time that the session is active, and also for a
large time before and after the active session time (this is also an LCT
requirement - RFC 3451 [11]).
The TSI shall be defined according the SDP descriptor given below. There shall
be exactly one occurrence of this descriptor in a complete FLUTE SDP session
description and it shall appear at session level.
The syntax in ABNF is given below:
flute-tsi-line = \"a=flute-tsi:\" tsi CRLF
tsi = 1*15DIGIT
#### 7.3.2.5 Multiple objects transport indication
RFC 3626 [9] requires the use of the Transport Object Identifier (TOI) header
field (with one exception for packets with no payload when the A flag is
used). The transport of a single FLUTE file requires that multiple TOIs are
used (TOI 0 for FDT Instances). Thus, there is no further need to indicate to
receivers that the session carries packets for more than one object and no SDP
attribute (or other FLUTE out of band information) is needed for this.
#### 7.3.2.6 Session Timing Parameters
A MBMS download session start and end times shall be defined according to the
SDP timing field (\"t=\") ( [14]).
#### 7.3.2.7 Mode of MBMS bearer per media
A new MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute is defined which results in,
e.g.:
  * a=mbms-mode:broadcast 123869108302929 1
OR
  * a=mbms-mode:broadcast-mbsfn 123869108302929
The MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute shall be used in session
descriptions using one or more MBMS broadcast mode media or broadcast-mbsfn
mode media. If all media declarations use MBMS broadcast mode or broadcast-
mbsfn mode, then the SDP attribute may be declared at session level. In that
case the session level attribute applies to all media without a media level
occurance of the \"mbms-mode\" attribute. If one or more media using MBMS
multicast mode is present in the same declaration as media using MBMS
broadcast mode, then only media using the MBMS broadcast mode or broadcast-
mbsfn mode will contain the \"mbms-mode\" attribute.
mbms-bearer-mode-declaration-line = \"a=mbms-mode:\" (\"broadcast\" SP tmgi SP
mbms-counting-information) / ("broadcast-mbsfn" SP tmgi) CRLF
tmgi = 1*15DIGIT
mbms-counting-indication = 1 * DIGIT
Note: Please find below an example of the building of the TMGI:
UK MCC = 234 (MCC Digit 1 = 2; MCC Digit 2 = 3 and MCC Digit 3 = 4)
Vodafone UK MNC = 15
Therefore, with padding, Vodafone UK MNC = 15F (MNC Digit 1 = 1; MNC Digit 2 =
5 and MNC Digit 3 = F)
MBMS Service ID = 70A886
Therefore, TMGI = 70A886 32F451 (Hex)
Therefore, TMGI = 123869108302929 (Decimal)
The Temporary Mobile Group Identity (tmgi) information element is defined in
TS 24.008 [40] including the coding of the fields. . Octets 3 to 8 (MBMS
Service ID, MCC and MNC) shall be placed in the tmgi attribute of the MBMS
bearer mode declaration line, and are encoded as a decimal number. Octet 3 is
the most significant octet. As this is encoded as a decimal number, leading
zeros of the MBMS Service ID field may be omitted.
The MBMS Counting Information (mbms-counting-information) information element
is defined in TS 25.413 [87] and indicates whether the RAN level counting
procedures are applicable or not for the MBMS broadcast mode. The value 0
corresponds to the information element value of "not counting" and the value 1
corresponds to the information element value "counting".
#### 7.3.2.8 FEC capabilities and related parameters
A new FEC-declaration attribute is defined which results in, e.g.:
  * a=FEC-declaration:0 encoding-id=1
This attribute may be used on both session-level and media-level. Multiple
instances are allowed to specify several different FEC declarations. The
attribute is used on session level to define FEC declarations used by multiple
media components. On media level it is used to define FEC declarations which
are only valid for a single media component. If FEC declarations on both
session and media level use the same reference number (fec-ref) then the media
level declaration takes precedence for that media component. Each media
component references one FEC declaration using the "a=FEC" attribute.
This attribute is optional to use for the download delivery method as the
information will be available elsewhere (e.g. FLUTE FDT Instances). If this
attribute is not used, and no other FEC-OTI information is signalled to the UE
by other means, the UE may assume that support for FEC id 0 is sufficient
capability to enter the session.
A new FEC-declaration reference attribute is defined which results in, e.g.:
  * a=FEC:0
This is a media-level only attribute, used as a short hand to reference one of
one or more FEC-declarations.
The syntax for the attributes in ABNF [23] is:
fec-declaration-line = \"a=FEC-declaration:\" fec-ref SP fec-enc-id [\";\" SP
fec-inst-id] CRLF
fec-ref = 1*3DIGIT ; value is the SDP-internal identifier for FEC-declaration.
fec-enc-id = \"encoding-id=\" enc-id
enc-id = 1*DIGIT ; value is the FEC encoding ID used
fec-inst-id = \"instance-id=\" inst-id
inst-id = 1*DIGIT ; value is the FEC Instance ID used.
fec-line = \"a=FEC:\" fec-ref CRLF
#### 7.3.2.9 Service-language(s) per media
The existing SDP attribute \"a=lang\" is used to label the language of any
language-specific media. The values are taken from [73] which in turn takes
language and (optionally) country tags from ISO 639 [74] and ISO 3166 [75]
(e.g. \"a=lang:EN-US\"). These are the same tags used in the User Service
Description XML.
#### 7.3.2.10 Bandwidth Specification
The maximum bit-rate required by this FLUTE session shall be specified using
the \"AS\" bandwidth modifier [14] on media level. The Application Specific
(AS) bandwidth for a FLUTE session shall be the largest sum of the sizes of
all packets transmitted during any one second long period of the session,
expressed as kilobits. The size of the packet shall be the complete packet,
i.e. IP, UDP and FLUTE headers, and the data payload.
### 7.3.3 SDP Examples for FLUTE Session
Here is a full example of SDP description describing a FLUTE session:
_v=0_
_o=user123 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP6 2201:056D::112E:144A:1E24_

_c=IN IP6 FF1E:03AD::7F2E:172A:1E24/1_
_b=64_
_a=lang:EN_
_a=FEC:0_
## 7.4 OMA Push usage for MBMS Download
### 7.4.1 Introduction
OMA Push may be used for MBMS download reception when MBMS Bearers are not
available. The MBMS UE registers its MSISDN with the BM-SC to receive the
Download Sessions using OMA Push. The BM-SC distributes FLUTE FDT instance
which allows the MBMS UE to fetch files of interest.
If the MBMS UE is out of its home network and if at least one
_unicastAccessURI_ element is available in the deliver method description, the
MBMS UE should register its MBMS Download Services with the BM-SC.
### 7.4.2 HTTP registration and deregistration procedure
The MBMS UE may register and deregister for unicast service delivery, if the
MBMS User Service Description for this service includes at least one
_unicastAccessURI_ element in the _deliveryMethod_ element.
The HTTP (RFC 2616 [18]) GET method is used for this purpose. If more than one
_unicastAccessURI_ is provided in the _deliveryMethod_ element, the UE shall
randomly select one.
In the following, we give the details of the syntax used for the above request
method in ABNF [23].
  * unicast_access_request_http_URL = unicast_access_URI \"?\" > query
  * unicast_access_URI = \ Description; URI-reference is as defined in [19].>
  * query = action "&" serviceId \"&\" msisdn
  * action = "action=" ("register" \| "Register" \| "deregister" \| > "Deregister")
  * serviceId = \"serviceId=\" \ the User Service Description>
  * msisdn = "msisdn=" 1*DIGIT \\ \\ \
\\ \\ \\
\\ \\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \
The UE will then have necessary information about all files in the FLUTE
session including their fileURIs, content encodings, content lengths etc.
## 7.5 FLUTE session setup and control with RTSP
### 7.5.1 Introduction
In case the MBMS User Service contains MBMS Streaming and MBMS Download
delivery sessions, it may be beneficial to control all flows with RTSP. The
prime use case of FLUTE session set-up and control with RTSP is for sending
MBMS streaming associated presentation data.
### 7.5.2 SDP handling
The FLUTE specific SDP extensions are defined in clause 7. For the FLUTE
session establishment using RTSP, a control URI as defined in [88] shall be
present for the FLUTE media description. Note, a control URI is defined by the
\"a=control:\" SDP field according to [88].
### 7.5.3 RTSP SETUP Method
The control URI as defined in [88] shall be present for each FLUTE media
description in the SDP. The control URI is used within the RTSP SETUP method
to establish the described FLUTE sessions.
The RTSP transport protocol specifier for FLUTE as defined in [88] shall be
\"FLUTE/UDP\". One and only one UDP port is allocated for each FLUTE channel.
The following RTP specific parameters shall be used in the transport request
and responds header for FLUTE sessions:
  * client_port: This parameter provides the unicast FLUTE port(s) on > which the client has chosen to receive FLUTE data.
  * server_port: This parameter provides the unicast FLUTE port(s) on > which the server has chosen to send data.
### 7.5.4 RTSP PLAY Method
The PLAY method tells the server to start sending data including FLUTE session
data as defined in [88]. The RTSP server forwards the FLUTE packets as
according by the RTSP range header in the RTSP PLAY.
Only ntp and clock range units may be used with the \"Range\" headers. Normal
Play Time (NPT) indicates the stream absolute position relative to the
beginning of the presentation. The NPT consists of a decimal fraction.The
clock range header describe the absolute time expressed as ISO 8601
timestamps, using UTC (GMT).
### 7.5.5 RTSP PAUSE Method
The PAUSE request causes the stream delivery including all FLUTE sessions to
be interrupted (halted) as defined in [88].
### 7.5.6 RTSP TEARDOWN Method
The TEARDOWN client to server request stops the stream delivery including all
FLUTE data delivery for the given URI, freeing the resources associated with
it. Details for the TEARDOWN method are defined in [88].
# 8 Streaming delivery method
## 8.1 Introduction
The purpose of the MBMS streaming delivery method is to deliver continuous
multimedia data (i.e. speech, audio, video and DIMS) over an MBMS bearer.
Using MBMS Streaming delivery on unicast is defined in clause 8.5. This
delivery method complements the download delivery method which consists of the
delivery of files. The streaming delivery method is particularly useful for
multicast and broadcast of scheduled streaming content.
## 8.2 Transport protocol
RTP is the transport protocol for MBMS streaming delivery. RTP provides means
for sending real-time or streaming data over UDP and is already used for the
transport of PSS in 3GPP. RTP provides RTCP for feedback about the
transmission quality. The transmission of RTCP packets in the downlink (sender
reports) is allowed. In this version of the specification, RTCP RR shall be
turned off by SDP RR bandwidth modifiers. Note that in the context of MBMS
detection of link aliveness is not necessary.
### 8.2.1 RTP payload formats for media
The RTP payload formats and corresponding MIME types are closely aligned with
those defined in PSS [47] . For RTP/UDP/IP transport of continuous media the
following RTP payload formats shall be used:
  * AMR narrow-band speech codec (see sub-clause 10.2) RTP payload > format according to RFC 4867 [33]. A MBMS client is not required > to support multi-channel sessions.
  * AMR wideband speech codec (see sub-clause 10.2) RTP payload format > according to RFC 4867 [33]. A MBMS client is not required to > support multi-channel sessions.
  * Extended AMR-WB codec (see sub-clause 10.3) RTP payload format > according to [34].
  * Enhanced aacPlus codec (see sub-clause 10.3) RTP payload format and > MIME types according to RFC 3640 [41], namely the Low Bit-Rate > AAC or the High Bit-Rate AAC modes.
  * H.264 (AVC) video codec (see sub-clause 10.5) RTP payload format > according to RFC 3984 [35]. An MBMS client supporting H.264 > (AVC) is required to support all three packetization modes: single > NAL unit mode, non-interleaved mode and interleaved mode. For the > interleaved packetization mode, an MBMS client shall support > streams for which the value of the \"sprop-deint-buf-req\" MIME > parameter is less than or equal to MaxCPB * 1000 / 8, inclusive, > in which \"MaxCPB\" is the value for Video Coding Layer (VCL) > parameters of the H.264 (AVC) profile and level in use, as > specified in [43].
  * DIMS (see sub-clause 10.12) RTP payload format according to [89].
  * Timed Text (see sub-clause 10.10) RTP payload format according to > [93].
### 8.2.2 FEC mechanism for RTP
#### 8.2.2.0 General
The "MBMS FEC scheme" is the fully-specified FEC scheme defined in [101],
section 6 with ID 1.
The source flows for the MBMS FEC scheme are UDP flows including RTP, RTCP,
SRTP and MIKEY packets. The payload of such UDP packets constitute an
Application Data Unit (ADU) as defined in RFC6363 [102]. The source data flow
with which the ADUs are associated is the UDP flow identity of the
corresponding UDP flow.
A UE that supports MBMS User Services shall support a decoder for the "MBMS
FEC scheme". The use of MBMS FEC by the sender is recommended, but it is
permitted not to use it. In the case where the FEC is not used by the sender,
the FEC Layer should not be used (i.e. RTP is mapped onto UDP directly).
The mechanism does not place any restrictions on the source data which can be
protected together, except that the source data is carried over UDP. The data
may be from several different UDP flows that are protected jointly.
A UE supporting the streaming delivery method shall support the packet format
for FEC packets..
If any FEC source packets have been lost, but sufficient FEC source and FEC
repair packets have been received, FEC decoding can be performed to recover
the FEC source block. The original packets UDP payload and UDP flow identity
can then be extracted from the source block and provided to the upper layer.
If not enough FEC source and repair packets were received, only the original
packets that were received as FEC source packets will be available. The rest
of the original packets are lost.
If a UE that supports MBMS User Services receives a mathematically sufficient
set of encoding symbols generated according to the encoder specification in
RFC5053 [91], section 5.3, for reconstruction of a source block, then the
decoder shall recover the entire source block. Note that the example decoder
described in [91] clause 5.5 fulfils this requirement.
Note that the receiver must be able to buffer all the original packets and
allow time for the FEC repair packets to arrive and FEC decoding to be
performed before media playout begins. The min-buffer-time parameter specified
in sub-clause 8.3.1.8 helps the receiver to determine a sufficient duration
for initial start-up delay.
The protocol architecture is illustrated in figure 11.
Figure 11: FEC mechanism for the streaming delivery method interaction diagram
Figure 11 depicts how one or more out of several possible packet flows of
different types (Audio, video, DIMS, text RTP and RTCP flows, MIKEY flow) are
sent to the FEC layer for protection. The source packets are modified to carry
the FEC payload ID and a new flow with repair data is generated. The receiver
takes the source and repair packets and buffers them to perform, if necessary,
the FEC decoding. After appropriate buffering received and recovered source
packets are forwarded to the higher layers. The arrows in the figure indicate
distinct data flows.
#### 8.2.2.1 Sending Terminal Operation (Informative)
It is assumed that the sender has constructed or received original data
packets for the session. These may be RTP, RTCP, MIKEY or other UDP packets.
The following procedures are based on the UDP payload and the identity of the
UDP flow. The UDP payload constitutes and ADU according to RFC6363 [102] and
the identity of the UDP flow is the integer identifier associated with the
identifier of the ADU flow.
In order to FEC protect a sequence of original data packets, the sender
constructs a source block as specified in RFC6681 [101], section 5 to which
the FEC algorithm is to be applied, and includes the original source packet
data within FEC source packets. The following operations describe a possible
way to generate compliant FEC source packet and FEC repair packet streams:
1\. Each original packet is placed in the source block. In doing so, the
Source FEC Payload ID information to be included in the FEC payload ID of the
FEC source packet can be determined. In the source block the identity of the
packet's flow is marked using the Flow ID. See RFC6681 [101], section 5 for
details.
2\. The FEC source packet is constructed according to sub-clause 8.2.2.4. The
identity of the original flow is maintained by the source packet through the
use of the destination UDP port number and destination IP address, which has
been advertised (for example using SDP), as carrying FEC source packets
generated from an original stream of a particular protocol (e.g. RTP, RTCP,
SRTP, MIKEY etc.). See sub-clause 8.2.2.13.
3\. The generated FEC source packet is sent using UDP.
When a source block is complete, the FEC encoder generates encoding symbols
and places these symbols into FEC repair packets, to be conveyed to the
receivers. These repair packets are sent using normal UDP procedures to a
unique destination port to separate it from any of the source packet flows.
In particular cases it may be advantageous not to use FEC for some source
blocks and to signal this to the receiver. In this case the sender may send
one or more empty repair packets consisting exclusively of the Repair FEC
Payload ID. This will be helpful in particular for selective FEC where some of
the source blocks (e.g. consisting of reference video frames) are FEC
protected while others (e.g. consisting exclusively of non-reference frames)
will not be protected.
#### 8.2.2.2 Receiving Terminal Operation (Informative)
The following describes a possible receiver algorithm, when receiving an FEC
source or repair packet:
1\. If a FEC source packet is received (as indicated by the UDP port on which
it was received):
a. The original source packet is reconstructed by removing the Source FEC
Payload ID. The resulting packet is buffered to allow time for the FEC repair.
b. The resulting packet is placed into the source block according to the
information in the Source FEC Payload ID and the source block format described
in [101], section 5. The UDP port the packet was received on is used to
determine the Flow ID written into the source block.
2\. If an FEC repair packet is received (as indicated by the UDP port), the
contained encoding symbols are placed into an FEC encoding block according to
the Repair FEC Payload ID. In case the received FEC repair packet is empty,
there are no repair symbols to be placed in the FEC encoding block.
3\. If at least one source packet is missing, then FEC decoding may be
desirable. The FEC decoder determines if the encoding block constructed in
steps 1 and 2 contains enough symbols from the source and repair packets for
decoding and, if so, performs the decoding operation. If only empty FEC repair
packets are received, the receiver may start immediately some procedures to
conceal the effect of missing media data.
4\. Any missing source packets that were reconstructed during the decoding
operation are then buffered as normal received packets (see step 1a above).
Note that the above procedure may result in that not all original packets are
recovered, and they must simply be marked as being lost.
Obviously, buffering and packet re-ordering are required to insert any
reconstructed packets in the appropriate place in the packet sequence if that
is necessary according to the used higher layer protocol (RTP, RTCP or MIKEY).
To allow receivers to determine the minimal start-up buffering requirement for
FEC decoding, the min-buffer-time parameter indicates a minimum initial
buffering time that is sufficient regardless of the position of the stream in
which the reception starts.
#### 8.2.2.3 (Void)
#### 8.2.2.4 Packet format for FEC source packets
The packet format for FEC source packets as defined in RFC6363 [102], section
5.3, shall be used to encapsulate an original UDP packet.
The destination IP address and UDP port shall be set as indicated in the
session control signalling. This ensures that the receiver can determine which
protocols and FEC Payload ID formats are used for this flow. The remaining
fields in the IP and UDP headers shall be set according to their
specifications.
The Source FEC Payload ID shall be constructed according to RFC 6681 [101],
section 6.2.2.
The FEC Source packets over IP and UDP are indicated to be used for a flow by
using one of the SDP protocol identifiers "UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP", "UDP/MBMS-
FEC/RTP/SAVP" depending on the upper layer protocol RTP/AVP or RTP/SAVP
respectively. If MIKEY is FEC protected and encapsulated in source packets,
then it is indicated in the security description using the _fecProtection_
element and the destination IP address.
#### 8.2.2.5 Packet Format for Repair packets
The packet format for FEC repair packets as defined in RFC6363 [102], section
5.4 shall be used for repair packets.
The UDP payload consists of the Repair FEC Payload ID, and zero, one or more
repair symbols. The format of the Repair FEC payload ID is defined in clause
[101], section 6.2.3.
The repair packet sent over IP and UDP is indicated in the SDP using the
protocol identifier "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR".
#### 8.2.2.6 Void
#### 8.2.2.7 FEC block Construction algorithm and example (informative)
This section provides an example how to use the methods in RFC6363 [102] and
RFC6681 [101] to generate a source block.
When the original UDP packet is placed into the source block, the value of the
UDP flow identifier, F, followed by the value of the UDP payload length, L,
are first written as a single byte and two-byte value in network byte order
(i.e. with high order byte first) respectively into the first available bytes
in the source block, followed by the UDP packet payload itself (i.e. not
including the IP/UDP headers). Following this, if the next available byte is
not the first byte of a new symbol, then padding bytes up to the next symbol
boundary shall be included using the value 0 in each byte. As long as any
source UDP packets remain to be placed, the procedure is repeated starting
each UDP flow identifier at the start of the next encoding symbol.
An example of forming a source block is given in figure 14 below. In this
example, three UDP packets of lengths 26, 52 and 103 bytes have been placed
into a source block with symbol size T = 16 bytes. The first two packets are
from UDP flow 0 and the third from UDP flow 1. Each entry in Figure 14 is a
byte and the rows correspond to the source symbols and are numbered from 0 to
12. B~i,j~ denotes the (j+1)th byte of the (i+1)th UDP packet.

Figure 14: Source block consisting of 3 source UDP packets of lengths 26, 52
and 103 bytes.
#### 8.2.2.8 Void
#### 8.2.2.9 Source FEC Payload ID
The Source FEC payload ID shall be the Source FEC Payload ID format A in
section 6.2.2 of RFC6681 [101].
#### 8.2.2.10 Repair FEC payload ID
The Repair FEC Payload ID shall be the Repair FEC Payload ID format A in
section 6.2.3 of RFC6681 [101].
#### 8.2.2.10a FEC Object Transmission information
The FEC Object Transmission information consists of:
  * the maximum source block length, in symbols
  * the symbol size, in bytes
The FEC Object Transmission information shall be the first four octets of the
FEC Scheme Specific Information in section 6.2.1.2 of RFC6681 [101].
> NOTE: This corresponds to Payload ID Format A in RFC6681 [101] as the last
> octet of FEC Scheme Specific Information is omitted.
The Source Block Length signalled within the Repair FEC Payload ID of any
packet of a stream shall not exceed the Maximum Source Block Length signalled
within the FEC Object Transmission Information for the stream.
The FEC Object Transmission Information shall be communicated as described in
sub-clause 8.2.2.14. Note, the FEC Object Transmission Information is only
communicated in SDP.
#### 8.2.2.11 Hypothetical FEC Decoder
This clause specifies the hypothetical FEC decoder and its use to check packet
stream and MBMS receiver conformance.
The hypothetical FEC decoder uses the packet stream, the transmission time of
each packet, the initial buffering delay, and the SDP for the stream as
inputs. The packet stream from the beginning of the FEC source block until the
end of the stream shall comply with the hypothetical reference decoder as
specified below when the initial buffer delay equals to the value of the min-
buffer-time parameter.
The maximum hypothetical FEC decoding buffer size for MBMS streaming is 1
Mbytes. The default hypothetical FEC decoding buffer size is equal to 1
Mbytes.
For the packet stream, the buffer occupancy level of the hypothetical FEC
decoding buffer shall not exceed the value of the buf-size parameter, when it
is present in the SDP, or the default FEC decoding buffer size, when the buf-
size parameter is not present in the SDP. The output of the hypothetical FEC
decoder shall comply with the RTP payload and decoding specifications of the
media format.
The hypothetical FEC decoder operates as follows:
1) The hypothetical FEC decoding buffer is initially empty.
2) Each FEC source packet and FEC repair packet, starting from the first
packet in transmission order, is inserted into a FEC source block at its
transmission time. The FEC source block generation is done as specified in
[101], section 6.2.3. The FEC source block resides in the hypothetical FEC
decoding buffer.
3) When both the last FEC source packet and the last FEC repair packet of an
FEC source block are transmitted, any elements of the FEC source block that
are not original UDP packets (e.g. FEC repair packets and potential padding
bytes) are removed from the hypothetical FEC decoding buffer.
4) Original UDP packets are not removed from the hypothetical FEC decoding
buffer before the signaled initial buffering delay has expired. Then, the
first original UDP packet in sequence number order is output and removed from
the hypothetical FEC decoding buffer immediately. Each succeeding original UDP
packet is output and removed when the following conditions are true:
i. The following time (in seconds) since the removal of the previous packet
has elapsed:
8 × (size of the previous original UDP packet _including_ UDP/IP header in
bytes) / (1 000 × (value of \"b=AS\" SDP attribute for the stream))
ii. All the packets in the same FEC source block as the original UDP packet
have been transmitted.
An MBMS client shall be capable of receiving a packet stream that complies
with the hypothetical FEC decoder. Furthermore, in the case of RTP packets,
when an MBMS client complies with the requirements for the media decoding of
the packet stream, it shall be able to de-packetize and decode the packet
stream and output decoded data at the correct rate specified by the RTP
timestamps of the received packet stream.
#### 8.2.2.12 Void
#### 8.2.2.13 Signalling
The signalling for streaming FEC consists of several components:
  * If several user services are bundled together they are indicated as a sequence of services in the User Service Bundle Description. See sub-clause 11.2.
  * A separate SDP describing the FEC repair stream and all the flow IDs referenced from the User Service Bundle Description. See sub-clauses 11.2 and 8.2.2.14.
  * SDP protocol identifiers and attributes to indicate the usage of the source packet format, how the FEC payload ID is configured and other FEC parameters such as minimal buffering delay, for the RTP/RTCP streams. See sub-clause 8.2.2.13a.
  * Security description extensions to indicate usage of FEC source packet format, and the FEC parameters. See sub-clauses 11.3 and 8.2.2.13a.
The user service description contains either a single service or several
bundled services. All of the streaming delivery methods and security
descriptions that are present within the _bundleDescription_ element must be
considered when configuring the FEC operations. This includes RTP, RTCP and
MIKEY flows. A receiver intending to perform FEC decoding to cover for packet
losses shall receive all the flows that are indicated to be sent as FEC source
packets, even if the flows are in a service currently not played out. A
receiver intending to use FEC shall also receive the FEC repair stream as
described by the FEC Repair Stream Description. The delivery method's session
description, and the security description both carry the FEC source packet
configuration information: FEC encoding ID, FEC instance ID, and FEC OTI
information. The FEC repair packet stream is configured using the similar
methods as for the source packets, with the addition of the Flow ID
information and buffer delay parameter.
#### 8.2.2.13a SDP for FEC source packet streams
To indicate the presence of the FEC layer between IP/UDP and, RTP or SRTP a
SDP protocol identifier is used. Instead of the normal RTP/AVP and RTP/SAVP
protocol identifiers, 'UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP' and 'UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/SAVP' are
defined respectively. Both these protocol identifiers shall use the FMT space
rules that are used for RTP/AVP and RTP/SAVP respectively, i.e. payload types
used in the RTP session is listed. The protocol identifiers are defined in
Appendix C1.
The FEC parameters, FEC encoding ID, FEC instance ID and FEC-OTI-Extension
information are signalled using the mechanism defined in sub-clause 8.3.1.8.
The "a=FEC" SDP attribute shall be used to indicate the single definition that
is used for each media component.
For MIKEY messages the service protection description is used to indicate when
FEC source packet shall be used, see sub-clause 11.3. The FEC parameter used
is also defined in the service protection description. As all MIKEY packets
from all user services arrive on the same port, the receiver must use the
destination address to separate FEC protected packets from not FEC protected
packets. This requires that all MIKEY packets sent to a specific destination
address are either FEC protected or not. Note that it is not possible to mix
protected and non-protected packets within a single stream as there is no
mechanism to determine whether they are protected or not.
#### 8.2.2.14 SDP for FEC repair packet streams
The repair packet stream is indicated in SDP using a media block with the
protocol identifier "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR". The media type shall be "application".
The FEC parameters, FEC encoding ID, FEC instance ID, FEC-OTI-Extension
information and repair parameters (min-buffer-time) are signalled using the
mechanisms defined in sub-clause 8.3.1.9. Each media component shall reference
only one FEC declaration.
The mapping of the FEC source block flow ID to the destination IP address and
UDP port are done using the SDP attribute "a=mbms-flowid" defined in sub-
clause 8.3.1.9.
Interleaving may be signaled using the "X-3gpp-FEC-Interleaving" attribute,
which also gives the arrangement of the flows in the source block and by
consequence their transmission order. The "X-3gpp-FEC-Interleaving" attribute
is defined in sub-clause 8.3.1.11.
#### 8.2.2.15 Signalling example for FEC
This sub-clause contains a complete signalling example for a MBMS multicast
mode session using FEC with a Service description, a SDP for the streaming
delivery method, a SDP for the FEC repair stream, and a security description.
The following is an example bundleDescription.

An example of how the SDP http://www.example.com/3gpp/mbms/session1.sdp could
look for a session containing two media streams that are FEC protected. In
this example we have assumed an audiovisual stream, using 56 kbps for video
and 12 kbps for audio. In addition another 300 bits/second of RTCP packets
from the source is used for the each of the sessions. Hence, the total media
session bandwidth is 56+12+0.3+0.3 = 68.6 kbps.

### 8.2.3 General RTP Header Extension Mechanism
#### 8.2.3.1 Introduction
The General RTP Header Extension Mechanism [92] is a general mechanism to use
the header extension feature of RTP (the Real-Time Transport Protocol). The
General RTP Header Extension Mechanism should be supported.
#### 8.2.3.2 Timestamp Offset
Timestamp offsets for RTP may be transmitted using the general RTP header
extension mechanism.
The variable timestamp extension element is 32 bits long. The first byte is
the extension element header, i.e. the ID and len fields, as defined in [92].
The remaining 3 bytes are the timestamp-offset measured in the same frequency
as the RTP timestamp.
Timestamp-offset: A 24 bit unsigned integer signaling the offset of the
received packets of the same media in the tune-in FEC block. The timestamp
offset indicates at most the difference between the RTP timestamp of the
current packet and the highest RTP timestamp of packets of the same media
stream that are transmitted in the current FEC source block.
Timestamp offset shall not be used if FEC protection and Interleaving are not
being used.
The following example is a general RTP header extension block containing a
single variable timestamp extension element.
0 1 2 3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
\| 0xBEDE \| length=1 \|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
\| ID \| len=2 \| timestamp-offset \|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
The presence of variable timestamps is signaled in the SDP file using the
header extension specification and the URI
\"http://www.3gpp.org/2008/TimestampOffset\". The URI signals the possible
presence of timestamp offsets with the given ID.
## 8.3 Session description
SDP is provided to the MBMS client via a discovery/announcement procedure to
describe the streaming delivery session. The SDP describes one or more RTP
sessions part of the MBMS streaming session. The SDP shall be a correctly
formed SDP according to [14].
### 8.3.1 SDP Parameters for MBMS streaming session
The semantics of a Session Description of an MBMS streaming session shall
include the parameters:
  * The sender IP address.
  * The number of media in the session.
  * The destination IP address and port number for each and all of the > RTP sessions in the MBMS streaming session.
  * The start time and end time of the session.
  * The protocol ID (i.e. RTP/AVP).
  * Media type(s) and fmt-list.
  * Data rate using existing SDP bandwidth modifiers.
  * Mode of MBMS bearer per media.
  * FEC configuration and related parameters.
  * Service-language(s) per media.
  * QoE Metrics (defined in sub-clauses 8.3.2.1 and 8.4).
#### 8.3.1.1 Sender IP address
There shall be exactly one IP source address per media description within the
SDP. The IP source address shall be defined according to the source-filter
attribute (\"a=source-filter:\") [15] for both IPv4 and IPv6 sources, with the
following exceptions:
1\. Exactly one source address may be specified by this attribute such that
exclusive-mode shall not be used and inclusive-mode shall use exactly one
source address in the \.
2\. There shall be exactly one source-filter attribute per complete MBMS
streaming session SDP description, and this shall be in the session part of
the session description (i.e. not per media).
3\. The * value shall be used for the \ subfield.
#### 8.3.1.2 Destination IP address and port number for channels
Each RTP session part of a MBMS streaming session is defined by two
parameters:
  * IP destination address.
  * Destination port number(s).
The IP destination address shall be defined according to the \"connection
data\" field (\"c=\") of [14]. The destination port number shall be defined
according to the \ sub-field of the media announcement field (\"m=\") of
[14]. Multiple ports using \"/\" notation shall not be used. The RTCP port, if
used, shall be RTP port +1.
#### 8.3.1.3 Media Description
The media description line shall be used as defined in [14] for RTP. The
\ part indicates the type of media, audio, video, or text. The usage of
RTP and any applicable RTP profile shall be indicated by using the \
field of the \'_m-_ line\'. The one or more payload types that are being used
in this RTP session are enumerated in the \ part. Each payload type is
declared using the \"a=rtpmap\" attribute according to [14] and use the
\"a=fmtp\" line when required to describe the payload format parameters.
#### 8.3.1.4 Session Timing Parameters
A MBMS streaming session start and end times shall be defined according to the
SDP timing field (\"t=\") - [14].
#### 8.3.1.5 Mode of MBMS bearer per media
The MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute shall be used for MBMS streaming
sessions, as defined in sub-clause 7.3.2.7.
#### 8.3.1.6 Service-language(s) per media
The existing SDP attribute \"a=lang\" is used to label the language of any
language-specific media. The values are taken from [73] which in turn takes
language and (optionally) country tags from ISO 639 [74] and ISO 3166 [75]
(e.g. \"a=lang:EN-US\"). These are the same tags used in the User Service
Description XML.
#### 8.3.1.7 Bandwidth specification
The bit-rate required by the MBMS streaming session and its media components
shall be specified using both the \"AS\" bandwidth modifier and the \"TIAS\"
bandwidth modifier combined with \"a=maxprate\" [38] on media level in the
SDP. On session level the \"TIAS\" bandwidth modifier combined with
\"a=maxprate\" may be used, where the session level expresses the aggregated
peak bit-rate, which may be lower than the sum of the individual media
streams.
The bandwidth required for RTCP is specified by the \"RR\" and \"RS\"
bandwidth modifiers (3GPP TS 26.244 [32]) on media level for each RTP session.
The \"RR\" modifier shall be included and set to 0 to specify that RTCP
receiver reports are not used. The bandwidth used for RTCP sender reports
shall be specified using the \"RS\" bandwidth modifier.
#### 8.3.1.8 FEC Parameters
The FEC encoding ID and instance ID are provided using the \"a=FEC-
declaration\" attribute defined in sub-clause 7.3.2.8. Any OTI information for
that FEC encoding ID and instance ID is provided with below defined FEC OTI
attribute.
The FEC OTI attribute must be immediately preceded by the \"a=FEC-
declaration\" attribute (and so can be session-level and media-level). The
fec-ref maps the oti-extension to the FEC-declaration OTI it extends. The
purpose of the oti-extension is to define FEC code specific OTI required for
RTP receiver FEC payload configuration; exact contents are FEC code specific
and need to be specified by each FEC code using this attribute. The OTI for
the MBMS FEC Scheme is defined in sub-clause 8.2.2.10a.
The syntax for the attributes in ABNF [23] is:
  * sdp-fec-oti-extension-line = \"a=FEC-OTI-extension:\" fec-ref SP > oti-extension CRLF
  * fec-ref = 1*3DIGIT (the SDP-internal identifier for the associated > FEC-declaration).
  * oti-extension = base64
  * base64 = *base64-unit [base64-pad]
  * base64-unit = 4base64-char
  * base64-pad = 2base64-char \"==\" / 3base64-char \"=\"
  * base64-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"/\"
To provide the FEC repair packets with additional, non FEC specific
parameters, a session and media level SDP attribute is defined.
sdp-fec-parameter-line = "a=mbms-repair: 0*1SP fec-ref SP parameter-list CRLF
parameter-list = parameter-spec *(1*SP parameter-spec)
parameter-spec = name "=" value;
name = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
value = 1*(safe) ; safe defined in [14]
Currently one FEC non code-specific parameter is defined:
**min-buffer-time** : This FEC buffering parameter specifies the minimum
receiver buffer time (delay) needed to ensure that FEC repair has time to
happen regardless of the FEC source block of the stream from which the
reception starts. The value is in milliseconds and represents the wallclock
time between the reception of the first FEC source or repair packet of a FEC
source block, whichever is earlier in transmission order, and the wallclock
time when media decoding can safely start.
The parameters name and value is defined in ABNF as follows:
Min-buffer-time-parameter-name = "min-buffer-time"
Min-buffer-time-parameter-value = 1*8DIGIT ;Wallclock time in milliseconds.
The FEC declaration and FEC OTI information utilized in a specific source or
repair packet is indicated using the FEC-ref number in the a=fec lines as
described in sub-clauses 8.2.2.12 and 8.2.2.13.
#### 8.3.1.9 FEC Flow ID attribute
To indicate the mapping between destination IP address and UDP port number and
FEC source block flow IDs, the "a=mbms-flowid" SDP attribute is defined. Each
flowID that is used to construct a source block within the bundled sessions
shall be included. It is a media level attribute that shall be present in any
SDP media block using the "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR" protocol identifier.
The syntax for the attributes in ABNF [23] is:
Sdp-mbms-flowid-attr = \"a=mbms-flowid:\" *WSP flow-id-spec *(\",\" *WSP flow-
id-spec) CRLF
flow-id-spec = flowID \"=\" address-spec \"/\" port-spec
address-spec = IP4-multicast / IP6-multicast
IP4-multicast = m1 3*( \".\" decimal-uchar )
m1 = (\"22\" (\"4\"/\"5\"/\"6\"/\"7\"/\"8\"/\"9\")) / (\"23\" DIGIT ))
IP6-multicast = hexpart
hexpart = hexseq / hexseq \"::\" [ hexseq ] /
\"::\" [ hexseq ]
hexseq = hex4 *( \":\" hex4)
hex4 = 1*4HEXDIG
port-spec = 1*5DIGIT
#### 8.3.1.10 Buffer Requirement Signaling
Due to the variable bitrate nature of some media streams (especially video
streams), initial buffering at the receiver becomes necessary to smooth out
those variations. The initial buffering delay SHOULD be signaled to the
receiver in the SDP using the following media level attribute:
  * \"a=X-initpredecbufperiod:\\"
For H.263 video streams, the "X-initpredecbufperiod" indicates the required
initial pre-decoder buffering period specified according to Annex G of 3GPP TS
26.234 [47].
For H.264 video streams, the "X-initpredecbufperiod" indicates the nominal
removal time of the first access unit from the coded picture buffer (CPB).
Note that X-initpredecbufperiod is expressed as clock ticks of a 90-kHz clock.
Hence, conversion may be required if the RTP timestamp clock frequency is not
90 kHz.
#### 8.3.1.11 Interleaving Signaling
When interleaving is used in combination with FEC protection of an MBMS
service, the BM-SC may indicate to receivers the order of transmission of the
media units of a source block using the "X-3gpp-FEC-Interleaving" attribute.
It also indicates whether intra-stream interleaving (described in section G.1)
has been performed or not for each of the flows in the FEC source block.
The "X-3gpp-FEC-Interleaving" attribute is defined as follows:
Interleaving="X-3gpp-FEC-Interleaving:" SP flow_interleaving *(","
flow_interleaving) CRLF
flow_interleaving=flowID "=" ["ordered" / "mixed" / "reverse"]
flowID is the indentification of the flow as described in section 8.3.1.9. The
intra-stream interleaving modes may result in un-changed tranmission order
("Ordered"), a mixed transmission order ("Mixed"), or a reversed transmission
order ("Reverse"). For a flow that is not listed in the X-3gpp-FEC-
Interleaving attribute, the receiver should assume that no particular intra-
or inter-stream interleaving has been performed. The transmission order does
not preculde that some media units of a lower priority stream are interleaved
with the media units of higher priority stream.
### 8.3.2 SDP Example for Streaming Session
Here is a full example of SDP description describing the media streams part of
a streaming delivery session:

FEC is not used in that example. See clause 8.2.2.15 for an example with FEC.
#### 8.3.2.1 SDP Description for QoE Metrics
Similar as in 3GPP TS 26.234 [47], an SDP attribute for QoE, which can be used
either at session or media level, is defined below in [23] based on [14]:
  * QoE-Metrics-line = \"a\" \"=\" \"3GPP-QoE-Metrics:\" > att-measure-spec *(\",\" att-measure-spec)) CRLF
  * att-measure-spec = Metrics \";\" Sending-rate [\";\" > Measure-Range]\ > [\";\" Measure-Resolution] *([\";\" Parameter-Ext])
  * Metrics = \"metrics\" \"=\" \"{\"Metrics-Name *(\"\|\" > Metrics-Name) \" }\"
  * Metrics-Name = 1*((0x21..0x2b) / (0x2d..0x3a) / (0x3c..0x7a) / > 0x7e) ;VCHAR except \";\", \",\", \"{\" or \"}\"
  * Sending-Rate = \"rate\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT / \"End\"
  * Measure-Resolution = \"resolution\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT ; in seconds
  * Measure-Range = \"range\" \":\" Ranges-Specifier
  * Parameter-Ext = (1*DIGIT [\".\" 1*DIGIT]) / (1*((0x21..0x2b) / > (0x2d..0x3a) / (0x3c..0x7a) / 0x7c / 0x7e))
  * Ranges-Specifier = as defined in RFC 2326 [88].
An MBMS server uses this attribute to indicate that QoE metrics are supported
and shall be used if also supported by the MBMS client. When present at
session level, it shall only contain metrics that apply to the complete
session. When present at media level, it shall only contain metrics that are
applicable to individual media.
The \"Metrics\" field contains the list of names that describes the
metrics/measurements that are required to be reported in a MBMS session (see
sub-clause 8.4). The names that are not included in the \"Metrics\" field
shall not be reported during the session.
In this version of the specification, the \"Sending-Rate\" shall be set to the
value \"End\", which indicates that only one report is sent at the end of the
MBMS session.
The optional \"Measure-Resolution\" field, if used, shall define a time over
which each metrics value is calculated. The \"Measure-Resolution\" field
splits the session duration into a number of equally sized periods where each
period is of the length specified by the \"Measure-Resolution\" field. The
\"Measure-Resolution\" field is thus defining the time before the calculation
of a QoE parameter starts over. If the \"Measure-Resolution\" field is not
present the metrics resolution shall cover the period specified by the
\"Measure-Range\" field. If the \"Measure-Range\" field is not present the
metrics resolution shall be the whole session duration.
The \"Measure-Resolution\" field shall take only one value for all session
level metrics and only one value for all metrics associated to one media. Note
that \"Measure-Resolution\" shall be evaluated according to a real-time clock.
This implies that the real-time interval between consecutive measurements is
not affected by changes in playback rate, for instance due to buffering.
The optional \"Measure-Range\" field, if used, shall define the time range in
the stream for which the QoE metrics will be reported. There shall be only one
range per measurement specification. The range format shall be any of the
formats allowed by the media. If the \"Measure-Range\" field is not present,
the corresponding (media or session level) range attribute in SDP shall be
used. If SDP information is not present, the metrics range shall be the whole
session duration.
#### 8.3.2.2 OMA-DM Configuration of QoE Metrics
As an alternative to configure the QoE reporting for each session (as
specified in 8.3.2.1), OMA-DM can be used to specify the default QoE
configuration. If such a default QoE configuration has been specified, it
should be used by the terminal for all subsequent MBMS sessions where no
session-specific QoE configuration is received.
Any session-specific QoE configuration received shall always have higher
priority, and will in such cases override any default OMA-DM QoE configuration
for that session.
For OMA-DM QoE configuration the parameters are specified according to the
following Managed Object (MO). Version numbering is included for possible
extension of the MO.
The Management Object Identifier shall be: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-mbmsqoe:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: The MO is compatible with OMA Device Management
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD _DM-V1_2 [94].
The following nodes and leaf objects shall be contained under the 3GPP_MBMSQOE
node if an MBMS client supports the feature described in this clause
(information of DDF for this MO is given in Annex H):
{width="2.790277777777778in" height="4.954861111111111in"}

## 8.4 Quality of Experience
### 8.4.1 General
The MBMS Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics feature is optional for both MBMS
streaming server and MBMS client, and shall not disturb the MBMS service. An
MBMS Server that supports the QoE metrics feature shall activate the gathering
of client QoE metrics with SDP as described in sub-clauses 8.3.2.1 and 8.4.2
and via the reception reporting procedure as described in sub-clause 9.4.
Alternatively QoE activation can be done with OMA-DM as described in sub-
clause 8.3.2.2. An MBMS client supporting the feature shall perform the
quality measurements in accordance to the measurement definitions, aggregate
them into client QoE metrics and report the metrics to the specified server
using the content reception reporting procedure. The way the QoE metrics are
processed and made available is out of the scope of the present document.
### 8.4.2 QoE Metrics
An MBMS client should measure the metrics at the transport layer after FEC
decoding (if FEC is used), but may also do it at the application layer for
better accuracy.
The measurement period for the metrics is the whole streaming duration and the
measurement resolution of each reported metrics value is defined by the
\"Measure-Resolution\" field. The measurement period may be less than the
session duration, because of late joiners or early leavers. The measurement
period shall not include any voluntary event that impacts the actual play,
such as pause, or any buffering or freezes/gaps caused by them.
The following metrics in Table 8.4.2 shall be derived by the MBMS client
implementing QoE:
Table 8.4.2
* * *
**QoE Metric** **Streaming delivery method** **Download delivery method**
**Metric type**
Corruption duration metric ✓ Media Rebuffering duration metric ✓ Session
Initial buffering duration metric ✓ Session Successive loss of RTP packets ✓
Media Frame rate deviation ✓ Media Jitter duration ✓ Media Content
Access/Switch Time ✓ Session Network Resource ✓ ✓ Session Average codec
bitrate ✓ Media Codec information ✓ Media Loss of Objects^1^ ✓ Session
* * *
^1^ This metric is of interest mainly for sessions with a large number of
object deliveries such as HTTP streaming sessions [98].
All media metrics are only applicable to at least one of audio, video, speech
and timed text media types, and are not applicable to other media types such
as synthetic audio, still images, bitmap graphics, vector graphics, and text.
Any unknown metrics shall be ignored by the client and not included in any QoE
report.
#### 8.4.2.1 Corruption duration metric
Corruption duration, M, is the time period from the NPT time of the last good
frame before the corruption, (since the NPT time for the first corrupted frame
cannot always be determined) or the start of the measurement period (whichever
is later)to the NPT time of the first subsequent good frame or the end of the
measurement period (whichever is sooner). A corrupted frame may either be an
entirely lost frame, or a media frame that has quality degradation and the
decoded frame is not the same as in error-free decoding. A good frame is a
\"completely received\" frame X that, either:
  * it is a refresh frame (does not reference any previously decoded > frames AND where none of the subsequently decoded frames reference > any frames decoded prior to X); or
  * does not reference any previously decoded frames; or
  * only references previously decoded \"good frames\".
\"Completely received\" means that all the bits are received and no bit error
has occurred.
_Corruption duration, M, in milliseconds can be calculated according to the
derivation of good frames as below:_
a) A good frame can be derived by the client using the codec layer, in which
case the codec layer signals the decoding of a good frame to the client. A
good frame could also be derived by error tracking methods, but decoding
quality evaluation methods shall not be used. An error tracking method may
derive that a frame is a good frame even when it references previously decoded
corrupted frames, as long as all the referenced pixels for generating the
prediction signal were correctly reconstructed when decoding the reference
frames. A decoding quality evaluation method may derive that a frame is a good
frame even one or more pixels of the frame have not been correctly
reconstructed, as long as the decoding quality is considered by the method as
acceptable. Such a frame is not a good frame according to the definition
above, which shall be strictly followed.
b) In the absence of information from the codec layer, a good frame should be
derived according to N, where N is optionally signalled from MBMS streaming
server (via SDP) to the MBMS client and represents the maximum duration, in
presentation time, between two subsequent refresh frames in milliseconds.
After a corrupted frame, if all subsequent frames within N milliseconds in
presentation time have been completely received, then the next frame is a good
frame.
c) N is not signalled, then it defaults to ∞ (for video) or to one frame
duration (for audio).
_The optional parameter D is defined to indicate which of options a) and b) is
in use. D is signalled from the client to the server. When D is equal to
\"a\", option a) shall be in use, and the optional parameter T shall be
present. When D is equal to \"b\", option b) shall be in use and the optional
parameter T shall not be present._
_The_ optional parameter N as defined in point b is used with the
\"Corruption_Duration\" parameter. The optional parameter _T_ is defined to
indicate whether the client uses error tracking (when T is equal to \"On\") or
not (when T is equal to \"Off\"). _T is signalled from the client to the
server_.
The syntax for D, _N_ to be included in the \"att-measure-spec\" (sub-clause
8.3.2.1) is as follows:
  * D = \"D\" \"=\" \"a\" / \"b\"
```{=html}
``` \- N = \"N\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT
In MBMS reception reporting will be done only once at the end of streaming,
hence all the occurred corruption durations are summed up over each resolution
period of the stream and stored in the vector _TotalCorruptionDuration_. The
unit of this metrics is expressed in milliseconds. For each resolution
duration the number of individual corruption events are summed up and stored
in the vector _NumberOfCorruptionEvents._ These two vectors are reported by
the MBMS client as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.2 Rebuffering duration metric
Rebuffering is defined as any stall in playback time due to any involuntary
event at the client side.
The syntax for the metric \"Rebuffering_Duration\" for the QoE-Feedback header
is as defined in sub-clause 8.3.2.1.
Rebuffering starts at the NPT time of the last played frame before the
occurrence of the rebuffering.
In MBMS reception reporting will be done only once at the end of streaming,
hence all the occurred rebuffering durations are summed up over each
resolution period of the stream and stored in the vector
_TotalRebufferingDuration_. The unit of this metrics is expressed in seconds,
and can be a fractional value. The number of individual rebuffering events for
each resolution duration are summed up and stored in the vector
_NumberOfRebufferingEvents._ These two vectors are reported by the MBMS client
as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.3 Initial buffering duration metric
Initial buffering duration is the time from receiving the first RTP packet
until playing starts.
The syntax for the \"Initial_Buffering_Duration\" is as defined in sub-clause
8.3.2.1.
The metric value indicates the initial buffering duration where the unit of
this metrics is expressed in seconds, and can be a fractional value. There can
be only one measure and it can only take one value.
\"Initial_Buffering_Duration\" is a session level parameter.This value is
reported by the MBMS client as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6
and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.4 Successive loss of RTP packets
The metric \"Successive_Loss\" indicates the number of RTP packets lost in
succession (excluding FEC packets) per media channel.
The syntax for the metrics \"Successive_Loss\" is as defined in sub-clause
8.3.2.1.
In MBMS reception reporting will be done only once at the end of streaming,
hence all the number of successively lost RTP packets are summed up over each
resolution period of the stream and stored in the vector
_TotalNumberofSuccessivePacketLoss_. The unit of this metric is expressed as
an integer equal to or larger than 0. The number of individual successive
packet loss events over each resolution duration are summed up and stored in
the vector _NumberOfSuccessiveLossEvents. The number of received packets is
also summed up over each resolution duration and stored in the vector
NumberOfReceivedPackets._ These three vectors are reported by the MBMS client
as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.5 Frame rate deviation
Frame rate and frame rate deviation indicates the playback frame rate
information. Frame rate deviation happens when the actual playback frame rate
during a measurement period is deviated from a pre-defined value.
The actual playback frame rate is equal to the number of frames played during
the resolution period divided by the time duration, in seconds, of the actual
measurement. For the last measurement period in the session this time duration
might be shorter than the configured measurement resolution (see 8.3.2.1 for
the definition of the measurement resolution).
_The parameter FR that denotes the pre-defined frame rate value_ is used with
the \"Framerate_Deviation\" parameter in the \"3GPP-QoE-Metrics\" attribute.
The value of FR shall be set by the server. The syntax for _FR_ to be included
in the \"att-measure-spec\" (sub-clause 8.3.2.1) is as follows:
  * FR = \"FR\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT \".\" 1*DIGIT
The syntax for the metrics\"Framerate\" and \"Framerate_Deviation\" is defined
in sub-clause 8.3.2.1
The metric \"Framerate\" indicates the actual playback frame rate. It is
expressed in frames per second, and can be a fractional value..
For the Metrics-Name \"Framerate_Deviation\", the value field indicates the
frame rate deviation value that is equal to the pre-defined frame rate minus
the actual playback frame rate. This metric is expressed in frames per second,
and can be a fractional value, and can be negative.
The frame rate and the frame rate deviations for each resolution period are
stored in the vectors _Framerate_ and _FramerateDeviation_ and the vectors are
reported by the MBMS client as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6
and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.6 Jitter duration
Jitter happens when the absolute difference between the actual playback time
and the expected playback time is larger than a pre-defined value, which is
100 milliseconds. The expected time of a frame is equal to the actual playback
time of the last played frame plus the difference between the NPT time of the
frame and the NPT time of the last played frame.
The syntax for the metric \"Jitter_Duration\" is defined in sub-clause
8.3.2.1.
In MBMS reception reporting will be done only once at the end of streaming,
hence all the Jitter_Durations are summed up over each resolution duration and
stored in the vector _TotalJitterDuration_. The unit of this metrics is
expressed in seconds, and can be a fractional value. The number of individual
events over the resolution duration are summed up and stored in the vector
_NumberOfJitterEvents._ These two vectors are reported by the MBMS client as
part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.7 Content Access/Switch Time
Content access/switch time is the time that elapses between the initiation of
a content request/switch by the user and up to the time when the first packet
of the content or media stream is received.
The syntax for the metric \"Content_Access_Time\" is defined in sub-clause
8.3.2.1.
The metric value indicates the content access/switch time and the unit of this
metrics is expressed in seconds, and can be a fractional value. There can be
only one measure and it can only take one value. \"Content_Access_Time\" is a
session level parameter. This value is reported by the MBMS client as part of
the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.8 Network Resource
The Network_Resource identifies the cell which has been used during each
measurement resolution duration. There may be many measurement resolution
durations in a reception report for a session, each identified with a cell
identity in which the measurement was performed.
The syntax for the metric \"Network_Resource\" is as defined in sub-clause
8.3.2.1.
In GERAN and UTRAN, the cell is identified by the Cell Global Identity (as
described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [77]), which is a concatenation of MCC, MNC, LAC
and CI. It shall be coded as a text string as follows: Starting with the most
significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3 digits depending on MCC value),
LAC (4 hexadecimal digits) and CI (4 hexadecimal digits).
In E-UTRAN, the cell is identified by the E-UTRAN Cell Global Identification
(ECGI) (as described in 3GPP TS 36.331 [103]) which is a concatenation of the
PLMN Identifier (PLMN-Id) and the E-UTRAN Cell Identity (ECI). The PLMN
identifier consists of MCC and MNC. It shall be coded as a text string as
follows: starting with the most significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3
digits depending on MCC value) and ECI (7 hexadecimal digits).
Only one cell shall be reported per measurement resolution duration, even if
more than one cell has been used during a measurement resolution duration or
if reception is done simultaneously from several cells.
The cells used for all the corresponding measurement resolution durations are
stored in the vector _networkResourceCellId._ If the cell identifier value in
the vector for a resolution period is unchanged from the previous value, it is
allowed to put the value "=" in the vector to indicate this. The vector is
reported by the MBMS client as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6
and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.9 Average codec bitrate
The average codec bitrate is the bitrate used for coding "active" media
information during the measurement resolution period.
For audio media "active" information is defined by frames containing audio. If
the audio codec uses silence frames (SID-frames), these frames are not counted
as \"active\", and the SID-frames and the corresponding DTX time periods are
excluded from the calculation. Thus for audio media the average codec bitrate
can be calculated as the number of audio bits received for "active" frames ,
divided by the total time, in seconds, covered by these frames. The total time
covered is calculated as the number of "active" frames times the length of
each audio frame.
For non-audio media the average codec bitrate is the total number of media
bits played out during the measurement resolution period, divided by the
length of the playout period. The playout period length is normally equal to
the length of the measurement resolution period, but if rebuffering occurs the
playout period will be shorter (i.e. any rebuffering time shall be ignored
when calculating the codec bitrate).
The syntax for the metric \"Average_Codec_Bitrate\" is defined in sub-clause
8.3.2.1.
The average codec bitrate value for each measurement resolution period shall
be stored in the vector _AverageCodecBitrate_. The unit of this metrics is
expressed in kbit/s and can be a fractional value. The vector is reported by
the client as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.10 Codec information
The codec information metrics contain details of the media codec used during
the measurement resolution period. If the codec information is changed during
the measurement resolution period, the codec information valid when each
measurement resolution period ends shall be reported. The unit of this metric
is a string value. No \"white space\" characters are allowed in the string
values, and shall be removed if necessary.
For audio media the codec information contains the audio codec type,
represented as in an SDP offer, for instance \"AMR-WB/16000/1\".
For video media, the codec information contains the video codec type,
represented as in an SDP offer, for instance "H263-2000/90000". Furthermore,
the video profile and level used, as well as the image size used shall be
reported. For instance \"profile=0;level=45\" for the profile and level
information and "176x144" for the image size. In some cases the profile and
level is reported together, for instance \"profile-level-id=42e00a\". Note
that the image size reported for each measurement resolution period shall be
the one actually used, not the maximum size allowed by the SDP negotiation.
For timed text media, the codec information contains the text encoding,
represented as in an SDP offer, for instance \"3gpp-tt/1000\".
The syntax for the metric \"Codec_Info\", "Codec_ProfileLevel" and
"Codec_ImageSize" are defined in sub-clause 8.3.2.1.
The codec info, profile / level and codec image size value for each
measurement resolution period shall be stored in the vectors C _odecInfo_ ,
_CodecProfileLevel_ and _CodecImageSize_ respectively. If the metric values in
these vectors for a measurement resolution period are unchanged from the
previous values in the respective vector, it is allowed to put the value "="
in the vector to indicate this. The C _odecInfo, CodecProfileLevel_ and
_CodecImageSize_ vectors are reported by the client as part of the reception
report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
#### 8.4.2.11 Loss of Objects
The metric \"Object_Loss\" indicates the number of objects lost in a FLUTE
session during a resolution period.
The syntax for the metric \"Object_Loss\" is as defined in sub-clause 8.3.2.1.
The number of lost objects are summed up over each resolution period of the
session and stored in the vector _numberOfLostObjects_. The unit of this
metric is expressed as an integer equal to or larger than 0. _The number of
received objects is also summed up over each resolution duration and stored in
the vector NumberOfReceivedObjects._ These two vectors are reported by the
MBMS client as part of the reception report (sub-clauses 9.4.6 and 9.5.3).
### 8.4.3 Example metrics initiation with SDP
This following example shows the syntax of the SDP attribute for QoE metrics.
The session level QoE metrics description (Initial buffering duration,
rebufferings and network resource) are to be monitored with a measurement
resolution of 20 seconds and reported at the end of the session. Also video
specific description of metrics (corruptions) are to be monitored and reported
at the end from the beginning of the stream until the time 40s. Finally, audio
specific description of metrics (corruptions) is to be monitored with a
measurement resolution of 10s and reported at the end of the stream.
SDP example:

## 8.5 Using MBMS Streaming delivery on Unicast
If the MBMS UE supports MBMS streaming delivery on unicast, then MBMS
Streaming shall perform the functions of a PSS client [47] to deliver content
when MBMS Bearers are not usable or available and if an
alternativeAccessDelivery element is available for the delivery method in the
MBMS User Service Description. Note, if an alternativeAccessDelivery element
is available, it is presumed that the same content is offered over both PSS
and MBMS. If more than one unicastAccessURI element is available in the
alternativeAccessDelivery element, then the UE shall randomly choose one URI
to be used for unicast access to the service.
MBMS and PSS define Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics features. The UE shall
not mix MBMS and PSS QoE metrics gatherings and/or reports. QoE is negotiated,
gathered and reported separately for PSS and MBMS.
The UE may compare the SSRC values of PSS and MBMS flows. If the UE detects
that the same SSRC value is used for PSS and MBMS flows, then the UE should
assume that the same wallclock time and same random RTP timestamp offset is
used for the flows with the same SSRC value. This gives the UE an advantage
for the synchronization onto the flows. The UE does not need to wait for new,
flow specific RTCP packets.
The BM-SC and the PSS servers which provide for unicast access to the MBMS
service shall be time synchronized. The PSS server and the UE should support
UTC clock time format in the "Range" header field as defined in [88].
The UE may request a specific start time of the PSS session by indicating a
UTC clock time in the "Range" header field of the PLAY request. The UTC clock
time represents the requested streaming start point according to the timeline
of the BM-SC. This time may be calculated using the NTP timestamp of the last
received RTCP sender reports. Otherwise, the UE may either specify an NPT
range using the "now" value as a start point of the PSS session or it may
completely omit the Range header field.
If the PSS server does not support time shifting and the request contains a
range indication (other than "now") then the PSS server shall reply with the
actual range that will be played back. Examples of this are an NPT range
header field using "now" or the selected start time in UTC clock time.
A _unicastAccessURI_ element of an alternativeAccessDelivery element in the
_deliveryMethod_ element of the User Service Description may contain an RTSP
URI or a reference to an PSS SDP file.
# 9 Associated delivery procedures
## 9.1 Introduction
Associated delivery procedures describe general procedures, which start
before, during or after the MBMS data transmission phase. They provide
auxiliary features to MBMS user services in addition, and in association with,
MBMS delivery methods and their sessions. Those procedures that shall only be
permitted after the MBMS Data transmission phase may also be described as
post-delivery procedures.
To enable future backwards compatibility, clause 9 specifies generic and
extensible techniques for a potentially wide range of associated delivery
procedures.
Clauses 9.3 and 9.4 specify the associated delivery procedures that are
initiated only after an MBMS data transmission phase.
The present document describes the following associated delivery procedures:
  * File repair, for post-delivery repair of files initially delivered > as part of an MBMS download session.
  * Content reception reporting of files delivered to an MBMS UE.
These procedures are enabled by establishing a point-to-point connection; and
using the MBMS session parameters, received during User Service
Discovery/Announcement, to communicate the context (e.g. file and session in
question) to the network and the MBMS sender infrastructure. To avoid network
congestion in the uplink and downlink directions, and also to protect servers
against overload situations, the associated delivery procedures from different
MBMS UEs shall be distributed over time and resources (network elements).
An instance of an \"associated procedure description\" is an XML file that
describes the configuration parameters of one or more associated delivery
procedures.
MBMS Download receivers shall support the file repair procedure as defined in
sub-clause 9.3.
MBMS Download receivers shall support the reception reporting procedure as
defined in sub-clause 9.4.
MBMS Streaming receivers shall support reception reporting procedures (StaR
and StaR-all report types) as defined in sub-clause 9.4.
## 9.2 Associated Procedure Description
An associated procedure description instance (configuration file) for the
associated delivery procedures may be delivered to the MBMS clients:
  * during a User Service Discovery / Announcement prior to the MBMS > Download delivery session along with the session description > (out-of-band of that session); or
  * in-band within a MBMS Download delivery session.
The most recently delivered configuration file (i.e. the one with the highest
version number - as given from the envelope, see sub-clause 11.1.3) shall take
priority, such that configuration parameters received prior to, and out-of-
band of, the download session they apply to are regarded as \"initial
defaults\", and configuration parameters received during, and in-band with the
download session, overwrite the earlier received parameters. Thus, a method to
update parameters dynamically on a short time-scale is provided but, as would
be desirable where dynamics are minimal, is not mandatory.
During the User Service Discovery / Announcement Procedure, the associated
procedure description instance is clearly identified using a URI, to enable UE
cross-referencing of in and out-of-band configuration files.
The MIME application type \"application/mbms-associated-procedure-
description+xml\" as defined in clause C.7 identifies associated delivery
procedure description instances (configuration files).
In XML, each associated delivery procedure entry shall be configured using an
\"associatedProcedureDescription\" element. All configuration parameters of
one associated delivery procedure are contained as attributes of an
\"associatedProcedureDescription\" element. The elements (e.g.
\"postFileRepair\" and \"postReceptionReport\") of an
\"associatedProcedureDescription\" element identify which associated
procedure(s) to configure. The associated delivery procedure description is
specified formally as an XML schema in sub-clause 9.5.1.
## 9.3 File Repair Procedure
### 9.3.1 Introduction
The purpose of the File Repair Procedure is to repair lost or corrupted file
fragments from the MBMS download data transmission. When in
multicast/broadcast environment, scalability becomes an important issue as the
number of MBMS clients grows. Three problems must generally be avoided:
  * Feedback implosion due to a large number of MBMS clients requesting > simultaneous file repairs. This would congest the uplink network > channel.
  * Downlink network channel congestion to transport the repair data, as > a consequence of the simultaneous clients requests.
  * File repair server overload, caused again by the incoming and > outgoing traffic due to the clients\' requests arriving at the > server, and the server responses to serve these repair requests.
The three problems are interrelated and must be addressed at the same time, in
order to guarantee a scalable and efficient solution for MBMS file repair.
The principle to protect network resources is to spread the file repair
request load in time and across multiple servers.
The MBMS client:
1\. Identifies the end of transmission of files or sessions.
2\. Identifies the missing data from an MBMS download.
3\. Calculates a random _back-off time_ and selects a file repair server
randomly out of a list.
4\. Sends a _repair request_ message to the selected file repair server at the
calculated time.
When a MBMS download session of repair data is configured in the associated
delivery descriptions, a MBMS client should wait for repair data in the
defined MBMS download session on its MBMS bearer - except where the UE is
prevented from doing so due to limited simultaneous context activation
capability.
Then the file repair server:
1\. Responds with a _repair response_ message either containing the requested
data, redirecting the client to an MBMS download session, redirecting the
client to another server, or alternatively, describing an error case.
The BM-SC may also send the repair data on a MBMS bearer (possibly the same
MBMS bearer as the original download) as a function of the repair process.
The random distribution, in time, of _repair request_ messages enhances system
scalability to the total number of such messages the system can handle without
failure.
### 9.3.2 Starting Time of the Associated Delivery Procedure for MBMS Download
Delivery
FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT) Instances include an \"expires\" attribute,
which defines the expiration time of the FDT instance. The sender must use an
expiry time relative to the current time at the BM-SC. According to clause
7.2.9, the UE shall not use a received FDT Instance to interpret packets
received beyond the expiration time of the FDT Instance\".
The starting time of Associated Delivery Procedure for the MBMS download is
the expiration time of the FDT instance at the latest.
The starting time of the _postFileRepair_ timer (see sub-clause 9.4.4)
corresponds to the starting time of the Associated Delivery Procedure. The
_postFileRepair_ timer value corresponds to the back-off time determined from
sub-clause 9.3.4, using the file repair associated parameters in the ADP.
The starting time for the _postReceptionReport_ timer (see sub-clause 9.4.4)
for RAck reports corresponds to the time at which the UE determines that there
has been a complete file reception for MBMS download, as specified in sub-
clause 9.4.1.
The starting time for the _postReceptionReport_ timer (see sub-clause 9.4.4)
for StaR/StaR-only/StaR-all reports corresponds to the time at which the UE
has identified a complete MBMS delivery session reception, as specified in
sub-clause 9.4.2.
The _postReceptionReport_ timer value for RAck and StaR/StaR-only/StaR-all
reports is set to the same value and corresponds to the back-off time, as
determined from sub-clause 9.3.4, using the reception reporting associated
parameters in the ADP.
The MBMS UE may also choose to start the Associated Delivery Procedure before
the FDT instance expires
  * when it has received an end-of-object (B-flag) for an object or
  * when an end-of-session (A-flag) is received before the FDT instance expires. Note, the end-of session (A-flag) indicates, that neither more objects nor FDT instances will be transmissed by the BM-SC.
If the MBMS UE is not capable of receiveing an MBMS transmission while using
an interactive bearer, the MBMS UE shall ignore the end-of-object flags
(B-flag).
When a particular file (URI) is present in several FDT Instances with
different TOI values, then the FDT Instance with the highest FDT Instance ID
defines the TOI for the most recent instance of the file and determines the
end of transmission time for that file. A UE shall only determine transmission
completeness for a file for the most recent instance of the file - and shall
not use FDT Instance expiry time to determine transmission completeness for
any other (TOI) instances of a file (fileURI).
NOTE 1: The intention of this sub-clause is to just start the Associated
Delivery Procedure back-off timer for the more recent instance version of a
file with respect to the FLUTE transmission session.
When a particular file (URI) is present in more than one FDT Instance with the
same TOI value, then the end of transmission time is defined by the expiration
time of the latest FDT Instance to expire.
If an FDT Instance is received describing the file after this time (giving an
FDT Instance expiry time in the future and a different TOI value) the UE shall
determine that the transmission of the file is incomplete - i.e. that more
packets may arrive within the MBMS download session for that file,
\'forgetting\' its previous file transmission complete determination.
NOTE 2: This effectively resets and stops any running timers already initiated
for an associated delivery procedure for that file.
If the MBMS UE receives an end-of-object packet (with FLUTE header B flag set
true) the MBMS UE shall determine that the transmission of that object is
complete, and shall interpret that as file transmission complete if no, more
recent, TOIs are described for the same file (URI) in any received and
unexpired FDT Instance(s).
If the MBMS UE determines that the download session is complete (as specified
in sub-clause 9.4.2) then it shall interpret this also that all the
transmissions of all files (and TOIs) described by all FDT Instances, received
from that session, are complete.
### 9.3.3 Identification of Missing Data from an MBMS Download
The session description and the MBMS download delivery protocol, FLUTE,
provide the client with sufficient information to determine the source block
and encoding symbol structure of each file. From this a client is able to
determine which source symbols should have been transmitted but have not been
received. The client is also able to determine the number of symbols it has
received for each source block of each file, and thus the number of further
symbols required to decode the block.
Thus, an MBMS client is able to identify any source symbols lost in
transmission, and the number (and ESI values where appropriate) of required
source and/or repair symbols that would complete the reconstruction of a
source block (of a file).
When the MBMS FEC scheme is used, the MBMS client shall consider already
received repair symbols when making the determination of the further symbols
required. In this case, the client should either:
  * identify a minimal set of specific symbols that, combined with the > already received symbols, allows the MBMS FEC decoder to recover > the file, or
  * identify a number, _r_ , of symbols such that reception of _r_ > previously unreceived symbols will allow the MBMS FEC decoder to > recover the file.
### 9.3.4 Back-off Timing the Procedure Initiation Messaging for Scalability
This clause describes a _back-off mode_ for MBMS download to provide
information on when a receiver, that did not correctly receive some data from
the MBMS sender during a transmission session, can start a request for a
repair session. In the following it is specified how the information and
method a MBMS client uses to calculate a time (_back‑off time_), instance of
the back-off mode, to send a file repair message to the MBMS server.
The back-off mode is represented by a _back-off unit_ , a _back-off value,_
and a _back-off window_. The two latter parameters describe the back-off time
used by the MBMS client.
_The back-off unit_ (in the time dimension) defaults to _seconds_ and it is
not signalled.
The _back-off time_ shall be given by an _offset time_ (describing the back-
off value) and a _random time period_ (describing the back-off window) as
described in the following clauses.
An MBMS client shall generate random or pseudo-random time dispersion of
_repair requests_ to be sent from the receiver (MBMS client) to the sender
(MBMS server). In this way, the repair request is delayed by a pre-determined
(random) amount of time.
The back-off timing of _repair request_ messages (i.e. delaying the sending of
_repair requests_ at the receiver) enhances system scalability to the total
number of such messages the system can handle without failure.
#### 9.3.4.1 Offset time
The _OffsetTime_ refers to the repair request suppression time to wait before
requesting repair, or in other words, it is the time that a MBMS client shall
wait after the end of the MBMS data transmission to start the file repair
procedure. An associated procedure description instance shall specify the wait
time (expressed in _back-off unit_) using the \"offset-time\" attribute.
#### 9.3.4.2 Random Time Period
The _Random Time Period_ refers to the time window length over which a MBMS
client shall calculate a _random time_ for the initiation of the file repair
procedure. The method provides for statistically uniform distribution over a
relevant period of time. An associated procedure description instance shall
specify the wait time (expressed in _back-off unit_) using the \"random-time-
period\" attribute.
The MBMS client shall calculate a uniformly distributed _Random Time_ out of
the interval between 0 and _Random Time Period_.
#### 9.3.4.3 Back-off Time
The sending of the file _repair request_ message shall start at _Back-off Time
=_ _offset-time +_ _Random Time_ , and this calculated time shall be a
relative time after the MBMS data transmission. The MBMS client shall not
start sending the repair request message before this calculated time has
elapsed after the initial transmission ends.
#### 9.3.4.4 Reset of the Back-off Timer
The reception of an updated (higher version number)
associatedDeliveryProcedureDescription and/or an updated sessionDescription
shall overwrite the timer parameters used in the back-off algorithm. Except in
the case that the offset-time, random-time-period and session end time
parameters are identical to the earlier version; the back-off time shall be
recalculated. For currently running timers this requires a reset.
### 9.3.5 File Repair Server Selection
#### 9.3.5.1 List of Server URIs
A list of file repair service URIs is provided as elements of the Associated
Delivery procedure fragment\'s _postFileRepair_ element. Service URIs host
identity may also be given as IP addresses, which may be used to avoid a
requirement for DNS messaging. The file repair service URIs of a single
associated delivery procedure description shall be of the same type, e.g. all
IP addresses of the same version, or all domain names. The number of URIs is
determined by the number of \"serviceURI\" elements, each of which shall be a
child-element of the \"procedure\" element. The \"serviceURI\" element
provides the references to the file repair server\'s resource via the
\"xs:anyURI\" value. At least one \"serviceURI\" element shall be present.
#### 9.3.5.2 Selection from the Server URI List
The MBMS client randomly selects one of the service URIs from the list, with
uniform distribution.
### 9.3.6 File Repair Request Message
Once missing file data is identified, the MBMS client sends one or more
messages to a file repair server requesting transmission of data that allows
recovery of missing file data. All file repair requests and repair responses
for a particular MBMS transmission shall take place in a single TCP session
using the HTTP protocol (RFC 2616 [18]). The repair request is routed to the
file repair server IP address resolved from the selected \"serviceURI\".
The timing of the opening of the TCP connection to the server, and the first
repair request, of a particular MBMS client is randomized over a time window
as described in sub-clause 9.3.2. If there is more than one repair request to
be made these are sent immediately after the first.
When a MBMS UE identifies symbols in repair requests these shall be source
symbols, and should include all the missing source symbols of the relevant
source block. Note, these represent information for the file repair server and
the BM-SC may use these and/or redundant symbols in providing the necessary
repair data.
#### 9.3.6.1 File Repair Request Message Format
After the MBMS download session, the receiver identifies a set of encoding
symbols which allows recovery of the missing file data and requests for their
transmission in a file repair session. Specific encoding symbols are uniquely
identified by the combination (URI, SBN, ESI).
The file repair request shall either include the URI of the file for which it
is requesting the repair data or an identifier of a set of files. URI is
required to uniquely identify the file (resource) and is found from the
download delivery method (the FLUTE FDT Instances describe file URIs).
Additionally, the repair request for single files shall contain an indication
of the MD5 hash value of the file, if present in the FDT instance declaring
the file from which data is being requested. The MD5 hash value is used to
identify a specific version of the file. The (SBN, ESI) pair uniquely
identifies an encoding symbol. For completely missed files, a Repair Request
may give only the URI of the file and optionally the MD5 hash value of the
file. If the MD5 hash value is not present, the server shall respond with the
latest version of the file.
A set of files may be fetched using the File Repair server. A client may
request all files from a specific FDT instance or a specific logical group of
a particular MBMS User Services.
The client makes a file repair request using the HTTP (RFC 2616 [18]) request
method GET. Further arguments are encoded into the URI query part (RFC 3986
[19]) as defined below and included in the HTTP GET request. If a number of
previously unreceived symbols are requested for a specific Source Block, then
the SBN is provided along with the ESI of the symbol, which is subsequent in
the symbol sequence to the latest received symbol for that source block and
the number of symbols requested. If a number of previously unreceived source
blocks are requested for a specific file, the URI should be provided along
with an SBN range starting from the first missing source block and ending with
the SBN of the last missing source block of the contiguous set of source
block. Examples for requesting contiguous and non-contiguous ranges of symbols
and source blocks or even entire files or group of files are given below.
For example, assume that in a MBMS download session a 3gp file with URI =
www.example.com/news/latest.3gp was delivered to an MBMS client. After the
MBMS download session, the MBMS client recognized that it did not receive two
packets with SBN = 5, ESI = 12 and SBN=20, ESI = 27. If the repair service URI
(from the associated delivery procedure meta data fragment) is
http://mbmsrepair1.example.com/path/repair_script and the MD5 **value of that
file is "** ODZiYTU1OTFkZGY2NWY5ODh==**",** then the HTTP GET request is as
follows:
**GET** /path/repair_script?fileURI=www.example.com/news/latest.3gp&Content-
MD5= ODZiYTU1OTFkZGY2NWY5ODh== &SBN=5;ESI=12&SBN=20;ESI=27 **HTTP/1.1**
**Host: mbmsrepair1.example.com**
A file repair session shall be used to recover the missing file data from a
single MBMS download session only. If more than one file were downloaded in a
particular MBMS download session, and, if the MBMS client needs repair data
for more than one file received in that session, the MBMS client shall send
separate HTTP GET requests for each file.
An HTTP client implementation might limit the length of the URL to a finite
value, for example 256 bytes. In the case that the length of the URL-encoded
(SBN, ESI) data exceeds this limit, the MBMS client shall distribute the
URL‑encoded data into multiple HTTP GET requests.
In any case, all the HTTP GETs of a single file repair session shall be
performed within a single TCP session and they shall be performed immediately
one after the other.
In the following, we give the details of the syntax used for the above request
method in ABNF.
In this case an HTTP GET with a normal query shall be used to request the
missing data, according to HTTP1.1 [RFC2616 [18]]
  * repair_request_http_URL = repair_service_URI \"?\" query
  * repair_service_URI = \ Delivery Procedure Description>
Where, for MBMS File Repair Request:
  * query = std_query \| alt_query
  * std_query = file_uri [\"&\" content_md5] *( \"&\" sbn_info)
  * file_uri = \"fileURI=\" URI-reference; URI-reference is as defined > in [19].
  * content_md5 = \"Content-MD5=\" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"/\" / > \"=\")
  * sbn_info = \"SBN=\" sbn_range
  * sbn_range = ( sbnA [ \"-\" sbnZ ] ) / ( sbnA [ \";\" esi_info] > )
  * esi_info = \"ESI=\" ((esi_range *( \",\" esi_range ) ) ) / (esiA > "+" number_symbols)
  * esi_range = esiA [ \"-\" esiZ ]
  * sbnA = 1*DIGIT; the SBN, or the first of a range of SBNs
  * sbnZ = 1*DIGIT; the last SBN of a range of SBNs
  * esiA = 1*DIGIT; the ESI, or the first of a range of ESIs
  * esiZ = 1*DIGIT; the last ESI of a range of ESIs
  * number_symbols = 1*DIGIT; the number of additional symbols > required
  * alt_query = service_id "&" ( fdt_inst_id \| fdt_group_id )
  * service_id = \"serviceId=\" \ the User Service Description>
  * fdt_inst_id = "fdtInstanceId=" \ [9] or in clause 7.4>
  * fdt_group_id = "fdtGroupId=" \ defined in clause 7.2.10.1>
Thus, the following symbols adopt a special meaning for MBMS download URI: ? -
+ , ; & =
One example of a query on encoding symbol 34 of source block 12 of a music
file "www.example.comm/greatmusic/number1.aac\" using the provided repair
service URI \"http://mbmsrepair1.example.com/path/repair_script\" is:
  * http://mbmsrepair1.example.com/path/repair_script?fileURI= > www.example.com/greatmusic/number1.aac&SBN=12;ESI=34
An example of requesting an entire file is
  * http://mbmsrepair1.example.com/path/repair_script?fileURI= > www.example.com/greatmusic/number1.aac
An example of requesting a specific source block from a specific file version
is
```{=html}
``` \- http://mbmsrepair1.example.com/path/repair_script?fileURI=
www.example.com/greatmusic/number1.aac&Content-MD5=ODZiYTU1OTFkZGY2NWY5ODh==
For messaging efficiency, the formal definition enables several contiguous and
non-contiguous ranges to be expressed, as well as a number of symbols with
ESIs of a given value or above in a single query:
  * An entire file (like in the above example).
  * A symbol of a source block (e.g. ...&SBN=12;ESI=23).
  * A range of symbols for a certain source block (e.g. > ...&SBN=12;ESI=23-28).
```{=html}
``` \- A number of symbols with ESIs of a given value or above (e.g. >
...&SBN=12;ESI=120+10).
```{=html}
``` \- A list of symbols for a certain source block (e.g. >
...&SBN=12;ESI=23,26,28).
  * All symbols of a source block (e.g. ...&SBN=12).
  * All symbols of a range of source blocks (e.g. ...&SBN=12-19).
  * non-contiguous ranges (e.g.1. ...&SBN=12;ESI=34&SBN=20;ESI=23 also, > e.g. 2. ...&SBN=12‑19&SBN=28;ESI=23-59&SBN=30;ESI=101).
An example to request all file of a particular FDT instance is given below:
```{=html}
``` \-
http://mbmsrepair1.example.com/path/repair_script?serviceId=urn:3gpp:0010120123hotdog&fdtInstanceId=12
### 9.3.7 File Repair Response Message
Once the MBMS file repair server has assembled a set of encoding symbols that
contain sufficient data to allow the UE to reconstruct the file data from a
particular file repair request, the MBMS file repair server sends one message
to the UE. Each file repair response occurs in the same TCP and HTTP session
as the repair request that initiated it.
An MBMS client shall be prepared for any of these 5 response scenarios:
  * The server returns a repair response message where a set of encoding > symbols forms an HTTP payload as specified below (see 9.3.7.2 for > details).
  * The server returns the requested file or file groups (see 9.3.7.4 > for details).
  * The server redirects the client to a broadcast/multicast delivery > (an MBMS download session).
  * The server redirects the client to another file repair server (if a > server is functioning correctly but is temporarily overloaded).
  * An HTTP error code is returned (note that sub-clause 9.3.8 describes > the case of no server response).
For (reasonably) uniformly distributed random data losses, immediate point-to-
point HTTP delivery of the repair data will generally be suitable for all
clients. However, broadcast/multicast delivery of the requested data may be
desirable in some cases:
  * A repeat MBMS download (all or part of the files from a download > session) is already scheduled and the BM-SC prefers to handle > repairs after that repeat MBMS download.
  * Many UEs request download data (over a short period of time) > indicating that broadcast/multicast delivery of the repaired data > would be desirable.
In this case a redirect to the broadcast/multicast repair session for UEs that
have made a repair request would be advantageous.
#### 9.3.7.1 File Repair Response Messages Codes
In the case that the file repair server receives a correctly formatted repair
request which it is able to understand and properly respond to with the
appropriate repair data, the file repair server shall attempt to serve that
request without an error case.
For a direct point-to-point HTTP response with the requested data, the file
response message shall report a 200 OK status code and the file repair
response message shall consist of HTTP header and file repair response payload
(HTTP payload), as defined in sub-clause 9.3.7.2. If the client receives a 200
OK response with fewer than all the quantity of requested symbols it shall
assume that the file repair server wishes the missing symbols to be requested
again (due to its choice or inability to deliver those symbols with this HTTP
response).
For a redirect case the file repair server uses the HTTP response status code
302 (Found - Redirection) to indicate to the UE that the resource (file repair
data) is temporarily available via a different URI. The temporary URI is given
by the Location field in the HTTP response. In the case of a redirect to
another file repair server, this temporary URI shall be the URL of that repair
server.
In the case of a redirect to a broadcast/multicast delivery, the temporary URI
shall be the URI of the Session Description (SDP file) of the
broadcast/multicast (repair) session as described in sub-clause 9.3.7.3.Other
HTTP status codes (RFC 2616 [18]) shall be used to support other cases. Other
cases may include server errors, client errors (in the file repair request
message) and server overload.
In case the file repair server does not find the requested file (file with
given fileURI is found), the server shall respond with "400 Bad Request" and
optionally with "0001 File not found" in the response body. As a result, the
MBMS UE may choose another file repair server as defined in clause 9.3.5.
In case the file repair server does not find the requested version of the
requested file (file with given fileURI is found but Content-MD5 is not
found), the server shall respond with "400 Bad Request" and optionally with
"0002 Content-MD5 not valid" in the response body. As a result, the MBMS UE
may chose another file repair server as defined in clause 9.3.5. Or the MBMS
UE may request the latest version of the file and discard the previously
received chunks of the file. Note, the MBMS UE can request the latest version
of a file by using only the fileURI argument in the file repair request.
Note. In case of repetitive server errors, the client is not expected to go
through the complete list of available file repair servers, and may abandon
after a limited number of attempts.
In case the file repair server does not find any of the requested SBN or ESI
values, it shall respond with the "400 Bad Request" and optionally with "0003
SBN or ESI out of range" in the respon se body. As a result, the UE should
discard all received chunks of the file and request the entire file from the
file repair server.
In case the file repair server receives unknown query line arguments, it shall
respond with "501 Not Implemented". The server should add the HTTP1.1 "Server"
header with the value "MBMS/6". As a result, the client should try to fetch
the entire file from the file repair server. Note, this behaviour is intended
to make the file repair service forward compatible and allow addition of new
function in later releases.
In case the file repair server does not find the requested serviceId value, it
shall respond with the "400 Bad Request" and optionally with "0004 ServiceId
not found" in the response body. As a result, the UE should request the needed
file separately using the fileURI query line argument.
In case the file repair server does not find the requested fdtInstanceId
value, it shall respond with the "400 Bad Request" and optionally with "0005
fdtInstanceId not found" in the response body. As a result, the UE should
request the needed file separately using the fileURI query line argument.
In case the file repair server does not find the requested fdtGroupId value,
it shall respond with the "400 Bad Request" and optionally with "0006
fdtGroupId not found" in the response body. As a result, the UE should request
the needed file separately using the fileURI query line argument.
In case the file repair server is experiencing overload condition, it should
respond with the "503 Service Unavailable". As a result, the UE should stop
the file repair procedure to the file repair server. The UE shall consider
this server unavailable, however the UE may try an alternative file repair
server. In the case that all known file repair servers have been exhausted in
this manner, the UE shall cease the file repair procedure.
HTTP responds error messages may contain a message body, which gives a more
detailed error message. The MIME type of such message body shall be in
text/plain. The syntax of the HTTP error message body is defined in ABNF [23]
as follows:
http-error-body = error-code (SP / HTAB) error-description CRLF
error-code = 4DIGIT
error-description = 1*(SP / VCHAR)
Note that the following error messages MAY be used in the message body of the
HTTP response error messages.
0001 File not found
0002 Content-MD5 not valid
0003 SBN or ESI out of range
0004 ServiceId not found
0005 fdtInstanceId not found
0006 fdtGroupId not found
#### 9.3.7.2 File Repair Response Message Format for HTTP Carriage of Repair
Data
The file repair response message consists of HTTP header and file repair
response payload (HTTP payload).
The HTTP header shall provide:
  * HTTP status code, set to 200 OK for the case of a successful > request.
  * Content type of the HTTP payload (see below).
NOTE: Other HTTP headers (RFC 2616 [18]) may also be used but are not mandated
by this mechanism.
The Content-Type shall be set to \"application/simpleSymbolContainer\", which
denotes that the message body is a simple container of encoding symbols as
described below.
This header is as follows:
  * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  * Content-Type: application/simpleSymbolContainer
NOTE: Other HTTP headers (RFC 2616 [18]) may also be used but are not mandated
by this mechanism.
Encoding symbols are included in the response in groups. Each group is
preceded by an indication of the number of symbols within the group and an FEC
Payload ID coded according to the FEC scheme used for the original file
delivery session. The FEC Payload ID identifies all the symbols in the group
in the same way that the FEC Payload ID of an FEC source or repair packet
identifies all the symbols in the packet. The file repair response payload is
constructed by including each FEC Payload ID and Encoding Symbol group one
after another (these are already byte aligned). The order of these pairs in
the repair response payload may be in order of increasing SBN, and then
increasing ESI, value; however no particular order is mandated.
A single HTTP repair response message shall contain, at the most, the same
number of symbols as requested by the respective HTTP repair request message.
The UE and file repair server already have sufficient information to calculate
the length of each encoding symbol and each FEC Payload ID. All encoding
symbols are the same length; with the possible exception of the last source
encoding symbol in the repair response. All FEC Payload IDs are the same
length for one file repair request-response as a single FEC Scheme is used for
a single file.

the FEC Scheme in use.
**Encoding Symbols** : contain the encoding symbols. All the symbols shall be
the same length.
Figure 18: File Repair Response Message Format
#### 9.3.7.3 File Repair Response for Broadcast/Multicast of Repair Data
Details of how a file repair server decides, or is instructed, to use
broadcast/multicast repair instead of point-to-point over HTTP are
implementation specific and beyond the scope of the present document.
Prior to the decision to use broadcast/multicast repair, each repair response
shall be provided by HTTP according to sub-clause 9.3.7.2.
The file repair server uses the HTTP response status code 302 (Found -
Redirection) to indicate to the UE that the resource (file repair data) is
temporarily available via a different URI. The temporary URI is given by the
Location field in the HTTP response and is the URI of the Session Description
(SDP file) of the broadcast/multicast repair session.
Where feasible, it is recommended that the same download session that
delivered the original data be used for the broadcast/multicast repair. If
this conflicts with the session end time limit of the Session Description then
a new version of the Session Description shall be sent with an updated
(extended) session end time. This shall be sent in-band of that download
session.
In some cases this may not be feasible and a different (possibly new) download
session may be defined for the repair.
The SDP file for broadcast/multicast repair session may be carried as payload
(entity-body) in the HTTP response - which is especially useful if the
broadcast/multicast repair session is a new (or recently end time modified)
FLUTE download session and other means of service announcement prior to this
were not feasible.
The delivery method\'s associatedDeliveryProcedureDescription may be updated
and the new version transmitted in-band with the download session so that
currently active client back-off timers are reset, thus minimizing additional
client requests until after the broadcast/multicast repair session. The server
shall be prepared for additional requests in any case as successful reception
of the updated associatedDeliveryProcedureDescription can not be assured in
all cases.
The existence of a broadcast/multicast file repair session is signalled by the
inclusion of the optional _bmFileRepair_ procedure in the updated Associated
Delivery procedure description. This is signalled by the _bmFileRepair_
element with a single \"sessionDescriptionURI\" attribute of type
\"xs:anyURI\" which specifies the URI of the broadcast/multicast file repair
session\'s session description.
In the cases where the same IP addressing is used for the broadcast/multicast
repair session as the original download session, the UE simply shall not leave
the group. Otherwise, the UE shall join to the MBMS bearer for the repair
session as it would for any MBMS session.
A broadcast/multicast file repair session behaves just as an MBMS download
session, and the determination of end of files and session, and use of further
associated delivery procedures uses the same techniques as specified for the
MBMS download delivery method.
#### 9.3.7.4 File Repair Response Message Format for HTTP carriage of Complete
Files
The file repair response message consists of HTTP header and one or more
complete files.
The HTTP header shall provide:
  * HTTP status code, set to 200 OK for the case of a successful response.
  * Content type shall be set to multipart/related
NOTE: Other HTTP headers (RFC 2616 [18]) may also be used but are not mandated
by this mechanism.
The server shall encapsulate the requested files into a multipart mime
container. Each part of the multipart mime shall contain at least the Content-
Location of the embedded files.
### 9.3.8 Server Not Responding Error Case
In the error case where a UE determines that the its selected file repair
server is not responding it shall return to the serverURI list of repair
servers and uniformly randomly select another server from the list, excluding
any servers it has determined are not responding. All the repair requests
message(s) from that UE shall then be immediately sent to the newly selected
file repair server.
If all of the repair servers from the serverURI list are determined to be not
responding, the UE may attempt an HTTP GET to retrieve a, potentially new,
instance of the session\'s Associated Procedure Description; otherwise UE
behaviour in this case is unspecified.
A UE determines that a file repair server is not responding if any of these
conditions apply:
1\. The UE is unable to establish a TCP connection to the server.
2\. The server does not respond to any of the HTTP repair requests that have
been sent by the UE (it is possible that second and subsequent repair requests
are sent before the first repair request is determined to be
not‑responded‑to).
3\. The server returns an unrecognized message (not a recognizable HTTP
response).
4\. The server returns an HTTP server error status code (in the range 500 to
505).
## 9.4 The Reception Reporting Procedure
Following successful reception of content whether through point-to-multipoint
MBMS bearers only, unicast bearers only, or using both point-to-multipoint and
point-to-point bearers, a reception reporting procedure can be initiated by
the MBMS Receiver (UE) to the BM-SC.
For MBMS Download Delivery method, the reception reporting procedure is used
to either report the complete reception of one or more files, or to report
statistics on the stream, or to do both. For MBMS Streaming Delivery method,
the reception reporting procedure is used to report statistics on the stream.
If the BM-SC provided parameters requiring reception reporting confirmation
then the MBMS Receiver shall confirm the content reception.
If reception reporting is requested for statistical purposes the BM-SC may
specify the percentage subset of MBMS receivers it would like to perform
reception reporting.
Transport errors can prevent an MBMS Receiver from deterministically
discovering whether the reception reporting associated delivery procedure is
described for a session, and even if this is successful whether a sample
percentage is described. An MBMS Receiver shall behave according to the
information it has even when it is aware that this may be incomplete.
The MBMS Receiver:
1\. Identifies the completion of the reception of an MBMS session and its
content items (e.g. a file, or a set of files within a download delivery
session). See sub-clauses 9.4.1and 9.4.2.
2\. Determines the need to report reception. See sub-clause 9.4.3.
3\. Selects a time (Request time) at which a reception report request will be
sent and selects a server from a list - both randomly and uniformly
distributed. See sub-clauses 9.4.4 and 9.4.5.
4\. Sends a _reception report request_ message to the selected server at the
selected time. See sub-clause 9.4.6.
Then the server:
1\. Responds with a _reception report response_ message either describing a
success or an error case. See sub-clause 9.4.7.
### 9.4.1 Identifying Complete File Reception from MBMS Download and
Determining Download Status
A file is determined to be completely downloaded when it is fully received and
reconstructed by MBMS reception with FEC decoding (if FEC is actually used)
and/or a subsequent File Repair Procedure (sub-clause 9.3).
When compiling RAck reception reports for a download delivery session, the
failure or success of a file is determined after FEC decoding and any
subsequent File Repair Procedure.
When compiling StaR, StaR-all, or StaR-only reception reports for a download
delivery session, the failure or success of a file is determined after FEC
decoding and before any subsequent File Repair Procedure.
### 9.4.2 Identifying Complete MBMS Delivery Session Reception
Delivery sessions (download and streaming) are considered complete when the
\"time to\" value of the session description (from \"t=\" in SDP) is reached.
Where the end time is unbounded (time to = 0) then this parameter is not used
for identifying completed sessions.
Delivery sessions are also considered complete when the UE decides to exit the
session - where no further data from that session will be received. In this
case the UE may or may not deactivate the MBMS bearer(s).
For MBMS download sessions, FLUTE provides a \"Close session flag\" (see sub-
clause 7.2.7) which, when used, indicates to the UE that the session is
complete.
### 9.4.3 Determining Whether a Reception Report Is Required
Upon full reception of a content item or when a session is complete, the MBMS
Receiver must determine whether a reception report is required. An Associated
Delivery Procedure Description indicates the parameters of a reception
reporting procedure (which is transported using the same methods as the ones
that describe File Repair).
A delivery method may associate zero or one associated delivery procedure
descriptions with an MBMS delivery session. Where an associated delivery
procedure description is associated with a session, and the description
includes a _postReceptionReport_ element, the UE shall initiate a reception
reporting procedure. Reception reporting behaviour depends on the parameters
given in the description as explained below.
The Reception Reporting Procedure is initiated if:
a. A _postReceptionReport_ element is present in the associated procedure
description instance, or the default QoE reporting according to sub-clause
8.3.2.2 is activated.
One of the following will determine the UE behaviour:
_b. reportType_ is set to RAck (Reception Acknowledgement). Only successful
file reception is reported without reception details.
_c. reportType_ is set to StaR (Statistical Reporting for successful
reception). Successful file reception is reported (as with RAck) with
reception details for statistical analysis in the network.
_d. reportType_ is set to StaR-all (Statistical Reporting for all content
reception). The same as StaR with the addition that failed reception is also
reported. StaR-all is relevant to both streaming and download delivery.
_e. reportType_ is set to StaR-only (Statistical Reporting without Reception
Acknowledgement). The same as StaR-all with the exception that individual
files are not acknowledged. Only reception details are reported for the
session for both streaming and download delivery. StaR-only is equivalent to
StaR-all for streaming delivery. StaR-all is relevant to download delivery
where session performance is obtained through QoE metrics.
f. The default OMA-DM QoE reporting configuration is activated according to
sub-clause 8.3.2.2. QoE reporting is in this case done according to the
content of the \"Rules\" leaf in the 3GPP_MBMSQOE MO.
The _reportType_ attribute is optional and behaviour shall default to RAck
when it is not present.
The _samplePercentage_ attribute can be used to set a percentage sample of
receivers which should report reception. This can be useful for statistical
data analysis of large populations while increasing scalability due to reduced
total uplink signalling. The _samplePercentage_ takes on a value between 0 and
100, including the use of decimals. It is recommended that no more than 3
digits follow a decimal point (e.g. 67.323 is sufficient precision).
The _samplePercentage_ attribute is optional and behaviour shall default to
100 (%) when it is not present. The _samplePercentage_ attribute may be used
with StaR, StaR-only and StaR-all, but shall not be used with RAck.
When the _samplePercentage_ is not present or its value is 100 each UE which
entered the associated session shall send a reception report. If the
_samplePercentage_ were provided for reportType StaR, StaR-only and StaR-all
and the value is less than 100, the UE generates a random number which is
uniformly distributed in the range of 0 to100. The UE sends the reception
report when the generated random number is of a lower value than the
_samplePercentage_ value.
### 9.4.4 Request Time Selection
The MBMS receiver selects a time at which it is to issue a delivery
confirmation request. The default start time for the reception reporting
procedure is defined in clause 9.3.2.
Back-off timing is used to spread the load of delivery confirmation requests
and responses over time.
Back-off timing is performed according to the procedure described in sub-
clause 9.3.4. The _offsetTime_ and _randomTimePeriod_ used for delivery
confirmation may have different values from those used for file-repair and are
signalled separately in the reception reporting description of the associated
delivery procedure description instance.
In general, reception reporting procedures may be less time critical than file
repair procedures. Thus, if a postFileRepair timer may expire earlier than a
postReceptionReport, radio and signalling resources may be saved by using the
file repair point-to-point PDP context (and radio bearer) activate period also
for reception reporting (to remove the delay and signalling of multiple
activations and deactivations over time)
The default behaviour is that a UE shall stop its postReceptionReport timers
which are active when a postFileRepair timer expires, and the UE shall send
the corresponding reception report(s) immediately following the file repair
procedure on the point-to-point communication setup for file repair.
In some circumstances, the system bottleneck may be in the server handling of
reception reporting. In this case the _forceTimeIndependence_ attribute may be
used and set to true. (false is the default case and would be a redundant use
of this optional attribute). When _forceTimeIndependence_ is true the UE shall
not use file repair point-to-point connections to send reception reporting
messages. Instead it will allow the timers to expire and initiate point-to-
point connections dedicated to reception report messaging.
For StaR, StaR-only and StaR-all, session completeness - according to sub-
clause 9.4.2 - shall determine the back-off timer initialization time.
For RAck, the complete download session - according to sub-clause 9.4.2 \- as
well as completing any associated file repair delivery procedure shall
determine the back-off timer initialization time. RAcks shall be only sent for
completely received files.
### 9.4.5 Reception Report Server Selection
Reception report server selection is performed according to the procedure
described in sub-clause 9.3.5.2.
### 9.4.6 Reception Report Message
Once the need for reception reporting has been established, the MBMS receiver
sends one or more Reception Report messages to the reception report server
URI. All Reception Report requests and responses for a particular MBMS
transmission should take place in a single TCP session using the HTTP protocol
(RFC 2616 [18]).
The Reception Report request shall include the URI of the file for which
delivery is being confirmed. URI is required to uniquely identify the file
(resource).
The client shall make a Reception Report request using the HTTP (RFC 2616
[18]) POST request carrying XML formatted metadata for each reported received
content (file). An HTTP session shall be used to confirm the successful
delivery of a single file. If more than one file were downloaded in a
particular MBMS download multiple reception reports shall be added in a single
POST request.
Each Reception Report is formatted in XML according the following XML schema
(sub-clause 9.5.3). An informative example of a single reception report XML
object is also given (sub-clause 9.5.3.2).
Multipart MIME (multipart/mixed) may be used to aggregate several small XML
files of reception reports to a larger object.
For Reception Acknowledgement (RAck) a receptionAcknowledgement element shall
provide the relevant data.
For Statistical Reporting (StaR) a statisticalReporting element shall provide
the relevant data.
For both RAck and StaR/StaR-all (mandatory):
  * For download, one or more _fileURI_ elements shall specify the list > of files which are reported. If the Content-MD5 value of the file > is present in the FDT, it shall be provided in the Content-MD5 > attribute in the reception report. Note, this allows unambiguous > identification of the files.
For only StaR/StaR-all/StaR-only (all optional):
  * Each _fileURI_ element has an optional _receptionSuccess_ status > code attribute which defaults to \"true\" (\"1\") when not used. > This attribute shall be used for StaR-all reports. This attribute > shall not be used for StaR reports. This attribute is not relevant > for StaR-only reports.
  * Each QoE Metrics element has a set of attributes and any number of > media level QoE Metrics elements. All attributes are defined in > sub-clause 9.5.3 and correspond to the QoE metrics listed in > sub-clause 8.4.2. Individual metrics, both at session and at media > level can be selected via SDP as described in sub-clause 8.3.2.1.
  * The _sessionID_ attribute identifies the delivery session. If the > sessionType is \"download\", _sessionID_ is of the format > source_IP_address + \":\" + FLUTE_TSI. If the _sessionType_ is > \"streaming\", _sessionID_ is of the format source_IP_address + > \":\" + RTP_destination_port.
```{=html}
``` \- The _sessionStartTime_ and _sessionStopTime_ attributes identifies >
the time when the session was started and stopped, respectively. > The value
of the data field represents the 32 most significant > bits of a 64 bit
Network Time Protocol (NTP) [78] time value > (i.e. the seconds part of the
NTP time stamp format). These 32 > bits provide an unsigned integer
representing the time in seconds > relative to 0 hours 1 January 1900.
Handling of wraparound of the > 32 bit time is outside the scope of NTP and
FLUTE.
```{=html}
``` \- The _sessionType_ attribute defines the basic delivery method > session
type used = \"download\" \|\| \"streaming\".
  * The _serviceId_ attribute is value and format is taken from the > respective userServiceDescription serviceID definition.
  * The _clientId_ attribute is unique identifier for the receiver, e.g. > an MSISDN of the UE as defined in [77].
  * The _serviceURI_ attribute value and format is taken from the > respective associatedDeliveryProcedureDescription serviceURI, > which was selected by the UE for the current report. This > attribute expresses the reception report server to which the > reception report is addressed.
### 9.4.7 Reception Report Response Message
An HTTP response is used as the Reception Report response message.
The HTTP header shall use a status code of 200 OK to signal successful
processing of a Reception Report. Other status codes may be used in error
cases as defined in RFC 2616 [18].

# 10 Media codecs and formats
## 10.1 General
The set of media decoders that are supported by the MBMS Client to support a
particular media type are defined below. Speech, Audio, Video, Timed Text and
Scene description media decoders are relevant for both MBMS Download and
Streaming delivery. Other media decoders are only relevant for MBMS Download
delivery.
## 10.2 Speech
If speech is supported, the AMR decoder, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.071 [48],
3GPP TS 26.090 [49], 3GPP TS 26.073 [50] and 3GPP TS 26.107 [51], shall be
supported for narrow-band speech. The AMR wideband speech decoder, 3GPP TS
26.171 [52], 3GPP TS 26.190 [53], 3GPP TS 26.173 [54] and 3GPP TS 26.204 [55],
shall be supported when wideband speech working at 16 kHz sampling frequency
is supported.
## 10.3 Audio
If audio is supported, then the following two audio decoders should be
supported:
  * Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.401 [28], 3GPP TS > 26.410 [29] and 3GPP TS 26.411 [30].
  * Extended AMR-WB, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.290 [24], 3GPP TS > 26.304 [25] and 3GPP TS 26.273 [26].
Specifically, based on the audio codec selection test results, Extended AMR-WB
is strong for the scenarios marked with blue, Enhanced aacPlus is strong for
the scenarios marked with orange, and both are strong for the scenarios marked
with green colour in table 1.
Table 1
+----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | Content type | Music | Speech over Music | Speech between Music | Speech | | | | | | | | Bit rate | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | 14 kbps mono | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | 18 kbps stereo | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | 24 kbps stereo | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | 24 kbps mono | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | 32 kbps stereo | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+ | 48 kbps stereo | | | | | +----------------+-------+-------------------+----------------------+--------+
More recent information on the performance of the codecs based on more recent
versions of the codecs can be found in TR 26.936 [86].
## 10.4 Synthetic audio
If synthetic audio is supported, the Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) content
format defined in Scalable Polyphony MIDI Specification [56] and the device
requirements defined in Scalable Polyphony MIDI Device 5-to-24 Note Profile
for 3GPP [57] should be supported.
SP-MIDI content is delivered in the structure specified in Standard MIDI Files
1.0 [58], either in format 0 or format 1.
In addition the Mobile DLS instrument format defined in [59] and the Mobile
XMF content format defined in [60] should be supported.
A PSS client supporting Mobile DLS shall meet the minimum device requirements
defined in [59] in section 1.3 and the requirements for the common part of the
synthesizer voice as defined in ISO/IEC 10646-1 [70] in section 1.2.1.2. If
Mobile DLS is supported, wavetables encoded with the G.711 A-law codec
(wFormatTag value 0x0006, as defined in [59]) shall also be supported. The
optional group of processing blocks as defined in [59] may be supported.
Mobile DLS resources are delivered either in the file format defined in
ISO/IEC 10646-1 [70], or within Mobile XMF as defined in [60]. For Mobile DLS
files delivered outside of Mobile XMF, the loading application should unload
Mobile DLS instruments so that the sound bank required by the SP-MIDI profile
[57] is not persistently altered by temporary loadings of Mobile DLS files.
Content that pairs Mobile DLS and SP-MIDI resources is delivered in the
structure specified in Mobile XMF [60]. As defined in [60], a Mobile XMF file
shall contain one SP-MIDI SMF file and no more than one Mobile DLS file. PSS
clients supporting Mobile XMF must not support any other resource types in the
Mobile XMF file. Media handling behaviours for the SP-MIDI SMF and Mobile DLS
resources contained within Mobile XMF are defined in [60].
## 10.5 Video
If video is supported, H.264 (AVC) Constrained Baseline Profile Level 1.3
decoder (ITU-T Recommendation H.264\| ISO/IEC 14496-10 [43]) without
requirements on output timing conformance (annex C of [43]) should be
supported.
Note that MBMS does not offer dynamic negotiation of media codecs. To ensure
the maximum level of interoperability, H.264 (AVC) is the only video decoder
recommended for MBMS. However, it is to be noted that ITU-T Recommendation
H.263 profile 0 level 45 decoder (ITU-T Recommendation H.263 [45] and H.263
annex X [46]) shall be supported for PSS (3GPP TS 26.234 [47]) and hence may
be used for MBMS User Service.
When H.264 (AVC) is in use in the MBMS streaming delivery method, it is
recommended to transmit H.264 (AVC) parameter sets within the SDP description
of a stream (using sprop-parameter-sets MIME/SDP parameter - RFC3984 [35]),
and it is not recommended to transmit parameter sets within the RTP stream.
Moreover, it is not recommended to reuse any parameter set identifier value
that appeared previously in the SDP description or in the RTP stream. However,
if a sequence parameter set is taken into use or updated within the RTP
stream, it shall be contained at least in each IDR access unit and each access
unit including a recovery point SEI message in which the sequence parameter
set is used in the decoding process. If a picture parameter set is taken into
use or updated within the RTP stream, it shall be contained at the latest in
the first such access unit in each entry sequence that uses the picture
parameter set in the decoding process, in which an entry sequence is defined
as the access units between an IDR access unit or an access unit containing a
recovery point SEI message, inclusive, and the next access unit, exclusive, in
decoding order, which is either an IDR access unit or contains a recovery
point SEI message.
There are no requirements on output timing conformance (annex C of ITU-T
Recommendation H.264 [43]) for MBMS clients.
The H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS client shall start decoding immediately
when it receives data (even if the stream does not start with an IDR access
unit) or alternatively no later than it receives the next IDR access unit or
the next recovery point SEI message, whichever is earlier in decoding order.
Note that when the interleaved packetization mode of H.264 (AVC) is in use,
de-interleaving is normally done before starting the decoding process. The
decoding process for a stream not starting with an IDR access unit shall be
the same as for a valid H.264 (AVC) bitstream. However, the client shall be
aware that such a stream may contain references to pictures not available in
the decoded picture buffer.
## 10.6 Still images
If still images are supported, ISO/IEC JPEG [61] together with JFIF [62]
decoders shall be supported. The support for ISO/IEC JPEG only applies to the
following two modes:
  * baseline DCT, non-differential, Huffman coding, as defined in table > B.1, symbol \'SOF0\' in 3GPP TS 26.273 [26];
  * progressive DCT, non-differential, Huffman coding, as defined in > table B.1, symbol \'SOF2\' 3GPP TS 26.273 [26].
## 10.7 Bitmap graphics
If bitmap graphics is supported, the following bitmap graphics decoders should
be supported:
  * GIF87a, [63];
  * GIF89a, [64];
  * PNG, [65].
## 10.8 Vector graphics
If vector graphics is supported, SVG Tiny 1.2 [66], [67] and ECMAScript [68]
shall be supported.
NOTE 1: The compression format for SVG content is GZIP [42], in accordance
with the SVG specification [66].
NOTE 2 Content creators of SVG Tiny 1.2 are strongly recommended to follow the
content creation guidelines provided in annex L of 3GPP TS 26.234 [47].
NOTE 3: A DIMS client is capable of processing SVG Tiny 1.2 data..
## 10.9 Text
The text decoder is intended to enable formatted text in a SMIL presentation.
If text is supported, a MBMS client shall support
  * text formatted according to XHTML Mobile Profile [69];
  * rendering a SMIL presentation where text is referenced with the SMIL > 2.0 \"text\" element together with the SMIL 2.0 \"src\" attribute.
If text is supported, the following character coding formats shall be
supported:
  * UTF-8, [71];
  * UCS-2, [70].
NOTE: Since both SMIL and XHTML are XML based languages it would be possible
to define a SMIL plus XHTML profile. In contrast to the presently defined SMIL
Language Profile that only contain SMIL modules, such a profile would also
contain XHTML modules. No combined SMIL and XHTML profile is specified for
MBMS. Rendering of such documents is out of the scope of the present document.
## 10.10 Timed text
If timed text is supported, MBMS clients shall support 3GPP TS 26.245 [72].
Timed text may be transported over RTP or downloaded contained in 3GP files
using Basic profile.
NOTE: When a MBMS client supports timed text it needs to be able to receive
and parse 3GP files containing the text streams. This does not imply a
requirement on MBMS clients to be able to render other continuous media types
contained in 3GP files, e.g. AMR, if such media types are included in a
presentation together with timed text. Audio and video are instead streamed to
the client using RTP.
## 10.11 3GPP file format
An MBMS client shall support the Basic profile and the Extended presentation
profile of the 3GPP file format 3GPP TS 26.244 [32].
NOTE: For delivery of segments of Adaptive HTTP Streaming over MBMS download
(see clause 5.6), more details on the support of 3GPP file format and segments
for Adaptive HTTP streaming are specified in 3GPP TS 26.234 [47] and also in
3GPP TS 26.244 [32].
## 10.12 Scene Description
If scene description is supported, MBMS clients shall support 3GPP DIMS TS
26.142 [89].
## 10.13 Timed graphics
If timed graphics is supported, MBMS clients shall support 3GPP TS 26.430[95].
# 11 MBMS Metadata
## 11.1 The MBMS Metadata Envelope
### 11.1.1 Supported Metadata Syntaxes
The MBMS metadata syntax supports the following set of features:
  * Support of carriage of SDP descriptions, and SDP is expected to > sufficiently describe at least: MBMS Streaming sessions and, MBMS > download sessions.
  * Support for multiple metadata syntaxes, such that the delivery and > use of more than one metadata syntax is possible.
  * Consistency control of metadata versions, between senders and > receivers, independent of the transport and bearer use for > delivery.
  * Metadata fragments are identified, versioned and time-limited > (expiry described) in a metadata fragment syntax-independent > manner (which is a consequence of the previous two features).
### 11.1.2 Consistency Control and Syntax Independence
The _metadata envelope_ provides information to identify, version and expire
each of its metadata fragments. This is specified to be independent of
metadata fragments syntax and of transport method (thus enabling the use of
more than one syntaxes and enable delivery over more than a single transport
and bearer).
A metadata envelope (as identified by the _metadataEnvelope_ element in the
schema in sub-clause 11.1.3) consists of one or more metadata envelope
instances (as identified by the _item_ element in the schema in subclause
11.1.3). A metadata envelope instance is associated to exactly one metadata
fragment. A metadata envelope instance may update the time validity of its
metadata fragment without changing version of that metadata fragment if the
metadata fragment has not changed. A newer version (higher version number) of
a metadata envelope instance shall automatically expire the earlier version.
If the content type (metadata fragment syntax) is recognized and valid, the UE
shall use the new metadata fragment description. However, if the content type
is not recognized or valid, the UE may maintain the expired version data until
the newer version is correctly received.
Service announcement senders shall increment the version by one for each
subsequent transported version of a metadata fragment. However, a UE shall
also accept versions with an increment greater than one (so that they do not
fail in the case that an intermediate version was not successfully
transported).
### 11.1.3 Metadata Envelope Definition
The attributes for a metadata envelope instance and their description is as
follows. These attributes shall be supported:
  * _metadataURI_ : A URI providing a unique identifier for the metadata > fragment. The _metadataURI_ attribute shall be present.
  * _version_ : The version number of the associated instance of the > metadata fragment. The version number should be initialized to > one. The version number shall be increased by one whenever the > metadata fragment is updated. The _version_ attribute shall be > present.
  * _validFrom_ : The date and time from which the metadata fragment file > is valid. The _validFrom_ attribute may or not be present. If not > present, the UE should assume the metadata fragment version is > valid immediately.
  * _validUntil_ : The date and time when the metadata fragment file > expires. The _validUntil_ attribute may or not be present. If not > present the UE should assume the associated metadata fragment is > valid for all time, or until it receives a newer metadata envelope > for the same metadata fragment describing a validUntil value.
  * _contentType_ : The MIME type of the metadata fragment which shall be > used as defined for \"Content-Type\" in RFC 2616 [18]. The > _contentType_ attribute shall be present for embedding metadata > envelopes. The _contentType_ attribute may be present for > referencing metadata envelopes.
The metadata envelope is instantiated using an XML structure. This XML
contains a URI referencing the associated metadata fragment. The formal schema
for the metadata envelope is defined as an XML Schema as follows.
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The _metadataFragment_ element shall be encapsulated in the metadata envelope
for embedded metadata fragments, and shall not be encapsulated where the
metadata fragment is not embedded. In the embedded case, the
_metadataFragment_ element shall contain exactly one embedded metadata
fragment as specified by the metadata envelope syntax and only one instance of
the envelope element shall be used for encapsulating envelopes.
An embedded metadata fragment (in the _metadataFragment_ element) shall be
escaped. Generally, an embedded metadata fragment should be escaped by placing
inside a CDATA section [31]. Everything starting after \"\\" string would be ignored by the XML envelope parser
(quotes not included). Thus, the embedded parts would appear as \"\\". In this case, the complete metadata envelope
with embedded metadata fragment shall not violate the rules of CDATA section
usage [31].
In case the embedded metadata fragment is an XML document and include a CDATA
section , the embedded metadata fragment may be escaped by replacing illegal
characters with their ampersand-escaped equivalents [31] (instead of
encapsulating the whole fragment in a CDATA section). For instance \"\ envelope.
  * Referenced: The metadata fragment is referenced from the metadata > envelope.
The MBMS UE must know the MIME Type of each metadata fragment.
In the embedded case, the envelope and fragment are, by definition,
transported together and in-band of one another. In the referenced case, the
envelope and fragment shall be transported together in-band of the same
transport session.
MBMS Service Announcement transports shall support delivery of the metadata
envelope as a discrete object (XML document) for the referenced case. In the
referenced case, the MIME type of the metadata fragment should be provided by
the transport protocol (e.g. as a Content-Type text string). In both cases,
the MIME type of the metadata envelope should be provided by the transport
protocol.
The metadata envelope instance includes a reference (_metadataURI_) to the
associated metadata fragment using the same URI as the fragment file is
identified by in the Service Announcement. Thus, metadata envelope can be
mapped to its associated metadata fragment.
## 11.2 MBMS User Service Description Metadata Fragment
### 11.2.1 Definition of the MBMS User Service Bundle Description
#### 11.2.1.1 Initial Definition
The root element of the MBMS User Service Bundle description is the
_bundleDescription_ element. The element is of the _bundleDescriptionType_.
The _bundleDescription_ contains one or several _userServiceDescription_
elements and optionally a reference to the FEC repair stream description.
Each _userServiceDescription_ [ ]{.underline} element shall have a unique
identifier. The unique identifier shall be offered as _serviceId_ attribute
within the _userServiceDescription_ element and shall be of URN format.
The _userServiceDescription_ [ ]{.underline} element may contain one or more
_name_ elements. The intention of a _name_ element is to offer a title of the
user service. For each name elements, the language shall be specified
according to XML datatypes (XML Schema Part 2 [22]).
The _userServiceDescription_ [ ]{.underline} element may contain one or more
_serviceLanguage_ elements. Each _serviceLanguage_ element represents the
available languages of the user services. The language shall be specified
according to XML datatypes (XML Schema Part 2 [22]).
The _userServiceDescription_ [ ]{.underline} element may contain an
_accessPointName_ attribute. The _accessPointName_ attribute is optional and
gives an Access Point Name (APN) as defined in [77]. When this attribute is
present, the MBMS UE shall use the given APN for MBMS UE to network
interactions like File Repair and/or security registration. If this attribute
is not present, the MBMS UE shall use a default PDP context/default EPS bearer
for network interactions.
Each _userServiceDescription_ [ ]{.underline} element shall contain at least
one _deliveryMethod_ element. The _deliveryMethod_ element contains the
description of one delivery method. The element shall contain one reference to
a session description and may contain references to one associated delivery
procedure and/or one service protection descriptions. The session description
is further specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.2.
A _requiredCapabilities_ element gives a list of features, which are required
for the consumption of the related MBMS user service. The list of features
that are currently defined is included in section 11.9. The value of the
_feature_ element indicates the required feature. Note that the BM-SC can also
determine the terminal capabilities from the terminal identification during
the security registration. If the registering terminal does not have the
required capabilities, the BM-SC can reject the security registration.
The _deliveryMethod_ element may contain a reference to an associated delivery
procedure description. The description and configuration of associated
delivery procedures is specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.
The _deliveryMethod_ element may contain a reference to a service protection
description. The service protection description is specified in sub-clause
5.2.2.4.
A _userServiceDescription_ element contains zero or more _accessGroup_
elements. An _accessGroup_ element defines a list of access networks and is
uniquely identified by its id attribute. An _accessGroup_ element describes
whether separate access systems for the same MBMS user service are used (see
sub-clause 5.1.5.2 of [4]) by including one or more _accessBearer_ elements,
each describing one of those access systems and no two describing the same.
Possible _accessBearer_ values are "3GPP.R6.UTRAN", "3GPP.R6.GERAN" ,
"3GPP.R7.MBSFN-FDD", "3GPP.R7.MBSFN-TDD" and "3GPP.R8.MBSFN-IMB" which
indicate transport by 3GPP MBMS bearers according to the specification in
[4][5]. The _accessBearer_ value for evolved UTRAN is "3GPP.R9.E-UTRAN".
For forward compatibility, other _accessBearer_ values are allowed but their
definition and use are out of scope of this specification and a 3GPP UE may
silently ignore other values.
Each _deliveryMethod_ element contains at most one _accessGroupId_ attribute.
One specific _accessGroupId_ value maps to one specific _accessGroup_ element
id value. For each unique _accessGroupId_ attribute value presented in a
_deliveryMethod_ element of a _userServiceDescription_ instance, exactly one
associated _accessGroup_ element shall be present and the id attribute of the
_accessGroup_ element and the _accessGroupId_ attribute shall have the same
value. For each _deliveryMethod_ element without an _accessGroupId_ attribute,
the UE should assume that the delivery method is offered through all available
MBMS access systems.

The MBMS User Service Bundle Description schema defined in this clause extends
the MBMS Release 6 schema of clause 11.2.1.1. An MBMS User Service Description
schema of the current release shall comply with MBMS User Service Description
schema definition of Release 6 and the subsequent releases up to the current
release.
An _initiationRandomization_ element and _terminationRandomization_ element
carries the parameters to be used by the MBMS UE to randomize their initiation
and/or termination operations over time. If the _initiationRandomization_
element is present, all MBMS UEs shall randomize the initiation time as
defined by the attributes of the elements. If the _terminationRandomization_
element is present, all MBMS UEs shall randomize the termination time as
defined by the attributes of the elements.
The _initiationRandomization_ and/or _terminationRandomization_ element may be
part of:
  * a bundleDescription, where it applies to all services in the service bundle
  * a userServiceDescription, where it applies to all MBMS bearer services of a single service. If present, this overrides the element in bundleDescription
If the _initiationRandomization_ element is not present, the MBMS UE does not
randomize the User Service Initiation procedure over time. The MBMS UE should
then perform the operation immediately when it is triggered.
If the _terminationRandomization_ element is not present, the MBMS UE does not
randomize the User Service Termination procedure over time. The MBMS UE should
then perform the operation immediately when it is triggered.
An _initiationRandomization_ element may contain the _initiationStartTime_
attribute, which defines the start time for the initiation procedure
randomization period. The value of the data field represents the 32 most
significant bits of a 64 bit Network Time Protocol (NTP) [78] time value. If
the _initiationStartTime_ attribute is not present, the MBMS UE shall use the
reception time of the User Service Discovery / Announcement information as
_initiationStartTime._
The _initiationRandomization_ element shall contain the _protectionPeriod_
attribute. The _protectionPeriod_ attribute expresses the length of the
protection period in seconds. The initiation procedure shall be randomly
deferred during protection period.
The _initiationRandomization_ element shall contain the _randomTimePeriod_
attribute. The _randomTimePeriod_ attribute expresses the length of a time
interval (in seconds) over which requests are deferred. The MBMS UE shall
calculate a random time for the execution of the initiation procedure. The
method provides for statistically uniform distribution over a relevant period
of time.
The _terminationRandomization_ element shall contain the _protectionPeriod_
attribute. The _protectionPeriod_ attribute expresses the length of the
protection period in seconds. The termination procedure execution shall be
randomly deferred during protection period.
The _terminationRandomization_ element shall contain the _randomTimePeriod_
attribute. The _randomTimePeriod_ attribute expresses the length of a time
interval (in seconds) over which the operations are deferred. The MBMS UE
shall calculate a random time for the execution of the termination procedure.
The method provides for statistically uniform distribution over a relevant
period of time.
If the MBMS UE is switched off during the termination randomization, the MBMS
UE shall cancel the termination randomization.
The _alternativeAccessDelivery_ element shall extend the list of elements of
the MBMS _deliveryMethod_ element. Whenever present, it shall contain at least
one unicastAccessURI element. The _unicastAccessURI_ element provides unicast
server information for OMA push for MBMS download service when the UE is
outside of home network and file download delivery method is used. The
_unicastAccessURI_ element refers to a URI to be used for unicast access to
the streaming service. If the alternativeAccessDelivery element is available
then the UE shall select one of the unicastAccessURI elements included.The
timeShiftingBuffer attribute may be used to indicate the minimal size of the
time shifting buffer that will be provided for the current service by the PSS
servers that are referenced in the list. The actual size of the timeshifting
buffer of the selected server is returned in the SETUP response from the PSS
Server.
A USD may include a _r7:unicastAccessURI_ element for support of Release 7
UEs. UEs of release 8 onwards shall use _alternativeAccessDelivery_ element
for both OMA Push file download and unicast streaming.
The _serviceClass_ attribute, if present, shall extend the list of attributes
of the MBMS Release 6 _userServiceDescription_ [ ]{.underline} element. The
_serviceClass_ attribute is optional and contains the service class identifier
for the delivered service according to the syntax defined in clause E.1.2 of
[90]. Note that Annex E of [90] also foresees the registration of service
class identifiers with the Open Mobile Naming Authority. The service class
identifier is similar to MIME types and provides an unique identity to
services. A MBMS UE may determine the receiving application instance out of
the service class identifier.
A user service description may belong to a group of user service descriptions,
which represent alternative configurations of the same user service. An
example is an MBMS user service that is delivered over non-MBSFN bearer with a
low bitrate and over MBSFN bearer with a high bitrate. In such a case, the UE
is only expected to consume one variant of the service. The UE recognizes that
a set of user service descriptions apply to one user service based on the
_serviceGroup_ element.
The MBMS User Service Description may include a _Registration_ element. If
present, then the UE shall send the registration and deregistration to the
given URI. In such a case, the User Service Description fragment may not be
complete in the service announcement. Instead, it may contain references to
metadata fragments (e.g. the session description) that are not embedded in the
service announcement. When registration is requested, the
userServiceDescription element shall contain a Registration element that
describes the requested registration procedure. The registrationURI indicates
the URI to the server with whom the registration procedure shall be performed.
In case more than one registrationURI is indicated, the UE shall select one
randomly. The registrationThreshold is a number that indicates the percentage
of UEs that are requested to register. The UE shall randomly select a number
between 0 and 100 and compare it against the threshold. In case the selected
number is lower than the indicated threshold, the UE should perform
registration. The threshold value \"100\" indicates that the UE shall perform
registration, which is e.g. necessary when the USD is not complete.
The MBMS User Service Description may include a _mediaPresentationDescription_
element, when the MBMS User Service Description describes a download delivery
service. If present, then the UE expects that the received files correspond to
a media presentation description described by the MPD in [47]. The _mpdURI_
element provides a reference to the Media Presentation Description metadata
fragment, whose contents are identical to the MPD as defined in [47]. The
Media Presentation Description fragment may refer, via the
InitialisationSegmentURL, to one or more Initialisation Segment Description
(ISD) metadata fragments, whose contents are identical to the Initialisation
Segment as defined in [47].
The MBMS User Service Description may include a _schedule_ element. If
present, the _schedule_ element includes a URI to the MBMS User Service
schedule information, the latter corresponding to a Schedule Description
metadata fragment as defined in sub-clause 11.2A.
The MBMS User Service Description may include an _availabilityInfo_ element.
If present, it shall extend the list of child elements of the MBMS
_userServiceDescription_ element by indicating the presence of additional data
pertaining to the availability of the service.
The _availabilityInfo_ element shall include one or more _infoBinding_
elements. The _infoBinding_ element may contain the child element
_serviceArea_ , and shall contain the child element _radioFrequency_. The
_serviceArea_ element declares the one or more areas over which this MBMS User
Service is provided. This element is designated by the _MBMS Service Area
Identity_ as defined in 3GPP TS 36.443 [98] and 3GPP TS 23.003 [77]. According
to 3GPP TS 36.443 [98], _MBMS Service Area Identity_ is frequency agnostic and
can be mapped onto one or more cells. The specific usage of the _MBMS Service
Area Identity_ , or its correlation to other network identification
information, is not defined in this specification. The _radioFrequency_
element indicates the one or more RF frequencies in the E-UTRAN downlink which
transmit this MBMS User Service over the service area(s) identified by the
_serviceArea_ element. The frequency parameter is coded as EARFCN in 3GPP TS
36.101 [99]. The MBMS client shall forward the service area and radio
frequency information received in the USD to the lower layers, and the UE is
expected to make use of such information in accordance with TS 36.304 [100]
clause 5.2.4.1.
NOTE: In this release of the specification, a UE not supporting the processing
of the _serviceArea_ element can ignore that element if present in the USD.

## 11.2A Schedule Description Metadata Fragment
**The XML schema for the Schedule Description Metadata Fragment is specified
in sub-clause 11.2A.2. The procedures associated with the elements of the
schema are specified in sub-clause 11.2A.1.**
### 11.2A.1 Procedures for Schedule Description Metadata Fragment
A schedule description instance may be delivered to the MBMS clients:
  * during a User Service Discovery / Announcement prior to the MBMS > Download delivery session along with the session description > (out-of-band of that session); or
  * in-band within a MBMS Download delivery session; or
  * via an MBMS download delivery session dedicated to the transport of > file schedule information.
The most recently delivered schedule file shall take priority, such that
schedule parameters received prior to, and out-of-band, of the download
session they apply to are regarded as \"initial defaults\", and schedule
parameters received in-band with the download session, overwrite the earlier
received schedule parameters. The MBMS Metadata envelope, see sub-clause 11.1,
applies for the reception of schedule parameters.
The schedule description instance is clearly identified using a URI, to enable
UE cross-referencing of in and out-of-band schedule files.
The MIME Type for the Schedule information is
\"application/mbms‑schedule+xml\"
Availability of the schedule description metadata fragment is indicated by the
presence of the _schedule_ element in the MBMS User Service Bundle Description
fragment. The URI to the Schedule Description fragment is provided by the
element _scheduleDescriptionURI_ in the _schedule_ element.
The start and stop time of a single _fileSchedule_ is specified by the _start_
and _end_ attributes.The start and stop time of a single _sessionSchedule_ is
specified by the start and stop elements. The time is specified as the
absolute date and time. The duration may be determined by subtracting the
start time from the stop time.
The UE may only activate reception of that service within the
_sessionSchedule_ (and the _fileSchedule_ if present) time window.
When a _fileSchedule_ is present in a _serviceSchedule,_ then
  * The UE should not expect that a file described by a _fileSchedule_ will be updated during a time window instance, defined by _start_ and _end_ attributes within a _deliveryInfo_ element of that _fileSchedule_.
  * There shall be only one file version (as defined in the _Content-MD5_ attribute in the FDT) transmitted in a time window defined by the _start_ and _end_ attributes within a _deliveryInfo_ element for a given _fileSchedule_ element.
  * The files transmitted in the time windows from different _deliveryInfo_ elements in a _fileSchedule_ should not be expected to be the same file version.
  * Inband Schedule Description fragment updates can be used to provide a dynamic schedule update to override the existing delivery schedule, such as using the _cancelled_ attribute mechanism specified in this clause.
  * A _sessionSchedule_ element in the same _serviceSchedule_ element shall be present, and its _start_ and _stop_ elements shall specify a time window that completely overlaps the time windows specified in each of the _fileSchedule_ elements of the same _serviceSchedule_.
When a _sessionSchedule_ is present and there are no _fileSchedule_ in a
_serviceSchedule_ , then the UE should download each new file, independently
of whether the session is used for file delivery or DASH over MBMS.
The _reoccurencePattern_ element if included shall have a value of either
\"daily\", \"weekly\" or \"monthly\".
**The number of reoccurence of an event may be indicated by either specifying
the end time, as indicated by the** _reoccurenceStopTime_ element, or by
specifying the number of reoccurrence, with the _numberOfTimes_ element. If
there are no reoccurrence, then the _reoccurencePattern_ , _numberofTimes_ and
_reoccurenceStopTime_ elements are not included.
The _scheduleUpdate_ element specifies a time after which UE shall seek to
update its schedule information.
An _index_ element is included as a child of _sessionSchedule_ element. The
index is the starting index in a sessionSchedule describing recurrence with
the index increased by one from the index for each session in the session
repetitions.
A _cancelled_ attribute is defined as a child of the _fileURI_ element, itself
a child of the _fileSchedule_ element. If _cancelled_ is set to \"true\" or
\"1\", then the transmission of the file identified by the _fileURI_ element
is cancelled, and the UE shall cancel any applicable file repair and/or
reception reporting procedures for that file . If this file schedule-level
cancellation indication in the updated schedule description is received after
the associated file has already been delivered, then any related file repair,
or reception reporting for that file (associated with its parent service),
either in progress or yet to occur, shall be aborted. If _cancelled_ is set to
\"false\" or \"0\" or is absent, then nominal file transmission and associated
delivery procedures, if applicable, shall occur.
A _sessionScheduleOverride_ element is defined as a child of the
_serviceSchedule_ element. If included, the _sessionScheduleOverride_ element
indicates either the cancellation of the session occurrence, or schedule
override, as follows:
  * If the _cancelled_ attribute (a child of _sessionScheduleOverride_ element) is set to \"true\" or \"1\", then the transmission of the session identified by the _index_ attribute (a child of _sessionScheduleOverride_ element) is cancelled, and the UE shall cancel any applicable file repair and/or reception reporting for all files belonging to that session. If this session schedule-level cancellation indication in the updated schedule description is received after any of the associated files have already been delivered, then any related file repair, or reception reporting for those files (associated with their parent service(s)), either in progress or yet to occur, shall be aborted.
  * If the _cancelled_ attribute (a child of _sessionScheduleOverride_ element) is set to \"false\" or \"0\" or is absent, then the _start_ and _stop_ time elements (children of _sessionScheduleOverride_ element) shall override the nominal start and stop time of the transmission schedule of the session as identified by the _index_ attribute (a child of _sessionScheduleOverride_ element).
The value of the _index_ attribute in the _sessionScheduleOverride_ element
corresponds to any of the the value of the _index_ element in the
_reoccurenceStartStopType_ in the _sessionSchedule_ element.
Schedule information received in the Schedule Description metadata fragment
shall take precedence over timing information that may have been received in
SDP (t or/and r lines).
### 11.2A.2 XML-Schema for the Schedule Description Meta Data Fragment
Below is the formal XML syntax of schedule information procedure. Documents
following this schema can be identified with the MIME type
\"application/mbms‑schedule+xml\" defined in Annex C.14. The file name of XML
schema for schedule description is Schedule-Description-Main.xsd.
In this version of the specification the network shall set the _schemaVersion_
element, defined as a child of _scheduleDescription_ element, to 1.
The schema _version_ attribute (part of the schema instruction) shall be
included in the UE schema and the network schema.
Note: The value of the _schemaVersion_ element and _version_ attribute is
intended to be increased by 1 in every future releases where new element(s) or
attribute(s) are added.
When a UE receives an instantiation of a Schedule Description compliant to
this schema, it shall determine the schema version required to parse the
instantiation as follows:
  * If the UE supports one or more versions of the Schedule Description schema with the schema _version_ attribute, then the UE shall use the schema that has the highest schema _version_ attribute value that is equal to or less than the value in the received _schemaVersion_ element;
The XML schema \"schema-version.xsd" is specified in Annex J.

### 11.2A.3 Examples of the Schedule Description Meta Data Fragment
**Example 1**
In this instantiation example, the following key points can be noted
  * The version of the schema used to generate this instantiation is > version 1, as indicated by the schemaVersion element. Thus a > receiver of this instantiation that has multiple schedule schema > versions (say 1 and 2) should use a schedule schema version equals > to 1, as indicated in the version attribute of the schema > instruction "schema". The receiver should avoid using schema > version higher than 1, since the instantiation would fail > verification against such schema version.
  * The scheduleUpdate element indicates UTC time February 1^st^ 2012 at > time 00 hour 00 min 00 sec. Thus UE should seek to update the > schedule instance after this time.
  * There are 2 serviceSchedule elements.
  * In the first serviceSchedule, it includes
  * a sessionSchedule that starts at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:00:00 and ends at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:30:00;
  * a first fileSchedule used for FOTA (firmware update over the air) for oem-1 model-1 with a filename of image032212.apk, which delivery starts at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:00:00 and ends at March 1^st^ 2012 23:10:00, thus 10 minutes duration;
  * a second fileSchedule used for FOTA for oem-1 model-2 with filename image098798.apk, which delivery starts at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:10:00 and ends at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:20:00, thus 10 minutes duration;
  * a third fileSchedule used for FOTA for oem-1 model-3 with filename image765987.apk, which delivery starts at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:20:00 and ends at UTC March 1^st^ 2012 23:30:00, thus 10 minutes duration.
  * In the second serviceSchedule, it includes
  * a sessionSchedule that starts at UTC March 7^th^ 2012 10:00:00 and ends at UTC March 7^th^ 2012 10:30:00;
  * a first fileSchedule used for FOTA for oem-1 model-4 with a filename of image456345.apk, which delivery starts at UTC March 7^th^ 2012 10:00:00 and ends at March 7^th^ 2012 10:15:00, thus 15 minutes duration;
  * a second fileSchedule used for FOTA for oem-1 model-2 with filename image504123.apk, which delivery starts at UTC March 7^th^ 2012 10:15:00 and ends at UTC March 7^th^ 2012 10:30:00, thus 15 minutes duration.

## 11.3 Service Protection Description Metadata Fragment
### 11.3.1 Definition of the Protection Description
The security description is referenced by the _protectionDescriptionURI_ of a
deliveryMethod element. The security description fragment shall be identified
by the MIME type \"application/mbms protection-description+xml\" as defined in
Annex C.6.
The root element of the security description is the _securityDescription_
element. It contains three different elements, the _keyId_ element identities
the key(s) for each media flow, the _keyManagement_ element the keymanagement
servers that the load is distributed over and the parameters in use, and the
_fecProtection_ element that configures the FEC protection of the point to
multi-point distributed key flows.
The _keyManagement_ element defines the list of key management servers (i.e.
BM-SC). The MBMS UE must register with a key management server to receive key
material. A receiver shall select a key managment server following the same
procedure defined for selecting a file repair server defined in sub-clause
9.3.5.
The attribute _uiccKeyManagement_ defines whether UICC based key management is
required for the present MBMS User Service.
The _offsetTime_ and _randomTimePeriod_ attributes define the back off
behavior of the UE when requesting MSKs. This uses the procedure defined in
sub-clause 9.3.4 where _offsetTime_ specifies the offset time defined in sub-
clause 9.3.4.1 and _randomTimePeriod_ the length of the random window in
accordance with sub-clause 9.3.4.2. The units for both attributes are in
seconds.
The element _keyId_ contains a list of media flows for which keys are
required. For each media flow a key identifier is provided in addition to that
media flows additional security parameters. The media flow is identified by a
destination tuple providing an address followed by a port number separated by
a \"/\", i.e. \/\. The port number
is for RTP session the RTP port number, and not RTCP\'s. The _MSK_ element
identifies the key uniquely by specifying both the _keyDomainID_ and the
_MSKID_ as defined in sub-clause 6.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.246 [20]. The _MSKID_
is 4 bytes long binary with byte 3 and 4 equal to 0x00, i.e. the current key
that are base64 [82] when written into the element. The _keyDomainID_ is a 3
byte long binary value as specified in sub-clause 6.3.2.1 of [20] and shall
also be base64 encoded when written in the XML document.
The presence of the _fecProtection_ element indicates that any MIKEY packet
with an multicast destination IP address equal to any of the used destination
address in the User Service Bundle Description instance's delivery methods,
are FEC protected and encapsulated in FEC source packets, see sub-clause
8.2.2.4. The attributes _fecEncodingId_ , _fecInstanceID_ , and
_fecOtiExtension_ specify the FEC payload ID used in the source packet. All
service protection descriptions referenced by a User Service Bundle
Description instance shall use the same FEC parameters.
The schema filename of Security Description (as defined below) is

## 11.9 MBMS Feature Requirements
MBMS features enable the BM-SC to signal to the UE the set of capabilities
that are required for the consumption of the MBMS user service. The required
capability list is indicated in the MBMS User Service Description of the
corresponding MBMS user service as defined in section 11.2.1.
The MBMS UE shall not attempt to receive the service if it detects that at
least one required capability, indicated in the USD, is not supported or not
understood. The introduction of new features is possible and assumes that
unidentified features shall be interpreted by the UE as a requirement that
cannot be fulfilled.
The following list of features is currently identified:

###### ## Annex B (normative): FEC encoder specification
This Annex specifies the systematic Raptor forward error correction code and
its application to MBMS [7]. Raptor is a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding
symbols as needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly from the source
symbols of a block. The decoder is able to recover the source block from any
set of encoding symbols only slightly more in number than the number of source
symbols.
The code described in this document is a Systematic code, that is, the
original source symbols are sent unmodified from sender to receiver, as well
as a number of repair symbols.

### B.4.4.1 Parameter derivation algorithm
This sub-clause provides recommendations for the derivation of the transport
parameter _T_. This recommendation is based on the following input parameters:
\- _B_ the maximum source block size, in bytes
\- _P_ the maximum repair packet payload size, in bytes, which is a multiple
of _Al_
\- _Al_ the symbol alignment factor, in bytes
\- _K~MAX~_ the maximum number of source symbols per source block.
\- _K~MIN~_ a minimum target on the number of symbols per source block
\- _G~MAX~_ a maximum target number of symbols per repair packet
A requirement on these inputs is that ceil(_B_ /_P_) ≤ _K~MAX~_. Based on the
above inputs, the transport parameter _T_ is calculated as follows:
Let,
_G_ = min{ceil(_P_ · _K~MIN~_ /_B_), _P_ /_Al_ , _G~MAX~_} - the approximate
number of symbols per packet
_T =_ floor(_P_ /(_Al_ · _G_))· _Al_
The value of _T_ derived above should be considered as a guide to the actual
value of _T_ used. It may be advantageous to ensure that _T_ divides into _P_
, or it may be advantageous to set the value of _T_ smaller to minimize
wastage when full size repair symbols are used to recover partial source
symbols at the end of lost source packets (as long as the maximum number of
source symbols in a source block does not exceed _K~MAX~_). Furthermore, the
choice of _T_ may depend on the source packet size distribution, e.g., if all
source packets are the same size then it is advantageous to choose _T_ so that
the actual payload size of a repair packet _P'_ , where _P'_ is a multiple of
_T_ , is equal to (or as few bytes as possible larger than) the number of
bytes each source packet occupies in the source block.
Recommended settings for the input parameters, _Al_ , _K~MIN~_ and _G~MAX~_
are as follows:
_Al_ = 4 _K~MIN~_ = 1024 _G~MAX~_ = 10

###### ## Annex D (informative): RTP packetization guidelines
This annex provides guidelines for MBMS senders to minimize initial buffering
delay between starting of the reception and starting of rendering of media
data in MBMS receivers.
When H.264 (AVC) video is in use, an MBMS sender should form FEC source blocks
in which the first H.264 (AVC) access unit in decoding order is an IDR access
unit.
MBMS senders should transmit all application data units for a given H.264
(AVC) access unit, or audio frame within one FEC source block.
MBMS senders should set the min-buffer-time MIME/SDP parameter and the minimum
buffering delay elements included in FEC source blocks to values that are
sufficient to cover any required de-interleaving of application data units,
such as H.264 (AVC) NAL units and coded audio frames, from their transmission
order to decoding order.
When RTP timestamps are converted to the wallclock time of the MBMS receiver,
the smallest RTP timestamp among the FEC source packets of a FEC source block
of a stream should be equal or close to the smallest RTP timestamp among the
FEC source packets of a FEC source block of any other stream of the same MBMS
streaming session.
When RTP timestamps are converted to the wallclock time of the MBMS receiver,
the greatest RTP timestamp among the FEC source packets of a FEC source block
of a stream should be equal or close to the greatest RTP timestamp among the
FEC source packets of a FEC source block of any other stream of the same MBMS
streaming session.
When DIMS content is used, suitable media level recovery (a random access
point such as a replacement scene, redundant scene, etc.) should be present at
the beginning of each FEC source block. This facilitates immediate rendering
of the DIMS content after FEC decoding, thus reducing tune-in latency.
###### ## Annex E (informative): Void
###### ## Annex F (informative): Hybrid Streaming Delivery
# F.1 Introduction
In hybrid streaming delivery scenarios it is assumed that a set of streaming
services is available over MBMS and a set of streaming services is available
over PSS. MBMS services may not be available in some service areas, in which
cases those services might be alternatively provided via PSS.
Different switching cases between PSS and MBMS and vice versa may occur in
these scenarios, including user-initiated content switching with access change
as well as application-initiated access change. The latter can occur when a
service is available over MBMS in some service areas but not available over
MBMS in other service areas, assuming that the service is provided over PSS as
a fall-back.
This annex describes some methods to improve switching times in such hybrid
streaming delivery scenarios.
# F.2 Switching between MBMS and PSS Access
## F.2.1 Synchronization of Flows
For switching between MBMS and PSS access while receiving the same service,
comparing the SSRC values of the PSS and MBMS flows gives the UE an advantage
for synchronization onto the flows as described in sub-clause 8.5.
In order to allow for an as interruption-free access switch as possible, the
time offset between MBMS packet reception and PSS packet reception (including
MBMS FEC buffering and PSS retransmission delays) should be as small as
possible.
It is advantageous (but not always possible) that the same set of codecs is
used for representing the same service over both accesses. If the same media
bit rates are provided over both accesses, then at best the same media flows
(identical media encoding) are used for both accesses. This gives the UE an
advantage of being able to continuously using decoding buffers thus
simplifying seamless access switching. In case the codecs or codec
level/profiles change upon access switching, the UE needs to prepare a new set
of decoders and possibly having them run in parallel for a short period of
time.
## F.2.2 Switching from MBMS to PSS Access
Switching from MBMS to PSS can happen in two cases, user-initiated content
switch with access change and application-initiated access change.
  * User-initiated content switch with access change: The user requests reception of a service other than the one currently received over MBMS, and the new service is only available over PSS.
  * Application-initiated switch of access: The MBMS coverage is lost and alternative reception of the same service is possible over PSS.
The latter case may occur suddenly and without warning when the available
signal strength is no longer good enough for the MBMS reception. The UE may
identify the loss of MBMS access by signal strength measurements, detection of
packet losses exceeding a certain threshold, or that RTP reception has stopped
completely. As a result the UE may terminate the MBMS session and initiate
service reception over PSS instead.
In case MBMS coverage is lost and the corresponding PSS session is requested,
the UE may use PSS time-shifting (as defined in TS 26.234 [47]) for signalling
a PSS play-out start corresponding to the time instant the MBMS access was
lost, giving the advantage of synchronization of the received flows.
## F.2.3 Switching from PSS to MBMS Access
Switching from PSS to MBMS can happen in two cases, user-initiated content
switch with access change and application-initiated access change.
  * User-initiated content switch with access change: The user requests reception of a service other than the one currently received over PSS, and the new service is available over MBMS.
  * Application-initiated switch of access: The UE recognizes that MBMS reception of that service is alternatively possible (e.g. because MBMS reception was re-gained), such that the UE may terminate the PSS session and initiate reception over MBMS.
If the UE can receive both PSS and MBMS flows at the same time, and the time
offset between MBMS packet reception and PSS packet reception (including MBMS
FEC buffering and PSS retransmission delays) is small, and identical media
encoding is used, then application-initated access change from PSS to MBMS
without service change is possible to be made in such a way that it is
seamless.
###### ## Annex G (informative): Guidelines for Channel Tune-in and Switch
Time Reduction
This Annex describes some methods to improve channel tune-in and switching
times for MBMS Streaming when using the FEC framework. It presents means for
MBMS senders and receivers to minimize delay from a channel switch and initial
tune-in time. Fast startup improvements for the layers below IP are not
described here.
# G.1 Interleaving for Tune-in Time Reduction of FEC protected MBMS Services
Interleaving may be applied to source blocks before FEC encoding to re-arrange
the order of transmission of the UDP packets. The target of the interleaving
is to provide high priority and correctly decodeable media units in a way that
maximizes the resulting media duration at the receivers that tune in at that
specific source block. The interleaver may operate at two different levels:
  * Inter-stream interleaving: prioritize the media streams and arrange their transmission order according to the ascending order of priorities. In other words high priority data, e.g. audio data, is transmitted towards the end of the source block.
  * Intra-stream interleaving: high priority media data units such as Random Access Points of a video stream are transmitted towards the end of a source block.
The interleaving procedure enables receivers to reliably decode and present
media data that has been received from a fraction of the tune-in source block.
Interleaving is transparent to legacy receivers.
## G.1.1 Timestamp Offsets
The timestamp offset field may be used to signal a timestamp offset for the
received media units in the FEC block as specified in 8.2.3.2.
The timestamp offsets may be used to reconstruct the presentation time line at
the UE. They may also be used to reduce the out time caused by the reception
of a partially received interleaved FEC source block as shown in figure G.1.
{width="6.002083333333333in" height="2.765277777777778in"}
Figure G.1: Early tune-in using variable timestamps
## G.1.2 Early Playout
A UE that desires to make use of the interleaving to reduce the tune-in time
may start the playout earlier than dictated by the min-buffer-time value.
Instead, the UE may schedule the first media unit of the succeeding source
block to be played out after the min-buffer-time. It may then estimate the
appropriate time for starting early playout based on the amount of media
duration that was received from the current block, the playout time of the
earliest media unit of the next source block, and the highest presentation
time of the media units of the current source block.
The early playout behavior is depicted by the following figure.
Figure G.2: Early play out of interleaved media data of a FEC protected MBMS
service
# G.2 FEC Stream & Channel Bundling
## G.2.1 Introduction
FEC Stream bundling is a method of improving the FEC efficiency and also to
improve channel switching times. Several flows of one or more user services
are "bundled" to form the source blocks for the FEC calculations. . This
means, that all flows must be received for potential FEC recovery.
If flows from more than one user service are bundled (i.e. Channel Bundling),
then the receiver discards other services after FEC processing. When a switch
is performed, media inside the same bundle is immediately available. Stream
Bundling can be performed on whole channels, parts of channels, or not at all.
Note: FEC Bundling does not improve start-up times.
### G.2.1.1 Full Channel Bundling (All flows of several user services)
When full bundling is used, more than one complete channel is bundled. A
channel switch inside the bundle does not require rebuffering and can
therefore be near instantaneous. However, full bundling requires the
processing of all packets. In other words, at a single time instance all video
streams and all audio streams are received and processed. Also, the number of
channels possible is limited by the fixed bearer bandwidth.
### G.2.1.2 No Bundling
When no bundling is used, each channel is protected separately. In a channel
switch the new channel needs to be buffered for the full min-buffer-time. At a
single time instant one video stream and one audio stream is received and
processed.
### G.2.1.3 Partial Channel Bundling (Some flows of several user services)
Partial bundling may be used to combine some of the benefits of full bundling
and no bundling. In this case more than one parital channel is bundled. This
may be used to reduce the processing required on the terminal while retaining
fast channel switching between parts of the media.
Partial bundling may be used to bundle only the audio part of channels. In
other words, at a single time instance one video stream and all audio streams
are received. When a switch occurs the audio is switched instantaneously as it
does not need to be rebuffered. The complexity of this case is substantially
lower than full bundling and the number of channels which can be bundled given
a fixed bearer bandwidth is substantially increased. This is due to the fact
that the audio uses a substantially lower percentage of the bitrate compared
to video.
### G.2.1.3 Stream Bundling (All flows of a single user services)
When stream bundling is used, all flows of a single channel are bundled. The
FEC source block is formed using audio, video and security data.

_schemaVersion_ element, defined as a child of _bundleDescription_ element, to
1.
The schema _version_ attribute (part of the schema instruction) shall be
included in the UE schema and the network schema.
NOTE 1: The value of the _schemaVersion_ element and _version_ attribute is
intended to be increased by 1 in every future releases where new element(s) or
attribute(s) are added.
When a UE receives an instantiation of a USD compliant to this schema, it
shall determine the USD schema version required to parse the USD instantiation
as follows:
  * If the UE supports one or more versions of the USD schema with the schema _version_ attribute, then the UE shall use the USD schema that has the highest schema _version_ attribute value that is equal to or less than the value in the received _schemaVersion_ element;
  * Otherwise, if the UE supports a USD schema without a schema _version_ attribute, or all of its USD schemas with the _schema_ _version_ attribute have a value greater than the value received in the _schemaVersion_ element, then the UE shall use its USD schema without a _version_ attribute.
NOTE 2: To avoid a schema validation error (Unique Particle Attribution rule)
if an optional element from another namespace is specified just prior to the
_xs:any namespace=\"##other\"_ instructions (3 instances in the USD schema), a
_schemaVersion_ element is defined as the last child of the root element
(_bundleDescription_ element), and a _delimiter_ element is specified
preceding the 2 other occurrences of _xs:any_ instructions. These 2 elements
are defined in clause J.2, and the schema file name is "schema-version.xsd".
The file names associated to the USD schemas specified in sub-clause 11.2.1
are as follows:
  * Release 7 extension schema: USD-Rel-07-schema-snippet.xsd
  * Release 8 extension schema: USD-Rel-08-schema-snippet.xsd
  * Release 9 extension schema: USD-Rel-09-schema-snippet.xsd
The file name for the main USD schema (as defined below) is "USD-schema-
main.xsd".

# J.2 Version and Delimiter schema
This clause specifies the schema that is needed for the UE and the network
side for forward and backward compatibility, and is used by the following
schemas:
  * USD
  * Schedule Description
  * FDT
The schema defines 2 elements, _schemaVersion_ and _delimiter_. The value of
the _schemaVersion_ is specified separately for each of the schemas above. The
_delimiter_ element is specified in the various main schemas above to avoid
the schema validation error (due to the Unique Particle Attribution rule).
The _delimiter_ element shall be set by the network to a value of 0, and the
element content shall be ignored by the UE.
The file name used for this schema is "schema-version.xsd", and is used in the
various schemas above for the "import" instruction.
