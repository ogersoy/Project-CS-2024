# Introduction
This Report has been produced by ETSI SAGE Task Force for the design of the
GSM A5/3 and GEA3 encryption algorithms.
The work described in this report was undertaken in response to a request made
by Security Group GSM Association. The work was done under supervision of the
ETSI Mobile Competence Centre (MCC) and the GSM Association.
# 1 Scope
This Technical Report has been prepared by the ETSI SAGE GSM A5/3 Task Force,
and gives a detailed report on the design and evaluation of the A5/3
encryption algorithms for GSM and ECSD, and of the GEA3 encryption algorithm
for GPRS (including EGPRS).
