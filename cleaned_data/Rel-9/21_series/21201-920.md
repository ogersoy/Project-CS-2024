# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
_The present document identifies the 3GPP system specifications for Release 9.
The specifications and reports of 3GPP Release 8 have a major version number 9
(i.e. 9.x.y). The listed Specifications are required to build a system based
on the Evolved Packet System._
_The high-level architecture of such a system is defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [2]
(figure 1b)._
