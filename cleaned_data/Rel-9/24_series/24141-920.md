# 4 Presence service overview
The presence service provides the ability for the home network to manage
presence information of a user\'s device, service or service media even whilst
roaming. A user\'s presence information may be obtained through input from the
user, information supplied by network entities or information supplied by
elements external to the home network. Consumers of presence information,
watchers, may be internal or external to the home network. The architecture
for the 3GPP presence service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.141 [4].
SIP and XCAP provide means to manipulate the presence status of a user. For
details on the differences between those means refer to RFC 3903 [23] and RFC
4827 [34]. For details on the relationship of XCAP server to other roles see
subclause 6.2.2.
# 5 SIP related procedures
## 5.1 Introduction
## 5.2 Functional entities
### 5.2.1 User Equipment (UE)
A UE shall implement the role of a PUA (see subclause 5.3.1), a watcher (see
subclause 5.3.2) or both.
### 5.2.2 Application Server (AS)
An AS may implement one or more of the roles of a PUA (see subclause 5.3.1),
watcher (see subclause 5.3.2), PS (see subclause 5.3.3), RLS (see subclause
5.3.4), or PNA (see subclause 5.3.5).
## 5.3 Roles
### 5.3.1 Presence User Agent (PUA)
#### 5.3.1.1 General
A PUA is an entity that provides presence information to a PS.
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.1, the PUA shall
support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] appropriate to the
functional entity in which the PUA is implemented.
#### 5.3.1.2 Publication of presence information
When the PUA intends to publish its own view of the presentity\'s presence
information, it shall generate a PUBLISH request by acting as an Event
Publication Agent (EPA) in accordance with RFC 3903 [23].
NOTE 1: The contents of the presence event package containing the event state
of the EPA, and how such information is constructed, are outside the scope of
this version of the specification. However implementations will need to take
into account the reporting needs of the EPA, and also the needs of the EPA to
override information published by another EPA relating to the same presentity.
The PUA shall implement the \"application/pidf+xml\" content type as described
in RFC 3863 [21] ,the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) extensions
defined in RFC 4480 [26].
The PUA may implement the PIDF extensions defined in RFC 4482 [32].
The PUA may implement location information according to the format defined in
RFC 4119 [37].
NOTE 2: The categorization of presence attributes to generic information
attributes and communication address specific attributes is done using the
\ and \ elements as defined in RFC 4479 [44].
The PUA shall implement RFC 5196 [25] if it wants to make use of SIP user
agent capabilities in the presence document. The extension may be used for
describing the type of the service described by the presence tuple.
The PUA may implement RFC 5264 [45] if it wants to use the partial publication
mechanism. The first partial PUBLISH request shall contain the full state. The
PUA uses the \"application/pidf-diff+xml\" content type as described in RFC
5262 [38].
The PUA shall update the presence information, either 600 s before the
publication expiration time if the publication period indicated from the PS in
the response to the PUBLISH request was for greater than 1 200 s, or when half
of the time has expired if the publication period was for 1 200 s or less,
unless the PUA has determined that an update to the presence information is
not required.
When the PUA intends to show different value of the same presence attribute to
different watchers, the PUA shall publish a tuple or person element for every
value it intends to show, all including a different value of the same presence
attribute. The PUA shall label different information with different value of
the \ element in every published tuple or person element as defined in
RFC 4480 [26]. The PUA shall also authorize different tuples to different
watchers or watcher groups by manipulating the subscription authorization
policy as defined in subclause 6.3.1.2.
If a local configuration information limiting the rate at which PUA is allowed
to generate PUBLISH requests is available, then PUA shall take that
information into account. Such local configuration information could be e.g.
the shortest time period between consecutive PUBLISH requests.
#### 5.3.1.3 Mapping of presence attributes
The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema Definition of the
\"application/pidf+xml\" format covers the definition of the 3GPP
subscriber\'s presence attributes and the PUA shall perform the following
mapping:
\- _the communication address_ (containing _communication means, status and
contact address_) attribute and _the priority attribute are_ represented by a
\ element including a basic \ element and a \ elements
containing a priority attribute as defined in RFC 3863 [21].
_The PUA represents_ subscriber specific information by including a \
element defined in RFC 4479 [44]. The person element may contain e.g.
\ and \ elements both defined in RFC 4480 [26].
Further PIDF extensions as defined in RFC 4482 [32] can also be used.
NOTE 1: RFC 4479 [44] defines also a \ element which can be used to
present device specific information.
\- the text attribute is represented by the \ element as defined in RFC
3863 [21] for \ elements and in RFC 4479 [44] for \ and
\ elements; and
\- the location attribute is represented by the elements defined in RFC 4119
[37] and the \ element defined in RFC 4480 [26].
NOTE 2: Only information elements either relevant for the application or
recommended by the presence-data model RFC 4479 [44] are included in the
PUBLISH request. Attributes not relevant or available (e.g. the text attribute
or the location attribute) are omitted.
Additional extensions can be used to express application specific attributes,
but their usage is outside the scope of this version of the specification.
##### 5.3.1.4 Storing presence attributes by multipart/related or content
indirection
The PUA shall implement the \"multipart/related\" content type as described in
RFC 2387 [14] if it wants to aggregate other Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) objects with the \"application/pidf+xml\" content type.
When a presence attribute has a value of a MIME object, the PUA shall either:
a) publish the presence document and the MIME object utilizing the
\"multipart/related\" content-type in the PUBLISH request; or
b) make use of content indirection.
When the PUA decides to use the content indirection mechanism for publishing
an initial or modified value of a presence attribute the PUA shall follow the
following procedure:
a) either store the MIME object behind an HTTP URI on the PS or ensure that
the MIME object and a HTTP URL pointing to that MIME object already exists on
the PS;
b) use the \"multipart/related\" content type as described in RFC 2387 [14]
with the content indirection mechanism as specified in RFC 4483 [40] for the
publication of presence information format as follows:
\- set a CID URI referencing to other MIME multipart body. The other multipart
body contains the content indirection information which is represented as the
value of an XML element;
\- include the presence document of the format \"application/pidf+xml\" or
\"application/pidf-diff+xml\" in the root of the body of the
\"multipart/related\" content;
\- specify the part having information about the MIME object by using the
\"message/external-body\" content type, defining the HTTP URI, versioning
information and other information about the MIME object as described in RFC
4483 [40].
NOTE 1: The versioning information is used for determining whether or not the
MIME object indirectly referenced by a URI has changed or not;
When storing a MIME object on the PS the PUA shall:
a) construct as many HTTP URIs as the number of objects to be stored; and
b) formulate every HTTP URI according to a predefined directory structure.
NOTE 2: The PUA has the root directory for storing the MIME objects on the PS
preconfigured.
NOTE 3: The PUA needs to store the MIME objects on the PS behind the HTTP
URI(s) created previously using standard HTTP procedures as defined in RFC
2616 [15].
#### 5.3.1.5 Subscription for the watcher information event template package
Upon activation of the presence service, the PUA application may subscribe for
the watcher information state changes in accordance with RFC 3857 [28] and RFC
3858 [29].
The PUA application may include filters in the body of the SUBSCRIBE request
in accordance with RFC 4661 [30] and RFC 4660 [31].
#### 5.3.1.6 Subscription for notification of state changes in XML document
In order to get notifications of changes to XML documents manipulated via the
Ut reference point the PUA may generate a SUBSCRIBE request in accordance with
RFC 5875 [43].
### 5.3.2 Watcher
#### 5.3.2.1 General
A watcher is an entity that subscribes to or requests presence information
about a presentity from the PS.
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.2, the watcher shall
support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] appropriate to the
functional entity in which the watcher is implemented.
#### 5.3.2.2 Subscription for presence information state changes and
notification acceptance
When the watcher intends to subscribe for presence information state changes
of a presentity, it shall generate a SUBSCRIBE request in accordance with RFC
3265 [19] and RFC 3856 [27].
The watcher shall implement the \"application/pidf+xml\" content type as
described in RFC 3863 [21] , the PIDF extensions defined in RFC 4480 [26].
The watcher may implement the PIDF extensions defined in RFC 4482 [32].
The watcher may implement location information according to the format defined
in RFC 4119 [37].
The watcher shall implement RFC 5196 [25] if it wants to make use of SIP user
agent capabilities extensions included in the presence document. The extension
may be used by the watcher for interpreting the type of the service described
by the presence tuple.
The watcher may include filters in the body of the SUBSCRIBE request in
accordance with RFC 4661 [30] and RFC 4660 [31].
The watcher may indicate its support for partial notification using the Accept
header field in accordance with RFC 5263 [24].
The watcher shall interpret the received presence information according to RFC
4479 [44] and the following:
a) a \ element as defined in RFC 4479 [44] means information about the
presentity;
b) a tuple including a \ element defined in RFC 4480 [26] means
information about an alternate contact to the presentity;
c) a tuple contains communication means specific information. The
communication means described by the tuple is deduced from the URI scheme of
the contact address information present in the \ element as defined
in RFC 3863 [21]. If the URI scheme of the contact address information
provides ambiguous information about the communication means, the watcher
shall further examine other elements of the tuple to decide the communication
mean. Such elements can be the \ element, any of the different media
type specific elements as defined in RFC 5196 [25].
d) a \ element as defined in RFC 4479 [44] means information about a
device.
Additional extensions can be used to express application specific attributes,
but their usage is outside the scope of this version of the specification.
#### 5.3.2.3 Subscription for presence information state changes of presentity
collections
When the watcher intends to subscribe for presence information state changes
of a presentity collection, it shall generate a SUBSCRIBE request in
accordance with RFC 4662 [22], additionally to the procedures described in
subclause 5.3.2.2.
#### 5.3.2.4 Subscription for the watcher information event template package
Upon activation of the presence service, the watcher may subscribe recursively
for the watcher information state changes in accordance with RFC 3857 [28] and
RFC 3858 [29].
The watcher may include filters in the body of the SUBSCRIBE request in
accordance with RFC 4661 [30] and RFC 4660 [31].
#### 5.3.2.5 Subscription for notification of state changes in XML document
In order to get notifications of changes to XML documents manipulated via the
Ut reference point the watcher may generate a SUBSCRIBE request in accordance
with RFC 5875 [43].
### 5.3.3 Presence Server (PS)
#### 5.3.3.1 General
A PS is an entity that accepts, stores, and distributes presence information.
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.3, the PS shall
support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] appropriate to the
functional entity in which the PS is implemented.
#### 5.3.3.2 Subscription acceptance to presence information and notification
of state changes
When the PS receives a SUBSCRIBE request for the presence information event
package, the PS shall first attempt to verify the identity of the source of
the SUBSCRIBE request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.4,
then perform authorization according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.5.
In case of successful subscription, the PS shall generate a response to the
SUBSCRIBE request and notifications in accordance with RFC 3265 [19] and RFC
3586 [27].
Additionally, in the special case of a watcher subscription if the
subscription authorization policy results in the action to confirm the watcher
subscription from the PUA and the PUA has a valid watcher information
subscription, see RFC 3857 [28], then, the PS shall inform the PUA about the
watcher subscription attempt.
If the watcher has indicated the need for partial notification using the
Accept header field, then the PS shall generate partial notifications in
accordance with RFC 5263 [24] and RFC 5262 [38].
If the body of the SUBSCRIBE request from the watcher contains filters, the PS
shall apply the requested filtering function on notifications in accordance
with RFC 4661 [30] and RFC 4660 [31].
If the watcher has indicated support for the \"multipart/related\" content
type using the Accept header field, then the PS may generate notifications
using \"multipart/related\" content type which aggregates
\"application/pidf+xml\" formatted presence information with other MIME
objects in accordance with RFC 2387 [14]. In this case, the PS shall modify
the value of the presence attribute in the PIDF document to refer to the MIME
object included in the corresponding MIME multipart body. If the watcher has
not indicated support for the \"multipart/related\" or a MIME object cannot be
accessed by the PS, the PS should exclude the presence attribute from the
notification.
NOTE: How the PS takes presence information from various presence sources, in
order to generate a final presence document, is outside the scope of this
version of the specification. Implementations need a flexible approach to
composition policy and therefore to the collection, filtering and composition
of presence documents.
#### 5.3.3.3 Publication acceptance of presence information
The PS shall act as an Event State Compositor (ESC).
When the PS receives a PUBLISH request, the PS shall first verify the identity
of the source of the PUBLISH request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9]
subclause 5.7.1.4, then perform authorization according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [9]
subclause 5.7.1.5. In case of successful authentication and authorization, the
PS shall process the PUBLISH request in accordance with RFC 3903 [23].
If the PUBLISH request contains the \"application/pidf-diff+xml\" content-type
as described in RFC 5262 [38], the PS shall process the PUBLISH request in
accordance with RFC 3903 [23] and RFC 5264 [45].
If the PUBLISH request contains the \"multipart/related\" content type and the
PS supports the content type, the PS shall process the content as follows:
\- if a MIME multipart contains a MIME object of a content type supported by
the PS, either store the MIME object in case of initial publication or replace
an existing content in case of modify operation; and
\- if a multipart includes the \"message/external-body\" content type and the
content indirection as described in RFC 4483 [40] is supported by the PS,
ensure that it has access to the MIME object indicated by the URI and that the
MIME object exists; and associate the value of the presence attribute that
refers to the MIME object with the MIME object and additional information
about it.
If the PS does not support the content type used for publishing MIME objects
then the PS shall send a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response and indicate
the supported content types in the Accept header.
NOTE: If the PS receives a HTTP request for storing a MIME object on the PS
,meaning that the HTTP URI points to a predefined directory reserved for
storing MIME objects and the request is an HTTP PUT request, the PS replaces
any existing content referenced by the Request-URI with the content of the
request. If the Request-URI points to an uncreated directory, the PS creates
the directory, stores the content there and associates the content with the
Request-URI. For all requests, i.e. HTTP PUT, HTTP GET and HTTP DELETE
requests, the PS generates an appropriate response in accordance with RFC 2616
[15].
To receive 3GPP2 IP-CAN network presence information from the PNA, the PS
shall support the XML extension defined in 3GPP2 X.S0027-004 [46].
#### 5.3.3.4 Subscription acceptance to watcher information and notification
of state changes
When the PS receives a SUBCRIBE request for the watcher information event
template package, the PS shall first verify the identity of the source of the
SUBSCRIBE request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.4, then
perform authorization according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.5. In
case of successful subscription, the PS shall generate a response to the
SUBSCRIBE request and notifications in accordance with RFC 3265 [19], RFC 3857
[28] and RFC 3858 [29].
If the body of the SUBSCRIBE request from the PUA contains filters, the PS
shall apply the requested filtering function on notifications in accordance
with RFC 4661 [30] and RFC 4660 [31].
#### 5.3.3.5 Subscription acceptance and notification of state changes in XML
document
When the PS receives a SUBSCRIBE request having the Event header value \"xcap-
diff\", the PS shall first verify the identity of the source of the SUBSCRIBE
request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.4, then it shall
perform authorization as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.5.
Afterwards, the PS shall generate a response to the SUBSCRIBE request and
notifications in accordance with RFC 5875 [43].
### 5.3.4 Resource List Server (RLS)
#### 5.3.4.1 General
The Resource List Server (RLS) is an implementation of the presence list
server. The RLS is an entity that accepts subscriptions to resource lists and
sends notifications to update subscribers of the state of the resources in a
resource list.
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.4, the RLS shall
support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] appropriate for an AS
in which the RLS is implemented.
#### 5.3.4.2 Subscription acceptance to resource lists and notification of
state changes
When the RLS receives a SUBSCRIBE request for the presence information event
package of a presentity collection, the RLS shall first verify the identity of
the source of the SUBSCRIBE request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9]
subclause 5.7.1.4, then perform authorization according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [9]
subclause 5.7.1.5. In case of successful subscription, the RLS shall generate
a response to the SUBSCRIBE request and notifications in accordance with RFC
4662 [22] by adding a Require header field with value \"eventlist\".
If the body of the SUBSCRIBE request from the watcher contains filters, the
RLS shall apply the requested filtering function on notifications in
accordance with RFC 4661 [30] and RFC 4660 [31].
#### 5.3.4.3 Subscription to presence information
When the RLS receives a SUBSCRIBE request for the presence information event
package of a presentity collection and installs the corresponding
subscription, the RLS shall resolve the list URI to individual URIs and
generate SUBSCRIBE requests for each of the individual URIs as per the
procedures in RFC 3265 [19], RFC 3856 [27] and RFC 4662 [22] if the state
information for the resource represented by the individual URI is otherwise
not available.
For internal virtual subscriptions, the detection of loops potentially caused
by lists of lists is possible in RLS. However for back-end subscriptions (see
RFC 4662 [22]), the detection of such situations is not possible in RLS. To
prevent loops in subscriptions to non-local resources the RLS shall not insert
\"eventlist\" in the \"Supported\" header of back-end subscriptions.
#### 5.3.4.4 Subscription acceptance and notification of state changes in XML
document
When the RLS receives a SUBSCRIBE request having the Event header value
\"xcap-diff\", the RLS shall first verify the identity of the source of the
SUBSCRIBE request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.4, then
it shall perform authorization as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause
5.7.1.5. Afterwards, the RLS shall generate a response to the SUBSCRIBE
request and notifications in accordance with RFC 5875 [43].
### 5.3.5 Presence Network Agent (PNA)
#### 5.3.5.1 General
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.5, the PNA shall
support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] appropriate to the
functional entity in which the PNA is implemented.
The PNA can collect presence information about the presentity from a number of
core network entities. The PNA can combine information from various core
network entities to form more complete presence information.
Among these core network entities, the S-CSCF uses SIP to deliver presence
information to the PNA over the Pi reference point as specified in subclause
5.3.5.2.
NOTE: As part of the configuration of AS to provide a presence system,
appropriate settings are downloaded to the initial filter criteria in the
S-CSCF to ensure this occurs. The PNA will receive third-party REGISTER
requests as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclauses 5.4.1.7 and 5.7.1.1.
#### 5.3.5.2 Subscription to reg event package
On receiving a third-party REGISTER request which contains an Expires header
with a non-zero value, the PNA shall, if no subscription already exists,
subscribe to the reg event package for a particular user at the S-CSCF, as
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.1. As a result, the S-CSCF
will then provide the presence-related information as reg event packages in
NOTIFY requests to the PNA.
On receiving a third-party REGISTER request, the PNA may, if a subscription
already exists, resubscribe to the reg event package for a particular user at
the S-CSCF, as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9] subclause 5.7.1.1. As a result,
the S-CSCF will then provide the presence-related information as reg event
packages in NOTIFY requests to the PNA.
#### 5.3.5.3 Publication of network presence information
To publish network presence information received from 3GPP2 IP-CAN, the PNA
shall follow the procedures defined in 3GPP2 X.S0027-004 [46].
# 6 Protocol for data manipulation at the Ut reference point
## 6.1 Introduction
XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) is used to store, alter and delete
data related to the presence service. XCAP is designed according to the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) framework, and uses the HTTP methods PUT,
GET and DELETE for communication over the Ut reference point. The general
information that can be manipulated is user groups, subscription authorization
policy, resource lists, hard state presence publication, MIME objects
referenced from the hard state presence information, etc. Soft state presence
information manipulated with a PUBLISH request is not manipulated by the
mechanism provided over the Ut reference point.
## 6.2 Functional entities
### 6.2.1 User Equipment (UE)
The UE implements the XCAP client role as described in subclause 6.3.1.
For accessing presence servers in 3GPP system:
1) The UE shall implement HTTP digest AKA (see RFC 3310 [20]) and it shall
initiate a bootstrapping procedure with the bootstrapping server function
located in the home network, as described in 3GPP TS 24.109 [7].
2) The UE shall acquire the subscriber\'s certificate from PKI portal by using
a bootstrapping procedure, as described in 3GPP TS 24.109 [7];
3) The UE shall implement HTTP digest authentication (see RFC 2617 [15A]); and
4) The UE shall implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) (see RFC 2246 [13]).
The UE shall be able to authenticate the network application function based on
the received certificate during TLS handshaking phase.
For accessing presence servers in 3GPP2 system, the subscriber shall be
authenticated by the presence server. subscriber authentication may be
performed by the operator using proprietary or non-3G standardized methods.
GBA defined in 3GPP2 S.S0109 [48] may also be used. If GBA based subscriber
authentication is used, then the following shall apply:
1) The UE shall implement bootsrapping procedures as specified in 3GPP2
S.S0109 [48]; and
2) The UE shall implement TLS with pre-shared keys method specified in clause
5 of 3GPP2 S.S0114 [49].
### 6.2.2 Application Server (AS)
If an AS implements the role of a PS (see subclause 5.3.3) or of a RLS (see
subclause 5.3.4), then the AS shall also implement the role of a XCAP server
(see subclause 6.3.2).
If there is no authentication proxy in the network, then the AS in 3GPP system
shall:
1) implement the role of a network application function, as described in 3GPP
TS 24.109 [7];
2) implement TLS (see RFC 2246 [13]);
3) implement HTTP digest authentication (see RFC 2617 [15A]); and
4) support certificate authentication.
For 3GPP2 system, the authentication proxy does not apply. If GBA based
authentication is used by an AS in 3GPP2 system, then the AS shall:
1) implement the role of a network application function, as described in 3GPP2
S.S0114 [49]; and
2) implement TLS with pre-shared keys method specified in clause 5 of 3GPP2
S.S0114 [49].
### 6.2.3 Authentication proxy
For 3GPP2 system, this subclause does not apply.
The generic requirements for an authentication proxy are defined in 3GPP TS
24.109 [7].
In addition an authentication proxy acting within the scope of presence shall:
1) verify the content of the \"X-3GPP-Intended-Identity\" header in case it is
available in HTTP requests; and
2) indicate an asserted identity of the user in the \"X-3GPP-Asserted-
Identity\" header in HTTP requests sent to the AS.
## 6.3 Roles
### 6.3.1 XCAP client
#### 6.3.1.1 Introduction
The XCAP client is a logical function as defined in RFC 4825 [33]. The XCAP
client provides the means to manipulate the data such as user groups,
subscription authorization policy, resource lists, hard state presence
infromation, MIME objects referenced from the hard state presence information,
etc.
NOTE: In order to be able to manipulate data stored on the XCAP server, the
XCAP client has the root directory on the XCAP server pre‑configured or uses
some means to discover it. Discovery mechanisms are outside the scope of the
present document.
#### 6.3.1.2 Manipulating a resource list
When the XCAP client intends to manipulate a resource list, it shall generate
an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request in accordance with RFC 2616 [15],
RFC 4825 [33] and RFC 4826 [36].
#### 6.3.1.3 Manipulating the subscription authorization policy
When the XCAP client intends to manipulate the subscription authorization
policy, it shall generate an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request in
accordance with RFC 2616 [15], RFC 4825 [33], RFC 4745 [35A], and RFC 5025
[35].
When the XCAP client intends to authorize particular watchers or watcher
groups, the XCAP client shall authorize those watchers in \ and \
child elements of the \ element as specified in RFC 4745 [35A].
When the XCAP client intends to time-restrict presence attributes, the XCAP
client shall define time periods in \ elements as specified in RFC
4745 [35A].
When the XCAP client intends to provide certain presence attributes to
particular watchers or watcher groups and not others, the XCAP client shall
permit those presence attributes in the \ element as
specified in RFC 5025 [35].
When the XCAP client intends to authorize providing a particular presence
attribute to different watchers or watcher groups depending on the value of
that attribute, the XCAP client shall specify those attribute values in the
\ element as specified in RFC 5025 [35].
#### 6.3.1.4 Publishing hard state presence information
The XCAP client shall implement RFC 4827 [34] in order to be able to
manipulate hard state presence information. Hard state presence information
uses the same format as soft state information, namely
\"application/pidf+xml\" content type as described in RFC 3863 [21] together
with any of its extensions.
When the hard state presence information contains one or more MIME objects to
be aggregated with the \"application/pidf+xml\" content type and any of its
extensions, the XCAP client shall:
a) construct as many HTTP URIs as the number of objects to be stored and
formulate every HTTP URI according to a predefined directory structure;
NOTE: In order to be able to manipulate data stored on the XCAP server, the
XCAP client has the root directory on the XCAP server pre-configured or use
some means to discover it. Discovery mechanisms are outside the scope of the
present document.
b) store the objects on the XCAP server behind the HTTP URI(s) created in the
previous step using standard HTTP procedures as defined in RFC 2616 [15];
c) include every HTTP URI as a value of the corresponding XML element in the
published \"application/pidf+xml\" presence document referencing the stored
object(s) in the previous step; and
d) publish the hard state presence information according to RFC 4827 [34].
### 6.3.2 XCAP server
#### 6.3.2.1 Introduction
The XCAP server is a logical function as defined in RFC 4825 [33]. The XCAP
server can store data such as user groups, subscription authorization policy,
resource lists, hard state presence information, MIME objects referenced from
the hard state presence information, etc.
#### 6.3.2.2 Resource list manipulation acceptance
When the XCAP server receives an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request for
manipulating or fetching a resource list, the XCAP server shall first
authenticate the request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.109 [7] and then
perform authorization. Afterwards the XCAP server shall perform the requested
action and generate a response in accordance with RFC 2616 [15], RFC 4825 [33]
and RFC 4826 [36].
#### 6.3.2.3 Subscription authorization policy manipulation acceptance
When the XCAP server receives an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request for
manipulating or fetching of the subscription authorization policy, the XCAP
server shall first authenticate the request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.109
[7] and then perform authorization. Afterwards the XCAP server shall perform
the requested action and generate a response in accordance with RFC 2616 [15],
RFC 4825 [33], RFC 4745 [35A], and RFC 5025 [35].
#### 6.3.2.4 Publication acceptance of hard state presence information
When the XCAP server receives an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request for
publishing, fetching or deleting of hard state presence information, the XCAP
server shall first authenticate the request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.109
[7] and then perform authorization. Afterwards the XCAP server shall:
a) if the HTTP URI points to a predefined directory reserved for storing MIME
objects and the request is an HTTP PUT request, replace any existing content
referenced by the Request-URI with the content of the request;
b) if the Request-URI points to an uncreated directory and the request is HTTP
PUT, create the directory, store the content there and associate the content
with the Request-URI. For all requests, i.e. HTTP PUT, HTTP GET and HTTP
DELETE requests, generate an appropriate response in accordance with RFC 2616
[15]; or
c) if the HTTP URI points to an XCAP directory and the Application Unique ID
(AUID) part of the HTTP URI is set to \"pidf-manipulation\", process the
request and generate an appropriate response in accordance with RFC 4825 [33],
RFC 4827 [34] and RFC 2616 [15].

###### ## Annex A (informative): Example signalling flows of presence service
operation
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for the presence service within
the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based on the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and SIP Events.
These signalling flows provide detailed signalling flows, which expand on the
overview information flows provided in 3GPP TS 23.141 [4].
# A.2 Introduction
## A.2.1 General
The signalling flows provided in this annex follow the methodology developed
in 3GPP TS 24.228 [8]. The following additional considerations apply:
a) 3GPP TS 24.228 [8] shows separate signalling flows with no configuration
hiding between networks, and with configuration hiding between networks. There
is no presence specific functionality associated with this hiding, and
therefore such separate signalling flows are not show in the present document;
and
b) 3GPP TS 24.228 [8] does not show the functionality between the S-CSCF and
the AS. As the presence service depends on the functionality provided by
various AS, the signalling flows between S-CSCF and AS are shown in the
present document.
## A.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 [8]
subclauses 4.1 and 4.2 applies with the additions specified below.
  * rls.home1.net: an RLS in the home network of the watcher;
  * rls.home2.net: an RLS in the home network of the service provider, > but not the home network of the watcher;
  * ps.home1.net: a PS in the home network of the publisher;
  * ps.home2.net: a PS in the home network of the service provider, but > not in that of the watcher;
  * user1_list1\@home1.net: a resource list being subscribed to on a > RLS in the home network;
  * user2_list1\@home2.net: a resource list being subscribed to on a > RLS in the home network of the service provider, but not the home > network of the subscriber;
  * user1_public1\@home1.net: presentity being watched, own watcher > list;
  * user3_public1\@home3.net: presentity being watched.
As in 3GPP TS 24.228 [8], in order to differentiate between SIP methods and
other protocol messages, the message name is preceded with the associated
protocol for all non-SIP messages. Where the XCAP is used to map an HTTP URI
to an XML document, the protocol name \"XCAP\" is used for both the HTTP
request and HTTP response.
Each signalling flow table contains descriptions for headers where the content
of the header is new to that signalling flow, as is already performed in 3GPP
TS 24.228 [8].
However, 3GPP TS 24.228 [8] includes extensive descriptions for the contents
of various headers following each of the tables representing the contents of
the signalling flows. Where the operation of the header is identical to that
shown in 3GPP TS 24.228 [8], then such text is not reproduced in the present
document.
Additional text may also be found on the contents of headers within 3GPP TS
24.228 [8] in addition to the material shown in the present document.
# A.3 Signalling flows demonstrating how watchers subscribe to presence event
notification
## A.3.1 Introduction
The subclause covers the signalling flows that show how watchers can request
presence information about a presentity.
For the routing of the Public Service Identity (PSI) towards the AS, there are
two scenarios:
Subclause A.3.3.2 shows the case where the I-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE
request directly to the RLS when the RLS is located within the same network.
There is another scenario where the I-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request
towards the RLS, being involved with the S-CSCF located in the same network,
but this scenario is not described in the present document.
## A.3.2 Watcher and presentity in different networks, UE in home network
### A.3.2.1 Successful subscription
{width="6.497916666666667in" height="5.786111111111111in"}
Figure A.3.2.1-1: Watcher subscribing for presence information
Figure A.3.2.1-1 shows a watcher subscribing to presence event notification
about a presentity. The presentity is in a different IM CN subsystem. The
details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (UE (watcher) to P-CSCF) - see example in table
> A.3.2.1-1**
A watcher agent in a UE wishes to watch a presentity, or certain presence
information of the presentity. To initiate a subscription, the UE generates a
SUBSCRIBE request containing the \"presence\" event that it wishes to be
notified of, together with an indication of the length of time this periodic
subscription should last and the support for partial notification.

**Request-URI:** Public user identity whose events the subscriber subscribes
to.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence\" to specify the
use of the presence package.
**Accept:** This field is populated with the value \'application/pidf+xml\'
and \'application/pidf-diff+xml\', latter one with higher preference.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
> 2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table
> A.3.2.1-2**
The P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user
identity that was stored during the registration procedure. The SUBSCRIBE
request is forwarded to S-CSCF. A Route header is inserted into SUBSCRIBE
request. The information for the Route header is taken from the service route
determined during registration.

> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#1 validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. In this example, no AS is assumed to be involved.
> 4\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to I-CSCF) - see example in table
> A.3.2.1-4**
S-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the
network operator to whom the destination subscriber belongs. Since the
originating operator does not desire to keep their internal configuration
hidden, S-CSCF#1 forwards the SUBSCRIBE request directly to the I-CSCF in the
destination network.

The I-CSCF sends a query to the HSS to find out the S-CSCF of the called user.
The HSS responds with the address of the current S-CSCF for the terminating
subscriber.
For detailed message flows see 3GPP TS 29.228 [10].
Table A.3.2.1-5a provides the parameters in the SIP SUBSCRIBE request (flow
4), which are sent to the HSS.

NOTE: The I-CSCF does not add itself to the Record-Route header, as it has no
need to remain in the signalling path for the subsequent requests.
> 7\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#2 validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For sip:user2_public1\@home2.net S-CSCF#2 has
termination initial filter criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method =
SUBSCRIBE and Event = \"presence\" that informs the S-CSCF to route the
SUBSCRIBE request to the AS ps.home2.net. The S-CSCF#2 has preconfigured
information not to create a Record-Route entry for this request.
> 8\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to PS) -- see example in table A.3.2.1-8**
The S-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to the PS.

> 9\. **Authorization of watcher**
The PS performs the necessary authorization checks on the originator to ensure
it is allowed to watch the presentity. In this example all privacy conditions
are met, so the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to the S‑CSCF.
In the case where the privacy/authorization checks failes, then a necessary
2xx or 4xx response will be sent to the S-CSCF. The selection of the correct
response code depends on the presentity\'s subscription authorization policy
document.
> 10\. **200 (OK) response (PS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.2.1-10**

As soon as the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to accept the subscription, it
sends a NOTIFY request with the current state of the presentity\'s presence
information that the watcher has subscribed and been authorized to. The NOTIFY
request is sent to S-CSCF#1. Based on the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE
request, the PS decides to use partial notification to provide changes of

## A.3.3 Watcher subscribing to resource list, UE in visited network
### A.3.3.1 Watcher subscribing to his own resource list, UE in visited
network - Successful subscription
Figure A.3.3.1-1: Watcher subscribing to resource list
Figure A.3.3.1-1 shows a watcher subscribing to resource list event
notification. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (UE to P-CSCF) -- see example in table A.3.3.1-1**
A watcher agent in a UE wishes to watch a number of presentities, or certain
presence information of these presentities. The list of presentities are
identified by a SIP URI. In order to initiate a subscription to the RLS, the
UE generates a SUBSCRIBE request indicating support for \"eventlist\",
together with an indication of the length of time this periodic subscription
should last.

**Request-URI:** SIP URI of the resource list representing the collection of
public user identities whose events the subscriber subscribes to.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence\" to specify the
use of the presence package.
**Accept:** This field is populated with the value \"application/pidf+xml\",
\"application/rlmi+xml\" and \"multipart/related\" indicating that the UE
supports both body types for the eventlist extension additionally to PIDF.
**Supported:** This field is populated with the value \"eventlist\" to specify
the support for the eventlist extension.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
> 2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) -- see example in table
> A.3.3.1-2**
The P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user
identity that was stored during the registration procedure. The SUBSCRIBE
request is forwarded to S-CSCF#1. A Route header is inserted into SUBSCRIBE
request. The information for the Route header is taken from the service route
determined during registration.

> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. Assuming that sip:user1_list1\@home1.net is a
statically created PSI, sip:user1_list1\@home1.net is included in the service
profile as part of an originating initial Filter Criteria with Service Trigger
Point of Method = SUBSCRIBE AND Supported = \"eventlist\" AND Request-URI =
sip:user1_list1\@home1.net that informs the S-CSCF to route the SUBSCRIBE
request to the AS sip:rls.home1.net.
If there is no initial filter criteria for this PSI
(sip:user1_list1\@home1.net), the assumption is that the PSI is a sub domain-
based PSI. The procedure defined in RFC 3263 [18] with DNS NAPTR and SRV
queries may then be used to get the IP address of the AS home1.net.
> 4\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to RLS) -- see example in table A.3.3.1-4**
The S-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to the RLS.

>
> 5\. **Authorization of watcher**
The RLS performs the necessary authorization checks on the originator to
ensure that he/she is authorized to use the resource list. In this example
this condition has been met, so the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to the
S-CSCF. If the previous condition failed, then a 403 (Forbidden) response
would be sent to the S-CSCF.
> 6\. **200 (OK) response (RLS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.3.1-6**

> 15\. **Subscriptions and notifications on presence event package**
After the RLS generated a NOTIFY request to inform the UE about the
subscription state, the RLS generates the necessary SUBSCRIBE requests to the
presentities present in the resource list as described in subclause A.3.4.1.
As soon as it receives NOTIFY request(s) about a state change in one or more
presentities, it generates a NOTIFY request.
> 16\. **NOTIFY request (RLS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.3.3.1-16**
The RLS copies the body of the incoming NOTIFY request(s) into the body of the
outgoing NOTIFY request using MIME type multipart/related. Further
notification sent by the RLS may contain either the full or the partial set of
presence information (only the presence information that has changed since the
last notification) as described in RFC 4662 [22].
In this example it is assumed that the RLS has received two NOTIFY requests
from presentities sip:user2_public1\@home2.net and
sip:user3_public1\@home3.net before generating the NOTIFY request in table
A.3.3.1-16 to the UE.

### A.3.3.2 Watcher subscribing to a resource list, UE in visited network -
successful subscription
Figure A.3.3.2-1 Watcher subscribing to resource list
Figure A.3.3.2-1 shows a watcher subscribing to resource list event
notification. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (UE to P-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.3.2-1**
A watcher agent in a UE wishes to watch a number of presentities, or certain
presence information of these presentities. The list of presentities are
identified by a SIP URI. In order to initiate a subscription to the RLS, the
UE generates a SUBSCRIBE request indicating support for \"eventlist\",
together with an indication of the length of time this periodic subscription
should last.

**Request-URI:** SIP URI of the resource list representing the collection of
public user identities whose events the subscriber subscribes to.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence\" to specify the
use of the presence package.
**Accept:** This field is populated with the value \"application/pidf+xml\",
\"application/rlmi+xml\" and \"multipart/related\" indicating that the UE
supports the eventlist extension additionally to PIDF.
**Supported:** This field is populated with the value \"eventlist\" to specify
the support for the eventlist extension.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
> 2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table
> A.3.3.2-2**
The P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user
identity that was stored during the registration procedure. The SUBSCRIBE
request is forwarded to S-CSCF#1. A Route header is inserted into SUBSCRIBE
request. The information for the Route header is taken from the service route
determined during registration.

> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#1 validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. In this example, no AS is assumed to be involved.
> 4\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to I-CSCF) - see example in table
> A.3.3.2-4**
S-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address. As the destination
address points to a resource that is in a different network as the S-CSCF, the
S-CSCF sends the request to the I-CSCF of home2.net.

> 5\. **PSI location query**
The I-CSCF sends a query to the HSS to find the RLS where
sip:user2_list1\@home2.net is hosted. The HSS responds with the address of the
RLS.
For detailed message flows see 3GPP TS 29.228 [10].
Table A.3.3.2-5a provides the parameters in the SIP SUBSCRIBE request (flow
4), which are sent to the HSS.

> 7\. **Authorization of watcher**
The RLS performs the necessary authorization checks on the originator to
ensure that he/she is authorized to use the resource list. In this example
this condition has been met, so the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to the
S-CSCF. If the previous condition failed, then a 403 (Forbidden) response
would be sent to the S-CSCF.
> 8\. **200 (OK) response (RLS to I-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.3.2-8**

> 18\. **Subscriptions and notifications on presence event package**
After the RLS generated a 200 (OK) response to the SUBSCRIBE request from the
UE, it generates the necessary SUBSCRIBE requests to the presentities present
in the resource list as described in subclause A.3.4.1. As soon as it receives
NOTIFY request(s) about a state change in one or more presentities, it
generates a NOTIFY request.
> 19\. **NOTIFY request (RLS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.3.3.2-19**
The RLS copies the body of the incoming NOTIFY request(s) into the body of the
outgoing NOTIFY request using MIME type multipart/related. Further
notification sent by the RLS contain may contain either the full or the
partial set of presence information (only the presence information that has
changed since the last notification) as described in RFC 4662 [22].
In this example it is assumed that the RLS receives two NOTIFY requests from
presentities sip:user2_public1\@home2.net and sip:user3_public1\@home3.net
before generating the NOTIFY request in subclause A.3.3.2-23 to the UE.

## A.3.4 RLS subscribing to presentities in different network
### A.3.4.1 Successful subscription
Figure A.3.4.1-1 RLS subscribing to presentities in different network
Figure A.3.4.1-1 shows the RLS subscribing to presence event notification
about a presentity. The presentity is in a different IM CN subsystem. The
details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (RLS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.3.4.1-1**
The RLS resolves the watcher\'s resource address (the address is received
according to subclause A.3.3) and subscribes to presence event notification at
all the presentities that are represented by the resource list SIP URI. The
home network of these presentities can be different or in the same network, as
the RLS. In this example only a single subscription is shown where the home
network of the presentity is another network. Subscriptions to other
presentities follow a similar procedure. To initiate a subscription, the RLS
generates a SUBSCRIBE request containing the \"presence\" event that it wishes
to be notified of, together with an indication of the length of time this
periodic subscription should last. The RLS sends the SUBSCRIBE request to the
S-CSCF of \"sip:user1_public1\@home1.net\" (S-CSCF#1). The address of S-CSCF#1
is either remembered from previous transactions (when
\"sip:user1_public1\@home1.net\" has subscribed for the resource list) or
queried by the RLS using the Sh interface.

> 2\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#1 validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. In this example, no AS is assumed to be involved.
> 3\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to I-CSCF) -- see example in table
> A.3.4.1-3**
S-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the
network operator to whom the destination subscriber belongs. S-CSCF#1 forwards
the request to the I-CSCF.

> 4\. **Cx: User Location Query procedure**
The I-CSCF sends a query to the HSS to find out the S-CSCF of the presentity.
The HSS responds with the address of the current S-CSCF for the presentity.
For detailed message flows see 3GPP TS 29.228 [10].
Table A.3.4.1-4a provides the parameters in the SIP SUBSCRIBE request (flow
3), which are sent to the HSS.

> 6\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#2 validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For sip:user2_public1\@home2.net the S-CSCF has
Termination initial Filter Criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method =
SUBSCRIBE AND Event = \"presence\" that informs the S-CSCF to route the
SUBSCRIBE request to the AS ps.home2.net. The S-CSCF#2 has preconfigured
information not to create a Record-Route entry for this request.
> 7\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to PS) - see example in table A.3.4.1-7**
The S-CSCF#2 forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to the PS.

> 8\. **Authorization of watcher**
The PS performs the necessary authorization checks on the originator to ensure
it is allowed to watch the presentity. In this example all privacy conditions
are met, so the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to the S‑CSCF.
In the case where the privacy/authorization checks fails, then a necessary 2xx
or 4xx response will be sent to the S-CSCF. The selection of the correct
response code depends on the presentity\'s subscription authorization policy
document.
> 9\. **200 (OK) response (PS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.4.1-9**
The PS sends the response to S-CSCF#2.

## A.3.5 Network based watcher subscribing on behalf of IMS watcher to IMS
presentities
Figure A.3.5-1: Network based watcher subscribing on behalf of IMS watcher\
for presence information of IMS presentities
Figure A.3.5-1 shows a trusted network based watcher subscribing on behalf of
an IMS watcher to presence event notification about an IMS based presentity.
The presentity is in a different IM CN subsystem than the network based
watcher and the signalling flow assumes that the IMS watcher on whose behalf
the network based watcher subscribes is registered to the IMS network. The
details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **Sh: User Location Query procedure**
The network based watcher sends a query to the HSS to find out the S-CSCF of
the user on whose behalf the subscription is initiated. The HSS responds with
the address of the current S-CSCF for the originating subscriber.
> 2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (Network based watcher to S-CSCF) - see example in
> table A.3.5-2**
The SUBSCRIBE request is constructed and forwarded to S-CSCF. The S-CSCF is
inserted into the Route header of the SUBSCRIBE request.
Table A.3.5-2: SUBSCRIBE request (network watcher to S-CSCF)
> SUBSCRIBE sip:user2_public1\@home2.net SIP/2.0

> Content-Length: 0
>
> **Request-URI:** Public user identity of the user to whose events the
> subscriber subscribes to.
>
> **P-Asserted-Identity:** The network based watcher inserts the public user
> identity of the watcher on whose behalf the subscription is made into the
> P-Asserted-Identity header field.
>
> **Route:** The Route header is populated with the address of the S-CSCF
> obtained from the response to the user location query performed by the
> network based watcher on the Sh interface.
>
> **Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence\" to specify
> the use of the presence package.
>
> **Contact:** The contact information of the network based watcher.
>
> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#1 validates the service profile of the subscriber identified in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field and evaluates the initial filter criteria. In
this example, no AS is assumed to be involved.
> 4\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to I-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.5-4**
S-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the
network operator to whom the destination subscriber belongs. Since the
originating operator does not desire to keep their internal configuration
hidden, S-CSCF#1 forwards the SUBSCRIBE request directly to the I-CSCF in the
destination network.

> 5\. **Cx: User Location Query procedure**
The I-CSCF sends a query to the HSS to find out the S-CSCF of the called user.
The HSS responds with the address of the current S-CSCF for the terminating
subscriber.
For detailed message flows see 3GPP TS 29.228 [10].
Table A.3.5-5a provides the parameters in the SIP SUBSCRIBE request (flow 4),
which are sent to the HSS.
Table A.3.5-5a: Cx: User registration location procedure **(I-CSCF to HSS)**
* * *
Message source and destination Cx: Information element name Information source
in SIP SUBSCRIBE Description I-CSCF to HSS User Public Identity Request-URI
This information element indicates the public user identity
* * *
Table A.3.5-5b provides the parameters sent from the HSS that need to be
mapped to the SIP SUBSCRIBE request (flow 6) and sent to the S-CSCF.

* * *
Message source and destination Cx: Information element name Mapping to SIP

* * *
> 6\. **SUBSCRIBE request (I-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.5-6**
The I-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to the S-CSCF (S-CSCF#2) that will
handle the termination.

NOTE: The I-CSCF does not add itself to the Record-Route header, as it has no
need to remain in the signalling path for the subsequent requests.
> 7\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#2 validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For sip:user2_public1\@home2.net S-CSCF#2 has
termination initial filter criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method =
SUBSCRIBE and Event = \"presence\" that informs the S-CSCF to route the
SUBSCRIBE request to the AS ps.home2.net. The S-CSCF#2 has preconfigured
information not to create a Record-Route header for this request.
> 8\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to PS) - see example in table A.3.5-8**
The S-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to the PS.

> 9\. **Authorization of watcher**
The PS performs the necessary authorization checks on the watcher whose behalf
the subscription is being made to ensure it is allowed to watch the
presentity. In this example all privacy conditions are met, so the PS sends a
200 (OK) response to the S-CSCF.
In the case where the privacy/authorization checks fails, then a necessary 2xx
or 4xx response will be sent to the S-CSCF. The selection of the correct
response code depends on the presentity\'s authorization policy document.
> 10\. **200 (OK) response (PS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.5-10**
The PS sends the response to S-CSCF#2.

As soon as the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to accept the subscription, it
sends a NOTIFY request with the current state of the presentity\'s presence
information that the watcher has subscribed and been authorized to. The NOTIFY
request is sent to S-CSCF#1. Based on the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE
request, the PS decides to use partial notifications to provide further
changes of presence information. The first notification always contains the
full state. The \'application/pidf-diff +xml\' content type is used.

## A.3.6 Watcher subscribing to state changes in XML document, UE in visited
network
### A.3.6.1 Watcher subscribing to changes made via XCAP in his resource list,
UE in visited network - Successful subscription
Figure A.3.6.1-1: Watcher subscribing to changes made via XCAP in his resource
list
Figure A.3.6.1-1 shows a watcher subscribing to notifications of state changes
made via XCAP in his resource list. The details of the flows as follows:
> 1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (UE to P-CSCF) -- see example in table A.3.6.1-1**
A watcher agent in a UE wishes to get notification when his resource list gets
modified via XCAP. In order to initiate a subscription to XCAP document
changes in RLS, the UE generates a SUBSCRIBE request indicating support for
\"xcap-diff\", together with an indication of the length of time this periodic
subscription should last.

**Request-URI:** The users own SIP URI to get notifications of changes on all
lists owned by the user.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"xcap-diff\" to specify the
use of the xcap-diff package to get notified of changes to XCAP documents.
**Accept:** This field is populated with the value \"application/xcap-
diff+xml\" indicating that the UE supports the MIME type.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
> 2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table
> A.3.6.1-2**
The P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user
identity that was stored during the registration procedure. The SUBSCRIBE
request is forwarded to S-CSCF#1. A Route header is inserted into SUBSCRIBE
request. The information for the Route header is taken from the service route
determined during registration.

The S-CSCF validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For sip:user1_public1\@home1.net the S-CSCF has
originating initial Filter Criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method =
SUBSCRIBE AND Event = \"xcap-diff\" that informs the S-CSCF to route the
SUBSCRIBE request to the AS sip:rls.home1.net.

The RLS performs the necessary authorization checks on the originator to
ensure that he/she is authorized to subscribe to XML document changes. In this
example this condition has been met, so the RLS sends a 200 (OK) response to
the S-CSCF.

The content of the document element contains a new-etag and a previous etag
element with identical value and no list of instructions. This way it is
indicated that this is the reference XML diff document. This documents has
only the information about the etags and the document URI's covered by that
subscription.

# A.4 Signalling flows demonstrating how presentities update presence
information
## A.4.1 Introduction
This subclause covers the signalling flows that show how presentities update
presence information in the PS.
## A.4.2 Initial publication or modification of presence information by UE
### A.4.2.1 Successful publication
Figure A.4.2.1-1: UE publishing presence information
The UE may publish the partial presence information or the full presence
information about a presentity to the PS.
In this example, it is assumed that the UE publishes the full presence
information.
Figure A.4.2.1-1 shows a UE publishing or modifying already existing presence
information about a presentity. The details of the signalling flows as
follows:
> 1\. **PUBLISH request (UE to P-CSCF) - see example in table A.4.2.1-1**
A PUA in a UE wishes to publish presence information. To initiate the
publication, the UE generates a PUBLISH request according to RFC 3903 [23]
containing the presence information that it wishes to publish.

**Request-URI:** Public user identity whose presence information the PUA
intends to publish.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence\" to specify the
use of the presence package.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
**Content-Type:** Set to the value \"application/pidf+xml\".
The message body in the PUBLISH request that carries the presence update state
is formed as indicated in RFC 3863 [21], RFC 4480 [26], RFC 5196 [25], RFC
4482 [32], RFC 5263 [24] and RFC 4479 [44].
> 2\. **PUBLISH request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.4.2.1-2**
P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user identity
that was stored during the registration procedure. The PUBLISH request is
forwarded to the S-CSCF. A Route header is inserted into PUBLISH request. The
information for the Route header is taken from the service route determined
during registration.

> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF validates the service profile of the publisher and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For user1_public1\@home1.net S-CSCF#1 has originating
initial Filter Criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method = PUBLISH AND
Event = \"presence\" AND Request-URI = \"sip:user1_public1\@home1.net\" that
informs the S‑CSCF to route the PUBLISH request to the PS ps.home1.net.
> 4\. **PUBLISH (S-CSCF to PS) - see example in table A.4.2.1-4**
The S-CSCF#1 forwards the PUBLISH request to the PS.

it is allowed to publish the presentity\'s presence information. In this
example all privacy conditions are met, so the PS sends a 200 (OK) response to
the S-CSCF.

## A.4.3 Refreshing of presence information by UE
### A.4.3.1 Successful refresh
Figure A.4.3.1-1: UE updating presence information
Figure A.4.3.1-1 shows an UE refreshing the presence information about a
presentity. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **PUBLISH request (UE to P-CSCF) -- see example in table A.4.3.1-1**
A PUA in a UE wishes to refresh already existing presence information. To
initiate the publication, the UE generates a PUBLISH request according to RFC
3903 [23].

**Request-URI:** Public user identity whose presence information the PUA
intends to publish.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence\" to specify the
use of the presence package.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
**SIP-If-Match:** This field is populated with the entity-tag earlier provided
by the PS in the SIP-ETag header field of the previous 200(OK) response and is
used as a versioning precondition to the PUBLISH refresh.
> 2\. **PUBLISH request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.4.3.1-2**
P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user identity
that was stored during the registration procedure. The PUBLISH request is
forwarded to the S-CSCF. A Route header is inserted into PUBLISH request. The
information for the Route header is taken from the service route determined
during registration.

**P-Charging-Vector:** The P-CSCF populates the icid parameter with a globally
unique value.
> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
S-CSCF#1 validates the service profile of this publisher and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For user1_public1\@home1.net the S-CSCF has
originating initial Filter Criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method =
PUBLISH AND Event = \"presence\" AND Request-URI =
\"sip:user1_public1\@home1.net\" that informs the S-CSCF to route the PUBLISH
request to the PS ps.home1.net.
> 4\. **PUBLISH (S-CSCF to PS) -- see example in table A.4.3.1-4**
The S-CSCF forwards the PUBLISH request to the PS.

# A.5 PS notifying watcher of updates to presence information
## A.5.1 Introduction
This subclause covers the signalling flows that show how the PS notifies
watchers of updates to presence information.
## A.5.2 Watcher and presentity in the different networks, UE in the home
network
### A.5.2.1 Successful notification
Figure A.5.2.1-1: Notification to watcher in the visited network
Figure A.5.2.1-1 shows how a watcher is notified of updates to a presentity\'s
presence information. The signalling flow is applicable to the case where the
watcher and presentity are in the same or in different IM CN subsystems.
> **1\. NOTIFY request (PS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.5.2.1-1**
The PS determines which authorized watchers are entitled to receive the
updates of the presence information for this presentity. For each appropriate
watcher, the PS sends a NOTIFY request that contains the updated state of
presence information. The NOTIFY request may either contain the complete set
of presence information, or only the information that has changed since the
last notification. In this example, the watcher indicated preference for
partial notification in the SUBSCRIBE request, so the NOTIFY request is
formulated according to RFC 5263 [24] and RFC 5262 [38] by including only the
information that has changed since the last notification. (Note that the first
NOTIFY request has contained the full state of the presence information.)

## A.5.3 Notification to resource list in a different network and notification
to watcher in the visited network
### A.5.3.1 Successful notification
Figure A.5.3.1-1: Notification to resource list in a different network and\
notification to watcher in the visited network
Figure A.5.3.1-1 shows the PS providing presence event notification about a
presentity to a RLS in a different network. This notification triggers the RLS
to provide presence event notification to the watcher. The details of the
signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **NOTIFY request (PS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.5.3.1-1**
The PS determines which authorized watchers are entitled to receive presence
information. For each appropriate watcher, the PS sends a NOTIFY request that
contains the updated state of presence information. In this example the
notification is only sent to the RLS.
The NOTIFY request may either contain the complete set of presence
information, or only those presence information that have changed since the
last notification. In this example, the complete set of presence information
is sent.

# A.6 PUA subscribing to his own watcher list and receiving notification of
new watcher subscriptions
## A.6.1 Introduction
This subclause covers the signalling flows that show how a PUA can subscribe
to his own watcher list.
## A.6.2 PUA subscribing to watcher list and receiving a notification of an
already pending watcher subscription followed by a notification of a
subscription from a new watcher not already in the watcher list
Figure A.6.2-1: PUA subscribing to watcher list and receiving a notification\
of an already pending watcher subscription followed by a notification of a
subscription\ from a new watcher not already in the watcher list
Figure A.6.2-1 shows a PUA subscribing to the watcher list and receiving a
notification of an already pending watcher subscription followed by a
notification of a subscription from a new watcher not already in the watcher
list. In this example the default watcherinfo subscription filtering policy is
applied meaning that a partial state of a watcher-info document is transported
in the notifications. The details of the signalling flows as follows:
> 1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (UE to P-CSCF) -- see example in table A.6.2-1**
The presentity wishes to watch his own watcher information, therefore he
subscribes for the watcher information template-package of presence. The UE
generates a SUBSCRIBE request containing the presence.winfo event, together
with an indication of the length of time this periodic subscription should
last.

**Request URI:** Public user identity whose events the subscriber subscribes
to. In this case the Public User Identity of the presentity in SIP URI format.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"presence.winfo\" to
specify the use of the watcher information template-package of presence.
**Accept:** This field is populated with the value
\'application/watcherinfo+xml\' indicating that the UE supports this body type
for notification.
**To:** Same as the Request-URI.
> 2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.6.2-2**
The P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user
identity that was stored during the registration procedure. The SUBSCRIBE
request is forwarded to the S-CSCF. A Route header is inserted into SUBSCRIBE
request.

> 3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. For sip:user1_public1\@home1.net the S-CSCF has
originating initial Filter Criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method =
SUBSCRIBE AND Event = \"presence.winfo\" that informs the S-CSCF to route the
SUBSCRIBE request to the AS sip:ps.home1.net.
> 4\. **SUBSCRIBE request (S-CSCF to PS) -- see example in table A.6.2-4**
The S-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to the PS.

>
> **P-Charging-Function-Addresses:** The S-CSCF stores the P-Charging-
> Function-Addresses header field and passes this header to the PS.
>
> 5\. **Authorization**
The PS performs the necessary authorization checks on the originator. In this
example, the originator is the owner of the watcher information, so he/she is
authorized to see the full watcher information.
In other examples (when the originator is not the owner of the watcher
information) subscribers are only allowed to monitor the state of their own
subscription, which means that they will receive notifications only containing
the state of their own subscription. This requires that a terminating initial
Filter Criteria with Service Point Trigger of Method = SUBSCRIBE AND Event =
\"presence.winfo\" has been defined for the user sip:user1_public1\@home1.net.
> 6\. **200 (OK) response (PS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.6.2-6**
The PS sends the response to the S-CSCF.

The presentity determines to allow the watcher to access the presence
information. The PUA modifies the subscription authorization policy by
authorizing presence information for sip:user2_public1\@home1.net.
> 16\. **NOTIFY request (PS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.6.2-16**
The authorization event means changes in the watcher information, which
triggers a new NOTIFY request. The watcher information included in the NOTIFY
request contains only information on the watcher whose state has changed,
which in this example is the accepted subscription of
sip:user2_public1\@home1.net.

# A.7 PNA subscription for the reg-event package
Figure A.7-1 shows the registration signalling flow for the scenario when the
user is not registered. For the purpose of this registration signalling flow,
the subscriber is considered to be roaming. This signalling flow also shows
the authentication of the private user identity.
This is followed by the subscription procedure for the reg-event package,
whereby the PNA requests to be notified by the S-CSCF when a registration
event has occurred. This is done using the \'reg-event\' package as described
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [9].

# A.8 Example signalling flows of HTTP based presence service operation
## A.8.1 Introduction
This subclause shows signalling flows relating to the manipulation of presence
service data over the Ut reference point using XCAP. The flows only shows the
signalling between the XCAP server and the XCAP client, thus possible proxies
located in between the entities are not shown in the example signalling flows.
Each example signalling flow shows several sequences of manipulation of data
for the presence service.
NOTE: Error conditions are not considered in the examples e.g. if
authorization checks fail in the XCAP server, XML Schema compliancy checks
fail or the file specified by the URI does not exist then an appropriate 4xx
response is sent to the client.
Clarifications how XCAP is using HTTP are described in RFC 4825 [33].
NOTE: The authentication proxy resides between UE (XCAP client) and AS (XCAP
server), and examples of signalling flows for the authentication proxy are
provided in 3GPP TS 24.109 [7].
## A.8.2 Signalling flows demonstrating how XCAP clients manipulate resource
lists
Figure A.8.2-1: XCAP client manipulating a resource list on XCAP server
Figure A.8.2-1 shows a how a XCAP client may manipulate a resource list on a
XCAP server. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **XCAP PUT request (XCAP client to XCAP server - see example in table
> A.8.2-1**
The XCAP client generates an XCAP PUT request to create a new resource list on
the XCAP server. The resource list has one entry.

## A.8.4 Storing external content (successful operation)
Figure A.8.4.-1: XCAP client manipulating hard-state presence document on XCAP
server
Figure A.8.4-1 shows a XCAP client manipulating hard-state presence document
on a XCAP server when the presence document has an aggregated storing MIME
object with the \"application/pidf+xml\" content type and any of its
extensions. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
> 1\. **HTTP PUT request (XCAP client to XCAP server) -- see example in table
> A.8.2-1**
In order to store the content, the XCAP client generates an HTTP PUT request
containing the MIME object in the body of the request. The request-URI points
to the directory where the content is stored and shows the name of the file to
be created.

> Content-Type: image/jpeg
>
> Content-Length: (...)
>
> {pictureX.jpg}
>
> 2\. **HTTP 201 (Created) response (XCAP server to XCAP client) -- see
> example in table A.8.4-2**
After the XCAP server has performed the necessary authorization checks on the
originator to ensure the XCAP client is allowed to create a file the HTTP
server sends an HTTP 201 (Created) response to the client.
Table A.8.4-2: HTTP 201 (Created) response (XCAP server to XCAP client)

> 3\. **XCAP PUT request (XCAP client to XCAP server) - see example in table
> A.8.2-3**
The XCAP client generates an XCAP PUT request in order to store XML encoded
presence document which includes a URI reference to the MIME object stored on
the XCAP server. The AUID part of the request URI is \'pidf-manipulation\' as
defined in RFC 4827 [34].
