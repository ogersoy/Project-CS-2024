where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines a call control protocol for use in the IP
Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based on the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session Description Protocol (SDP).
The present document is applicable to:
\- the interface between the User Equipment (UE) and the Call Session Control
Function (CSCF);
\- the interface between the CSCF and any other CSCF;
\- the interface between the CSCF and an Application Server (AS);
\- the interface between the CSCF and the Media Gateway Control Function
(MGCF);
\- the interface between the S-CSCF and the Multimedia Resource Function
Controller (MRFC);
\- the interface between the Application Server (AS) and the Multimedia
Resource Function Controller (MRFC);
\- the interface between the CSCF and the Breakout Gateway Control Function
(BGCF);
\- the interface between the BGCF and the MGCF;
\- the interface between the CSCF and an IBCF;
\- the interface between the E-CSCF and the Location Retrieval Function (LRF);
\- the interface between the BGCF and any other BGCF;
\- the interface between the CSCF and an external Multimedia IP network; and
\- the interface between the E-CSCF and the EATF.
Where possible the present document specifies the requirements for this
protocol by reference to specifications produced by the IETF within the scope
of SIP and SDP. Where this is not possible, extensions to SIP and SDP are
defined within the present document. The document has therefore been
structured in order to allow both forms of specification.
As the IM CN subsystem is designed to interwork with different IP-Connectivity
Access Networks (IP-CANs), the IP-CAN independent aspects of the IM CN
subsystem are described in the main body and annex A of this specification.
Aspects for connecting a UE to the IM CN subsystem through specific types of
IP-CANs are documented separately in the annexes or in separate documents.
The document also specifies media-related requirements for the NAT traversal
mechanisms defined in this specification.
NOTE: The present document covers only the usage of SIP and SDP to communicate
with the enitities of the IM CN subsystem. It is possible, and not precluded,
to use the capabilities of IP-CAN to allow a terminal containing a SIP UA to
communicate with SIP servers or SIP UAs outside the IM CN subsystem, and
therefore utilise the services provided by those SIP servers. The usage of SIP
and SDP for communicating with SIP servers or SIP UAs outside the IM CN
subsystem is outside the scope of the present document.
# 2 References

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Entry point** :In the case that \"border control concepts\", as specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 [7], are to be applied in an IM CN subsystem, then these are to
be provided by capabilities within the IBCF, and the IBCF acts as an entry
point for this network (instead of the I-CSCF). In this case the IBCF and the
I-CSCF can be co-located as a single physical node. If \"border control
concepts\" are not applied, then the I-CSCF is considered as an entry point of
a network. If the P-CSCF is in the home network, then the I-CSCF is considered
as an entry point for this document.
**Exit point** : If operator preference requires the application of \"border
control concepts\" as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7], then these are to be
provided by capabilities within the IBCF, and requests sent towards another
network are routed via a local network exit point (IBCF), which will then
forward the request to the other network (discovering the entry point if
necessary).
**Geo-local number** : Either a geo-local service number as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.228 [7] or a number in non-international format according to an
addressing plan used at the current physical location of the user.
**Home-local number** : Either a home local service number as specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 [7] or a number in non-international format according to an
addressing plan used in the home network of the user.
**Newly established set of security associations** : Two pairs of IPsec
security associations that have been created at the UE and/or the P-CSCF after
the 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request was received.
**Old set of security associations:** Two pairs of IPsec security associations
still in existence after another set of security associations has been
established due to a successful authentication procedure.
**Temporary set of security associations:** Two pairs of IPsec security
associations that have been created at the UE and/or the P-CSCF, after an
authentication challenge within a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER
request was received. The SIP level lifetime of such created security
associations will be equal to the value of reg-await-auth timer.
**Integrity protected:** See 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. Where a requirement exists
to send information \"integrity-protected\" the mechanisms specified in 3GPP
TS 33.203 [19] are used for sending the information. Where a requirement
exists to check that information was received \"integrity-protected\", then
the information received is checked for compliance with the procedures as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
**Instance ID:** An URN generated by the device that uniquely identifies a
specific device amongst all other devices, and does not contain any
information pertaining to the user (e.g., in GPRS instance ID applies to the
Mobile Equipment rather than the UICC). The public user identity together with
the instance ID uniquely identifies a specific UA instance.
**Resource reservation: Mechanism for reserving bearer resources that is
required for certain access technologies.**
**Local preconditions: The indication of segmented status preconditions for
the local reservation of resources as specified in RFC 3312 [30].**
**Alias SIP URI:** A URI is an alias of another URI if the treatment of both
URIs is identical, i.e. both URIs belong to the same set of implicitly
registered public user identities, and are linked to the same service profile,
and are considered to have the exact same service configuration for each and
every service.
**Globally Routeable SIP URI:** a SIP URI of which the hostname part can be
resolved to the IP address of the entry entity of the network reponsible for
the identity represented by the userpart.
**Initial registration:** The registration procedure for a public user
identity initiated by the UE in the absence of any valid registration.
**Registration expiration interval** : An indication on how long a
registration is valid, indicated using the Expires header field, or the
\"expires\" header field parameter within the Contact header field, according
to the procedures specified in RFC 3261 [26].
**Re-registration:** The registration procedure initiated by the UE to refresh
or update an already existing registration for a public user identity.
**Registration of an additional public user identity:** The registration
procedure initiated by the UE to explicitly register an additional public user
identity during the life time of the registration of another registered public
user identity, where both public user identities have the same contact address
and P-CSCF.
**Emergency registration:** A special registration that relates to binding of
a public user identity to a contact address used for emergency service.
**Initial emergency registration:** An emergency registration that is also an
initial registration.
**Emergency reregistration:** An emergency registration that is also a
reregistration.
**Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)** : As given in RFC 3261 [26]. In addition,
for the usage in the IM CN subsystem, a SIP element being able to handle a
collection of \"n\" User Agents (behaving each one as UAC and UAS, according
to SIP rules), which are linked by some application logic that is fully
independent of the SIP rules.
**UE private IP address** : It is assumed that the NAT device performs network
address translation between a private and a public network with the UE located
in the private network and the IM CN subsystem in the public network. The UE
is assumed to be configured with a private IP address. This address will be
denoted as UE private IP address.
**UE public IP address** : The NAT device is assumed to be configured with one
(or perhaps more) public address(es). When the UE sends a request towards the
public network, the NAT replaces the source address in the IP header of the
packet, which contains the UE private IP address, with a public IP addressed
assigned to the NAT. This address will be denoted as UE public IP address.
**Encapsulating UDP header** : For the purpose of performing UDP encapsulation
according to RFC 3948 [63A] each IPsec ESP packet is wrapped into an
additional UDP header. This header is denoted as E**ncapsulating UDP header**.
**Port_Uenc** : In most residential scenarios, when the NAT device performs
address translation, it also performs translation of the source port found in
the transport layer (TCP/UDP) headers. Following RFC 3948 [63A], the UE will
use port 4500 as source port in the encapsulating UDP header when sending a
packet. This port is translated by the NAT into an arbitrarily chosen port
number which is denoted as port_Uenc.
**Multiple registrations** : An additional capability of the UE, P-CSCF and
S-CSCF, such that the UE (as identified by the private user identity and
instance-id), can create multiple simultaneous registration bindings (flows),
associated with one or more contact addresses, to any public user identity,
Without this capability, a new registration from the UE for a public user
identity replaces the existing registration binding, rather than merely
creating an additional binding.
**IMS flow set:** An IMS flow set is a set of flows as defined in RFC 5626
[92]. The flows in an IMS flow set are determined by a combination of
transport protocol, IP addresses, and ports. An IMS flow set is established by
a successful IMS registration procedure.
NOTE 1: For IPsec, the ports associated with the flow set include protected
client ports and protected server ports as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and
an IMS flow set is made up of the following four flows:
\- Flow 1: (IP address UE, port_uc) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_ps) over
TCP;
\- Flow 2: (IP address UE, port_uc) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_ps) over
UDP;
\- Flow 3: (IP address UE, port_us) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_pc) over
TCP; and
\- Flow 4: (IP address UE, port_us) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_pc) over
UDP.
NOTE 2: For IPsec, according to 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], the P-CSCF can only
select among flows 1, 3, or 4 when forwarding requests towards the UE, where
flow 1 is only possible in case of TCP connection re-use. According to 3GPP TS
33.203 [19], flow 2 is only used for UE originated requests and corresponding
responses. The P-CSCF uses flow 2 to identify the correct IMS flow set.
NOTE 3: An IMS flow set can be considered as a realisation of a logical flow
as used in RFC 5626 [92]. But this definition does not depend on any
particular definition of a logical flow.
NOTE 4: For TLS, the ports associated with the flow set include a protected
client port and a protected server port and an IMS flow set is made up of the
following flow:
\- (IP address UE, port) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port) over TCP.
NOTE 5: For SIP digest without TLS, an IMS flow set is as defined in RFC 5626
[92].
**IMS flow token:** A IMS flow token is uniquely associated with a IMS flow
set. When forwarding a request destined towards the UE, the P-CSCF selects the
flow from the IMS flow set denoted by the IMS flow token as appropriate
according to 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC 3261 [26].
**IP Association:** A mapping at the P-CSCF of a UE\'s packet source IP
address, the \"sent-by\" parameter in the Via header field, and,
conditionally, the port with the identities of the UE. This association
corresponds to the IP address check table specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
**Authorised Resource-Priority header field:** a Resource-Priority header
field that is either received from another entity in the trust domain relating
to the Resource-Priority header field, or which has been identified as
generated by a subscriber known to have such priority privileges for the
resource priority namespace and level of priority used within that namespace.
**Network-initiated resource reservation:** A mechanism of resource
reservation where the IP-CAN on the behalf of network initiates the resources
to the UE.
**Public network traffic:** traffic sent to the IM CN subsystem for processing
according to normal rules of the NGN. This type of traffic is known as public
network traffic.
**Private network traffic:** traffic sent to the IM CN subsystem for
processing according to an agreed set of rules specific to an enterprise. This
type of traffic is known as private network traffic. Private network traffic
is normally within a single enterprise, but private network traffic can also
exist between two different enterprises if not precluded for regulatory
reasons.
**Priviledged sender:** A priviledged sender is allowed to send SIP messages
where the identities in P-Asserted-Identity will be passed on in the P-CSCF
and are not subject to further processing in the P-CSCF.
**Restoration procedures:** the procedures for the IM CN to handle a S-CSCF
service interruption scenario (see 3GPP TS 23.380 [7D]).
**Canonical form of a SIP URI** : Canoncial form of a SIP URI takes the form
\"sip:username\@domain\" as specified in RFC 3261 [26] subclause 10.3. SIP URI
comparisons are performed as defined in RFC 3261 [26] subclause 19.1.4.
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
given in RFC 1594 [20B] apply.

# 3A Interoperability with different IP-CAN
The IM CN subsystem can be accessed by UEs resident in different types of IP-
CAN. The main body of this document, and annex A, are general to UEs and IM CN
subsystems that are accessed using any type of IP-CAN. Requirements that are
dependent on the type of IP-CAN are covered in annexes B, D, E, H, L, M and Q.
At any given time, for a given SIP transaction or dialog, the UE sees only one
type of IP-CAN, as reported to it by the lower layers. The UE follows the
procedures of the IP-CAN specific annex related to the last type of IP-CAN
reported, even if it is different to one used previously. In particular,
handover at the radio layers between two different access technologies can
result in such a change while the dialog or transaction proceeds.
At any given time, for a given SIP transaction or dialog, the P-CSCF sees only
one type of IP-CAN, as determined by interface to a particular resource
architecture, e.g. policy and charging control, and by the access technology
reported to it over that interface, or in the absence of this, by
preconfiguration in the system. The P-CSCF follows the procedures of the IP-
CAN specific annex related to the last type of IP-CAN determined, even if it
is different to one used previously. In particular, handover at the radio
layers between two different access technologies can result in such a change
while the dialog or transaction proceeds.
It is the responsibility of the IP-CAN to ensure that usage of different
bearer resources are synchronised on the handover from one IP-CAN to another,
e.g. so that a signalling bearer provided by one IP-CAN is a signalling bearer
(if provided by that IP-CAN) after handover, and that the appropriate QoS and
resource reservation exists after handover. There is no SIP signalling
associated with handover at the IP-CAN, and therefore no change in SIP state
at one entity is signalled to the peer SIP entity when handover occurs.
In particular the following constraints exist that can have an impact on
P-CSCF usage:
1) some IP-CANs can explicitly label a bearer as a signalling bearer, while
others provide a bearer that has appropriate QoS, but no explicit labelling.
Therefore if handover occurs from an IP-CAN with explicit labelling, to an IP-
CAN with no explicit labelling, and then back to an IP-CAN with explicit
labelling, the signalling will then be on a bearer that is not explicitly
labelled; and
2) some IP-CANs support signalling of grouping of media within particular
bearers, while others do not. Therefore if handover occurs from an IP-CAN with
grouping, to an IP-CAN with no grouping, and then back to an IP-CAN with
grouping, the signalled grouping can have been lost.
When a UE supports multiple IP-CANs, but does not support handover between
those IP-CANs, the annex specific to that IP-CAN applies unmodified.
Where handover between IP-CANs occurs without a reregistration in the IM CN
subsystem, the same identies and security credentials for access to the IM CN
subsystem are used before and after the handover.
# 4 General
## 4.1 Conformance of IM CN subsystem entities to SIP, SDP and other protocols
SIP defines a number of roles which entities can implement in order to support
capabilities. These roles are defined in annex A.
Each IM CN subsystem functional entity using an interface at the Gm reference
point, the Ma reference point, the Mg reference point, the Mi reference point,
the Mj reference point, the Mk reference point, the Ml reference point, the Mm
reference point, the Mr reference point, the Mr\' reference point, the Cr
reference point, the Mw reference point, the I2 reference point, the I4
reference point and the Ici reference point, and also using the IP multimedia
Subsystem Service Control (ISC) Interface, shall implement SIP, as defined by
the referenced specifications in Annex A, and in accordance with the
constraints and provisions specified in annex A, according to the following
roles.
The Gm reference point, the Ma reference point, the Mg reference point, the Mi
reference point, the Mj reference point, the Mk reference point, the Ml
reference point, the Mm reference point, the Mr reference point, the Mw
reference point, the Cr reference point, the I2 reference point, the I4
reference point and the ISC reference point are defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [2].
The Ici reference point is defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7]. The Mr\' reference
point is defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5].
\- The User Equipment (UE) shall provide the User Agent (UA) role, with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.1,
with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in
subclause 6.1, and with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SigComp
as described in subclause 8.1. The UE shall also provide the access technology
specific procedures described in the appropriate access technology specific
annex (see subclause 3A and subclause 9.2.2). The UE may include one or
several interconnected SIP elements registered as a single logical entity when
the UE performs the functions of an external attached network (e.g. an
enterprise network). This specification does not place any constraint on the
SIP role played by each of the elements as long as the compound entity appears
to the IM CM subsystem as a SIP UA with the aforementioned exceptions and
additional capabilities except for the modifications defined by the UE
performing the functions of an external attached network modifying role in
annex A.
> NOTE 1: When the UE performs the functions of an external attached network
> (e.g. an enterprise network), the internal structure of this UE is outside
> the scope of this specification. It is expected that in the most common
> case, several SIP elements will be connected to an additional element
> directly attached to the IM CN subsystem.
\- The P-CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.2, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.2, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SigComp as described in subclause
8.2. Under certain circumstances, if the P-CSCF provides an application level
gateway functionality (IMS-ALG), the P-CSCF shall provide the UA role with the
additional capabilities, as follows:
a) when acting as a subscriber to or the recipient of event information (see
subclause 5.2);
b) when performing P-CSCF initiated dialog-release, even when acting as a
proxy for the remainder of the dialog (see subclause 5.2);
c) when performing NAT traversal procedures (see annex F, annex G and annex
K); and
d) when performing media plane security procedures (see subclause 5.2).
The P-CSCF shall also provide the access technology specific procedures
described in the appropriate access technology specific annex (see subclause
3A and subclause 9.2.2).
\- The I-CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.3.
\- The S-CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.4, and with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.3. Under certain
circumstances as described in subclause 5.4, the S-CSCF shall provide the UA
role with the additional capabilities, as follows:
a) the S-CSCF shall also act as a registrar. When acting as a registrar, or
for the purposes of executing a third-party registration, the S-CSCF shall
provide the UA role;
b) as the notifier of event information the S-CSCF shall provide the UA role;
c) when providing a messaging mechanism by sending the MESSAGE method, the
S-CSCF shall provide the UA role; and
d) when performing S-CSCF initiated dialog release the S-CSCF shall provide
the UA role, even when acting as a proxy for the remainder of the dialog.
\- The MGCF shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.5, and with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.4.
\- The BGCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.6.
\- The AS, acting as terminating UA, or redirect server (as defined in 3GPP TS
23.218 [5] subclause 9.1.1.1), shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions
and additional capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.2, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6.
\- The AS, acting as originating UA (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5]
subclause 9.1.1.2), shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.3, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6.
\- The AS, acting as a SIP proxy (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5] subclause
9.1.1.3), shall provided the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.4.
\- The AS, performing 3rd party call control (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5]
subclause 9.1.1.4), shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.5, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6.
An AS performing media control of an MRFC shall also support the procedures
and methods described in subclause 10.2.
NOTE 2: Subclause 5.7 and its subclauses define only the requirements on the
AS that relate to SIP. Other requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5].
\- The AS, receiving third-party registration requests, shall provide the UA
role, with the exceptions and additional capabilities as described in
subclause 5.7.
\- The MRFC shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.8, and with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.5. The MRFC shall
also support the procedures and methods described in subclause 10.3 for media
control.
\- The IBCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.10. If the IBCF provides an
application level gateway functionality (IMS-ALG), then the IBCF shall provide
the UA role, with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SIP as
described in subclause 5.10, and with the exceptions and additional
capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.7. If the IBCF provides
screening functionality, then the IBCF may provide the UA role, with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.10.
\- The E-CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.11. Under certain circumstances as
described in subclause 5.11, the E-CSCF shall provide the UA role in
accordance with RFC 3323 [33], with the additional capabilities, as follows:
a) when operator policy (e.g. determined by national regulatory requirements
applicable to emergency services) allows user requests for suppression of
public user identifiers and location information, then the E-CSCF shall
provide the UA role, with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SIP as
described in subclause 5.11;
b) when performing E-CSCF initiated dialog release the E-CSCF shall provide
the UA role, even when acting as a proxy for the remainder of the dialog, e.g.
for any of the reasons specified in RFC 6442 [89] or RFC 3323 [33]; and
c) when acting as a notifier for the dialog event package the E-CSCF shall
provide the UA role.
\- The LRF shall provide the UA role.
\- The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall provide the UA role, with the
exceptions and additional capabilities as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [8O].
\- The EATF shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in 3GPP TS 24.237 [8M].
In addition to the roles specified above, the P-CSCF, the I-CSCF, the IBCF,
the S-CSCF, the BGCF and the E-CSCF can act as a UA when providing server
functionality to return a final response for any of the reasons specified in
RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 3: Annex A can change the status of requirements in referenced
specifications. Particular attention is drawn to table A.4 and table A.162 for
capabilities within referenced SIP specifications, and to table A.317 and
table A.328 for capabilities within referenced SDP specifications. The
remaining tables build on these initial tables.
NOTE 4: The allocated roles defined in this clause are the starting point of
the requirements from the IETF SIP specifications, and are then the basis for
the description of further requirements. Some of these extra requirements
formally change the proxy role into a B2BUA. In all other respects other than
those more completely described in subclause 5.2 the P-CSCF implements proxy
requirements. Despite being a B2BUA a P-CSCF does not implement UA
requirements from the IETF RFCs, except as indicated in this specification,
e.g., relating to registration event subscription.
NOTE 5: Except as specified in clause 5 or otherwise permitted in RFC 3261,
the functional entities providing the proxy role are intended to be
transparent to data within received requests and responses. Therefore these
entities do not modify message bodies. If local policy applies to restrict
such data being passed on, the functional entity has to assume the UA role and
reject a request, or if in a response and where such procedures apply, to pass
the response on and then clear the session using the BYE method.
All the above entities are functional entities that could be implemented in a
number of different physical platforms coexisting with a number of other
functional entities. The implementation shall give priority to transactions at
one functional entity, e.g. that of the the E-CSCF, over non-emergency
transactions at other entities on the same physical implementation. Such
priority is similar to the priority within the functional entities themselves
specified elsewhere in this document.
Additional routeing functionality can be provided to support the ability for
the IM CN subsystem to provide transit functionality as specified in Annex I.
The additional routeing functionality shall assume the proxy role.
## 4.2 URI and address assignments
In order for SIP and SDP to operate, the following prerequisite conditions
apply:
1) I-CSCFs used in registration are allocated SIP URIs. Other IM CN subsystem
entities may be allocated SIP URIs. For example sip:pcscf.home1.net and
sip:\\@pcscf.home1.net are valid SIP URIs. If the user
part exists, it is an essential part of the address and shall not be omitted
when copying or moving the address. How these addresses are assigned to the
logical entities is up to the network operator. For example, a single SIP URI
may be assigned to all I-CSCFs, and the load shared between various physical
boxes by underlying IP capabilities, or separate SIP URIs may be assigned to
each I-CSCF, and the load shared between various physical boxes using DNS SRV
capabilities.
2) All IM CN subsystem entities are allocated IP addresses. Any IM CN
subsystem entities can be allocated IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses. For systems providing access to IM CN subsystem using a GPRS IP-CAN
or an EPS IP-CAN this is specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [6] subclause 5.1. For
systems providing access to IM CN subsystem using a cdma2000^Â®^ packet data
subsystem IP-CAN this is specified in subclause M.2.2.1.
3) The subscriber is allocated a private user identity by the home network
operator. This private user identity is available to the SIP application
within the UE. Depending on the network operator, various arrangements exist
within the UE for retaining this information:
a) where an ISIM is present, within the ISIM, see subclause 5.1.1.1A;
b) where no ISIM is present but USIM is present, the private user identity is
derived (see subclause 5.1.1.1A);
c) neither ISIM nor USIM is present, but IMC is present, within IMC (see
subclause 5.1.1.1B.1);
d) when neither ISIM nor USIM nor IMC is present, the private user identity is
available to the UE via other means (see subclause 5.1.1.1B.2).
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] specifies that a UE attached to a 3GPP network has
an ISIM or a USIM.
NOTE 2: The SIP URIs can be resolved by using any of public DNSs, private
DNSs, or peer-to-peer agreements.
4) The subscriber is allocated one or more public user identities by the home
network operator. The public user identity shall take the form of SIP URI as
specified in RFC 3261 [26] or tel URI as specified in RFC 3966 [22]. At least
one of the public user identities is a SIP URI . All registered public user
identities are available to the SIP application within the UE, after
registration. Depending on the network operator, various arrangements exist
within the UE for retaining this information:
a) where an ISIM is present, at least one public user identity, which is a SIP
URI, within the ISIM, see subclause 5.1.1.1A;
b) where no ISIM is present but USIM is present, a temporary public user
identity is derived (see subclause 5.1.1.1A);
c) neither ISIM nor USIM is present, but IMC is present, within IMC (see
subclause 5.1.1.1B.1);
d) when neither ISIM nor USIM nor IMC is present, the public user identities
are available to the UE via other means (see subclause 5.1.1.1B.2).
NOTE 3: 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] specifies that a UE attached to a 3GPP network has
an ISIM or a USIM.
5) If the UE supports GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53) or multiple
registrations, then it shall have an Instance ID, in conformance with the
mandatory requirements for Instance IDs specified in RFC 5627 [93] and RFC
5626 [92].
6) For each tel URI, there is at least one alias SIP URI in the set of
implicitly registered public user identities that is used to implicitly
register the associated tel URI.
NOTE 4: For each tel URI, there always exists a SIP URI that has identical
user part as the tel URI and the \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\"
(see RFC 3261 [26] subclause 19.1.6), that represents the same public user
identity. If a tel URI identifies a subscriber served by the IM CN subsystem,
then the hostport parameter of the respective SIP URI contains the home domain
name of the IM CN subsystem to which the subscriber belongs.
6A) Identification of the UE to a PSAP with point of presence in the CS domain
is not possible if a tel URI is not included in the set of implicitly
registered public user identities. If the included tel URI is associated
either with the first entry in the list of public user identities provisioned
in the UE or with the temporary public user identity, then a PSAP can uniquely
identify the UE if emergency registration is performed.
NOTE 5: The tel URI uniquely identifies the UE by not sharing any of the
implicit registered public user identities in the implicit registration set
that contains this tel URI.
NOTE 6: Emergency registration is not always needed or supported.
7) The public user identities may be shared across multiple UEs. A particular
public user identity may be simultaneously registered from multiple UEs that
use different private user identities and different contact addresses. When
reregistering and deregistering a given public user identity and associated
contact address, the UE will use the same private user identity that it had
used during the initial registration of the respective public user identity
and associated contact address. If the tel URI is a shared public user
identity, then the associated alias SIP URI is also a shared public user
identity. Likewise, if the alias SIP URI is a shared public user identity,
then the associated tel URI is also a shared public user identity.
> 8) For the purpose of access to the IM CN subsystem, UEs can be allocated
> IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. For systems providing
> access to IM CN subsystem using a UMTS/GSM network this is specified in 3GPP
> TS 23.221 [6] subclause 5.1 (see subclause 9.2.1 for the assignment
> procedures). For systems providing access to IM CN subsystem using a
> cdma2000^Â®^ network this is specified in subclause M.2.2.1.
9) For the purpose of indicating an IMS communication service to the network,
UEs are assigned ICSI values appropriate to the IMS communication services
supported by the UE, coded as URNs as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2.
NOTE 7: cdma2000Â® is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications Industry
Association (TIA-USA).
10) E-CSCFs are allocated multiple SIP URIs. The SIP URI configured in the
P-CSCF to reach the E-CSCF is distinct from the one given by the E-CSCF to the
EATF such that EATF can reach the E-CSCF.
## 4.2A Transport mechanisms
This document makes no requirement on the transport protocol used to transfer
signalling information over and above that specified in RFC 3261 [26] clause
18. However, the UE and IM CN subsystem entities shall transport SIP messages
longer than 1300 bytes according to the procedures of RFC 3261 [26] subclause
18.1.1, even if a mechanism exists of discovering a maximum transmission unit
size longer than 1500 bytes.
NOTE: Support of SCTP as specified in RFC 4168 [96] is optional for IM CN
subsystem entities implementing the role of a UA or proxy. SCTP transport
between the UE and P-CSCF is not supported in the present document. Support of
the SCTP transport is currently not described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
For initial REGISTER requests, the UE and the P-CSCF shall apply port handling
according to subclause 5.1.1.2 and subclause 5.2.2.
The UE and the P-CSCF shall send and receive request and responses other than
initial REGISTER requests on the protected ports as described in 3GPP TS
33.203 [19].
In case of an emergency session if the UE does not have sufficient credentials
to authenticate with the IM CN subsystem and regulations allow, the UE and
P-CSCF shall send request and responses other than initial REGISTER requests
on non protected ports.
## 4.2B Security mechanisms
### 4.2B.1 Signalling security
3GPP TS 33.203 [19] defines the security features and mechanisms for secure
access to the IM CN subsystem. This document defines a number of access
security mechanisms, as summarised in table 4-1.
Table 4-1: Summary of access security mechanisms to the IM CN subsystem
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Mechanism | Aut | Integrity | Use of | Support (as | | | hentication | protection | security | defined in | | | | | agreement | 3GPP TS 33. | | | | | in | 203 [19]) | | | | | accordance | | | | | | with | | | | | | RFC | | | | | | 3329 [48] | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | IMS AKA | IMS AKA | IPsec ESP | Yes | Mandatory | | plus IPsec | | | | for all UEs | | ESP (see | | | | containing | | 3GPP TS 33 | | | | a UICC, | | .203 [19] | | | | else | | clause 6) | | | | optional. | | | | | | | | | | | | Mandatory | | | | | | for all | | | | | | P-CSCF, | | | | | | I-CSCF, | | | | | | S-CSCF | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | SIP digest | SIP digest | None | No | Optional | | plus check | | (note 3) | | for UEs | | of IP | | | | | | association | | | | Optional | | (see | | | | for P-CSCF, | | 3GPP TS 33 | | | | I-CSCF, | | .203 [19] | | | | S-CSCF | | annex N) | | | | | | (note 2) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | SIP digest | SIP digest | None | No | Optional | | plus Proxy | | (note 3) | | for UEs | | Aut | | | | | | hentication | | | | Optional | | (see | | | | for P-CSCF, | | 3GPP TS 33 | | | | I-CSCF, | | .203 [19] | | | | S-CSCF | | annex N) | | | | | | (note 2) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | SIP digest | SIP digest | TLS session | Yes | Optional | | with TLS | | | | for UEs | | (see | | | | | | 3GPP TS 33 | | | | Optional | | .203 [19] | | | | for P-CSCF, | | annex N and | | | | I-CSCF, | | annex O) | | | | S-CSCF | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | NASS-IMS | not | None | No | No UE | | bundled | applicable | | | support | | aut | (note 1) | (note 3) | | required | | hentication | | | | | | (see | | | | Optional | | 3GPP TS 33 | | | | for P-CSCF, | | .203 [19] | | | | I-CSCF, | | annex R) | | | | S-CSCF | | (notes 4, | | | | | | 5) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | GPRS- | not | None | No | Optional | | IMS-Bundled | applicable | (note 3) | | for UEs | | aut | (note 1) | | | | | hentication | | | | Optional | | (see 3GPP | | | | for P-CSCF, | | TS 33.203 | | | | I-CSCF, | | [19] | | | | S-CSCF | | annex S) | | | | | | (note 5) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
+-----------------+-----------------+----------+----+-----------------+ | Authentication | not applicable | None | No | No UE support | | already | (note 6) | | | required | | performed by | | (note 3) | | | | preceding node | | | | Optional for | | | | | | I-CSCF, S-CSCF | +-----------------+-----------------+----------+----+-----------------+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NOTE 1: Authentication is not provided as part of the IM CN | | subsystem signalling. | | | | NOTE 2: The term \"SIP digest without TLS\" is used in this | | specification to refer to both \"SIP digest plus check of IP | | association\" and \"SIP digest plus Proxy Authentication\". | | | | NOTE 3: This security mechanism does not allow SIP requests to be | | protected using an IPsec security association because it does not | | perform a key agreement procedure. | | | | NOTE 4: A P-Access-Network-Info aware P-CSCF is required in order to | | provide NASS-IMS bundled authentication. | | | | NOTE 5: The P-CSCF is restricted to the home network when performing | | this security mechanism. | | | | NOTE 6: Authentication performed by a trusted, preceding node. For | | example the MSC server enhanced for IMS centralized services has | | authenticated the UE and as a consequence S-CSCF will skip | | authentication. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
Specification of the mechanisms identified within table 4-1 within this
document are provided in clause 5. Subclauses where security procedures are
required consist of a general subclause applicable whichever security
mechanisms are in use, and a separate subclause for each security mechanism
identified by a row within table 4-1.
TLS is optional to implement and is used only in combination with SIP digest
authentication. Authentication associated with registration to the IM CN
subsystem is applicable to IMS AKA and SIP digest and is covered in subclause
5.1.1 for the UE, subclause 5.2.2 for the P-CSCF and subclause 5.4.1 for the
S-CSCF. Additionally, SIP digest allows for authentication to also occur on an
initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, this
additional capability is covered in subclause 5.1.2A and subclause 5.4.3.2.
If a UE that implements SIP digest is configured not to use TLS, then the UE
does not establish a TLS session toward the P-CSCF. If a UE supports TLS, then
the UE supports TLS as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
For SIP digest authentication, the P-CSCF can be configured to have TLS
required or disabled:
\- if TLS is required, the P-CSCF requires the establishment of a TLS session
from all SIP digest UEs, in order to access IMS subsequent to registration; or
\- if TLS is disabled, the P-CSCF does not allow the establishment of a TLS
session from any UE.
NOTE: The mechanism to configure the P-CSCF to have TLS required or disabled
is outside the scope of this specification.
SIP digest cannot be used in conjunction with the procedures of Annex F.
For emergency calls, 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] specifies some relaxations, which are
further described in the subclauses of this document relating to emergency
calls.
3GPP TS 33.210 [19A] defines the security architecture for network domain IP
based control planes. 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A] applies for security mechanisms
between entities in the IM CN subsystem.
### 4.2B.2 Media security
3GPP TS 33.328 [19C] defines mechanisms for support of security on the media
plane.
This document defines the required elements for signalling the support of
media security.
The media security mechanisms are summarised as shown in table 4-2.
Table 4-2: Summary of media security mechanisms to the IM CN subsystem
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Mechanism | Applicable | Support | Support | Network | | | to media | required by | required by | support | | | | UE | IM CN | outside IM | | | | | subsystem | CN | | | | | entities | subsystem | | | | | | entities | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | End-to- | RTP based | Support | P-CSCF | Not | | access-edge | media only. | RFC 3329 | (IMS-ALG) | applicable. | | media | | additions | is | | | security | | specified | required. | | | using SDES. | | in | | | | | | subclau | P-CSCF | | | | | se 7.2A.7.2 | support of | | | | | and SDP | RFC 3329 | | | | | extensions | additions | | | | | specified | specified | | | | | in table | in | | | | | A.317, | subclau | | | | | items | se 7.2A.7.2 | | | | | A.317/34, | and SDP | | | | | A.317/36 | extensions | | | | | and | specified | | | | | A.317/37. | in table | | | | | | A.317, | | | | | | items | | | | | | A.317/34, | | | | | | A.317/36 | | | | | | and | | | | | | A.317/37. | | | | | | | | | | | | (NOTE) | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | End-to-end | RTP based | Support SDP | Not | Not | | media | media only. | extensions | applicable. | applicable. | | security | | specified | | | | using SDES. | | in table | | | | | | A.317, | | | | | | items | | | | | | A.317/34 | | | | | | and | | | | | | A.317/36. | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | End-to-end | RTP based | Support SDP | Not | GBA and KMS | | media | media only. | extensions | applicable. | support | | security | | specified | | required. | | using KMS. | | in table | | | | | | A.317, | | | | | | items | | | | | | A.317/34 | | | | | | and | | | | | | A.317/35. | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | NOTE: | | | | | | Support of | | | | | | end-to- | | | | | | access-edge | | | | | | security is | | | | | | determined | | | | | | entirely by | | | | | | the network | | | | | | operator of | | | | | | the P-CSCF, | | | | | | which need | | | | | | not be the | | | | | | same | | | | | | network | | | | | | operator as | | | | | | that of the | | | | | | S-CSCF. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
For media security, the UE supports the SDES key management protocol and
optionally the KMS key management protocol as defined in 3GPP TS 33.328 [19C]
and SRTP as defined in RFC 3711 [169] for secure transport of media.
There is no support for media security in the MGCF, because there would be no
end-to-end security support on calls interworked with the CS domain and the CS
user. In this release of this document, there is no support for media security
in the MRF. End-to-access-edge security is not impacted by this absence of
support.
For emergency calls, it is not expected that PSAPs would support end-to-end
media security and therefore the procedures of this document do not allow the
UE to establish such sessions with end-to-end security. End-to-access-edge
media security is not impacted and can be used on emergency calls.
When the UE performs the functions of an external attached network (e.g. an
enterprise network):
\- where end-to-access-edge security is used, the UE functionality is expected
to be in the gateway of the external attached network, and support for further
media security is outside the scope of this document; and
\- where end-to-end security is used, the UE functionality is expected to be
supported by the endpoints in the attached network.
## 4.3 Routeing principles of IM CN subsystem entities
Each IM CN subsystem functional entity shall apply loose routeing policy as
described in RFC 3261 [26], when processing a SIP request. In cases where the
I-CSCF, IBCF, S-CSCF and the E-CSCF may interact with strict routers in non IM
CN subsystem networks, the I-CSCF, IBCF, S-CSCF and E-CSCF shall use the
routeing procedures defined in RFC 3261 [26] to ensure interoperability with
strict routers.
## 4.4 Trust domain
### 4.4.1 General
RFC 3325 [34] provides for the existence and trust of an asserted identity
within a trust domain. For the IM CN subsystem, this trust domain consists of
the functional entities that belong to the same operator\'s network (P-CSCF,
the E-CSCF, the I-CSCF, the IBCF, the S-CSCF, the BGCF. the MGCF, the MRFC,
the EATF and all ASs that are included in the trust domain). Additionally,
other nodes within the IM CN subsystem that are not part of the same
operator\'s domain may or may not be part of the trust domain, depending on
whether an interconnect agreement exists with the remote network. SIP
functional entities that belong to a network for which there is an
interconnect agreement are part of the trust domain. ASs outside the
operator\'s network can also belong to the trust domain if they have a trusted
relationship with the home network.
NOTE 1: Whether any peer functional entity is regarded as part of the same
operator\'s domain, and therefore part of the same trust domain, is dependent
on operator policy which is preconfigured into each functional entity.
NOTE 2: For the purpose of this document, the PSAP is typically regarded as
being within the trust domain, except where indicated. National regulator
policy applicable to emergency services determines the trust domain applicable
to certain header fields. This means that e.g. the handling of the P-Access-
Network-Info header field, P-Asserted-Identity header field and the History-
Info header field can be as if the PSAP is within the trust domain, and trust
domain issues will be resolved accordingly.
Within the IM CN subsystem trust domains will be applied to a number of header
fields. These trust domains do not necessarily contain the same functional
entities or cover the same operator domains. The procedures in this subclause
apply to the functional entities in clause 5 in the case where a trust domain
boundary exists at that functional entity.
Where the IM CN subsystem supports business communication, different trust
domains can apply to public network traffic, and to private network traffic
belonging to each supported corporate network.
NOTE 3: Where an external attached network (e.g. an enterprise network) is in
use, the edges of the trust domains need not necessarily lie at the P-CSCF. In
this release of the specification, the means by which the P-CSCF learns of
such attached devices, and therefore different trust domain requirements to
apply, is not provided in the specification and is assumed to be by
configuration or by a mechanism outside the scope of this release of the
specification.
A trust domain applies for the purpose of the following header fields:
P-Asserted-Identity, P-Access-Network-Info, History-Info, Resource-Priority,
P-Asserted-Service, Reason (only in a response), P-Profile-Key, P-Private-
Network-Indication, P-Served-User, and P-Early-Media. A trust domain applies
for the purpose of the CPC and OLI tel URI parameters. The trust domains of
these header fields and parameters need not have the same boundaries. Clause 5
defines additional procedures concerning these header fields.
### 4.4.2 P-Asserted-Identity
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the P-Asserted-Identity header field according to RFC 3325
[34] when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the trust domain. Subclause
5.4 identifies additional cases for the removal of the P-Asserted-Identity
header field.
### 4.4.3 P-Access-Network-Info
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain shall remove any
P-Access-Network-Info header field.
### 4.4.4 History-Info
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the History-Info header field according to RFC 4244 [66]
subclause 3.3 when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the trust domain.
Subclause 5.4 identifies additional cases for the removal of the History-Info
header field.
### 4.4.5 P-Asserted-Service
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the P-Asserted-Service header field according to RFC 6050
[121] when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the trust domain.
### 4.4.6 Resource-Priority
A functional entity shall only include a Resource-Priority header field in a
request or response forwarded to another entity within the trust domain. If a
request or response is forwarded to an entity outside the trust domain, the
functional entity shall remove the Resource-Priority header field from the
forwarded request or response. If a request or response is received from an
untrusted entity (with the exception requests or responses received by the
P-CSCF from the UE for which procedures are defined in subclause 5.2) that
contains the Resource-Priority header field, the functional entity shall
remove the Resource-Priority header field before forwarding the request or
response within the trust domain.
### 4.4.7 Reason (in a response)
A functional entity shall only include a Reason header field in a response
forwarded to another entity within the trust domain (as specified in RFC 6432
[130]). If a response is forwarded to an entity outside the trust domain, the
functional entity shall remove the Reason header field from the forwarded
response.
NOTE: A Reason header field can be received in a response from outside the
trust domain and will not be removed.
### 4.4.8 P-Profile-Key
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the P-Profile-Key header field as defined in RFC 5002 [97]
when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the trust domain.
### 4.4.9 P-Served-User
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the P-Served-User header field according to RFC 5502 [133]
when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the trust domain.
### 4.4.10 P-Private-Network-Indication
A functional entity shall only include a P-Private-Network-Indication header
field in a request forwarded to another entity within the trust domain. If a
request is forwarded to an entity outside the trust domain, the functional
entity shall remove the P-Private-Network-Indication header field from the
forwarded request. If a request is received from an untrusted entity that
contains the P-Private-Network-Indication header field, the functional entity
shall remove the P-Private-Network-Indication header field before forwarding
the request within the trust domain.
NOTE 1: Other entities within the enterprise will frequently be part of this
trust domain.
NOTE 2: The presence of the P-Private-Network-Indication header field is an
indication that the request constitutes private network traffic. This can
modify the trust domain behaviour for other header fields.
NOTE 3: If a trust domain boundary is encountered for this header field
without appropriate business communication processing, then this can be an
indication that misconfiguration has occurred in the IM CN subsystem. Removal
of this header field changes the request from private network traffic to
public network traffic.
### 4.4.11 P-Early-Media
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the P-Early-Media header field as defined in RFC 5009 [109]
when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the trust domain.
### 4.4.12 CPC and OLI
Entities in the IM CN subsystem shall restrict \"cpc\" and \"oli\" URI
parameters to specific domains that are trusted and support the \"cpc\" and
\"oli\" URI parameters. Therefore for the purpose of the \"cpc\" and \"oli\"
URI parameters within this specification, a trust domain also applies.
SIP functional entities within the trust domain shall remove the \"cpc\" and
\"oli\" URI parameters when the SIP signalling crosses the boundary of the
trust domain.
## 4.5 Charging correlation principles for IM CN subsystems
### 4.5.1 Overview
This subclause describes charging correlation principles to aid with the
readability of charging related procedures in clause 5. See 3GPP TS 32.240
[16] and 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] for further information on charging.
The IM CN subsystem generates and retrieves the following charging correlation
information for later use with offline and online charging:
1\. IM CN subsystem Charging Identifier (ICID);
2\. Access network charging information;
3\. Inter Operator Identifier (IOI);
4\. Charging function addresses:
a. Charging Data Function (CDF);
b. Online Charging Function (OCF).
How to use and where to generate the parameters in IM CN subsystems are
described further in the subclauses that follow. The charging correlation
information is encoded in the P-Charging-Vector header field as defined in
subclause 7.2A.5. The P-Charging-Vector header field contains the following
header field parameters: \"icid-value\", \"access-network-charging-info\", and
\"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\".
The offline and online charging function addresses are encoded in the
P-Charging-Function-Addresses as defined in RFC 3455 [52]. The P-Charging-
Function-Addresses header field contains the following header field
parameters: \"ccf\" for CDF and \"ecf\" for OCF.
NOTE: P-Charging-Function-Addresses parameters were defined using previous
terminology.
### 4.5.2 IM CN subsystem charging identifier (ICID)
The ICID is the session level data shared among the IM CN subsystem entities
including ASs in both the calling and called IM CN subsystems. The ICID is
used also for session unrelated messages (e.g. SUBSCRIBE request, NOTIFY
request, MESSAGE request) for the correlation with CDRs generated among the IM
CN subsystem entities.
The first IM CN subsystem entity involved in a SIP transaction will generate
the ICID and include it in the \"icid-value\" header field parameter of the
P-Charging-Vector header field in the SIP request. For a dialog relating to a
session, this will be performed only on the INVITE request, for all other
transactions, it will occur on each SIP request. See 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] for
requirements on the format of ICID. The P-CSCF will generate an ICID for UE-
originated calls. The I-CSCF will generate an ICID for UE-terminated calls if
there is no ICID received in the initial request (e.g. the calling party
network does not behave as an IM CN subsystem). The AS will generate an ICID
when acting as an originating UA. The MGCF will generate an ICID for PSTN/PLMN
originated calls. Each entity that processes the SIP request will extract the
ICID for possible later use in a CDR. The I-CSCF and S-CSCF are also allowed
to generate a new ICID for UE-terminated calls received from another network.
There is also an ICID generated by the P-CSCF with a REGISTER request that is
passed in a unique instance of P-Charging-Vector header field. The valid
duration of the ICID is specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
The \"icid-value\" header field parameter is included in any request that
includes the P-Charging-Vector header field. However, the P-Charging-Vector
(and ICID) is not passed to the UE.
The ICID is also passed from the P-CSCF to the IP-CAN via PCRF. The interface
supporting this operation is outside the scope of this document.
### 4.5.3 Access network charging information
#### 4.5.3.1 General
The access network charging information are the media flow level data shared
among the IM CN subsystem entities for one side of the session (either the
calling or called side). GPRS charging information (GGSN identifier and PDP
context information) is an example of access network charging information.
#### 4.5.3.2 Access network charging information
The IP-CAN provides the access network charging information to the IM CN
subsystem. This information is used to correlate IP-CAN CDRs with IM CN
subsystem CDRs, i.e. the access network charging information is used to
correlate the bearer level with the session level.
The access network charging information is generated at the first opportunity
after the resources are allocated at the IP-CAN. The access network charging
information is passed from IP-CAN to P-CSCF via PCRF, over the Rx and Gx
interfaces. Access network charging information will be updated with new
information during the session as media flows are added or removed. The P-CSCF
provides the access network charging information to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF may
also pass the information to an AS, which may be needed for online pre-pay
applications. The access network charging information for the originating
network is used only within that network, and similarly the access network
charging information for the terminating network is used only within that
network. Thus the access network charging information are not shared between
the calling and called networks. The access network charging information is
not passed towards the external ASs from its own network.
The access network charging information is populated in the P-Charging-Vector
header field.
### 4.5.4 Inter operator identifier (IOI)
The Inter Operator Identifier (IOI) is a globally unique identifier to share
between sending and receiving networks, service providers or content
providers.
The sending network populates the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter of the
P-Charging-Vector header field in a request and thereby identifies the
operator network from which the request originated. The \"term-ioi\" header
field parameter is left out of the P-Charging-Vector header field in this
request. The sending network retrieves the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter
from the P-Charging-Vector header field within the message sent in response,
which identifies the operator network from which the response was sent.
The receiving network retrieves the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter from
the P-Charging-Vector header field in the request, which identifies the
operator network from which the request originated. The receiving network
populates the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter of the P-Charging-Vector
header field in the response to the request, which identifies the operator
network from which the response was sent.
There are three types of IOI:
\- Type 1 IOI, between the P-CSCF (possibly in the visited network) and the
S-CSCF in the home network. This is exchanged in REGISTER requests and
responses.
\- Type 2 IOI, between the S-CSCF of the home originating network and the
S-CSCF of the home terminating network or between the S-CSCF of the home
originating network and the MGCF when a call/session is terminated at the
PSTN/PLMN or between the MGCF and the S-CSCF of the home terminating network
when a call/session is originated from the PSTN/PLMN or with a PSI AS when
accessed across I-CSCF. This is exchanged in all session-related and session-
unrelated requests and responses. For compatibility issues related to CS
charging system behaviour simulation, the S-CSCF in the terminating network
shall forward the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter from the P-Charging-
Vector header field in the initial request, which identifies the operator
network from which the request originated.
\- Type 3 IOI, between the S-CSCF or I-CSCF of the home operator network and
any AS. Type 3 IOI are also used between E-CSCF and LRF, and between E-CSCF
and EATF. The type 3 IOI is exchanged in all session-related and session-
unrelated requests and responses.
Each entity that processes the SIP request will extract the IOI for possible
later use in a CDR. The valid duration of the IOI is specified in 3GPP TS
32.240 [16].
### 4.5.5 Charging function addresses
Charging function addresses are distributed to each of the IM CN subsystem
entities in the home network for one side of the session (either the calling
or called side) and provide a common location for each entity to send charging
information. Charging Data Function (CDF) addresses are used for offline
billing. Online Charging Function (OCF) addresses are used for online billing.
There may be multiple addresses for CDF and OCF addresses populated into the
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field of the SIP request or response. The
header field parameters are \"ccf\" and \"ecf\" for CDF and OCF, respectively.
At least one instance of either \"ccf\" or \"ecf\" header field paramter is
required. If \"ccf\" header field parameter is included for offline charging,
then a secondary \"ccf\" header field paramter may be included by each network
for redundancy purposes, but the first instance of \"ccf\" header field
parameter is the primary address. If ecf address is included for online
charging, then a secondary instance may also be included for redundancy.
The CDF and/or OCF addresses are retrieved from an Home Subscriber Server
(HSS) via the Cx interface and passed by the S-CSCF to subsequent entities.
The charging function addresses are passed from the S-CSCF to the IM CN
subsystem entities in its home network, but are not passed to the visited
network or the UE. When the P-CSCF is allocated in the visited network, then
the charging function addresses are obtained by means outside the scope of
this document. The AS receives the charging function addresses from the S-CSCF
via the ISC interface. CDF and/or OCF addresses may be allocated as locally
preconfigured addresses. The AS can also retrieve the charging function
address from the HSS via Sh interface.
## 4.6 Support of local service numbers
For the IM CN subsystem, the support of local service numbers is provided by
an AS in the subscriber\'s home network as described in subclause 5.7.1.7.
## 4.7 Emergency service
The need for support of emergency calls in the IM CN subsystem is determined
by national regulatory requirements.
If the UE cannot detect the emergency call attempt, the UE initiates the
request as per normal procedures as described in subclause 5.1.2A. Depending
on network policies, for a non-roaming UE an emergency call attempt can
succeed even if the UE did not detect that an emergency session is being
requested, otherwise the network rejects the request indicating to the UE that
the attempt was for an emergency service.
The UE procedures for UE detectable emergency calls are defined in subclause
5.1.6.
The P CSCF, S-CSCF, and E-CSCF procedures for emergency service are described
in subclause 5.2.10, 5.4.8 and 5.11, respectively.
Access dependent aspects of emergency service (e.g. emergency registration
support and location provision) are defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology.
There are a number of variants within these procedures and which variant gets
used depends on a number of issues. These conditions are defined more
specifically in 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] and, where appropriate, in the access
technology specific annex, but are summarised as follows:
a) if the UE knows that it is in its own home network, then an existing
registration is permitted to be used for signalling the emergency call, except
where item c) applies. The access technology specific annexes define the
mechanism by which home network determination is made;
b) if emergency calls are permitted without security credentials (or
additionally where the authentication is not possible or has failed), then the
emergency call is made directly without use of any security association
created by a registration, and therefore without the registration; and
c) where the access technology defines emergency bearers for the support of
emergency calls, a new emergency registration is required so that these
emergency bearers can be used for both signalling and media, unless an
existing emergency registration exists on those emergency bearers.
A number of mechanisms also exist for providing location in support of
emergency calls, both for routeing to a PSAP, and for use by the PSAP itself,
in the IM CN subsystem:
a) by the inclusion by the UE of the Geolocation header field containing a
location by reference or by value (see RFC 6442 [89]);
b) by the inclusion by the UE of a P-Access-Network-Info header field, which
contains a cell identifier or location identitifier, which is subsequently
mapped, potentially by the recipient, into a real location;
c) by the inclusion by the P-CSCF of a P-Access-Network-Info header field
based on information supplied by either the PCRF or the NASS, and which
contains a cell identifier or location identitifier, which is subsequently
mapped, potentially by the recipient, into a real location;
d) by the allocation of a location reference that relates to the call by the
LRF. Location is then supplied to the recipient over the Le interface (see
3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] for a definition of the Le interface) along with other
call information. The LRF can obtain the location from entities outside the IM
CN subsystem, e.g. by the e2 interface from the NASS (see ETSI TS 283 035 [98]
or from the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC).
Mechanisms also exist for providing emergency-related information to a PSAP,
in requests subsequent to routeing an initial request to a PSAP, in the IM CN
subsystem:
a) by the inclusion by the UE of the Geolocation header field containing a
location by reference or by value (see RFC 6442 [89]);
b) by the inclusion by the UE of a P-Access-Network-Info header field, which
contains a cell identifier or location identitifier, which is subsequently
mapped, potentially by the recipient, into a real location;
c) by the inclusion by the P-CSCF of a P-Access-Network-Info header field
based on information supplied by either the PCRF or the NASS, and which
contains a cell identifier or location identitifier, which is subsequently
mapped, potentially by the recipient, into a real location;
d) by the inclusion by the UE of the emergency-related information as
specified in subclause 5.1.6.10.
The E-CSCF routes such a subsequent request to the PSAP using normal SIP
procedures. If operator policy determines that an LRF is to be used, this
version of the specification does not specify that the emergency-related
information in such a subsequent request received by the E-CSCF is provided to
the LRF.
NOTE 1: Mechanisms independent from SIP for providing the emergency related
information to a PSAP after session setup exist and are not listed. The use of
such mechanisms is not precluded.
Which means of providing location is used depends on local regulatory and
operator requirements. One or more mechanisms can be used. Location can be
subject to privacy constraints.
NOTE 2: A similar variety of mechanisms also exists for normal calls, where
location may be made use of by the recipient or by an intermediate AS, again
subject to privacy constraints. The LRF is not involved in a normal call, but
an AS can obtain location from the e2 interface from the NASS (see ETSI TS 283
035 [98] or from the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC).
## 4.8 Void
## 4.9 Overlap signalling
### 4.9.1 General
This subclause explains the overlap signalling impacts on the core entities of
the IM CN subsystem.
The support of overlap signalling, and each of the overlap signalling method,
within the IM CN subsystem, are optional and is dependent on the network
policy.
Only one overlap signalling method shall be used within one IM CN subsystem.
NOTE: Interworking between the overlap signalling methods is not specified in
this release.
### 4.9.2 Overlap signalling methods
#### 4.9.2.1 In-dialog method
##### 4.9.2.1.1 General
The in-dialog method uses INFO requests or INVITE requests in order to
transport additional digits. Before an early dialog has been established, upon
reception of a 404 (Not Found) or 484 (Address Incomplete) response to an
earlier INVITE request, new INVITE requests will be sent to transfer
additional digits (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B]). Once an entity
establishes an early dialog, by sending a provisional response to a INVITE
request, INFO requests will be sent to carry additional digits on the early
dialog.
The message body, and associated header values, which is used to carry
additional digits in INFO requests is defined in 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B].
#### 4.9.2.2 Multiple-INVITE method
##### 4.9.2.2.1 General
The multiple-INVITE method uses INVITE requests with the same Call ID and From
header in order to transport digits (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B]).
### 4.9.3 Routeing impacts
#### 4.9.3.1 General
If overlap dialing is supported, the IM CN subsystem needs to be configured in
such a manner that erroneous routeing of INVITE requests with incomplete
numbers towards others entities than the corresponding INVITE requests with
full numbers is avoided, for instance towards a default destination for
unknown numbers such as a PSTN. Possibly impacted nodes include the S-CSCF for
the UE-originated case, the transit routeing function, the I-CSCF, and
application servers.
A misrouteing can be avoided by configuring the entity sending overlap
signalling in such a manner that it will send the first INVITE request with a
sufficient number of digits to find a suitable entry in the translation
database. If ENUM is used, the ENUM database in a typical deployment contains
sufficient information about the first digits, as required to identify the
destination IP domain. Therefore, ENUM is able to handle incomplete numbers in
such deployments. As another alternative, the routeing entity can reject calls
with unknown numbers with a 404 (Not Found) response, using entries in the
routeing database to identify calls towards the PSTN. The S-CSCF for the UE-
originated case could also forward calls with unknown numbers to the BGCF, if
the BGCF is configured to reject calls to unknown destinations with a 404 (Not
Found) response.
#### 4.9.3.2 Deterministic routeing
If the multiple-INVITE method is used for overlap signalling, if an entity
receives a INVITE request outside an existing dialog with the same Call ID and
From header field as a previous INVITE request during a certain period of
time, the entity shall route the new INVITE request to the same next hop as
the previous INVITE request.
NOTE: INVITE requests with the same Call ID and From header fields received in
sequence during a certain period of time belong to the same call. The routeing
towards the same next hop could be achieved by an appropriately configured
database or by the entity comparing the Call ID and From header fields of each
INVITE request outside an existing dialog with Call IDs and \"tag\" From
header field parameters of previous INVITE requests. If the entity compares
the Call ID and From header field, it stores the information about received
Call ID and From header fields at least for a time in the order of call setup
times. If paths have been established at registration time, deterministic
routeing will be automatic for entities on these paths.
#### 4.9.3.3 Digit collection
Entities performing routeing decicisions may require additional digits for a
decision where to route an INVITE request. These entities may interact with a
routeing database to reach this decision.
If no suitable entry in a database is found for the digits received in a
INVITE request, an entity can reject the INVITE request with a 404 (Not Found)
or 484 (Address Incomplete) response. This method of digit collection can be
performed by a SIP proxy and is suitable both for the in-dialog and multiple-
INVITE overlap signalling methods. Replying with a 404 (Not Found) response
avoids the need to keep apart uncomplete and unknown numbers. The 484 (Address
Incomplete) response requires the recognition of incomplete numbers.
NOTE: An HSS does not support the recognition of incomplete numbers. A
routeing database being queried by ENUM also does not support the recognition
of incomplete numbers.
As an alternative for the in-dialogue method, the digit collection function
described in annex N.2 may be invoked. It shall be performed by an entity
acting as a B2BUA. The digit collection function requires the ability to
recognise incomplete number.
## 4.10 Dialog correlation for IM CN subsystems
### 4.10.1 General
The Call-ID header field in combination with the tags in the From header field
and in the To header field is the standard mechanism to identify SIP messages
which belong to the same dialog. However the Call-ID header field is often
changed by B2BUAs and other SIP intermediaries in the end-to-end message path.
To solve this problem, a Session-ID header field containing a globally unique
session identifier, as defined in RFC 7329 [162], can be used to correlate SIP
messages belonging to the same session. In the case of a concatenation of
dialogs, the dialog correlation mechanism indicates that these dialogs belong
to the same session.
The usage of the Session-ID header field is specified in annex A.
### 4.10.2 CONF usage
In case of the activation of a 3PTY conference, in the INVITE request to the
CONF AS the Session-ID header field is added to the URIs in the URI list, in
order to indicate the dialogs which are to be included to the 3PTY conference
at the CONF AS, as described in 3GPP TS 24.147 [8B].
# 5 Application usage of SIP
## 5.1 Procedures at the UE
### 5.1.0 General
The UE procedures for UE detectable emergency calls are defined in subclause
5.1.6. Exceptions to procedures for SIP that do not relate to emergency, are
documented in subclause 5.1.6 and shall apply.
### 5.1.1 Registration and authentication
#### 5.1.1.1 General
The UE shall register public user identities (see table A.4/1 and dependencies
on that major capability).
NOTE 1: The UE can use multiple Contact header field parameter values
simultaneously containing the same IP address and port number.
In case a UE registers several public user identities at different points in
time, the procedures to re-register, deregister and subscribe to the
registration-state event package for these public user identities can remain
uncoordinated in time.
The UE can register any one of its public user identities with any **IP
address acquired by the UE**. The same public user identity can be bound to
**more than one IP address of the UE**. While having valid registrations of
previously registered public user identities, the UE can register any
additional public user identity with any of its IP addresses. When binding any
one of its public user identities to an additional contact address, the UE
shall follow the procedures described in RFC 5626 [92].
If SIP digest without TLS is used, the UE shall not include signalling plane
security mechanisms in the header fields defined in RFC 3329 [48] in any SIP
messages.
NOTE 2: The UE determines if SIP digest is used with or without TLS based on
device configuration. If SIP digest with TLS is used, then the UE includes the
TLS signalling plane security mechanism in the header fields defined in RFC
3329 [48] as described in subclause 5.1.1.2.4.
SIP requests that indicate security mechanisms for both the signalling plane
and the media plane can contain multiple instances or a single instance of the
Security-Client, Security-Verify, or Security-Server header fields defined in
RFC 3329 [48].
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT, the UE may need to modify the SIP contents according
to the procedures described in either annex F or annex K.
NOTE 3: If UE populates the display-name of the Contact header field included
in the REGISTER request with UE name, other UEs of the user can discover the
UE name of the UE in the reg event package notification. The UE name is a text
string chosen by the user allowing the user to distinguish individual UEs of
the same user.
#### 5.1.1.1A Parameters contained in the ISIM
This subclause applies when a UE contains either an ISIM or a USIM.
The ISIM shall always be used for authentication to the IM CN subsystem, if it
is present, as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
The ISIM is preconfigured with all the necessary parameters to initiate the
registration to the IM CN subsystem. These parameters include:
\- the private user identity;
\- one or more public user identities; and
\- the home network domain name used to address the SIP REGISTER request
The first public user identity in the list stored in the ISIM is used in
emergency registration requests.
In case the UE does not contain an ISIM, the UE shall:
\- generate a private user identity;
\- generate a temporary public user identity; and
\- generate a home network domain name to address the SIP REGISTER request to;
in accordance with the procedures in clause C.2.
The temporary public user identity is only used in REGISTER requests, i.e.
initial registration, re-registration, UE-initiated deregistration.
The UE shall not reveal to the user the temporary public user identity if the
temporary public user identity is barred. The temporary public user identity
is not barred if received by the UE in the P-Associated-URI header field.
If the UE is unable to derive the parameters in this subclause for any reason,
then the UE shall not proceed with the request associated with the use of
these parameters and will not be able to register to the IM CN subsystem.
#### 5.1.1.1B Parameters provisioned to a UE without ISIM or USIM
##### 5.1.1.1B.1 Parameters provisioned in the IMC
In case the UE contains neither an ISIM nor a USIM, but IMC is present the UE
shall use preconfigured parameters in the IMC to initiate the registration to
the IM CN subsystem and for authentication.
The following IMS parameters are assumed to be available to the UE:
\- a private user identity;
\- a public user identity; and
\- a home network domain name to address the SIP REGISTER request to.
These parameters may not necessarily reside in a UICC.
The first public user identity in the list stored in the IMC is used in
emergency registration requests.
##### 5.1.1.1B.2 Parameters when UE does not contain ISIM, USIM or IMC
If the UE contains neither ISIM, nor USIM nor IMC, the UE shall generate a
temporary public user identity, a private user identity and a home network
domain name to address the SIP REGISTER request to, according 3GPP TS 23.003
[3].
#### 5.1.1.2 Initial registration
##### 5.1.1.2.1 General
The initial registration procedure consists of the UE sending an unprotected
REGISTER request and, if challenged depending on the security mechanism
supported for this UE, sending the integrity-protected REGISTER request or
other appropriate response to the challenge. The UE can register a public user
identity with any of its contact addresses at any time after it has acquired
an IP address, discovered a P-CSCF, and established an IP-CAN bearer that can
be used for SIP signalling. However, the UE shall only initiate a new
registration procedure when it has received a final response from the
registrar for the ongoing registration, or the previous REGISTER request has
timed out.
When registering any public user identity belonging to the UE, the UE shall
either use an already active pair of security associations or a TLS session to
protect the REGISTER requests, or register the public user identity via a new
initial registration procedure.
When binding any one of its public user identities to an additional contact
address via a new initial registration procedure, the UE shall follow the
procedures described in RFC 5626 [92]. The set of security associations or a
TLS session resulting from this initial registration procedure will have no
impact on the existing set of security associations or TLS sessions that have
been established as a result of previous initial registration procedures.
However, if the UE registers any one of its public user identities with a new
contact address via a new initial registration procedure and does not employ
the procedures described in RFC 5626 [92], then the new set of security
associations or TLS session shall replace any existing set of security
association or TLS session.
If the UE detects that the existing security associations or TLS sessions
associated with a given contact address are no longer active (e.g., after
receiving no response to several protected messages), the UE shall:
\- consider all previously registered public user identities bound to this
security associations or TLS session that are only associated with this
contact address as deregistered; and
\- stop processing all associated ongoing dialogs and transactions that were
using the security associations or TLS session associated with this contact
address, if any (i.e. no further SIP signalling will be sent by the UE on
behalf of these transactions or dialogs).
The UE shall send the unprotected REGISTER requests to the port advertised to
the UE during the P-CSCF discovery procedure. If the UE does not receive any
specific port information during the P-CSCF discovery procedure, or if the UE
was pre-configured with the P-CSCF\'s IP address or domain name and was unable
to obtain specific port information, the UE shall send the unprotected
REGISTER request to the SIP default port values as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 1: The UE will only send further registration and subsequent SIP messages
towards the same port of the P-CSCF for security mechanisms that do not
require to use negotiated ports for exchanging protected messages.
The UE shall extract or derive a public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration, according to the procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.1A or
subclause 5.1.1.1B. A public user identity may be input by the end user.
On sending an unprotected REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header
fields as follows:
a) a From header field set to the SIP URI that contains the public user
identity to be registered;
b) a To header field set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity
to be registered;
c) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI(s) containing the IP address
or FQDN of the UE in the hostport parameter. If the UE supports GRUU (see
table A.4, item A.4/53) or multiple registrations, the UE shall include a
\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter containing the instance ID. If the UE
supports multiple registrations it shall include \"reg-id\" header field
parameter as described in RFC 5626 [92]. The UE shall include all supported
ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref
media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS
communication services it intends to use, and IARI values (coded as specified
in subclause 7.2A.9.2), for the IMS applications it intends to use in a
g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3840
[62];
d) a Via header field set to include the sent-by field containing the IP
address or FQDN of the UE and the port number where the UE expects to receive
the response to this request when UDPis used. For TCP, the response is
received on the TCP connection on which the request was sent. The UE shall
also include a \"rport\" header field parameter with no value in the Via
header field. Unless the UE has been configured to not send keep-alives, and
unless the UE is directly connected to an IP-CAN for which usage of NAT is not
defined, it shall include a \"keep\" header field parameter with no value in
the Via header field, in order to indicate support of sending keep-alives
associated with the registration, as described in RFC 6223 [143];
NOTE 2: When sending the unprotected REGISTER request using UDP, the UE
transmit the request from the same IP address and port on which it expects to
receive the response to this request.
e) a registration expiration interval value of 600 000 seconds as the value
desired for the duration of the registration;
NOTE 3: The registrar (S-CSCF) might decrease the duration of the registration
in accordance with network policy. Registration attempts with a registration
period of less than a predefined minimum value defined in the registrar will
be rejected with a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
f) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network
used to address the REGISTER request;
g) the Supported header field containing the option-tag \"path\", and
1) if GRUU is supported, the option-tag \"gruu\"; and
> 2) if multiple registrations is supported, the option-tag \"outbound\".
h) if a security association or TLS session exists, and if available to the UE
(as defined in the access technology specific annexes for each access
technology), a P-Access-Network-Info header field set as specified for the
access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4); and
i) a Security-Client header field to announce the media plane security
mechanisms the UE supports, if any, labelled with the \"mediasec\" header
field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7.
NOTE 4: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, the UE
shall:
a) if available, store the announcement of media plane security mechanisms the
P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field
parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the Security-Server
header field, if any. Once the UE chooses a media security mechanism from the
list received in the Security-Server header field from the server, the UE may
initiate that mechanism on a media level when it initiates new media in an
existing session.
NOTE 5: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
a) store the expiration time of the registration for the public user
identities found in the To header field value and bind it either to the
respective contact address of the UE or to the registration flow and the
associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used);
b) store as the default public user identity the first URI on the list of URIs
present in the P-Associated-URI header field and bind it to the respective
contact address of the UE and the associated set of security associations or
TLS session;
> NOTE 6: When using the respective contact address and associated set of
> security associations or TLS session, the UE can utilize additional URIs
> contained in the P-Associated-URI header field and bound it to the
> respective contact address of the UE and the associated set of security
> associations or TLS session, e.g. for application purposes.
c) treat the identity under registration as a barred public user identity, if
it is not included in the P-Associated-URI header field;
d) store the list of service route values contained in the Service-Route
header field and bind the list either to the contact address or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used), and the associated set of security
associations or TLS session over which the REGISTER request was sent;
NOTE 7: When multiple registration mechanism is not used, there will be only
one list of service route values bound to a contact address. However, when
multiple registration mechanism is used, there will be different list of
service route values bound to each registration flow and the associated
contact address.
NOTE 8: The UE will use the stored list of service route values to build a
proper preloaded Route header field for new dialogs and standalone
transactions when using either the respective contact address or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used), and the associated set of security
associations or TLS session.
e) find the Contact header field within the response that matches the one
included in the REGISTER request. If this contains a \"pub-gruu\" header field
parameter or a \"temp-gruu\" header field parameter or both, and the UE
supports GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53), then store the value of those
parameters as the GRUUs for the UE in association with the public user
identity and the contact address that was registered;
f) if the REGISTER request contained the \"reg-id\" and \"+sip.instance\"
Contact header field parameter and the \"outbound\" option tag in a Supported
header field, the UE shall check whether the option-tag \"outbound\" is
present in the Require header field:
\- if no option-tag \"outbound\" is present, the UE shall conclude that the
S-CSCF does not support the registration procedure as described in RFC 5626
[92], and the S-CSCF has followed the registration procedure as described in
RFC 5627 [93] or RFC 3261 [26], i.e., if there is a previously registered
contact address, the S-CSCF replaced the old contact address and associated
information with the new contact address and associated information (see
bullet e) above). Upon detecting that the S-CSCF does not support the
registration procedure as defined in RFC 5626 [92], the UE shall refrain from
registering any additional IMS flows for the same private identity as
described in RFC 5626 [92]; or
NOTE 9: Upon replaces the old contact address with the new contact address,
the S-CSCF performs the network initiated deregistration procedure for the
previously registered public user identities and the associated old contact
address as described in subclause 5.4.1.5. Hence, the UE will receive a NOTIFY
request informing the UE about thederegistration of the old contact address.
\- if an option-tag \"outbound\" is present, the UE may establish additional
IMS flows for the same private identity, as defined in RFC 5626 [92];
g) if available, store the announcement of media plane security mechanisms the
P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field
parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the Security-Server
header field, if any. Once the UE chooses a media security mechanism from the
list received in the Security-Server header field from the server, it may
initiate that mechanism on a media level when it initiates new media in an
existing session; and
NOTE 10: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
h) if the Via header field contains a \"keep\" header field parameter with a
value, unless the UE detects that it is not behind a NAT, start to send keep-
alives associated with the registration towards the P-CSCF, as described in
RFC 6223 [143].
On receiving a 305 (Use Proxy) response to the unprotected REGISTER request,
the UE shall:
a) ignore the contents of the Contact header field if it is included in the
received message;
NOTE 11: The 305 response is not expected to contain a Contact header field.
b) release all IP-CAN bearers used for the transport of media according to the
procedures in subclause 9.2.2;
c) initiate either a new P-CSCF discovery procedure as described in subclause
9.2.1, or select a new P-CSCF, if the UE was pre-configured with more than one
P-CSCF\'s IP addresses or domain names;
d) select a P-CSCF address, which is different from the previously used
address, from the address list; and
e) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
On receiving a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response to the REGISTER request, the
UE shall:
\- send another REGISTER request populating the registration expiration
interval value with an expiration timer of at least the value received in the
Min-Expires header field of the 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
On receiving a 408 (Request Timeout) response or 500 (Server Internal Error)
response or 504 (Server Time-Out) or 600 (Busy Everywhere) response for an
initial registration, the UE may attempt to perform initial registration
again.
When the timer F expires at the UE, the UE may:
a) select a different P-CSCF address from the list of P-CSCF addresses
discovered during the procedures described in subclause 9.2.1 or from its pre-
configured list of P-CSCF\'s IP addresses or domain names;
b) if no response has been received when attempting to contact all P-CSCFs
known by the UE, the UE may get a new set of P-CSCF-addresses as described in
subclause 9.2.1; and
c) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
NOTE 12: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means than expiration of timer F, e.g. based on ICMP
messages.
On receiving a 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the REGISTER request, whereby the
response contains a Retry-After header field, the UE shall not automatically
attempt an initial registration via the same IP-CAN and the same P-CSCF for
the amount of time indicated in the Retry-After header field. If the UE is
power cycled, the UE can attempt an initial registration. If no initial
registration occurs within the time period indicated by the Retry-After header
field, the counter of unsuccessful initial registration attempts is reset.
After a first unsuccessful initial registration attempt, if the Retry-After
header field was not present and the initial registration was not performed as
a consequence of a failed reregistration, the UE shall not wait more than 5
minutes before attempting a new registration.
After a maximum of 2 consecutive unsuccessful initial registration attempts,
if the Retry-After header field was not present in failure responses of those
unsuccessful initial registration attempts, the UE shall implement the
mechanism defined in subclause 4.5 of RFC 5626 [92] for new registration
attemps. The UE shall use the values of the parameters max-time and base-time,
of the algorithm defined in subclause 4.5 of RFC 5626 [92]. If no values of
the parameters max-time and base-time have been provided to the UE by the
network, the default values defined in in subclause 4.5 of RFC 5626 [92] shall
be used.
The values of max-time and base-time parameters are provided by the network to
the UE through means outside the scope of the present specification.
##### 5.1.1.2.2 Initial registration using IMS AKA
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field, with:
\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter, set to the domain name of the home
network;
\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to an empty value; and
\- the \"response\" header field parameter, set to an empty value;
NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the hostport parameter in the Contact
header field and in the sent-by field in the Via header field, then it has to
ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the
IP address that is bound to the security association.
NOTE 2: The UE associates two ports, a protected client port and a protected
server port, with each pair of security association. For details on the
selection of the port values see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
b) additionally for the Contact header field, if the REGISTER request is
protected by a security association, include the protected server port value
in the hostport parameter;
c) additionally for the Via header field, for UDP, if the REGISTER request is
protected by a security association, include the protected server port value
in the sent-by field; and
d) a Security-Client header field set to specify the signalling plane security
mechanism the UE supports, the IPsec layer algorithms the UE supports and the
parameters needed for the security association setup. The UE shall support the
setup of two pairs of security associations as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
The syntax of the parameters needed for the security association setup is
specified in annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE shall support the
\"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The UE shall
support the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and confidentiality
protection as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], and shall announce support for
them according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329 [48].
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall additionally:
1) If the UE supports multiple registrations and the REGISTER request
contained the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter and the \"reg-id\"
header field parameter in the Contact header field, and the \"outbound\"
option-tag in the Supported header field, the UE shall check whether the
option-tag \"outbound\" is present in the Require header field. If the option-
tag \"outbound\" is present, then the UE shall use the bidirectional flow as
defined in RFC 5626 [92] as follows:
a) for UDP, the bidirectional flow consists of two unidirectional flows, i.e.
the first unidirectional flow is identified with the UE\'s protected client
port, the P-CSCF\'s protected server port, and the respective IP addresses.
The UE uses this flow to send the requests and responses to the P-CSCF. The
second unidirectional flow is identified with the P-CSCF\'s protected client
port, the UE\'s protected server port and the IP addresses. The second
unidirectional flow is used by the UE to receive the requests and responses
from the P-CSCF; or
b) for TCP, the bidirectional flow is the TCP connection between the UE and
the P-CSCF. This TCP connection was established by the UE, i.e. from the UE\'s
protected client port and the UE\'s IP address to the P-CSCF\'s protected
server port and the P-CSCF\'s IP address. This TCP connection is used to
exchange SIP messages between the UE and the P-CSCF _; and_
2) set the security association lifetime to the longest of either the
previously existing security association lifetime (if available), or the
lifetime of the just completed registration plus 30 seconds.
NOTE 3: If the UE receives Authentication-Info, it will proceed as described
in RFC 3310 [49].
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received the UE shall
behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1.
##### 5.1.1.2.3 Initial registration using SIP digest without TLS
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21], with:
\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter, set to the domain name of the home
network;
\- the \"uri\" header field directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to an empty value; and
\- the \"response\" header field parameter, set to an empty value;
b) the hostport parameter in the Contact header field with the port value of
an unprotected port where the UE expects to receive subsequent requests; and
c) the sent-by field in the Via header field with the port value of an
unprotected port where the UE expects to receive responses to the request.
The UE shall use the locally available public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration. The method whereby the public user identity and private user
identity are made available to the UE is outside the scope of this document
(e.g. a public user identity could be input by the end user).
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received the UE shall
behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.4.
##### 5.1.1.2.4 Initial registration using SIP digest with TLS
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field set in accordance with subclause 5.1.1.2.3;
and
b) a Security-Client header field set to specify the signalling plane security
mechanism the UE supports. The UE shall support the setup of a TLS session as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE shall support the \"tls\" security
mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The UE shall support TLS for
integrity and confidentiality protection as defined in RFC 3261 [26], and
shall announce support for them according to the procedures defined in RFC
3329 [48].
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall additionally:
a) set the TLS session lifetime to the longest of either the previously
existing TLS session lifetime (if available), or the lifetime of the just
completed registration plus 30 seconds.
If a UE supports TLS, then the UE shall support TLS ciphersuites as described
in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. TLS session lifetime is determined by local
configuration of the UE.
For SIP digest with TLS, the UE associates a protected server port with the
TLS session port on the UE.
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received the UE shall
behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.6.
##### 5.1.1.2.5 Initial registration using NASS-IMS bundled authentication
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) optionally, an Authorization header field, with the \"username\" header
field parameter, set to the value of the private user identity;
NOTE 1: In case the Authorization header field is absent, the mechanism only
supports that one public user identity is associated with only one private
user identity. The public user identity is set so that it is possible to
derive the private user identity from the public user identity by removing SIP
URI scheme and the following parts of the SIP URI if present: port number, URI
parameters, and To header field parameters.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, there are no additional requirements for the UE.
NOTE 2: When NASS-IMS bundled authentication is in use, a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the REGISTER request is not expected to be received.
##### 5.1.1.2.6 Initial registration using GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21] shall not be
included, in order to indicate support for GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication.
b) the Security-Client header field as defined in RFC 3329 [48] shall not
contain signalling plane security mechanisms;
c) a From header field set to a temporary public user identity derived from
the IMSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], as the public user identity to be
registered;
d) a To header field set to a temporary public user identity derived from the
IMSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], as the public user identity to be
registered;
e) the Contact header field with the port value of an unprotected port where
the UE expects to receive subsequent mid-dialog requests; and
f) the Via header field with the port value of an unprotected port where the
UE expects to receive responses to the request.
NOTE 1: Since the private user identity is not included in the REGISTER
requests when GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is used for registration, re-
registration and de-registration procedures, all REGISTER requests from the UE
use the IMSI-derived IMPU as the public user identity even when the implicitly
registered IMPUs are available at the UE. The UE does not use the temporary
public user identity (IMSI-derived IMPU) in any non-registration SIP requests.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, there are no additional requirements for the UE.
NOTE 2: When GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is in use, a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the REGISTER request is not expected to be received.
#### 5.1.1.3 Subscription to the registration-state event package
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the initial registration, the UE shall
subscribe to the reg event package for the public user identity registered at
the user\'s registrar (S-CSCF) as described in RFC 3680 [43].
The UE shall subscribe to the reg event package upon registering a new contact
address via an initial registration procedure. If the UE receives a NOTIFY
request via the newly established subscription dialog and via the previously
established subscription dialogs (there will be at least one), the UE may
terminate the previously established subscription dialogs and keep only the
newly established subscription dialog.
The UE shall use the default public user identity for subscription to the
registration-state event package, if the public user identity that was used
for initial registration is a barred public user identity. The UE may use
either the default public user identity or the public user identity used for
initial registration for the subscription to the registration-state event
package, if the initial public user identity that was used for initial
registration is not barred.
On sending a SUBSCRIBE request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
follows:
a) a Request-URI set to the resource to which the UE wants to be subscribed
to, i.e. to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity used for
subscription;
b) a From header field set to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity
used for subscription;
c) a To header field set to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity
used for subscription;
d) an Event header field set to the \"reg\" event package;
e) an Expires header field set to 600 000 seconds as the value desired for the
duration of the subscription;
f) void; and
g) void.
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request, the UE shall store
the information for the established dialog and the expiration time as
indicated in the Expires header field of the received response.
If continued subscription is required, the UE shall automatically refresh the
subscription by the reg event package, for a previously registered public user
identity, either 600 seconds before the expiration time if the initial
subscription was for greater than 1200 seconds, or when half of the time has
expired if the initial subscription was for 1200 seconds or less. If a
SUBSCRIBE request to refresh a subscription fails with a non-481 response, the
UE shall still consider the original subscription valid for the duration of
the most recently known \"Expires\" value according to RFC 3265 [28].
Otherwise, the UE shall consider the subscription invalid and start a new
initial subscription according to RFC 3265 [28].
#### 5.1.1.3A
#### 5.1.1.4 User-initiated reregistration and registration of an additional
public user identity
##### 5.1.1.4.1 General
The UE can perform the reregistration of a previously registered public user
identity bound to any one of its contact addresses and the associated set of
security associations or TLS sessions at any time after the initial
registration has been completed.
The UE can perform the reregistration of a previously registered public user
identity over any existing set of security associations or TLS session that is
associated with the related contact address.
The UE can perform the reregistration of a previously registered public user
identity via an initial registration as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2, when
binding the previously registered public user identity to new contact address
or to the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used).
The UE can perform registration of additional public user identities at any
time after the initial registration has been completed. The UE shall perform
the registration of additional public user identities either:
\- over the existing set of security associations or TLS sessions, if
appropriate to the security mechanism in use, that is associated with the
related contact address; or
\- via an initial registration as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2.
The UE can fetch bindings as defined in RFC 3261 [26] at any time after the
initial registration has been completed. The procedure for fetching bindings
is the same as for a reregistration except that the REGISTER request does not
contain a Contact header field.
Unless either the user or the application within the UE has determined that a
continued registration is not required the UE shall reregister an already
registered public user identity either 600 seconds before the expiration time
if the previous registration was for greater than 1200 seconds, or when half
of the time has expired if the previous registration was for 1200 seconds or
less, or when the UE intends to update its capabilities according to RFC 3840
[62] or when the UE needs to modify the ICSI values that the UE intends to use
in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag or IARI values that the UE intends to
use in the g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag.
When sending a protected REGISTER request, the UE shall use a security
association or TLS session associated either with the contact address or to
the registration flow and the associated contact address used to send the
request, see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], established as a result of an earlier
initial registration.
The UE shall extract or derive a public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration, according to the procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.1A or
subclause 5.1.1.1B.
On sending a REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response, the
UE shall populate the header fields as follows:
a) a From header field set to the SIP URI that contains the public user
identity to be registered;
b) a To header field set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity
to be registered;
c) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI(s) that contain(s) in the
hostport parameter the IP address or FQDN of the UE, and containing the
instance ID of the UE in the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter, if the
UE supports GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53) or multiple registrations. If
the UE support multiple registrations, it shall include \"reg-id\" header
field as described in RFC 5626 [92]. The UE shall include all supported ICSI
values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS
communication it intends to use, and IARI values (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.9.2), for the IMS applications it intends to use in a
g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3840
[62];
d) a Via header field set to include the IP address or FQDN of the UE in the
sent-by field. For the TCP, the response is received on the TCP connection on
which the request was sent. If the UE previously has previously negotiated
sending of keep-alives associated with the registration, it shall include a
\"keep\" header field parameter with no value in the Via header field, in
order to indicate continuous support to send keep-alives, as described in RFC
6223 [143];
e) a registration expiration interval value, set to 600 000 seconds as the
value desired for the duration of the registration;
NOTE 1: The registrar (S-CSCF) might decrease the duration of the registration
in accordance with network policy. Registration attempts with a registration
period of less than a predefined minimum value defined in the registrar will
be rejected with a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
f) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network
used to address the REGISTER request;
g) the Supported header field containing the option-tag \"path\", and:
1) if GRUU is supported, the option-tag \"gruu\"; and
2) if multiple registrations is supported, the option-tag \"outbound\";
h) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), a P-Access-Network-Info header field set
as specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4); and
i) a Security-Client header field to announce the media plane security
mechanisms the UE supports, if any, labelled with the \"mediasec\" header
field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7..
NOTE 2: Security mechanisms that apply to the media plane are distinguished by
the \"mediasec\" header field parameter.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
a) bind the new expiration time of the registration for this public user
identity found in the To header field value either to the contact address or
to the registration flow and the associated contact address used in this
registration;
b) store the list of service route values contained in the Service-Route
header field and bind the list either to the contact address or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used);
NOTE 3: The stored list of service route values will be used to build a proper
preloaded Route header field for new dialogs and standalone transactions when
using either the respective contact address or to the registration flow and
the associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used).
NOTE 4: If the list of Service-Route headers saved from a previous
registration and bound either to this contact address or to the registration
flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple registration
mechanism is used), and the associated set of security associations or TLS
session already exist, then the received list of Service-Route headers
replaces the old list.
NOTE 5: The UE can utilize additional URIs contained in the P-Associated-URI
header field, e.g. for application purposes.
c) find the Contact header field within the response that matches the one
included in the REGISTER request. If this contains a \"pub-gruu\" header field
parameter or a \"temp-gruu\" header field parameter or both, and the UE
supports GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53), then store the value of those
parameters as the GRUUs for the UE in association with the public user
identity and the contact address that was registered;
d) store the announcement of the media plane security mechanisms the P-CSCF
(IMS-ALG) supports received in the Security-Server header field and labelled
with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7, if
any. Once the UE chooses a media security mechanism from the list received in
the Security-Server header field from the server, it may initiate that
mechanism on a media level when it initiates new media in an existing session;
and
NOTE 6: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
e) if the Via header field contains a \"keep\" header field parameter with a
value, continue to send keep-alives as described in RFC 6223 [143], towards
the P-CSCF.
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received the UE shall
behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1.
On receiving a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response to the REGISTER request, the
UE shall:
\- send another REGISTER request populating the registration expiration
interval value with an expiration timer of at least the value received in the
Min-Expires header field of the 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
On receiving a 408 (Request Timeout) response or 500 (Server Internal Error)
response or 504 (Server Time-Out) response for a reregistration, the UE shall
perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
On receiving a 305 (Use Proxy) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
a) ignore the contents of the Contact header field if it is included in the
received message;
NOTE 4: The 305 response is not expected to contain a Contact header field.
b) release all IP-CAN bearers used for the transport of media according to the
procedures in subclause 9.2.2;
c) initiate either a new P-CSCF discovery procedure as described in subclause
9.2.1, or select a new P-CSCF, if the UE was pre-configured with more than one
P-CSCF\'s IP addresses or domain names;
d) select a P-CSCF address, which is different from the previously used
address, from the address list; and
e) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
When the timer F expires at the UE:
1) the UE shall stop processing of all ongoing dialogs and transactions
associated with that flow, if any (i.e. no further SIP signalling will be sent
by the UE on behalf of these transactions or dialogs); and
2) after releasing all IP-CAN bearers used for the transport of media
according to the procedures in subclause 9.2.2:
a) the UE may select a different P-CSCF address from the list of P-CSCF
addresses discovered during the procedures described in subclause 9.2.1 or
from its pre-configured list of P-CSCF\'s IP addresses or domain names;
b) if no response has been received when attempting to contact all P-CSCFs
known by the UE, the UE may get a new set of P-CSCF-addresses as described in
subclause 9.2.1;
c) the UE may perform the procedures for initial registration as described in
subclause 5.1.1.2; and
d) the UE shall perform the procedures in RFC 5626 [92] to form a new flow to
replace the failed one if it supports multiple registrations. If failed
registration attempts occur in the process of creating a new flow, the flow
recovery procedures defined in RFC 5626 [92] shall apply. The UE shall use the
values of the parameters max-time and base-time, of the algorithm defined in
subclause 4.5 of RFC 5626 [92]. If no values of the parameters max-time and
base-time have been provided to the UE by the network, the default values
defined in in subclause 4.5 of RFC 5626 [92] shall be used.
NOTE 7: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means than expiration of timer F, e.g. based on ICMP
messages.
##### 5.1.1.4.2 IMS AKA as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.4.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field, with:
\- the \"username\" header field parameter set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter directive, set to the value as
received in the \"realm\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameter;
\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to last received nonce value; and
\- the \"response\" header field parameter, set to the last calculated
response value;
NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the hostport parameter in the Contact
header field and in the sent-by field in the Via header field, then it has to
ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the
IP address that is bound to the security association.
NOTE 2: The UE associates two ports, a protected client port and a protected
server port, with each pair of security associations. For details on the
selection of the protected port value see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
NOTE 3: If the UE is setting up an additional registration using procedures
specified in RFC 5626 [92] and the UE accesses the network through 3GPP or
3GPP2 systems without any NAT, the flow is considered to be \"logical flow\".
b) additionally for the Contact header field, include the protected server
port value in the hostport parameter;
c) additionally for the Via header field, for UDP, if the REGISTER request is
protected by a security association, include the protected server port value
in the sent-by field;
d) a Security-Client header field, set to specify the signalling plane
security mechanism it supports, the IPsec layer algorithms for security and
confidentiality protection it supports and the new parameter values needed for
the setup of two new pairs of security associations. For further details see
3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC 3329 [48]; and
e) a Security-Verify header field that contains the content of the Security-
Server header field received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response of the last
successful authentication.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall
additionally:
a) set the security association lifetime associated with either this contact
address or to the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used), and the associated set of security
associations to the longest of either the previously existing security
association lifetime, or the lifetime of the just completed registration plus
30 seconds.
NOTE 4: If the UE receives Authentication-Info, it will proceed as described
in RFC 3310 [49].
##### 5.1.1.4.3 SIP digest without TLS as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response, the
UE shall additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21], including:
\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter, set to the domain name of the home
network;
\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to an empty value; and
\- the \"response\" header field parameter, set to an empty value;
b) the Contact header field with the port value of an unprotected port where
the UE expects to receive subsequent requests; and
c) the Via header field with the port value of an unprotected port where the
UE expects to receive responses to the request.
##### 5.1.1.4.4 SIP digest with TLS as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.4.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field set in accordance with subclause 5.1.1.2.3;
b) the Security-Client header field set to specify the signalling plane
security mechanism the UE supports. The UE shall support the setup of a TLS
session as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE shall support the \"tls\"
security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The UE shall support TLS
for integrity and confidentiality protection as defined in RFC 3261 [26], and
shall announce support for them according to the procedures defined in RFC
3329 [48]; and
c) a Security-Verify header field that contains the content of the Security-
Server header field received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response of the last
successful authentication.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall additionally:
a) set the lifetime of the respective TLS session to the value configured.
##### 5.1.1.4.5 NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.4.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) optionally, an Authorization header field, with the \"username\" header
field parameter, set to the value of the private user identity;
NOTE 1: In case the Authorization header field is absent, the mechanism only
supports that one public user identity is associated with only one private
user identity.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, there are no additional requirements for the UE.
NOTE 2: When NASS-IMS bundled authentication is in use, a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the REGISTER request is not expected to be received.
##### 5.1.1.4.6 GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.4.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21] shall not be
included, in order to indicate support GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication.
b) security agreement header field values as required by RFC 3329 [48] shall
not contain signalling plane security mechanisms;
c) a From header field set to a temporary public user identity derived from
the IMSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], as the public user identity to be
registered;
d) a To header field set to a temporary public user identity derived from the
IMSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], as the public user identity to be
registered;
e) the Contact header field with the port value of an unprotected port where
the UE expects to receive subsequent mid-dialog requests; and
f) the Via header field with the port value of an unprotected port where the
UE expects to receive responses to the request.
NOTE 1: Since the private user identity is not included in the REGISTER
requests when GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is used for registration, re-
registration and de-registration procedures, all REGISTER requests from the UE
use the IMSI-derived IMPU as the public user identity even when the implicitly
registered IMPUs are available at the UE. The UE does not use the temporary
public user identity (IMSI-derived IMPU) in any non-registration SIP requests.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.4.1, there are no additional requirements for the UE.
NOTE 2: When GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is in use, a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the REGISTER request is not expected to be received.
#### 5.1.1.5 Authentication
##### 5.1.1.5.1 IMS AKA - general
Authentication is performed during initial registration. A UE can be re-
authenticated during subsequent reregistrations, deregistrations or
registrations of additional public user identities. When the network requires
authentication or re-authentication of the UE, the UE will receive a 401
(Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request.
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, the UE
shall:
1) extract the RAND and AUTN parameters;
2) check the validity of a received authentication challenge, as described in
3GPP TS 33.203 [19] i.e. the locally calculated XMAC must match the MAC
parameter derived from the AUTN part of the challenge; and the SQN parameter
derived from the AUTN part of the challenge must be within the correct range;
and
3) check the existence of the Security-Server header field as described in RFC
3329 [48]. If the Security-Server header field is not present or it does not
contain the parameters required for the setup of the set of security
associations (see annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]), the UE shall abandon the
authentication procedure and send a new REGISTER request with a new Call-ID.
In the case that the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request is
deemed to be valid the UE shall:
1) calculate the RES parameter and derive the keys CK and IK from RAND as
described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19];
2) set up a temporary set of security associations for this registration based
on the static list and parameters the UE received in the 401 (Unauthorized)
response and its capabilities sent in the Security-Client header field in the
REGISTER request. The UE sets up the temporary set of security associations
using the most preferred mechanism and algorithm returned by the P-CSCF and
supported by the UE and using IK and CK (only if encryption enabled) as the
shared key. The UE shall use the parameters received in the Security-Server
header field to setup the temporary set of security associations. The UE shall
set a temporary SIP level lifetime for the temporary set of security
associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;
3) store the announcement of the media plane security mechanisms the P-CSCF
(IMS-ALG) supports received in the Security-Server header field and labelled
with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7, if
any; and
NOTE 1: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
4) send another REGISTER request towards the protected server port indicated
in the response using the temporary set of security associations to protect
the message. The header fields are populated as defined for the initial
REGISTER request that was challenged with the received 401 (Unauthorized)
response, with the addition that the UE shall include an Authorization header
field containing:
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter set to the value as received in the
\"realm\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameter;
\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"response\" header field parameter that contains the RES parameter, as
described in RFC 3310 [49];
\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"**algorithm\" header field parameter,** set to the value received in
the 401 (Unauthorized) response; and
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to the value received in the 401
(Unauthorized) response.
The UE shall also insert the Security-Client header field that is identical to
the Security-Client header field that was included in the previous REGISTER
request (i.e. the REGISTER request that was challenged with the received 401
(Unauthorized) response). The UE shall also insert the Security-Verify header
field into the request, by mirroring in it the content of the Security-Server
header field received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response. The UE shall set the
Call-ID of the security association protected REGISTER request which carries
the authentication challenge response to the same value as the Call-ID of the
401 (Unauthorized) response which carried the challenge.
NOTE 2: The Security-Client header field contains signaling plane security
mechanism and if the UE supports media plane security, then media plane
security mechanisms are contained, too.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response for the security association protected
REGISTER request registering a public user identity with the associated
contact address, the UE shall:
\- change the temporary set of security associations to a newly established
set of security associations, i.e. set its SIP level lifetime to the longest
of either the previously existing set of security associations SIP level
lifetime, or the lifetime of the just completed registration plus 30 seconds;
and
\- if this is the only set of security associations available toward the
P-CSCF, use the newly established set of security associations for further
messages sent towards the P-CSCF. If there are additional sets of security
associations (e.g. due to registration of multiple contact addresses), the UE
can either use them or use the newly established set of security associations
for further messages sent towards the P-CSCF as appropriate.
NOTE 3: If the UE has registered multiple contact addresses, the UE can either
send requests towards the P-CSCF over the newly established set of security
associations, or use different UE\'s contact address and associated set of
security associations when sending the requests towards the P-CSCF. Responses
towards the P-CSCF that are sent via UDP will be sent over the same set of
security associations that the related request was received on. Responses
towards the P-CSCF that are sent via TCP will be sent over the same set of
security associations that the related request was received on.
When the first request or response protected with the newly established set of
security associations is received from the P-CSCF or when the lifetime of the
old set of security associations expires, the UE shall delete the old set of
security associations and related keys it may have with the P-CSCF after all
SIP transactions that use the old set of security associations are completed.
NOTE 4: If the UE has registered multiple contact addresses, the S-CSCF may
use different contact address when sending the requests destined for the UE.
In this case the UE will not receive the subsequent requests over the newly
established set of security associations.
Whenever the 200 (OK) response is not received before the temporary SIP level
lifetime of the temporary set of security associations expires or a 403
(Forbidden) response is received, the UE shall consider the registration to
have failed. The UE shall delete the temporary set of security associations it
was trying to establish, and use the old set of security associations. The UE
should send an unprotected REGISTER request according to the procedure
specified in subclause 5.1.1.2 if the UE considers the old set of security
associations to be no longer active at the P-CSCF.
In the case that the 401 (Unauthorized) response is deemed to be invalid then
the UE shall behave as defined in subclause 5.1.1.5.3.
##### 5.1.1.5.2 Void
##### 5.1.1.5.3 IMS AKA abnormal cases
If, in a 401 (Unauthorized) response, either the MAC or SQN is incorrect the
UE shall respond with a further REGISTER indicating to the S-CSCF that the
challenge has been deemed invalid as follows:
\- in the case where the UE deems the MAC parameter to be invalid the
subsequent REGISTER request shall contain no \"auts\" Authorization header
field parameter and an empty \"response\" Authorization header field
parameter, i.e. no authentication challenge response;
\- in the case where the UE deems the SQN to be out of range, the subsequent
REGISTER request shall contain the \"auts\" Authorization header field
parameter (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [18]).
NOTE: In the case of the SQN being out of range, a \"response\" Authorization
header field parameter can be included by the UE, based on the procedures
described in RFC 3310 [49].
Whenever the UE detects any of the above cases, the UE shall:
\- send the REGISTER request using an existing set of security associations,
if available (see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]);
\- populate a new Security-Client header field within the REGISTER request and
associated contact address, set to specify the security mechanisms it
supports, the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and confidentiality
protection it supports and the parameters needed for the new security
association setup; and
\- not create a temporary set of security associations.
On receiving a 420 (Bad Extension) in which the Unsupported header field
contains the value \"sec-agree\" and if the UE supports GPRS-IMS-Bundled
authentication, the UE shall initiate a new authentication attempt with the
GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication procedures as specified in subclause
5.1.1.2.6.
##### 5.1.1.5.4 SIP digest without TLS -- general
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, and where
the \"algorithm\" Authorization header field parameter is \"MD5\", the UE
shall extract the digest-challenge parameters as indicated in RFC 2617 [21]
from the WWW-Authenticate header field. The UE shall calculate digest-response
parameters as indicated in RFC 2617 [21]. The UE shall send another REGISTER
request containing an Authorization header field. The header fields are
populated as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.3, with the addition that the UE
shall include an Authorization header field containing a challenge response,
i.e. \"cnonce\", \"qop\", and \"nonce-count\" header field parameters as
indicated in RFC 2617 [21]. The UE shall set the Call-ID of the REGISTER
request which carries the authentication challenge response to the same value
as the Call-ID of the 401 (Unauthorized) response which carried the challenge.
If SIP digest without TLS is used, the UE shall not include RFC 3329 [48]
header fields with this REGISTER.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request, if the
\"algorithm\" Authentication-Info header field parameter is \"MD5\", the UE
shall authenticate the S-CSCF using the \"rspauth\" Authentication-Info header
field parameter as described in RFC 2617 [21]. If the nextnonce field is
present in the Authentication-Info header field the UE should use it when
constructing the Authorization header for its next request as specified in RFC
2617 [21].
##### 5.1.1.5.5 SIP digest without TLS -- abnormal procedures
On receiving a 403 (Forbidden) response, the UE shall consider the
registration to have failed.
##### 5.1.1.5.6 SIP digest with TLS -- general
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, the
procedures in subclause 5.1.1.5.4 apply with the following differences:
\- The UE shall check the existence of the Security-Server header field as
described in RFC 3329 [48]. If the Security-Server header field is not present
or the list of supported security mechanisms does not include \"tls\", the UE
shall abandon the authentication procedure and send a new REGISTER request.
In the case that the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER is deemed to
be valid the UE shall:
\- store the announcement of the media plane security mechanisms the P-CSCF
(IMS-ALG) supports labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter
specified in subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the Security-Server header
field, if any; and
NOTE 1: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
\- send another REGISTER request using the TLS session to protect the message.
The header fields are populated as defined for the initial request, with the
addition that the UE shall include an Authorization header field containing a
challenge response, \"cnonce\", \"qop\", and \"nonce-count\" header field
parameters as indicated in RFC 2617 [21]. The UE shall also insert the
Security-Client header field that is identical to the Security-Client header
field that was included in the previous REGISTER request (i.e. the REGISTER
request that was challenged with the received 401 (Unauthorized) response).
The UE shall also insert the Security-Verify header field into the request, by
mirroring in it the content of the Security-Server header field received in
the 401 (Unauthorized) response. The UE shall set the Call-ID to the same
value as the Call-ID of the 401 (Unauthorized) response which carried the
challenge.
NOTE 2: The Security-Client header field contains signaling plane security
mechanism and if the UE supports media plane security, then media plane
security mechanisms are contained, too.
When SIP digest with TLS is used, and for the case where the 401
(Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request is deemed to be valid, the UE
shall establish the TLS session as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE
shall use this TLS session to send all further messages towards the P-CSCF
towards the protected server port.
##### 5.1.1.5.7 SIP digest with TLS -- abnormal procedures
On receiving a 403 (Forbidden) response, the UE shall consider the
registration to have failed. If performing SIP digest with TLS, the UE should
send an initial REGISTER according to the procedure specified in subclause
5.1.1.2 if the UE considers the TLS session to be no longer active at the
P-CSCF.
##### 5.1.1.5.8 NASS-IMS bundled authentication -- general
NASS-IMS bundled authentication is only applicable to UEs that contain neither
USIM nor ISIM. Authentication is achieved via the registration and re-
registration procedures as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2 and subclause 5.1.1.4.
NASS-bundled authentication is granted by the network upon receipt by the UE
of a 200 (OK) response to the initial REGISTER request.
There is no separate authentication procedure.
##### 5.1.1.5.9 NASS-IMS bundled authentication -- abnormal procedures
There is no separate authentication procedure, and therefore no abnormal
procedures.
##### 5.1.1.5.10 GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication -- general
Authentication is achieved via the registration and re-registration procedures
as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2 and subclause 5.1.1.4. GPRS-IMS-Bundled
authentication is granted by the network upon receipt by the UE of a 200 (OK)
response to the initial REGISTER request.
##### 5.1.1.5.11 GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication -- abnormal procedures
There is no separate authentication procedure and therefore no abnormal
procedures.
##### 5.1.1.5.12 Abnormal procedures for all security mechanisms
A UE shall only respond to two consecutive invalid challenges and shall not
automatically attempt authentication after two consecutive failed attempts to
authenticate. The UE may attempt to register with the network again after an
implementation specific time.
#### 5.1.1.5A Network-initiated re-authentication
At any time, the UE can receive a NOTIFY request carrying information related
to the reg event package (as described in subclause 5.1.1.3). If:
\- the state attribute in any of the \ elements is set to
\"active\";
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the Contact address that the UE registered; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"shortened\";
the UE shall:
1) use the expiry attribute within the \ sub-element that the UE
registered to adjust the expiration time for that public user identity; and
2) start the re-authentication procedures at the appropriate time (as a result
of the S-CSCF procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.6) by initiating a
reregistration as described in subclause 5.1.1.4, if required.
NOTE: When authenticating a given private user identity, the S-CSCF will only
shorten the expiry time within the \ sub-element that the UE
registered using its private user identity. The \ elements for the
same public user identity, if registered by another UE using different private
user identities remain unchanged. The UE will not initiate a reregistration
procedure, if none of its \ sub-elements was modified.
#### 5.1.1.5B Change of IPv6 address due to privacy
Stateless address autoconfiguration as described in RFC 2462 [20E] defines how
an IPv6 prefix and an interface identifier is used by the UE to construct a
complete IPv6 address.
If the UE receives an IPv6 prefix, the UE may change the interface identity of
the IPv6 address as described in RFC 3041 [25A] due to privacy but this can
result in service discontinuity for services provided by the IM CN subsystem.
NOTE: When the UE constructs new IPv6 address by changing the interface
identity, the UE can either transfer all established dialogs to new IPv6
address as specified in 3GPP TS 24.237 [8M] and subsequently relinquish the
old IPv6 address, or terminate all established dialogs and transactions. While
transferring the established dialogs to new IPv6 address, the UE will have
double registration, i.e. one registration for the old IPv6 address and
another for the new IPv6 address.
The procedure described below assumes that the UE will terminate all
established dialogs and transactions and temporarily disconnect the UE from
the IM CN subsystem until the new registration is performed. If the UE decides
to change the IPv6 address due to privacy and terminate all established
dialogs and transaction, associated with old IPv6 address, the UE shall:
1) terminate all ongoing dialogs (e.g., sessions) and transactions (e.g.,
subscription to the reg event) that were using the old IPv6 address;
2) deregister all registered public user identities that were using the old
IPv6 address as described in subsclause 5.1.1.4;
3) construct a new IPv6 address according to the procedures specified in RFC
3041 [25A];
4) register the public user identities that were deregistered in step 2 above
with a new IPv6 address, as follows:
a) by performing an initial registration as described in subsclause 5.1.1.2;
and
b) by performing a subscription to the reg event package as described in
subsclause 5.1.1.3; and
5) subscribe to other event packages it was subscribed to before the change of
IPv6 address procedure started.
To ensure a maximum degree of continuous service to the end user, the UE
should transfer all established dialogs to the new IPv6 address as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.237 [8M] rather than terminate all established dialogs and
transactions and temporarily disconnect the UE from the IM CN subsystem as
described above.
#### 5.1.1.6 User-initiated deregistration
##### 5.1.1.6.1 General
For any public user identity that the UE has previously registered, the UE can
deregister via a single registration procedure:
\- all contact addresses bound to the indicated public user identity;
\- some contact addresses bound to the indicated public user identity;
\- a particular contact address bound to the indicated public user identity;
or
\- when the UE supports multiple registrations (i.e. the \"outbound\" option
tag is included in the Supported header field) one or more flows bound to the
indicated public user identity.
The UE can deregister a public user identity that it has previously registered
with its contact address at any time. The UE shall protect the REGISTER
request using a security association or TLS session that is associated with
contact address, see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], established as a result of an
earlier registration, if one is available.
The UE shall extract or derive a public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration, according to the procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.1A or
subclause 5.1.1.1B.
Prior to sending a REGISTER request for deregistration, the UE shall release
all dialogs that were using the contact addresses or the flow that is going to
be deregistered and related to the public user identity that is going to be
deregistered or to one of the implicitly registered public user identities.
However:
\- if the dialog that was established by the UE subscribing to the reg event
package used the public user identity that is going to be deregistered; and
\- this dialog is the only remaining dialog used for subscription to reg event
package of the user, i.e. there are no other contact addresses registered with
associated subscription to the reg event package of the user;
then the UE shall not release this dialog.
On sending a REGISTER request that will remove the binding between the public
user identity and one of its contact addresses or one of its flows, the UE
shall populate the header fields as follows:
a) a From header field set to the SIP URI that contains the public user
identity to be deregistered;
b) a To header field set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity
to be deregistered;
c) a Contact header field set to the SIP URI(s) that contain(s) in the
hostport parameter the IP address of the UE or FQDN, and:
1) if the UE is removing the binding between the public user identity
indicated in the To header field, (together with the associated implicitly
registered public user identities), and the contact address indicated in the
Contact header field; and
\- if the UE supports GRUU or multiple registrations (i.e. the \"outbound\"
option tag is included in the Supported header field), the Contact header
field also contains the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter;
\- if the UE supports multiple registrations (i.e. the \"outbound\" option tag
is included in the Supported header field), the Contact header field does not
contain the \"reg-id\" header field parameter;
\- if the UE does not supports GRUU or multiple registrations (i.e. the
\"outbound\" option tag is not included in the Supported header field), the
Contact header field does not contain either the \"+sip.instance\" header
field parameter or the \"reg-id\" header field parameter;
NOTE 1: Since the contact address is deregistered, if there are any flows that
were previously registered with the respective contact address, all flows
terminating at the respective contact address are removed.
2) if the UE is removing the binding between the public user identity
indicated in the To header field, (together with the associated implicitly
registered public user identities) and one of its flows, the Contact header
field contains the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter and the \"reg-id\"
header field parameter that identifies the flow;
d) a Via header field set to include the IP address or FQDN of the UE in the
sent-by field;
e) a registration expiration interval value set to the value of zero,
appropriate to the deregistration requirements of the user;
f) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network
used to address the REGISTER request;
g) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), a P-Access-Network-Info header field set
as specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4); and
h) a Security-Client header field to announce the media plane security
mechanisms the UE supports, if any, labelled with the \"mediasec\" header
field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7.
NOTE 2: Security mechanisms that apply to the media plane are distinguished by
the \"mediasec\" header field parameter.
For a public user identity that the UE has registered with multiple contact
addresses or multiple flows (e.g. via different P-CSCFs), the UE shall also be
able to deregister multiple contact addresses or multiple flows, bound to its
public user identity, via single deregistration proceduere as specified in RFC
3261 [26]. The UE shall send a single REGISTER request, using one of its
contact addresses and the associated set of security associations or TLS
session, containing a list of Contact headers. Each Contact header field is
populated as specifed above in bullets a) through h).
The UE can deregister all contact addresses bound to its public user identity
and associated with its private user identity. The UE shall send a single
REGISTER request, using one of its contact addresses and the associated set of
security associations or TLS session, containing a public user identity that
is being deregistered in the To header field, and a single Contact header
field with value of \"*\" and the Expires header field with a value of \"0\".
The UE shall not include the \"instance-id\" feature tag and the \"reg-id\"
header field parameter in the Contact header field in the REGISTER request.
NOTE 3: All entities subscribed to the reg event package of the user will be
inform via NOTIFY request which contact addresses bound to the public user
identity have been deregistered.
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request is received the UE
shall behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
\- remove all registration details relating to this public user identity and
the associated contact address.
\- store the announcement of the media plane security mechanisms the P-CSCF
(IMS-ALG) supports labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter
specified in subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the Security-Server header
field, if any.
NOTE 4: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
If there are no more public user identities registered with this contact
address, the UE shall delete any stored media plane security mechanisms and
related keys and any security associations or TLS sessions and related keys it
may have towards the IM CN subsystem.
If all public user identities are deregistered and all security association or
TLS session is removed, then the UE shall consider subscription to the reg
event package cancelled (i.e. as if the UE had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with
an Expires header field containing a value of zero).
##### 5.1.1.6.2 IMS AKA as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.6.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field, with:
\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter, set to the value as received in the
\"realm\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameter;
\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to last received nonce value; and
\- the response directive, set to the last calculated response value;
b) additionally for each Contact header field and associated contact address,
include the associated protected server port value in the hostport parameter;
c) additionally for the Via header field, include the protected server port
value bound to the security association in the sent-by field;
NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the hostport parameter in the Contact
header field and in the sent-by field in the Via header field, then it has to
ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the
IP address that is bound to the security association.
d) a Security-Client header field, set to specify the signalling plane
security mechanisms it supports, the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and
confidentiality protection it supports and the new parameter values needed for
the setup of two new pairs of security associations. For further details see
3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC 3329 [48]; and
e) a Security-Verify header field that contains the content of the Security-
Server header field received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response of the last
successful authentication.
NOTE 2: When the UE has received the 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER
request of the only public user identity currently registered with this
contact address and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities (i.e. no other public user identity is registered), the UE removes
the security association (between the P-CSCF and the UE) that were using this
contact address. Therefore further SIP signalling using this security
association (e.g. the NOTIFY request containing the deregistration event) will
not reach the UE.
##### 5.1.1.6.3 SIP digest without TLS as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.6.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21], including:
\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the private
user identity;
\- the \"realm\" header field parameter, set to the domain name of the home
network;
\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain name
of the home network;
\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to an empty value; and
\- the \"response\" header field parameter, set to an empty value;
b) for each Contact header field and associated contact address include the
associated unprotected port value (where the UE was expecting to receive mid-
dialog requests); and
c) the Via header field with the port value of an unprotected port where the
UE expects to receive responses to the request.
##### 5.1.1.6.4 SIP digest with TLS as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.6.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field set in accordance with subclause 5.1.1.6.3;
and
b) a Security-Client header field, set to specify the signalling plane
security mechanism it supports. For further details see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]
and RFC 3329 [48]; and
c) a Security-Verify header field that contains the content of the Security-
Server header field received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response of the last
successful authentication.
##### 5.1.1.6.5 NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.6.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) optionally, an Authorization header field, with the \"username\" header
field parameter, set to the value of the private user identity;
NOTE 1: In case the Authorization header field is absent, the mechanism only
supports that one public user identity is associated with only one private
user identity.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.6.1, there are no additional requirements for the UE.
NOTE 2: When NASS-IMS bundled authentication is in use, a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the REGISTER request is not expected to be received.
##### 5.1.1.6.6 GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication as a security mechanism
On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.6.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21] shall not be
included, in order to indicate support GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication.
b) the Security-Verify header field and the Security-Client header field
values as defined by RFC 3329 [48] shall not contain signalling plane security
mechanisms;
c) a From header field set to a temporary public user identity derived from
the IMSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], as the public user identity to be
deregistered;
d) a To header field set to a temporary public user identity derived from the
IMSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], as the public user identity to be
deregistered;
e) for each Contact header field and associated contact address include the
associated unprotected port value (where the UE was expecting to receive mid-
dialog requests); and
f) the Via header field with the port value of an unprotected port where the
UE expects to receive responses to the request.
NOTE 1: Since the private user identity is not included in the REGISTER
requests when GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is used for registration, re-
registration and de-registration procedures, all REGISTER requests from the UE
use the IMSI-derived IMPU as the public user identity even when the implicitly
registered IMPUs are available at the UE. The UE does not use the temporary
public user identity (IMSI-derived IMPU) in any non-registration SIP requests.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.6.1, there are no additional requirements for the UE.
NOTE 2: When GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is in use, a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the REGISTER request is not expected to be received.
#### 5.1.1.7 Network-initiated deregistration
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request, on any dialog which was generated during the
subscription to the reg event package as described in subclause 5.1.1.3,
including one or more \ element(s) which were registered by this
UE, with:
1) the state attribute within the \ element set to
\"terminated\", and within each \ element belonging to this UE, the
state attribute set to \"terminated\" and the event attribute set either to
\"unregistered\", or \"rejected\", or \"deactivated\", the UE shall remove all
registration details relating to the respective public user identity (i.e.
consider the public user identity indicated in the aor attribute of the
\ element as deregistered); or
2) the state attribute within the \ element set to \"active\",
and within a given \ element belonging to this UE, the state
attribute set to \"terminated\", and the associated event attribute set either
to \"unregistered\", or \"rejected\", or \"deactivated\", the UE shall
consider the binding between the public user identity and either the contact
address or the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) indicated in the respective
\ element as removed. The UE shall consider its public user identity
as deregistered when all bindings between the respective public user identity
and all contact addresses and all registration flow and the associated contact
address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used) belonging to this UE
are removed.
NOTE 1: When multiple registration mechanism is used to register a public user
identity and bind it to a registration flow and the associated contact
address, there will be one \ element for each registration flow and
the associated contact address.
NOTE 2: If the state attribute within the \ element is set to
\"active\" and the \ element belonging to this UE is set to
\"active\", the UE will consider that the binding between the public user
identity and either the respective contact address or the registration flow
and the associated contact address as left unchanged.
In case of a \"deactivated\" event attribute, the UE shall start the initial
registration procedure as described in subclause 5.1.1.2. In case of a
\"rejected\" event attribute, the UE shall release all dialogs related to
those public user identities.
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request, the UE shall delete all security
associations or TLS sessions towards the P-CSCF either:
\- if all \ element(s) have their state attribute set to
\"terminated\" (i.e. all public user identities are deregistered) and the
Subscription-State header field contains the value of \"terminated\"; or
\- if each \ element that was registered by this UE has either
the state attribute set to \"terminated\", or the state attribute set to
\"active\" and the state attribute within the \ element belonging to
this UE set to \"terminated\".
When all UE\'s public user identities are registered via a single P-CSCF and
the subscription dialog to the reg event package of the UE is set via the
respective P-CSCF, the UE shall delete these security associations or TLS
sessions towards the respective P-CSCF when all public user identities have
been deregistered and after the server transaction (as defined in RFC 3261
[26]) pertaining to the received NOTIFY request terminates.
NOTE 3: Deleting a security association or TLS session is an internal
procedure of the UE and does not involve any SIP procedures.
NOTE 4: If all the public user identities (i.e. \ elements)
registered by this UE are deregistered and the security associations or TLS
sessions have been removed, the UE considers the subscription to the reg event
package terminated since the NOTIFY request was received with Subscription-
State header field containing the value of \"terminated\".
### 5.1.2 Subscription and notification
#### 5.1.2.1 Notification about multiple registered public user identities
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request the UE shall maintain
the generated dialog (identified by the values of the Call-ID header field,
and the values of tags in To and From header fields).
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package the UE shall perform the following
actions:
\- if a state attribute \"active\", i.e. registered is received for one or
more public user identities, the UE shall store the indicated public user
identities as registered;
\- if a state attribute \"active\" is received, and the UE supports GRUU (see
table A.4, item A.4/53), then for each public user identity indicated in the
notification that contains a \ element or a \ element or
both (as defined in RFC 5628 [94]) then the UE shall store the value of those
elements in association with the public user identity;
\- if a state attribute \"terminated\", i.e. deregistered is received for one
or more public user identities, the UE shall store the indicated public user
identities as deregistered and shall remove any associated GRUUs.
NOTE 1: There may be public user identities which are automatically registered
within the registrar (S-CSCF) of the user upon registration of one public user
identity or when S-CSCF receives a Push-Profile-Request (PPR) from the HSS (as
described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]) changing the status of a public user
identity associated with a registered implicit set from barred to non-barred.
Usually these automatically or implicitly registered public user identities
belong to the same service profile of the user and they might not be available
within the UE. The implicitly registered public user identities may also
belong to different service profiles. The here-described procedures provide a
different mechanism (to the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request) to
inform the UE about these automatically registered public user identities.
NOTE 2: RFC 5628 [94] provides guidance on the management of temporary GRUUs,
utilizing information provided in the reg event notification.
#### 5.1.2.2 General SUBSCRIBE requirements
If the UE receives a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to an initial
SUBSCRIBE request containing a Retry-After header field, then the UE shall not
automatically reattempt the request until after the period indicated by the
Retry-After header field contents.
### 5.1.2A Generic procedures applicable to all methods excluding the REGISTER
method
#### 5.1.2A.1 UE-originating case
##### 5.1.2A.1.1 General
The procedures of this subclause are general to all requests and responses,
except those for the REGISTER method.
When the UE sends any request using either a given contact address or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address, the UE shall:
\- if IMS AKA is in use as a security mechanism:
a) if the UE has not obtained a GRUU, populate the Contact header field of the
request with the protected server port and the respective contact address; and
b) include the protected server port and the respective contact address in the
Via header field entry relating to the UE;
\- if SIP digest without TLS is in use as a security mechanism:
a) if the UE has not obtained a GRUU, populate the Contact header field of the
request with the port value of an unprotected port and the contact address
where the UE expects to receive subsequent mid-dialog requests; and
b) populate the Via header field of the request with the port value of an
unprotected port and the respective contact address where the UE expects to
receive responses to the request;
\- if SIP digest with TLS is in use as a security mechanism:
a) if the UE has not obtained a GRUU, populate the Contact header field of the
request with the protected server port; and
b) include the protected server port in the Via header field entry relating to
the UE;
\- if NASS-IMS bundled authentication is in use as a security mechanism, and
therefore no port is provided for subsequent SIP messages by the P-CSCF during
registration, the UE shall send any request to the same port used for the
initial registration as described in subclause 5.1.1.2;
\- if GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is in use as a security mechanism, and
therefore no port is provided for subsequent SIP messages by the P-CSCF during
registration, the UE shall send any request to the same port used for the
initial registration as described in subclause 5.1.1.2.
If SIP digest without TLS is used, the UE shall not include RFC 3329 [48]
header field s in any SIP messages.
When SIP digest is in use, upon receiving a 407 (Proxy Authentication
Required) response to an initial request, the originating UE shall:
\- extract the digest-challenge parameters as indicated in RFC 2617 [21] from
the Proxy-Authenticate header field;
\- calculate the response as described in RFC 2617 [21]; and
\- send a new request containing a Proxy-Authorization header field in which
the header field parameters are populated as defined in RFC 2617 [21] using
the calculated response.
Where a security association or TLS session exists, the UE shall discard any
SIP response that is not protected by the security association or TLS session
and is received from the P-CSCF outside of the registration and authentication
procedures. The requirements on the UE within the registration and
authentication procedures are defined in subclause 5.1.1.
In accordance with RFC 3325 [34] the UE may insert a P-Preferred-Identity
header field in any initial request for a dialog or request for a standalone
transaction as a hint for creation of an asserted identity (contained in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field) within the IM CN subsystem.
NOTE 1: Since the S-CSCF uses the P-Asserted-Identity header field when
checking whether the UE originating request matches the initial filter
criteria, the P-Preferred-Identity header field inserted by the UE determines
which services and applications are invoked.
When sending any initial request for a dialog or request for a standalone
transaction using either a given contact address or to the registration flow
and the associated contact address, the UE may include any of the following in
the P-Preferred-Identity header field:
\- a public user identity which has been registered by the user with the
respective contact address;
\- an implicitly registered public user identity returned in a registration-
state event package of a NOTIFY request whose \ sub-element inside the
\ sub-element of the \ element is the same as the
contact address being used for this request and was not subsequently
deregistered or that has not expired; or
\- any other public user identity which the user has assumed by mechanisms
outside the scope of this specification to have a current registration.
NOTE 2: The temporary public user identity specified in subclause 5.1.1.1 is
not a public user identity suitable for use in the P-Preferred-Identity header
field.
NOTE 3: Procedures in the network require international public
telecommunication numbers when telephone numbers are used in P-Preferred-
Identity header field.
NOTE 4: A number of header fields can reveal information about the identity of
the user. Where privacy is required, implementers should also give
consideration to other header fields that can reveal identity information. RFC
3323 [33] subclause 4.1 gives considerations relating to a number of header
fields.
Where privacy is required, in any initial request for a dialog or request for
a standalone transaction, the UE shall set the From header field to
\"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 5: The contents of the From header field are not necessarily modified by
the network based on any privacy specified by the user either within the UE
indication of privacy or by network subscription or network policy. Therefore
the user should include the value \"Anonymous\" whenever privacy is explicitly
required. As the user may well have privacy requirements, terminal
manufacturers should not automatically derive and include values in this
header field from the public user identity or other values stored in or
derived from the UICC. Where the user has not expressed a preference in the
configuration of the terminal implementation, the implementation should assume
that privacy is required. Users that require to identify themselves, and are
making calls to SIP destinations beyond the IM CN subsystem, where the
destination does not implement RFC 3325 [34], will need to include a value in
the From header field other than Anonymous.
The UE shall determine the public user identity to be used for this request as
follows:
1) if a P-Preferred-Identity was included, then use that as the public user
identity for this request; or
2) if no P-Preferred-Identity was included, then use the default public user
identity for the security association or TLS session and the associated
contact address as the public user identity for this request;
The UE shall not include its \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter in the
Contact header field in its non-register requests and responses except when
the request or response is guaranteed to be sent to a trusted intermediary
that will remove the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter prior to
forwarding the request or response to the destination.
NOTE 6: Such trusted intermediaries include an AS that all such requests as
part of an application or service traverse. In order to ensure that all
requests or responses containing the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter
are forwarded via the trusted intermediary the UE needs to have first verified
that the trusted intermediary is present (e.g first contacted via a
registration or configuration procedure). Including the \"+sip.instance\"
header field parameter containing an IMEI URN does not violate RFC 7254 [153]
even when the UE requests privacy using RFC 3323 [33].
If this is a request for a new dialog, the Contact header field is populated
as follows:
> 1) a contact header value which is one of:
\- if a public GRUU value (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) has been saved
associated with the public user identity to be used for this request, and the
UE does not indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then the UE should
insert the public GRUU (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) value as
specified in RFC 5627 [93]; or
\- if a temporary GRUU value (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter) has been
saved associated with the public user identity to be used for this request,
and the UE does indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then the UE
should insert the temporary GRUU (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter) value
as specified in RFC 5627 [93]; or
\- otherwise, a SIP URI containing the contact address of the UE;
NOTE 7: The above items are mutually exclusive.
2) include an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter, if the UE supports multiple
registrations, and the UE wants all subsequent requests in the dialog to
arrive over the same flow identified by the flow token as described in RFC
5626 [92];
3) if the request is related to an IMS communication service that requires the
use of an ICSI then the UE shall include in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature
tag, as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3841 [56B], the ICSI value (coded
as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) for the IMS communication service. The UE
may also include other ICSI values that the UE is prepared to use for all
dialogs with the terminating UE(s); and
4) if the request is related to an IMS application that is supported by the
UE, then the UE may include in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag, as defined
in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3841 [56B], the IARI value (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.9.2) that is related to the IMS application and that applies
for the dialog.
If this is a request within an existing dialog, and the request includes a
Contact header field, then the UE should insert the previously used Contact
header field.
If the UE support multiple registrations as specified in RFC 5626 [92], the UE
should include option-tag \"outbound\" in the Supported header field.
If this is a request for a new dialog or standalone transaction and the
request is related to an IMS communication service that requires the use of an
ICSI then the UE:
1) shall include the ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2),
for the IMS communication service that is related to the request in a
P-Preferred-Service header field according to RFC 6050 [121]. If a list of
network supported ICSI values was received as specified in 3GPP TS 24.167
[8G], the UE shall only include an ICSI value that is in the received list;
NOTE 8: The UE only receives those ICSI values corresponding to the IMS
communication services that the network provides to the user.
2) may include an Accept-Contact header field containing an ICSI value (coded
as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) that is related to the request in a
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 if the ICSI
for the IMS communication service is known.
NOTE 9: If the UE includes the same ICSI values into the Accept-Contact header
field and the P-Preferred-Service header field, there is a possibility that
one of the involved S-CSCFs or an AS changes the ICSI value in the P-Asserted-
Service header field, which results in the message including two different
ICSI values (one in the P-Asserted-Service header field, changed in the
network and one in the Accept-Contact header field).
If an IMS application indicates that an IARI is to be included in a request
for a new dialog or standalone transaction, the UE shall include an Accept-
Contact header field containing an IARI value (coded as specified in subclause
7.2A.9.2) that is related to the request in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature
tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3841 [56B].
NOTE 10: RFC 3841 [56B] allows multiple Accept-Contact header fields along
with multiple Reject-Contact header fields in a SIP request, and within those
header fields, expressions that include one or more logical operations based
on combinations of media feature tags. Which registered UE will be contacted
depends on the Accept-Contact header field and Reject-Contact header field
combinations included that evaluate to a logical expression and the relative
qvalues of the registered contacts for the targeted registered public user
identity. There is therefore no guarantee that when multiple Accept-Contact
header fields or additional Reject-Contact header field(s) along with the
Accept-Contact header field containing the ICSI value or IARI value are
included in a request that the request will be routed to a contact that
registered the same ICSI value or IARI value. Charging and accounting is based
upon the contents of the P-Asserted-Service header field and the actual media
related contents of the SIP request and not the Accept-Contact header field
contents or the contact reached.
NOTE 11: The UE only includes the header field parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" in the Accept-Contact header field containing the ICSI value or
IARI value if the IMS communication service absolutely requires that the
terminating UE understand the IMS communication service in order to be able to
accept the session. Including the header field parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" in Accept-Contact header fields in requests which don't
absolutely require that the terminating UE understand the IMS communication
service in order to accept the session creates an interoperability problem for
sessions which otherwise would interoperate and violates the interoperability
requirements for the ICSI in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7].
After the dialog is established the UE may change the dialog capabilities
(e.g. add a media or request a supplementary service) if defined for the IMS
communication service as identified by the ICSI value using the same dialog.
Otherwise, the UE shall initiate a new initial request to the other user.
The UE can indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity that will be generated
by the P-CSCF in accordance with RFC 3323 [33], and the additional
requirements contained within RFC 3325 [34].
If resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] is required for a
dialog, then the UE shall include the Resource-Priority header field in all
requests associated with that dialog.
NOTE 12: The case where the UE is unaware of the requirement for resource
priority because the user requested the capability as part of the dialstring
falls outside the scope of this requirement. Such cases can exist and will
need to be dealt with by an appropriate AS to process the dialstring.
If available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific annexes
for each access technology), the UE shall insert a P-Access-Network-Info
header field into any request for a dialog, any subsequent request (except ACK
requests and CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL responses) within a
dialog or any request for a standalone method (see subclause 7.2A.4).
NOTE 13: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP-CAN of the UE
may change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will populate the
P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request or response within a dialog
with the current point of attachment to the IP-CAN (e.g. the current cell
information).
The UE shall build a proper preloaded Route header field value for all new
dialogs and standalone transactions. The UE shall build a list of Route header
field values made out of the following, in this order:
a) the P-CSCF URI containing the IP address or the FQDN learnt through the
P-CSCF discovery procedures; and
b) the P-CSCF port based on the security mechanism in use:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is in use as a security mechanism, the
protected server port learnt during the registration procedure;
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is in use as a security mechanism, the unprotected
server port used during the registration procedure;
c) and the values received in the Service-Route header field saved from the
200 (OK) response to the last registration or re-registration of the public
user identity with associated contact address.
NOTE 14: When the UE registers multiple contact addresses, there will be a
list of Service-Route headers for each contact address. When sending a request
using a given contact address and the associated security associations or TLS
session, the UE will use the corresponding list of Service-Route headers to
construct a list of Route headers.
The UE may indicate that proxies should not fork the request by including a
\"no-fork\" directive within the Request-Disposition header field in the
request as described in RFC 3841 [56B].
If the UE receives a 1xx or 200 (OK) response to an initial request for a
dialog, the response containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to an
emergency number as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A], the UE procedures in
subclause 5.1.6.10 apply.
##### 5.1.2A.1.2 Structure of Request-URI
The UE may use non-international formats of E.164 addresses, including geo-
local numbers and home-local numbers and other local numbers (e.g. private
number), in the Request-URI.
Local numbering information is sent in the Request-URI in initials requests or
stand alone transaction, using one of the following formats:
1) a tel-URI, complying with RFC 3966 [22], with a local number followed by a
\"phone-context\" tel URI parameter value.
2) a SIP URI, complying with RFC 3261 [26], with the \"user\" SIP URI
parameter set to \"phone\"
3) a SIP URI, complying with RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 4967 [103], with the
\"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"dialstring\"
The actual value of the URI depends on whether user equipment performs an
analysis of the dial string input by the end user or not.
##### 5.1.2A.1.3 UE without dial string processing capabilities
In this case the UE does not perform any analysis of the dial string. This
requires that the dialling plan is designed so it enables the network to
differentiate local numbers from other numbers.
The dial string is sent to the network, in the Request-URI of a initial
request or a stand alone transaction, using one of the following formats:
1) a tel-URI, syntactically complying with RFC 3966 [22], with the dial string
encoded as a local number followed by a \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
value;
EXAMPLE: tel:\;phone-context=operator.com
2) a SIP URI, syntactically complying with RFC 3261 [26], with the user =phone
parameter, embedding a tel-URI with a \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
value;
EXAMPLE: sip:\;
phone-context=operator.com\@operator.com;user=phone
3) a SIP URI, complying with RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 4967 [103], with the
user=dialstring parameter and a with a \"phone-context\" tel-URI parameter
value in the user part; or
EXAMPLE: sip:\;
phone-context=operator.com\@operator.com;user=dialstring
4) a SIP URI syntactically complying with RFC 3261 [26], where the user part
contains the dial string and the domain name is specific enough to enable to
network to understand that the user part contains a dial string.
EXAMPLE: sip:\\@dialstrings.entreprise.com
For cases 1), 2), and 3) the UE shall set the \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter in accordance with subclause 5.1.2A.1.5.
##### 5.1.2A.1.4 UE with dial string processing capabilities
In this case the UE performs sufficient dial string analysis (or receives an
explicit indication from the user) to identify the type of numbering that is
used and processes the dial string accordingly before building the Request-
URI.
If the UE detects that a local dialling plan is being used, where the terminal
is able to identify a global telephone number, the normal procedures apply
after removing all dial string elements used for local numbering detection
purposes (e.g. escape codes).
If the UE detects that a local (private or public) dialling plan is being
used, it may decide to send the dial string unchanged to the network as
described in subclause 5.1.2A.1.3 or the UE may decide to alter it to comply
with the local numbering plan (e.g. remove all dial string elements used for
local numbering detection).
In the latter case the local numbering information is sent using one of the
following formats:
1) a tel-URI, complying with RFC 3966 [22], with a local number followed by a
\"phone-context\" tel-URI parameter value;
2) a SIP URI, complying with RFC 3261 [26], with the \"user\" SIP URI
parameter set to \"phone\"; and
3) if the UE intends to send information related to supplementary services, a
SIP URI, complying with RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 4967 [103], with the \"user\"
SIP URI parameter set to \"dialstring\" and a with a \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter value in the user part.
NOTE: The way how the UE process the dial-string and handles special
characters (e.g. pause) in order to produce a conformant SIP URI or tel-URI
according to RFC 3966 [22] is implementation specific.
As a general rule, recognition of special service numbers shall take priority
over other dialling plan issues. If the dial string equates to a pre-
configured service URN as specified in RFC 5031 [69]) then the service-urn
should be sent.
##### 5.1.2A.1.5 Setting the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
When the UE uses home-local number, the UE shall include in the \"phone-
context\" tel URI parameter the home domain name in accordance with RFC 3966
[22].
When the UE uses geo-local number, the UE shall:
\- if access technology information available to the UE (i.e., the UE can
insert P-Access-Network-Info header field into the request), include the
access technology information in the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
according to RFC 3966 [22] as defined in subclause 7.2A.10; and
\- if access technology information is not available to the UE (i.e., the UE
cannot insert P-Access-Network-Info header field into the request), include in
the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter the home domain name prefixed by the
\"geo-local.\" string according to RFC 3966 [22] as defined in subclause
7.2A.10.
When the UE uses other local numbers, than geo-local number or home local
numbers , e.g. private numbers that are different from home-local number, the
UE shall include a \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter set according to RFC
3966 [22], e.g. if private numbers are used a domain name to which the private
addressing plan is associated.
NOTE 1: The \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter value can be entered or
selected by the subscriber, or can be a \"pre-configured\" value inserted by
the UE, based on implementation.
NOTE 2: The way how the UE determines whether numbers in a non-international
format are geo-local, home-local or relating to another network, is
implementation specific.
NOTE 3: Home operator\'s local policy can define a prefix string(s) to enable
subscribers to differentiate dialling a geo-local number and/or a home-local
number.
##### 5.1.2A.1.6 Abnormal cases
In the event the UE receives a 504 (Server Time-out) response containing:
1) a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to a value equal to a URI:
a) from the Service-Route header field value received during registration; or
b) from the Path header field value received during registration; and
2) a Content-Type header field set according to subclause 7.6 (i.e.
\"application/3gpp-ims+xml\"), independent of the value or presence of the
Content-Disposition header field, independent of the value or presence of
Content-Disposition parameters, then the following treatment is applied:
a) if the 504 (Server Time-out) response includes an IM CN subsystem XML body
as described in subclause 7.6 with the \ element, including a
version attribute, with the \ child element:
A) with the \ child element set to \"restoration\" (see table 7.7AA);
and
B) with the \ child element set to \"initial-registration\" (see table
7.7AB);
then the UE:
\- shall initiate restoration procedures by performing an initial registration
as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2; and
\- may provide an indication to the user based on the text string contained in
the \ child element of the \ child element of the
\ element.
When sending a request from a contact address (or via a registration flow if
the multiple registration mechanism is used) which is bound to a public user
identity by registration which used a P-CSCF address, and:
\- if timer F expires in the \"Trying\" state of non-INVITE client transaction
as described in IETF RFC 3261 [26];
\- if a fatal transport error is reported by the transport layer in the
\"Trying\" state of non-INVITE client transaction as described in IETF RFC
3261 [26];
\- if timer B expires in the \"Calling\" state of INVITE client transaction as
described in IETF RFC 6026 [163]; or
\- if a fatal transport error is reported by the transport layer in
\"Calling\" state of INVITE client transaction as described in IETF RFC 6026
[163];
then the UE shall:
1) if the multiple registration mechanism is not used, consider the contact
address as not bound to any public user identity and remove the P-CSCF address
from the list of P-CSCF addresses discovered during the procedures described
in subclause 9.2.1; and
2) if the multiple registration mechanism is used, declare the registration
flow dead as defined in RFC 5626 [92] and remove the P-CSCF address from the
list of P-CSCF addresses discovered during the procedures described in
subclause 9.2.1.
NOTE: When a fatal transport error occurs, further steps might be necessary to
restore the transport layer, possibly including re-establishment of an IP-CAN
bearer.
#### 5.1.2A.2 UE-terminating case
The procedures of this subclause are general to all requests and responses,
except those for the REGISTER method.
Where a security association or TLS session exists, the UE shall discard any
SIP request that is not protected by the security association or TLS session
and is received from the P-CSCF outside of the registration and authentication
procedures. The requirements on the UE within the registration and
authentication procedures are defined in subclause 5.1.1.
If an initial request contains an Accept-Contact header field containing the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag with an ICSI value, the UE should invoke the
IMS application that is the best match for the ICSI value.
If an initial request contains an Accept-Contact header field containing the
g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag with an IARI value the UE should invoke the
IMS application that is the best match for the IARI value.
The UE can receive multiple ICSI values, IARI values or both in an Accept-
Contact header field. In this case it is up to the implementation which of the
multiple ICSI values or IARI values the UE takes action on.
NOTE 1: The application verifies that the contents of the request (e.g. SDP
media capabilities, Content-Type header field) are consistent with the the
ICSI value in the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag and IARI value contained
in the g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag.
If an initial request does not contain an Accept-Contact header field
containing a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag or a g.3gpp.iari-ref media
feature tag the UE shall invoke the application that is the best match based
on the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type
header field, media feature tag).
The UE can indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity that will be generated
by the P-CSCF in accordance with RFC 3323 [33], and the additional
requirements contained within RFC 3325 [34].
NOTE 2: In the UE-terminating case, this version of the document makes no
provision for the UE to provide a P-Preferred-Identity in the form of a hint.
NOTE 3: A number of header fields can reveal information about the identity of
the user. Where, privacy is required, implementers should also give
consideration to other header fields that can reveal identity information. RFC
3323 [33] subclause 4.1 gives considerations relating to a number of header
fields.
The UE shall not include its \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter in the
Contact header field in its non-register requests and responses except when
the request or response is guaranteed to be sent to a trusted intermediary
that will remove the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter prior to
forwarding the request or response to the destination.
NOTE 4: Such trusted intermediaries include an AS that all such requests as
part of an application or service traverse. In order to ensure that all
requests or responses containing the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter
are forwarded via the trusted intermediary the UE needs to have first verified
that the trusted intermediary is present (e.g first contacted via a
registration or configuration procedure). Including the \"+sip.instance\"
header field parameter containing an IMEI URN does not violate RFC 7254 [153]
even when the UE requests privacy using RFC 3323 [33].
If the response includes a Contact header field, and the response is sent
within an existing dialog, and the Contact address previously used in the
dialog was a GRUU, then the UE should insert the previously used GRUU value in
the Contact header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93].
If the response includes a Contact header field, and the response is not sent
within an existing dialog, the Contact header field is populated as follows:
1) if a public GRUU value (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) has been saved
associated with the public user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID header
field, and the UE does not indicate privacy of the contents of the P-Asserted-
Identity header field, then the UE should insert the public GRUU (\"pub-gruu\"
header field parameter) value as specified in RFC 5627 [93];
2) if a temporary GRUU value (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter) has been
saved associated with the public user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID
header field, and the UE does indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity,
then should insert the temporary GRUU (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter)
value in the Contact header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93];
NOTE 5: The above items 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive.
3) if the request is related to an IMS communication service that requires the
use of an ICSI then the UE shall include in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature
tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3841 [56B] the ICSI value (coded as
specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2), for the IMS communication service and then
the UE may include the IARI value for any IMS application that applies for the
dialog, (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), that is related to the
request in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3
and RFC 3841 [56B]. The UE may also include other ICSI values that the UE is
prepared to use for all dialogs with the originating UE(s) and other IARI
values for the IMS application that is related to the IMS communication
service; and
4) if the request is related to an IMS application that is supported by the UE
when the use of an ICSI is not needed, then the UE may include the IARI value
(coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), that is related to any IMS
application and that applies for the dialog, in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media
feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3841 [56B].
After the dialog is established the UE may change the dialog capabilities
(e.g. add a media or request a supplementary service) if defined for the IMS
communication service as identified by the ICSI value using the same dialog.
Otherwise, the UE shall initiate a new initial request to the other user.
If the UE did not insert a GRUU in the Contact header field then the UE shall
include a port in the address in the Contact header field as follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the protected server port value as in the initial registration; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS is being used as a security mechanism, the port
value of an unprotected port where the UE expects to receive subsequent mid-
dialog requests. The UE shall set the unprotected port value to the port value
used in the initial registration.
If resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] is required for a
dialog, then the UE shall include the Resource-Priority header field in all
requests associated with that dialog.
If available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific annexes
for each access technology), the UE shall insert a P-Access-Network-Info
header field into any response to a request for a dialog, any subsequent
request (except CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL responses) within
a dialog or any response to a standalone method (see subclause 7.2A.4).
### 5.1.3 Call initiation - UE-originating case
#### 5.1.3.1 Initial INVITE request
Upon generating an initial INVITE request, the UE shall include the Accept
header field with \"application/sdp\", the MIME type associated with the 3GPP
IM CN subsystem XML body (see subclause 7.6.1) and any other MIME type the UE
is willing and capable to accept.
The \"integration of resource management and SIP\" extension is hereafter in
this subclause referred to as \"the precondition mechanism\" and is defined in
RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64].
The preconditions mechanism should be supported by the originating UE.
The UE may initiate a session without the precondition mechanism if the
originating UE does not require local resource reservation.
NOTE 1: The originating UE can decide if local resource reservation is
required based on e.g. application requirements, current access network
capabilities, local configuration, etc.
In order to allow the peer entity to reserve its required resources, an
originating UE supporting the precondition mechanism should make use of the
precondition mechanism, even if it does not require local resource
reservation.
Upon generating an initial INVITE request using the precondition mechanism,
the UE shall:
\- indicate the support for reliable provisional responses and specify it
using the Supported header field mechanism;and
\- indicate the support for the preconditions mechanism and specify it using
the Supported header field mechanism.
Upon generating an initial INVITE request using the precondition mechanism,
the UE shall not indicate the requirement for the precondition mechanism by
using the Require header field mechanism.
NOTE 2: Table A.4 specifies that UE support of forking is required in
accordance with RFC 3261 [26]. The UE can accept or reject any of the forked
responses, for example, if the UE is capable of supporting a limited number of
simultaneous transactions or early dialogs.
Upon successful reservation of local resources the UE shall confirm the
successful resource reservation (see subclause 6.1.2) within the next SIP
request.
NOTE 3: In case of the precondition mechanism being used on both sides, this
confirmation will be sent in either a PRACK request or an UPDATE request. In
case of the precondition mechanism not being supported on one or both sides,
alternatively a reINVITE request can be used for this confirmation after a 200
(OK) response has been received for the initial INVITE request, in case the
terminating UE does not support the PRACK request (as described in RFC 3262
[27]) and does not support the UPDATE request (as described in RFC 3311 [29]).
NOTE 4: If the UE supports the P-Early-Media header field, upon receiving a
18x provisional response with a P-Early-Media header field indicating
authorized early media, as described in RFC 5009 [109], if the preconditions
are met, the UE should, based on local configuration, present received early
media to the user.
NOTE 5: If the UE supports the P-Early-Media header field, upon receiving a
180 (Ringing) provisional response with a P-Early-Media header field
indicating authorized early media, as described in RFC 5009 [109], if the
preconditions are met, and the UE presents the received early media to the
user based on local configuration, the UE will not provide an indication that
the invited user is being alerted.
NOTE 6: If the UE supports the P-Early-Media header field and if the most
recently received P-Early-Media header field within the dialog includes a
parameter applicable to media stream with value \"inactive\", then based on
local configuration, the UE will provide an indication that the invited user
is being alerted and stop presenting received early media to the user if
requested by any previous receipt of P-Early-Media header field within the
dialog.
If the UE wishes to receive early media authorization indications, as
described in RFC 5009 [109], the UE shall add the P-Early-Media header field
with the \"supported\" parameter to the INVITE request.
To request end to access edge media security on a media level, the UE shall
send an SDP Offer for an SRTP stream containing one or more SDES crypto
attributes, each with a key and other security context parameters required
according to RFC 4568 [168], together with the attribute \"a=3ge2ae\".
When a final answer is received for one of the early dialogues, the UE
proceeds to set up the SIP session. The UE shall not progress any remaining
early dialogues to established dialogs. Therefore, upon the reception of a
subsequent final 200 (OK) response for an INVITE request (e.g., due to
forking), the UE shall:
1) acknowledge the response with an ACK request; and
2) send a BYE request to this dialog in order to terminate it.
Upon receiving a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response to an initial INVITE
request, the originating UE should send a new INVITE request containing SDP
according to the procedures defined in subclause 6.1.
NOTE 7: An example of where a new request would not be sent is where knowledge
exists within the UE, or interaction occurs with the user, such that it is
known that the resulting SDP would describe a session that did not meet the
user requirements.
Upon receiving a 421 (Extension Required) response to an initial INVITE
request in which the precondition mechanism was not used, including the
\"precondition\" option-tag in the Require header field, the originating UE
shall:
\- send a new INVITE request using the precondition mechanism, if the
originating UE supports the precondition mechanism; and
\- send an UPDATE request as soon as the necessary resources are available and
a 200 (OK) response for the first PRACK request has been received.
Upon receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to an initial INVITE
request containing a Retry-After header field, then the originating UE shall
not automatically reattempt the request until after the period indicated by
the Retry-After header field contents.
The UE may include a \"cic\" tel-URI parameter in a tel-URI, or in the
userinfo part of a SIP URI with user=phone, in the Request-URI of an initial
INVITE request if the UE wants to identify a user-dialed carrier, as described
in RFC 4694 [112].
NOTE 8: The method whereby the UE determines when to include a \"cic\" tel-URI
parameter and what value it should contain is outside the scope of this
document (e.g. the UE could use a locally configured digit map to look for
special prefix digits that indicate the user has dialled a carrier).
NOTE 9: The value of the \"cic\" tel-URI parameter reported by the UE is not
dependent on UE location (e.g. the reported value is not affected by roaming
scenarios).
In the event the UE receives a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an INVITE
request the response containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field with a
value equal to the value of the last entry on the Path header field value
received during registration and the the response containing a 3GPP IM CN
subsystem XML body that includes an \ element, including a version
attribute, with an \ child element with the \ child
element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA), the UE shall select a domain
in accordance with the conventions and rules specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A]
and 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B], and:
\- if the CS domain is selected, the UE behavior is defined in subclause 7.1.2
of 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] and, where appropriate, in the access technology
specific annex; and
\- if the IM CN subsystem is selected, the UE shall apply the procedures in
subclause 5.1.6.
NOTE 10: The last entry on the Path header field value received during
registration is the value of the SIP URI of the P-CSCF.
Upon receiving a 199 (Early Dialog Terminated) provisional response to an
established early dialog the UE shall release resources specifically related
to that early dialog.
### 5.1.4 Call initiation - UE-terminating case
#### 5.1.4.1 Initial INVITE request
The preconditions mechanism should be supported by the terminating UE.
The handling of incoming initial INVITE requests at the terminating UE is
mainly dependent on the following conditions:
\- the specific service requirements for \"integration of resource management
and SIP\" extension (hereafter in this subclause known as the precondition
mechanism and defined in RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64], and with
the request for such a mechanism known as a precondition); and
\- the UEs configuration for the case when the specific service does not
require the precondition mechanism.
If an initial INVITE request is received the terminating UE shall check
whether the terminating UE requires local resource reservation.
NOTE 1: The terminating UE can decide if local resource reservation is
required based on e.g. application requirements, current access network
capabilities, local configuration, etc.
If local resource reservation is required at the terminating UE and the
terminating UE supports the precondition mechanism, and:
a) the received INVITE request includes the \"precondition\" option-tag in the
Supported header field or Require header field, the terminating UE shall make
use of the precondition mechanism and shall indicate a Require header field
with the \"precondition\" option-tag in any response or subsequent request it
sends towards to the originating UE; or
b) the received INVITE request does not include the \"precondition\" option-
tag in the Supported header field or Require header field, the terminating UE
shall not make use of the precondition mechanism.
If local resource reservation is not required by the terminating UE and the
terminating UE supports the precondition mechanism and:
a) the received INVITE request includes the \"precondition\" option-tag in the
Supported header field and:
\- the required resources at the originating UE are not reserved, the
terminating UE shall use the precondition mechanism; or
\- the required local resources at the originating UE and the terminating UE
are available, the terminating UE may use the precondition mechanism;
b) the received INVITE request does not include the \"precondition\" option-
tag in the Supported header field or Require header field, the terminating UE
shall not make use of the precondition mechanism; or
c) the received INVITE request includes the \"precondition\" option-tag in the
Require header field, the terminating UE shall use the precondition mechanism.
NOTE 2: Table A.4 specifies that UE support of forking is required in
accordance with RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 3: If the terminating UE does not support the precondition mechanism it
will apply regular SIP session initiation procedures.
If the terminating UE requires a reliable alerting indication at the
originating side, the UE shall send the 180 (Ringing) response reliably. If
the received INVITE request indicated support for reliable provisionable
responses, but did not require their use, the terminating UE shall send
provisional responses reliably only if the provisional response carries SDP or
for other application related purposes that requires its reliable transport.
NOTE 4: Certain applications, services and operator policies might mandate the
terminating UE to send a 199 (Early Dialog Terminated) provisional response
(see RFC 6228 [142]) prior to sending a non-2xx final response to the INVITE
request.
If the terminating UE uses the precondition mechanism, upon successful
reservation of local resources:
a) if the originating side requested confirmation for the result of the
resource reservation (as defined in RFC 3312 [30]) at the terminating UE, the
terminating UE shall confirm the successful resource reservation (see
subclause 6.1.3) within an UPDATE request; and
NOTE 5: Originating side requests confirmation for the result of the resource
reservation at the terminating UE e.g. when an application server performs 3rd
party call control. The request for confirmation for the result of the
resource reservation at the terminating UE can be included e.g. in the SDP
answer in the PRACK request.
b) if the originating side did not request confirmation for the result of the
resource reservation (as defined in RFC 3312 [30]) at the terminating UE, the
terminating UE shall not confirm the successful resource reservation (see
subclause 6.1.3) within an UPDATE request.
NOTE 6: The terminating UE can send an UPDATE request for reasons other than
confirmation of the successful resource reservation.
### 5.1.5 Call release
Void.
### 5.1.6 Emergency service
#### 5.1.6.1 General
A CS and IM CN subsystem capable UE shall follow the conventions and rules
specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A] and 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] to select the domain
for the emergency call attempt. If the CS domain is selected, the UE shall
attempt an emergency call setup using appropriate access technology specific
procedures.
The UE shall determine, whether it is currently attached to its home
operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) or to a different network than its home
operator\'s network (e.g. VPLMN) by applying access technology specific
procedures described in the access technology specific annexes.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is currently attached to its
home operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) and the UE is currently registered and
the IP-CAN does not define emergency bearers, the UE shall attempt an
emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.4.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is currently attached to its
home operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) and the UE is currently registered and
the IP-CAN defines emergency bearers and the core network has indicated that
it supports emergency bearers, the UE shall:
1) perform an initial emergency registration as described in subclause
5.1.6.2; and
2) attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.3.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is currently attached to its
home operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) and the UE is not currently registered,
the UE shall:
1) perform an initial emergency registration, as described in subclause
5.1.6.2; and
2) attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.3.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is attached to a different
network than its home operator\'s network (e.g. VPLMN), the UE shall:
1) perform an initial emergency registration, as described in subclause
5.1.6.2; and
2) attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.3.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE has no credentials the UE can
make an emergency call without being registered. The UE shall attempt an
emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.2.
The IP-CAN can, dependent on the IP-CAN capabilities, provide local emergency
numbers (including information about emergency service categories) to the UE
which has that capability, in order for the UE to recognize these numbers as
emergency call.
#### 5.1.6.2 Initial emergency registration
When the user initiates an emergency call, if emergency registration is needed
(including cases described in subclause 5.1.6.2A), the UE shall perform an
emergency registration prior to sending the SIP request related to the
emergency call.
The UE shall have only one valid emergency registration at any given time. If
the UE initiates a new emergency registration using different contact address,
and the previous emergency registration has not expired, the UE shall consider
the previous emergency registration as expired.
IP-CAN procedures for emergency registration are defined in 3GPP TS 23.167
[4B] and in each access technology specific annex.
When a UE performs an initial emergency registration the UE shall perform the
actions as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2 with the following additions and
modifications:
a) the UE shall include a \"sos\" SIP URI parameter in the Contact header
field as described in subclause 7.2A.13, indicating that indicates that this
is an emergency registration and that the associated contact address is
allowed only for emergency service; and
b) the UE shall populate the From and To header fields of the REGISTER request
with:
\- the first entry in the list of public user identities provisioned in the
UE;
\- the default public user identity obtained during the normal registration,
if the UE is not provisioned with a list of public user identites, but the UE
is currently registered to the IM CN subsystem; and
\- the derived temporary public user identity, in all other cases.
When the UE performs an initial emergency registration and whilst this
emergency registration is active, the UE shall:
\- handle the emergency registration independently from any other ongoing
registration to the IM CN subsystem;
\- handle any signalling or media related IP-CAN for the purpose of emergency
calls independently from any other established IP-CAN for IM CN subsystem
related signalling or media; and
\- handle all SIP signalling and all media related to the emergency call
independently from any other ongoing IM CN subsystem signalling and media.
#### 5.1.6.2A New initial emergency registration
The UE shall perform a new initial emergency registration, as specified in
subclause 5.1.6.2, if the UE determines that:
\- it has previously performed an emergency registration which has not yet
expired; and
\- it has obtained an IP address from the serving IP-CAN, as specified in
subclause 9.2.1, different than the IP address used for the emergency
registration.
#### 5.1.6.3 Initial subscription to the registration-state event package
Upon receiving the 200 (OK) to the REGISTER request that completes the
emergency registration, the UE shall not subscribe to the reg event package of
the public user identity specified in the REGISTER request.
#### 5.1.6.4 User-initiated emergency reregistration
The UE shall perform user-initiated emergency reregistration as specified in
subclause 5.1.1.4 if half of the time for the emergency registration has
expired and:
\- the UE has emergency related ongoing dialog; or
\- standalone transactions exist; or
\- the user initiates an emergency call.
The UE shall not perform user-initiated emergency reregistration in any other
cases.
#### 5.1.6.5 Authentication
When a UE performs authentication a UE shall perform the procedures as
specified in subclause 5.1.1.5.
#### 5.1.6.6 User-initiated emergency deregistration
Once the UE registers a public user identity and an associated contact address
via emergency registration, the UE shall not perform user-initiated
deregistration of the respective public user identity and the associated
contact address.
NOTE: The UE will be deregistered when the emergency registration expires.
#### 5.1.6.7 Network-initiated emergency deregistration
An emergency registration will not be deregistered by the network (see
subclause 5.4.8.4).
#### 5.1.6.8 Emergency session setup
##### 5.1.6.8.1 General
The UE shall translate any user indicated emergency number as specified in
3GPP TS 22.101 [1A] to an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a
top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69].
When an initial request for a dialog or a standalone transaction, or an
unknown method transmitted as part of UE detected emergency call procedures as
defined in subclause 5.1.6 is initiated:
\- in event other than reception of a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an
initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown
method as defined in procedures in subclause 5.1.3.1, subclause 5.1.6.8.1,
subclause 5.1.6.8.3 and subclause 5.1.6.8.4; or
\- upon reception of a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an initial
request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method as
defined in procedures in subclause 5.1.3.1, subclause 5.1.6.8.1, subclause
5.1.6.8.3 and subclause 5.1.6.8.4, and the 380 (Alternative Service) response
does not contain a Contact header field containing a service URN with a top-
level service type of \"sos\";
the Request-URI of the initial request for a dialog or the standalone
transaction, or the unknown method transmitted as part of UE detected
emergency call procedures as defined in subclause 5.1.6 shall include one of
the following service URNs; \"urn:service:sos\",
\"urn:service:sos.ambulance\", \"urn:service:sos.police\",
\"urn:service:sos.fire\", \"urn:service:sos.marine\",
\"urn:service:sos.mountain\". If the UE can determine the type of emergency
service the UE shall include a sub-service type.
NOTE 1: A service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" is used only
when the user intends to establish an emergency call.
When an initial request for a dialog or a standalone transaction, or an
unknown method transmitted as part of UE detected emergency call procedures as
defined in subclause 5.1.6 is initiated upon reception of 380 (Alternative
Service) response to an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone
transaction, or an unknown method as defined in procedures in subclause
5.1.3.1, subclause 5.1.6.8.1, subclause 5.1.6.8.3 and subclause 5.1.6.8.4, and
if the 380 (Alternative Service) response contains a Contact header field
containing a service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\", the UE
shall set the Request-URI of the initial request for a dialog or the
standalone transaction, or the unknown method transmitted as part of UE
detected emergency call procedures as defined in subclause 5.1.6 to the
service URN of the Contact header field of the 380 (Alternative Service)
response.
In the event the UE receives a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an INVITE
request the response including a 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in
subclause 7.6 that includes an \ element, including a version
attribute, with an \ child element with the \ child
element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA), the UE shall automatically
send an ACK request to the P-CSCF as per normal SIP procedures and terminate
the session. In addition, if the 380 (Alternative Service) response includes a
P-Asserted-Identity header field with a value equal to the value of the last
entry on the Path header field value received during registration:
\- the UE may also provide an indication to the user based on the text string
contained in the \ child element of the \ child
element of the \ element; and
\- one of subclause 5.1.6.8.3 or subclause 5.1.6.8.4 applies.
NOTE 2: Emergency numbers which the UE does not detect, will be treated as a
normal call.
NOTE 3: The last entry on the Path header field value received during
registration is the value of the SIP URI of the P-CSCF.
##### 5.1.6.8.2 Emergency session set-up in case of no registration
When establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the UE is
allowed to receive responses to emergency requests and requests inside an
established emergency session on the unprotected ports. The UE shall reject or
silently discard all other messages not arriving on a protected port.
Additionally, the UE shall transmit signalling packets pertaining to the
emergency session from the same IP address and unprotected port on which it
expects to receive signalling packets containing the responses to emergency
requests and the requests inside the established emergency session.
Prior to establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the UE
shall acquire a local IP address, discover a P-CSCF, and establish an IP-CAN
bearer that can be used for SIP signalling. The UE shall send only the initial
INVITE requests to the port advertised to the UE during the P-CSCF discovery
procedure. If the UE does not receive any specific port information during the
P-CSCF discovery procedure, the UE shall send the initial INVITE request to
the SIP default port values as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
The UE shall apply the procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A.1 and
subclause 5.1.3 with the following additions:
1) the UE shall set the From header field of the INVITE request to
\"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261 [26];
2) the UE shall include a service URN in the Request-URI of the initial INVITE
request in accordance with subclause 5.1.6.8.1;
NOTE 1: Other specifications make provision for emergency service identifiers,
that are not specifically the emergency service URN, to be recognised in the
UE. Emergency service identifiers which the UE does not detect will be treated
as a normal call by the UE.
3) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with the same
emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;
4) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), the UE shall include in the P-Access-
Network-Info header field in any request for a dialog, any subsequent request
(except ACK requests and CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL
responses) within a dialog or any request. The UE shall populate the P-Access-
Network-Info header field with the current point of attachment to the IP-CAN
as specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4). The
P-Access-Network-Info header field contains the location identifier such as
the cell id, the line id or the identity of the I-WLAN access node, which is
relevant for routeing the emergency call;
5) if defined by the access technology specific annex, the UE shall populate
the P-Preferred-Identity header field in the INVITE request with an equipment
identifier as a SIP URI. The special details of the equipment identifier to
use depends on the IP-CAN;
6) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI that contains in the hostport
parameter the IP address of the UE and an unprotected port where the UE will
receive incoming requests belonging to this dialog. The UE shall also include
a \"sip.instance\" media feature tag containing Instance ID as described in
RFC 5626 [92]. The UE shall not include either the public or temporary GRUU in
the Contact header field;
7) a Via header field set to include the IP address of the UE in the sent-by
field and for the UDP the unprotected server port value where the UE will
receive response to the emergency request, while for the TCP, the response is
received on the TCP connection on which the emergency request was sent. The UE
shall also include \"rport\" header field parameter with no value in the top
Via header field. Unless the UE has been configured to not send keep-alives,
and unless the UE is directly connected to an IP-CAN for which usage of NAT is
not defined, it shall include a \"keep\" header field parameter with no value
in the Via header field, in order to indicate support of sending keep-alives
associated with, and during the lifetime of, the emergency session, as
described in RFC 6223 [143];
NOTE 2: The UE inserts the same IP address and port number into the Contact
header field and the Via header field, and sends all IP packets to the P-CSCF
from this IP address and port number.
8) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that points to
the location information, the UE shall include a Geolocation header field in
the INVITE request in the following way:
\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location is
stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as described in
RFC 6442 [89]; or
\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with RFC 4119 [90],
include the location object in a message body with the content type
application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL, referring to the message
body, as the Geolocation header field value, as described RFC 6442 [89];
9) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also include a
Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field value, which
indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other entities to make
routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 [89]; and
10) if the UE has neither geographical location information available, nor a
URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not insert a
Geolocation header field in the INVITE request.
NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a URI when
the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF provider. This is an
issue on which the network operator needs to provide guidance to the end user.
A URI that is only resolvable to the UE which is making the emergency call is
inapplicable in this area.
NOTE 5: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP-CAN of the UE
can change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will populate the
P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request or response within a dialog
with the current point of attachment to the IP-CAN (e.g. the current cell
information).
The UE shall build a proper preloaded Route header field value for all new
dialogs. The UE shall build a Route header field value containing only the
P-CSCF URI (containing the unprotected port number and the IP address or the
FQDN learnt through the P-CSCF discovery procedures).
When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H expires at
the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described in subclause
5.1.1.4.
NOTE 6: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means.
NOTE 7: A number of header fields can reveal information about the identity of
the user. Where privacy is required, implementers should also give
consideration to other header fields that can reveal identity information. RFC
3323 [33] subclause 4.1 gives considerations relating to a number of header
fields.
NOTE 8: RFC 3261 [26] provides for the use of the Priority header field with a
suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that emergency sessions
contain this value, but such usage will have no impact on the processing
within the IM CN subsystem.
If the response for the initial INVITE request indicates that the UE is behind
NAT, and the INVITE request was sent over TCP connection, the UE shall keep
the TCP connection during the entire duration of the emergency session. In
this case the UE will receive all responses to the emergency requests and the
requests inside the established emergency session over this TCP connection.
If the Via header field of any provisional response, or of the final 200 (OK)
response, for the initial INVITE request contains a \"keep\" header field
parameter with a value, unless the UE detects that it is not behind a NAT, the
UE shall start to send keep-alives associated with the session towards the
P-CSCF, as described in RFC 6223 [143].
##### 5.1.6.8.3 Emergency session set-up within an emergency registration
After a successful initial emergency registration, the UE shall apply the
procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A, 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 with the
following additions:
1) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a From header field that
includes the public user identity registered via emergency registration or the
tel URI associated with the public user identity registered via emergency
registration, as described in subclause 4.2;
2) the UE shall include a service URN in the Request-URI of the initial INVITE
request in accordance with subclause 5.1.6.8.1;
3) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with the same
emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;
4) if available to the UE, and if defined for the access type as specified in
subclause 7.2A.4, the P-Access-Network-Info header field shall contain a
location identifier such as the cell id, line id or the identity of the I-WLAN
access node, which is relevant for routeing the IMS emergency call;
NOTE 2: The IMS emergency specification in 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] describes
several methods how the UE can get its location information from the access
network or from a server. Such methods are not in the scope of this
specification.
5) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, one or two P-Preferred-Identity
header field(s) that include the public user identity registered via emergency
registration or the tel URI associated with the public user identity
registered via emergency registration as described in subclause 4.2;
NOTE 2: Providing two P-Preferred-Identity header fields is usually supported
by UE acting as enterprise network.
6) void;
7) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that points to
the location information, then the UE shall include a Geolocation header field
in the INVITE request in the following way:
\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location is
stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as described in
RFC 6442 [89]; or
\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with RFC 4119 [90],
include the location object in a message body with the content type
application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL, referring to the message
body, as the Geolocation header field value, as described RFC 6442 [89];
8) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also include a
Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field value, which
indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other entities to make
routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 [89]; and
NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a URI when
the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF provider. This is an
issue on which the network operator needs to provide guidance to the end user.
A URI that is only resolvable to the UE which is making the emergency call is
not desirable.
9) if the UE has neither geographical location information available, nor a
URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not insert a
Geolocation header field in the INVITE request.
NOTE 4: RFC 3261 [26] provides for the use of the Priority header field with a
suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that emergency sessions
contain this value, but such usage will have no impact on the processing
within the IM CN subsystem.
In the event the UE receives a 380 (Alternative Service) response with a
P-Asserted-Identity header field with a value equal to the value of the last
entry on the Path header field value received during registration, and the
Content-Type header field set according to subclause 7.6 (i.e.
\"application/3gpp-ims+xml\"), independent of the value or presence of the
Content-Disposition header field, independent of the value or presence of
Content-Disposition parameters, then the following treatment is applied:
1) if the 380 (Alternative Service) response includes a 3GPP IM CN subsystem
XML body as described in subclause 7.6 the \ element, including a
version attribute, with the \ child element with with the
\ child element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA), then the UE
shall:
a) if the CS domain is available to the UE, and no prior attempt using the CS
domain for the current emergency call attempt has been made, attempt emergency
call via CS domain using appropriate access technology specific procedures;
and
b) if the CS domain is not available to the UE or the emergency call has
already been attempted using the CS domain, then perform one of the following
actions:
\- if the \ child element of the \ child element
of the \ element in the IM CN subsystem XML body as described in
subclause 7.6 is set to \"emergency-registration\" (see table 7.7AB), perform
an initial emergency registration using a different VPLMN if available, as
described in subclause 5.1.6.2 and if the new emergency registration
succeeded, attempt an emergency call as described in this subclause; or
\- perform implementation specific actions to establish the emergency call;
and
2) if the 380 (Alternative Service) response includes a 3GPP IM CN subsystem
XML body as described in subclause 7.6 with the \ element, including
a version attribute, with the \ child element with the
\ child element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA) then the UE may
also provide an indication to the user based on the text string contained in
the \ child element of the \ child element of the
\ element.
NOTE 5: The last entry on the Path header field value received during
registration is the value of the SIP URI of the P-CSCF.
##### 5.1.6.8.4 Emergency session setup within a non-emergency registration
The UE shall apply the procedures as specified in subclauses 5.1.2A, 5.1.3 and
5.1.4 with the following additions:
1) the UE shall include a service URN;
2) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with the same
emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;
3) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a From header field that
includes the public user identity or the tel URI associated with the public
user identity, as described in subclause 4.2;
4) if available to the UE, and if defined for the access type as specified in
subclause 7.2A.4, the UE shall insert in the P-Access-Network-Info header
field a location identifier such as the cell id, line id or the identity of
the I-WLAN access node, which is relevant for routeing the IMS emergency call;
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] describes several methods how the UE can get its
location information from the access network or from a server. Such methods
are not in the scope of this specification.
5) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request one or two P-Preferred-Identity
header field(s) that include the public user identity or the tel URI
associated with the public user identity as described in subclause 4.2;
NOTE 2: Providing two P-Preferred-Identity header fields is usually supported
by UE acting as enterprise network.
6) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that points to
the location information, then the UE shall include a Geolocation header field
in the INVITE request in the following way:
\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location is
stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as described in
RFC 6442 [89]; or
\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with RFC 4119 [90],
include the location object in a message body with the content type
application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL, referring to the message
body, as the Geolocation header field value, as described RFC 6442 [89];
7) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also include a
Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field value, which
indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other entities to make
routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 [89];
8) if the UE has neither geographical location information available, nor a
URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not insert a
Geolocation header field in the INVITE request; and
NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a URI when
the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF provider. This is an
issue on which the network operator needs to provide guidance to the end user.
A URI that is only resolvable to the UE which is making the emergency call is
not desirable.
9) if a public GRUU value (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) has been saved
associated with the public user identity to be used for this request, then
insert the public GRUU (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) value in the
Contact header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93]. Otherwise the UE shall
include the address in the Contact header field set to contain the IP address
or FQDN of the UE, and the UE shall also include:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the protected server port value as in the initial registration; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled Authentication is being used as a security mechanism, the port value
of an unprotected port where the UE expects to receive subsequent mid-dialog
requests. The UE shall set the unprotected port value to the port value used
in the initial registration.
In the event the UE receives a 380 (Alternative Service) response with a
P-Asserted-Identity header field with a value equal to the value of the SIP
URI of the P-CSCF received in the Path header field during registration, and
the Content-Type header field set according to subclause 7.6 (i.e.
\"application/3gpp-ims+xml\"), independent of the value or presence of the
Content-Disposition header field, independent of the value or presence of
Content-Disposition parameters, then the following treatment is applied:
a) if the 380 (Alternative Service) response includes a 3GPP IM CN subsystem
XML body as described in subclause 7.6 with an \ element, including
a version attribute, with an \ child element with the
\ child element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA), then the UE
shall:
\- if the \ child element of the \ child element
of the \ element in the IM CN subsystem XML body as described in
subclause 7.6 is set to \"emergency-registration\" (see table 7.7AB), perform
an initial emergency registration, as described in subclause 5.1.6.2 and
attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.3;
\- attempt emergency call via CS domain using appropriate access technology
specific procedures, if available and not already tried; or
\- perform implementation specific actions to establish the emergency call;
and
b) if the 380 (Alternative Service) response includes a 3GPP IM CN subsystem
XML body as described in subclause 7.6 with an \ element, including
a version attribute, with an \ child element with the
\ child element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA) then the UE may
also provide an indication to the user based on the text string contained in
the \ child element of the \ child element of the
\ element.
NOTE 4: RFC 3261 [26] provides for the use of the Priority header field with a
suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that emergency sessions
contain this value, but such usage will have no impact on the processing
within the IM CN subsystem.
NOTE 5: The last entry on the Path header field value received during
registration is the value of the SIP URI of the P-CSCF.
#### 5.1.6.9 Emergency session release
Normal call release procedure shall apply, as specified in the subclause
5.1.5.
#### 5.1.6.10 Response to non-UE detectable emergency call
If the UE receives a 1xx or 200 (OK) response to an initial request for a
dialog, the response containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to an
emergency number as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A], and:
\- if a public GRUU value (pub-gruu) has been saved associated with the public
user identity, the public GRUU value has not been included in the Contact
header field of the initial request for a dialog as specified in RFC 5627
[93];
\- if a public GRUU value (pub-gruu) has not been saved and a protected server
port was not included in the address in the Contact header field of the the
initial request for a dialog; or
\- if the UE has its geographical location information available and the
geographical location information has not been included in the initial request
for a dialog; then the UE shall send an UPDATE request according to RFC 3311
[29]; and
1) if available to the UE, and if defined for the access type as specified in
subclause 7.2A.4, the UE shall include in the UPDATE request a P-Access-
Network-Info header field and it shall contain a location identifier such as
the cell id or the identity of the I-WLAN access node;
2) if the UE has its geographical location information available, or a URI
that points to the location information, then the UE shall include it in the
UPDATE request in the following way:
I) if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location is
stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as described in
RFC 6442 [89]; or
II) if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with RFC 4119 [90],
include the location object in a message body with the content type
application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL, referring to the message
body, as the Geolocation header field value, as described RFC 6442 [89];
3) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also include a
Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field value, which
indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other entities to make
routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 [89];
4) if the UE has neither geographical location information available, nor a
URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not insert a
Geolocation header field in the INVITE request; and
5) if a public GRUU value (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) has been saved
associated with the public user identity, then the UE shall insert the public
GRUU (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) value in the Contact header field
of the UPDATE request as specified in RFC 5627 [93]; otherwise the UE shall
include the address in the Contact header field set in accordance with
subclause 5.1.6.8.4, item 8.
NOTE 1: The IMS emergency specification in 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] describes
several methods how the UE can get its location information from the access
network or from a server. Such methods are not in the scope of this
specification.
NOTE 2: It is suggested that UEs only use the option of providing a URI when
the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF provider. This is an
issue on which the network operator needs to provide guidance to the end user.
A URI that is only resolvable to the UE which is making the emergency call is
not desirable.
NOTE 3: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP-CAN of the UE
can change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will populate the
P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request (except ACK requests and
CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL responses) within a dialog with
the current point of attachment to the IP-CAN (e.g. the current cell
information).
NOTE 4: In this version of the specification, only requests creating a dialog
can request emergency services.
If the UE receives a 1xx or 200 (OK) response to an initial request for a
dialog the response containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to an
emergency number as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A], then the UE may indicate
the nature of the session to the user.
### 5.1.7 Void
### 5.1.8 Void
## 5.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### 5.2.1 General
Where the P CSCF provides emergency call support, the procedures of subclause
5.2.10 shall be applied first.
Subclause 5.2.2 through subclause 5.2.9 define P-CSCF procedures for SIP that
do not relate to emergency. All SIP requests are first screened according to
the procedures of subclause 5.2.10 to see if they do relate to an emergency.
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- as relating to an emergency; or
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the P-CSCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs. If the P-CSCF recognises
the need for priority processing to a request or if the P-CSCF recognises the
need to provide different priority processing than the one indicated by the
originating UE, based on the information stored during registration, the
P-CSCF may insert or modify Resource-Priority header in accordance with RFC
4412 [116].
NOTE 1: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
The P-CSCF shall support the Path and Service-Route header fields.
NOTE 2: The Path header field is only applicable to the REGISTER request and
its 200 (OK) response. The Service-Route header field is only applicable to
the 200 (OK) response of REGISTER request.
NOTE 3: In subsequent procedures, the P-CSCF can address the needs of
individual users (e.g. in support of attached enterprise networks or in
support of priority mechanisms, from information saved during registration. In
this release of the specification, no information is specified in the
registration procedures to perform this, and therefore this information has to
either be associated with the user at time of registration from configured
information, or by a mechanism outside the scope of this release of the
specification.
When the P-CSCF sends any request or response to the UE, before sending the
message the P-CSCF shall:
\- remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses and P-Charging-Vector header
fields, if present.
When the P-CSCF receives any request or response from the UE, the P-CSCF:
1) shall remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses and P-Charging-Vector header
fields, if present. Also, the P-CSCF shall ignore any data received in the
P-Charging-Function-Addresses and P-Charging-Vector header fields; and
2) may insert previously saved values into the P-Charging-Function-Addresses
and P-Charging-Vector header fields before forwarding the message;
NOTE 4: When the P-CSCF is located in the visited network, then it will not
receive the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field from the S-CSCF, IBCF,
or I-CSCF. Instead, the P-CSCF discovers charging function addresses by other
means not specified in this document.
3) shall remove the P-Access-Network-Info header field, if the request or the
response include a P-Access-Network-Info header field with a \"network-
provided\" parameter;
4) may insert a P-Access-Network-Info header field where, if the request or
the response are sent using:
\- xDSL as an IP-CAN, the access-type field is set to one of \"ADSL\",
\"ADSL2\", \"ADSL2+\", \"RADSL\", \"SDSL\", \"HDSL\", \"HDSL2\", \"G.SHDSL\",
\"VDSL\", or \"IDSL\", the \"network-provided\" parameter is added and the
\"dsl-location\" parameter is set with the value received in the Location-
Information header field in the User-Data Answer command as specified in ETSI
ES 283 035 [98];
\- Ethernet as an IP-CAN, the access-type field is set to one of
\"IEEE-802.3\", \"IEEE-802.3a\", \"IEEE-802.3e\", \"IEEE-802.3i\",
\"IEEE-802.3j\", \"IEEE-802.3u\" ,\"IEEE-802.3ab\"or \"IEEE-802.3ae\",
\"IEEE-802.3ak\", \"IEEE-802.3aq\", \"IEEE-802.3an\", \"IEEE-802.3y\" or
\"IEEE-802.3z\" and if NASS subsystem is used, the \"network-provided\"
parameter is added and the \"eth-location\" parameter is set with the value
received in the Location-Information header field in the User-Data Answer
command as specified in ETSI ES 283 035 [98];
NOTE 5: The way the P-CSCF deduces that the request comes using xDSL or
Ethernet access is implementation dependent.
\- DOCSIS as an IP-CAN, the access-type field is set to \"DOCSIS\" and the
\"network-provided\" parameter is added.
NOTE 6: The way the P-CSCF deduces that the request comes using DOCSIS access
is implementation dependent.
\- 3GPP as an IP-CAN, the access-class field is set to the value has been
obtained from the PCRF using the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D]
and the \"network-provided\" parameter is added.
NOTE 7: The way the IM CN subsystem functionalities (e.g. S-CSCF, AS) deduce
the request comes using a 3GPP Rel-8 P-CSCF is implementation dependent.
NOTE 8: The above requirements to insert a P-Access-Network-Info header field
overrides the preclusion of this functionality by RFC 3455 [52].
When the P-CSCF receives any request or response containing the P-Media-
Authorization header field, the P-CSCF shall remove the header field.
NOTE 9: Depending on the security mechanism in use, the P-CSCF can integrity
protect all SIP messages sent to the UE outside of the registration and
authentication procedures by using a security association or TLS session. The
P-CSCF will discard any SIP message that is not protected by using a security
association or TLS session and is received outside of the registration and
authentication procedures. The integrity and confidentiality protection and
checking requirements on the P-CSCF within the registration and authentication
procedures are defined in subclause 5.2.2.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the P-CSCF shall not recurse
on 3xx responses.
NOTE 10: If the P-CSCF is connected to a PDF the requirements for this
interconnection is specified in the Release 6 version of this specification.
The P-CSCF may add, remove, or modify, the P-Early-Media header field within
forwarded SIP requests and responses according to procedures in RFC 5009
[109].
NOTE 11: The P-CSCF can use the P-Early-Media header field for the gate
control procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D]. In the presence of
early media for multiple dialogs due to forking, if the P-CSCF is able to
identify the media associated with a dialog, (i.e., if symmetric RTP is used
by the UE and and the P-CSCF can use the remote SDP information to determine
the source of the media) the P-CSCF can selectively open the gate
corresponding to an authorized early media flow for the selected media.
When SIP digest without TLS is used, the P-CSCF shall discard any SIP messages
received outside of the registration and authentication procedures that do not
map to an existing IP association as defined in subclause 5.2.3.
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT controlled by the P-CSCF, the P-CSCF may need to
modify the SIP contents according to the procedures described in annex F. In
case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided by
a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT not controlled by the P-CSCF, the P-CSCF may need to
modify the SIP contents according to the procedures described in annex K if
both a \"reg-id\" and \"+sip.instance\" header field parameters are present in
the received Contact header field as described in RFC 5626 [92].
### 5.2.2 Registration
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The P-CSCF shall be prepared to receive the unprotected REGISTER requests on
the SIP default port values as specified in RFC 3261 [26]. The P-CSCF shall
also be prepared to receive the unprotected REGISTER requests on the port
advertised to the UE during the P-CSCF discovery procedure.
NOTE 1: The P-CSCF will only accept further registration and subsequent SIP
messages on the same ports for security mechanisms that do not require to use
negotiated ports for exchanging protected messages.
The P-CSCF shall distinguish between security mechanisms through the use of
the Security-Client header field and Authorization header field as follows:
1) if a REGISTER request from the UE contains a Security-Client header field
and the Require and Proxy-Require header fields contain \"sec-agree\", then
for an initial registration, the P-CSCF shall select the sec-mechanism and
mode (as described in Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]) from the corresponding
parameters offered in the Security-Client header field according to its
priorities, as follows:
\- if the P-CSCF selects the sec-mechanism \"ipsec- 3gpp\" then follow the
procedures as described in subclause 5.2.2.2, in addition to the procedures
described in this subclause;
\- if the P-CSCF selects the sec-mechanism \"tls\" then follow the procedures
as described in subclause 5.2.2.4, in addition to the procedures described in
this subclause.
NOTE 2: If the Security-Client header field contains only media plane security
mechanisms then Require and Proxy-Require header fields will not contain
\"sec-agree\". The P-CSCF will then continue as per the procedure in bullet
2), not select a signalling plane security mechanism and then distinguish
signalling plane security based upon the Authorization header field as
described in the steps below.
2) if:
a) a REGISTER request from the UE does not contain a Security-Client header
field;
b) a REGISTER request from the UE contains a Security-Client header field
containing only media plane security mechanisms and the Require and Proxy-
Require header fields do not contain \"sec-agree\"; or
c) the P-CSCF does not select any signalling plane security mechanism from the
Security-Client header field;
then the P-CSCF shall behave as follows, in addition to the procedures
described in the remainder of this subclause:
\- if the REGISTER request does not contain an Authorization header field and
was received over an access network defined in 3GPP specifications then follow
the GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication procedures as described in subclause
5.2.2.6; or
\- if the REGISTER request does not contain an Authorization header field and
was received over a TISPAN NASS then follow the NASS-IMS bundled
authentication procedures described in subclause 5.2.2.5. If the NASS-IMS
bundled authentcation related query from the P-CSCF to the TISPAN NASS fails,
then the P-CSCF shall not continue and shall return an error message to the
UE; or
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field and was not
received over a TISPAN NASS then follow the SIP digest without TLS procedures
as described in subclause 5.2.2.3; or
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field and was
received over a TISPAN NASS, and the P-CSCF supports both SIP digest and NASS-
IMS bundled authentication, then the P-CSCF shall perform the steps required
for NASS-IMS bundled authentication, in subclause 5.2.2.5, as well as the
steps required for SIP digest without TLS, in subclause 5.2.2.3, unless it is
configured to behave differently. If the NASS-IMS bundled authentication
related query from the P-CSCF to the TISPAN NASS fails, then the P-CSCF shall
only continue with the SIP digest related steps.
For subsequent registrations, the P-CSCF shall continue to use the selected
mechanism.
NOTE 3: The steps required for SIP digest and for NASS-IMS bundled
authentcation are not in contradiction. Rather, for NASS-IMS bundled
authentication the P-CSCF needs to perform additional steps, namely an
exchange with the TISPAN NASS and an inclusion of NASS location information in
the REGISTER request, on top of the steps required for SIP digest.
NOTE 4: How the P-CSCF knows the access network type of a specific network
interface is implementation-dependent (e.g. it can know the access network
type from different UE IP address ranges or by using different network
interfaces for different access network types).
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, the P-CSCF shall:
1) insert a Path header field in the request including an entry containing:
\- the SIP URI identifying the P-CSCF;
\- an indication that requests routed in this direction of the path (i.e. from
the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF) are expected to be treated as for the UE-
terminating case. This indication may e.g. be in a parameter in the URI, a
character string in the user part of the URI, or be a port number in the URI;
\- an IMS flow token in the user portion of the P-CSCF\'s SIP URI inserted
into the Path header field, and the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter according to RFC
5626 [92]. The same SIP URI (user portion, hostport parameter and SIP URI
parameters) shall be used for the initial registration, re-registrations,
binding fetchings, and de-registration of the respective registration;
\- the P-CSCF shall use a different IMS flow token for each registration. If
the multiple registration mechanism is used, the P-CSCF shall also use a
different IMS flow token for each registration flow associated with the
registration;
NOTE 5: The form of the IMS flow token is of local significance to the P-CSCF
only and can thus be chosen freely by a P-CSCF implementation.
NOTE 6: By inserting the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter in its SIP URI, the P-CSCF
indicates that it supports multiple registrations as specified in RFC 5626
[92]. The presence of the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter is not an indication that
the P-CSCF supports the keep-alive mechanism defined in RFC 5626 [92].
2) insert a Require header field containing the option-tag \"path\";
3) insert a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header
field parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 1
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The P-CSCF shall set the type 1 \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of
the request. The P-CSCF shall not include the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter;
4) insert a P-Visited-Network-ID header field, with the value of a pre-
provisioned string that identifies the visited network at the home network;
4A) store the announcement of the media plane security mechanisms the UE
supports labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in
subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the Security-Client header field, if any.
Also, if the Security-Client header field contains only media plane security
mechanisms, remove the header field;
NOTE 7: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
4B) if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field, remove the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter, if present;
4C) if the host portion of the sent-by field in the topmost Via header field
contains a FQDN, or if it contains an IP address that differs from the source
address of the IP packet, the P-CSCF shall add a \"received\" Via header field
parameter in accordance with the procedure defined in RFC 3261 [26];
5) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home
network, forward the request to an IBCF in the visited network.
If the selected exit point:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
P-CSCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
the P-CSCF shall select a new exit point and forward the REGISTER request to
that entry point.
NOTE 8: The list of the exit points can be either obtained as specified in RFC
3263 [27A] or provisioned in the P-CSCF.
If the P-CSCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any exit point, the
P-CSCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the user, in
accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26] unless local policy allows
omitting the exit point;
NOTE 9: If the P-CSCF forwards the request to an IBCF in the visited network,
the IBCF in the visited network can determine the entry point of the home
network, as specified in RFC 3263 [27A] or the entry point of the home network
may be provisioned in the IBCF in the visited network.
6) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network and local policy does not
require the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards
the home network, determine the entry point of the home network and forward
the request to that entry point.
If the selected entry point:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
P-CSCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
the P-CSCF shall select a new entry point and forward the REGISTER request to
that entry point.
NOTE 10: The list of the entry points can be either obtained as specified in
RFC 3263 [27A] or provisioned in the P-CSCF.
If the P-CSCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any entry point, the
P-CSCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the user, in
accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26]; and
7) if the P-CSCF is located in the home network, determine the I-CSCF of the
home network and forward the request to that I-CSCF.
If the selected I-CSCF:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
P-CSCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
the P-CSCF shall select a new I-CSCF and forward the original REGISTER
request.
NOTE 11: The list of the I-CSCFs can be either obtained as specified in RFC
3263 [27A] or provisioned in the P-CSCF.
If the P-CSCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any I-CSCF, the P-CSCF
shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the user, in accordance
with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request, the P-CSCF
shall check the value of the registration expiration interval value. When the
registration expiration interval value is different than zero, then the P-CSCF
shall:
1) save the list of service route values in the Service-Route header fields
preserving the order, and bind the list either to the contact address or to
the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used) and the associated security association or TLS
session over which the REGISTER request was received. The P-CSCF shall store
this list during the entire registration period of the respective public user
identity and bind it either to the associated contact address or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used). The P-CSCF shall use this list to validate
the routeing information in the requests originated by the UE using either the
respective contact address or to the registration flow and the associated
contact address, and received over the respective security association or a
TLS session. If the list of Service-Route header fields already exists either
for this contact address or to the registration flow and the associated
contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used), then the
P-CSCF shall replace the already existing list of service route values with
the list of Service-Route header fields received in the 200 (OK) response;
NOTE 12: When the UE registers multiple registration flows and the associated
contact addresses, then the UE and the P-CSCF will have a list of Service-
Route header fields for each registration flow and the associated contact
address and the associated security association or TLS session. When sending a
request using a given registration flow and the associated contact address and
the associated security association or TLS session, the UE will use the
corresponding list of Service-Route header fields, when building a list of
Route header fields.
2) associate the list of service route values with the registered public user
identity and either the associated contact address or to the registration flow
and the associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used) and the associated security association or TLS session;
3) store the public user identities found in the P-Associated-URI header field
value, including any associated display names, and any parameters associated
with either the user or the identities of the user, and associate them to the
registered public user identity, i.e. the registered public user identity and
its associated set of implicitly registered public user identities are bound
to the contact address and security association or TLS session over which the
REGISTER request was received;
4) store the default public user identity, including its associated display
name, if provided, for use with procedures for the P-Asserted-Identity header
field for requests received from the UE over the respective security
association or TLS session. The default public user identity is the first on
the list of URIs present in the P-Associated-URI header field;
NOTE 13: There can be more than one default public user identity stored in the
P-CSCF, as the result of the multiple registrations of public user identities.
NOTE 14: For each contact address and the associated security association or
TLS session the P-CSCF will maintain a list of registered public user
identities and the associated default public user identities, that it will use
when populating the P-Asserted Identity header.
5) store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
6) if a \"term-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter;
NOTE 15: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will contain a type
1 IOI. The type 1 IOI identifies the home network of the registered user.
7) if the P-CSCF included an IMS flow token and the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter
in the Path header field of the REGISTER request, check for presence of the
option-tag \"outbound\" in the Require header field of the a 200 (OK)
response:
\- if the option-tag \"outbound\" is present, it indicates that the UE has
successfully registered its public user identity with a new bidirectional flow
as defined in RFC 5626 [92]. In this case the P-CSCF shall route the
subsequent requests and responses destined for the UE as specified in RFC 5626
[92]; or
\- if the option-tag \"outbound\" is not present, it indicates that the public
user identity has not been registered as specified in RFC 5626 [92]. In this
case the P-CSCF shall route the subsequent requests and responses destined for
the UE as specified in RFC 3261 [26]; and
8) if the P-CSCF detects that the UE is behind a NAT, and the UE\'s Via header
field contains a \"keep\" header field parameter, the P-CSCF shall add a value
to the parameter, to indicate that it is willing to receive keep-alives
associated with the registration from the UE, as defined in RFC 6223 [143].
If the P-CSCF detects that the UE is behind a NAT, and the request was
received over a TCP connection, the P-CSCF shall not close the TCP connection
during the duration of the registration.
NOTE 16: The P-CSCF can conclude whether the UE is behind a NAT or not by
comparing the values in the \"received\" header field parameter and \"rport\"
header field parameter with the corresponding values in the sent-by parameter
in the topmost Via header field. If the values do not match, the P-CSCF can
conclude that the UE is not behind a NAT.
#### 5.2.2.2 IMS AKA as a security mechanism
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, as defined in
subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
1) insert the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter (described in
subclause 7.2A.2) with a value \"yes\" into the Authorization header field in
case the REGISTER request was either received protected with the security
association created during an ongoing authentication procedure and includes an
authentication challenge response (i.e. RES parameter), or it was received on
the security association created during the last successful authentication
procedure, otherwise insert the parameter with the value \"no\";
1A) if the \"reg-id\" header field parameter was included in the Contact
header field of the REGISTER request, insert in the Path header an IMS flow
token and the \"ob\" URI parameter according to RFC 5626 [92]. The IMS flow
token shall identify the flow from the P-CSCF toward the UE, as follows:
a) for UDP, the IMS flow token identifies the unidirectional flow from the
P-CSCF\'s protected client port and the P-CSCF\'s IP address to the UE\'s
protected server port and the UE\'s IP address. This flow is used by the
P-CSCF to send requests and responses to the UE. The P-CSCF shall receive the
requests and responses from the UE on its protected server port; or
b) for TCP, the IMS flow token identifies the excising TCP connection between
the UE and the P-CSCF. This TCP connection was established by the UE, i.e.
from the UE\'s protected server port and the UE\'s IP address to the P-CSCF\'s
protected client port and the P-CSCF\'s IP address. This TCP connection is
used to exchange SIP messages between the UE and the P-CSCF;
2) in case the REGISTER request was received without protection, on the
default port or port advertised to UE for P-CSCF discovery:
a) check the existence of the Security-Client header field. If the Security-
Client header field is present, then remove and store it. If the Security-
Client header field is not present, then the P-CSCF shall return a suitable
4xx response;
b) **set the value of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header
field to the source port of the received REGISTER request;**
**c) insert the \"received\" header field parameter in the Via header field
containing the source IP address that the request came from, as defined in RFC
3581 [56A]; and**
NOTE 1: **As defined in RFC 3581 [56A],** the P-CSCF will insert a
\"received\" header field parameter containing the source IP address that the
request came from, even if it is identical to the value of the \"sent-by\"
component.
NOTE 2: Upon receiving the unprotected REGISTER request the P-CSCF detects if
the UE is behind a NAT.
3) in case the REGISTER request was received protected, then towards the port
that was notified to the UE in the previous response:
a) check the security association which protected the request. If the security
association is a temporary one, then the request is expected to contain a
Security-Verify header field in addition to a Security-Client header field. If
there are no such header fields, then the P-CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx
response. If there are such header fields, then the P-CSCF shall compare the
content of the Security-Verify header field with the content of the Security-
Server header field sent earlier and the content of the Security-Client header
field with the content of the Security-Client header field received in the
challenged REGISTER request. If those do not match, then there is a potential
man-in-the-middle attack. The request should be rejected by sending a suitable
4xx response. If the contents match, the P-CSCF shall remove the Security-
Verify and the Security-Client header field;
b) if the security association the REGISTER request was received on, is an
already established one, then:
\- the P-CSCF shall remove the Security-Verify header field if it is present;
\- a Security-Client header field containing new parameter values is expected.
If the Security-Client header field or any required parameter is missing, then
the P-CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx response; and
\- the P-CSCF shall remove and store the Security-Client header field before
forwarding the request to the S-CSCF;
c) check if the private user identity conveyed in the Authorization header
field of the protected REGISTER request is the same as the private user
identity which was previously challenged or authenticated. If the private user
identities are different, the P-CSCF shall reject the REGISTER request by
returning a 403 (Forbidden) response; and
d) ignore the \"rport\" Via header field parameter, if included.
NOTE 3: Once the IPsec security associations between the UE and the P-CSCF
have been created**, in case of UDP** the P-CSCF sends the responses to a
different UE\'s port then the one from which the request was received from the
UE. For the TCP, the responses are sent on the TCP connection on which the
request was received. Hence, the P-CSCF will ignore the \"rport\" Via header
field parameter in all protected requests and responses, if received.
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request,
the P-CSCF shall:
1) delete any temporary set of security associations established towards the
UE;
2) remove the \"ck\" and \"ik\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameters
contained in the 401 (Unauthorized) response and bind the values to the proper
private user identity and to the temporary set of security associations which
will be setup as a result of this challenge. The P-CSCF shall forward the 401
(Unauthorized) response to the UE if and only if the \"ck\" and \"ik\" header
field parameters have been removed;
3) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF static signalling plane security list and the parameters needed for
this security association setup, as specified in Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203
[19]. The P-CSCF shall support the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as
specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The P-CSCF shall support the IPsec layer
algorithms for integrity and confidentiality protection as defined in 3GPP TS
33.203 [19] and shall announce support for them according to the procedures
defined in RFC 3329 [48];
3A) insert a Security-Server header field to specify the media plane security
mechanisms the P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports, if any, labelled with the
\"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7;
NOTE 4 The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.
4) set up the temporary set of security associations for this registration
with a temporary SIP level lifetime between the UE and the P-CSCF for the user
identified with the private user identity. For further details see 3GPP TS
33.203 [19] and RFC 3329 [48]. The P-CSCF shall set the temporary SIP level
lifetime for the temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-
await-auth timer; and
5) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE using the security
association with which the associated REGISTER request was protected, or
unprotected in case the REGISTER request was received unprotected. If the 401
(Unauthorized) response to the unprotected REGISTER request is sent using UDP,
**the P-CSCF shall send the response to the IP address listed in the
\"received\" Via header field parameter and the port in the \"rport\" Via
header field parameter.** In case of TCP, the P-CSCF shall send the response
over the same TCP connection over which the request was received from the UE.
NOTE 5: The challenge in the 401 (Unauthorized) response sent back by the
S-CSCF to the UE as a response to the REGISTER request is piggybacked by the
P-CSCF to insert the Security-Server header field in it. The S-CSCF
authenticates the UE, while the P-CSCF negotiates and sets up two pairs of
security associations with the UE during the same registration procedure. For
further details see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request as defined
in subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
1) if an existing set of security association is available, set the SIP level
lifetime of the security association to the longest of either the previously
existing security association lifetime, or the lifetime of the just completed
registration plus 30 seconds;
2) if a temporary set of security associations exists, change the temporary
set of security associations to a newly established set of security
associations, i.e. set its SIP level lifetime to the longest of either the
previously existing set of security associations SIP level lifetime, or the
lifetime of the just completed registration plus 30 seconds; and
3) protect the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request within the same
security association to that in which the REGISTER request was protected.
If the P-CSCF receives a SIP message (including REGISTER requests) from the UE
over the newly established set of security associations that have not yet been
taken into use, the P-CSCF shall:
1) reduce the SIP level lifetime of the old set of security associations
towards the same UE to 64*T1 (if currently longer than 64*T1); and
2) use the newly established set of security associations for further messages
sent towards the UE as appropriate (i.e. take the newly established set of
security associations into use).
NOTE 6: If the UE has registered other contact addresses and established
security associations for these contact addresses, it may use them when
sending subsequent SIP messages rather than using the newly established set of
security associations. In this case the P-CSCF will not receive any SIP
message over the newly established set of security associations.
NOTE 7: In this case, the P-CSCF will send requests (that specify the
associated contact address in the Request-URI) towards the UE over the newly
established set of security associations. Responses towards the UE that are
sent via UDP will be sent over the newly established set of security
associations. Responses towards the UE that are sent via TCP will be sent over
the same set of security associations that the related request was received
on.
NOTE 8: When receiving a SIP message (including REGISTER requests) from the UE
over a set of security associations that is different from the newly
established set of security associations, the P-CSCF will not take any action
on any set of security associations.
When the SIP level lifetime of an old set of security associations is about to
expire, i.e. their SIP level lifetime is shorter than 64*T1 and a newly
established set of security associations has not been taken into use, the
P-CSCF shall use the newly established set of security associations for
further messages towards the UE as appropriate (see NOTE 2).
When sending the 200 (OK) response for a REGISTER request that concludes a re-
authentication, the P-CSCF shall:
1) keep the set of security associations that was used for the REGISTER
request that initiated the re-authentication;
2) keep the newly established set of security associations created during this
authentication; and
3) go on using for further requests sent towards the UE the set of security
associations and associated contact address that was used to protect the
REGISTER request that initiated the re-authentication as appropriate (see NOTE
6).
When sending the 200 (OK) respone for a REGISTER request that concludes an
initial authentication of the user registering its public user identity with a
given contact address the associated security association, i.e. the REGISTER
request that initiated the authentication was received unprotected, the P-CSCF
shall:
1) keep the newly established set of security associations created during this
authentication; and
2) use the kept newly established set of security associations and associated
contact address for further messages sent towards the UE as appropriate (see
NOTE 6).
NOTE 9: For each contact address or for each registration flow and the
associated contact address and bound to a set of security associations, the
P-CSCF will maintain two Route header field lists. The first Route header
field list (constructed from the Service-Route header fields, received during
the last registration procedure of either the respective contact address or a
registration flow and the associated contact address) is used only to validate
the routeing information in the initial requests for a dialog and stand alone
transactions originating from the UE using either the respective contact
address or a registration flow and the associated contact address and the
respective security association. This list is valid as long as there is at
least one public user identity registered either with the associated contact
address or a registration flow and the associated contact address. The second
list is the list of Route --header fields (constructed from the Record Route
header fields in the initial INVITE request and associated response) and it is
used during the duration of the call. Once the call is terminated, this list
of Route header fields is discarded.
The P-CSCF shall delete any security association from the IPsec database when
their SIP level lifetime expires.
The handling of the security associations at the P-CSCF is summarized in table
5.2.2-1.
Table 5.2.2-1: Handling of security associations at the P-CSCF

#### 5.2.2.3 SIP digest without TLS as a security mechanism
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, as defined in
subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
\- if the REGISTER request does not map to an existing IP association, and
does not contain a challenge response, not include the \"integrity-protected\"
header field parameter; or
\- if the REGISTER request does not map to an existing IP association, and
does contain a challenge response, include an \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter with the value set to \"ip-assoc-pending\"; or
\- if the REGISTER request does map to an existing IP association, include an
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter with the value set to \"ip-
assoc-yes\"; and
NOTE 1: The value of \"ip-assoc-pending\" for the \"integrity-protected\"
header field parameter or the absence of an \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header field is an indication to the
I-CSCF and S-CSCF that this is an initial REGISTER request.
\- if the P-CSCF adds a \"received\" header field parameter and UDP is being
used, also add an \"rport\" Via header field parameter with the IP source port
of the received REGISTER request.
If the P-CSCF receives a 500 (Server Internal Error) or 504 (Server Time-Out)
response to a REGISTER request, and if the REGISTER request is mapped to an
existing IP association, then the P-CSCF shall delete the IP association.
NOTE 2: The P-CSCF deletes the IP association on receipt of 500 (Server
Internal Error) or 504 (Server Time-Out) so that the next REGISTER request
received from the UE will look like an initial REGISTER request.
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request,
the P-CSCF shall:
1) insert a Security-Server header field to specify the media plane security
mechanisms the P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports, if any, labelled with the
\"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7; and
2) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE unprotected as defined in
clause 4 of RFC 3581 [56A].
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF does not include signalling plane security mechanisms
because the Require and Proxy-Require header fields in the REGISTER request do
not contain \"sec-agree\".
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request as defined
in subclause 5.2.2.1, and the registration expiration interval value is
different than zero, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
a) create an IP association by storing and associating the UE\'s packet source
IP address along with the \"sent-by\" parameter of the Via header field, cf.
RFC 3261 [26], of the REGISTER request with the private user identity and all
the successfully registered public user identities related to that private
user identity. If required by the use case, e.g. RFC 5626 [92] is used, then
the P-CSCF shall also include the UE\'s packet source port of the REGISTER
request as part of the IP association;
b) if the port has been stored as part of the IP associaton, overwrite any
existing IP association which has the same pair of IP address and port, but a
different private user identity. If the port has been stored as part of the IP
associaton then overwrite any existing IP association which has the same IP
address, but a different private user identy; and
c) send the 200 (OK) response to the UE unprotected as defined in clause 4 of
RFC 3581 [56A].
#### 5.2.2.4 SIP digest with TLS as a security mechanism
TLS is optional to implement and is used only in combination with SIP digest
authentication. If the P-CSCF supports TLS, then the P-CSCF shall support TLS
as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. If the P-CSCF supports TLS, the P-CSCF
shall support TLS ciphersuites as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, as defined in
subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
1) in case the REGISTER request was received without protection on the default
port or port advertised to UE for P-CSCF discovery and with the Security-
Client header field indicating \"tls\", then:
a) remove and store the Security-Client header field;
b) do not include the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header; or
c) **set the value of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header
to the source port of the received REGISTER request; and**
**d) insert the \"received\" header field parameter in the Via header
containing the source IP address that the request came from, as defined in RFC
3581 [56A];**
NOTE 1: The absence of an \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in
the Authorization header is an indication to the I-CSCF and S-CSCF that this
is an initial REGISTER request.
NOTE 2: **As defined in RFC 3581 [56A],** the P-CSCF will insert a
\"received\" header field parameter containing the source IP address that the
request came from, even if it is identical to the value of the \"sent-by\"
component.
NOTE 3: Upon receiving the unprotected REGISTER request the P-CSCF detects if
the UE is behind a NAT.
2) if the REGISTER request was received protected with a TLS session, on the
protected server port, created during an ongoing authentication procedure,
where the Session ID for the TLS session is not yet bound to a private user
identity, and includes an authentication challenge response (i.e. response
parameter), then:
a) check if the private user identity conveyed in the Authorization header of
the protected REGISTER request is the same as the private user identity which
was previously challenged. If the private user identities are different, the
P-CSCF shall reject the REGISTER request by returning a 403 (Forbidden)
response;
b) check the existence of the Security-Verify header field and the Security-
Client header field. If there are no such headers, then the P CSCF shall
return a suitable 4xx response. If there are such headers, then the Pâ€‘CSCF
shall compare the content of the Security-Verify header field with the content
of the Security-Server header field sent earlier and the content of the
Security-Client header field with the content of the Security-Client header
field received in the challenged REGISTER request. If those do not match, then
there is a potential man-in-the-middle attack. The P-CSCF should reject the
request by sending a suitable 4xx response. If the contents match, the P-CSCF
shall remove the Security-Verify and the Security-Client header fields;
c) include an \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter with the value
set to \"tls-pending\"; and
d) if the hostport parameter in the Contact header field is in the form of a
FQDN, the P-CSCF shall ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g. by
reverse DNS lookup) to the IP address bound to the TLS session; or
3) if the REGISTER request was received on an existing TLS session created
during a previous authentication procedure and the private user identity
contained in the REGISTER request matches the private user identity previously
associated with the Session ID for this TLS session, then:
a) check if the private user identity conveyed in the Authorization header of
the protected REGISTER request is the same as the private user identity which
was previously authenticated. If the private user identities are different,
the P-CSCF shall reject the REGISTER request by returning a 403 (Forbidden)
response;
b) check the existence of the Security-Verify header field and Security-Client
header field. If there are no such header fields, then the P-CSCF shall return
a suitable 4xx response. If there are such headers, then the P-CSCF shall
compare the content of the Security-Verify header field with the content of
the Security-Server header field sent earlier and the content of the Security-
Client header field with the content of the Security-Client header field
received in the challenged REGISTER request. If those do not match, then there
is a potential man-in-the-middle attack. The P-CSCF should reject the request
by sending a suitable 4xx response;
c) the P-CSCF shall remove and store the Security-Client header field and
remove the Security-Verify header field before forwarding the request to the
S-CSCF; and
d) include an \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter with the value
set to \"tls-yes\".
If the P-CSCF require security agreement, and the Security-Client header field
is not present, then the P-CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx response.
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request,
the P-CSCF shall:
1) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF selected signalling plane mechanism name, as specified in Annex H of
3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall support and indicate the \"tls\"
security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The P-CSCF shall support
the TLS ciphersuites as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and shall announce
support for them according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329 [48]; and
1A) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF static media plane security list, if any, labelled with the
\"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7;
2) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE using the TLS session with
which the associated REGISTER request was protected, or unprotected in case
the REGISTER request was received unprotected. If the 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the unprotected REGISTER request is sent using UDP, **the P-CSCF
shall send the response to the IP address listed in the \"received\" header
field parameter and the port in the \"rport\" header field parameter.** In
case of TCP, the P-CSCF shall send the response over the same TCP connection
over which the request was received from the UE.
NOTE 4: The challenge in the 401 (Unauthorized) response sent back by the
S-CSCF to the UE as a response to the REGISTER request is piggybacked by the
P-CSCF to insert the Security-Server header field in it.
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request as defined
in subclause 5.2.2.1, and the registration expiration interval value is
different than zero, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
\- create an association by storing and associating the UEs IP address and
port of the TLS connection with the TLS Session ID, the private user identity
and all the successfully registered public user identities related to that
private user identity; and
\- protect the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request within the same TLS
session to that in which the request was protected.
#### 5.2.2.5 NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a security mechanism
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, as defined in
subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
1) perform the NASS-IMS bundled authentication related query from the P-CSCF
to the TISPAN NASS;
2) if the query in step 1) is successful, insert a P-Access-Network-Info
header field as described in subclause 5.2.1 step 4); and
3) if the P-CSCF adds a \"received\" header field parameter and UDP is being
used, the P-CSCF shall also add an \"rport\" Via header field parameter with
the IP source port of the received REGISTER request.
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request from the
UE, as defined in subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
1) store an association between the IP source address and port of the initial
REGISTER request and the public user identities found in the P-Associated-URI
header field value and associate them to the public user identity under
registration;
2) store an association between the IP source address and port of the initial
REGISTER request the default public user identity for use with procedures for
the P-Asserted-Identity header field. The default public user identity is the
first on the list of URIs present in the P-Associated-URI header field; and
3) insert a Security-Server header field to specify the media plane security
mechanisms the P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports, if any, labelled with the
\"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7.
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF does not include signalling plane security mechanisms
because the Require and Proxy-Require header fields in the REGISTER request do
not contain \"sec-agree\".
#### 5.2.2.6 GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication as a security mechanism
When the P-CSCF receives a SIP request from a GPRS-IMS-Bundled UE, the P-CSCF
checks the IP address in the \"sent-by\" parameter of the Via header field
provided by the UE as specified in RFC 3261 [6]. If the \"sent-by\" parameter
contains a domain name, or if it contains an IP address that differs from the
packet source IP address, the P-CSCF adds a \"received\" header field
parameter to that Via header field value. This parameter contains the source
IP address from which the packet was received.
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request from the
UE, as defined in subclause 5.2.2.1, the P-CSCF shall additionally:
1) store an association between the IP source address and port of the initial
REGISTER request and the public user identities found in the P-Associated-URI
header field value and associate them to the public user identity under
registration;
2) store an association between the IP source address and port of the initial
REGISTER request the default public user identity for use with procedures for
the P-Asserted-Identity header field. The default public user identity is the
first on the list of URIs present in the P-Associated-URI header field;
3) if the P-CSCF adds a \"received\" header field parameter and UDP is being
used, the P-CSCF shall also add an \"rport\" Via header field parameter with
the IP source port of the received REGISTER request; and
4) insert a Security-Server header field to specify the media plane security
mechanisms the P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports, if any, labelled with the
\"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7.
NOTE: The P-CSCF does not include signalling plane security mechanisms because
the Require and Proxy-Require header fields in the REGISTER request do not
contain \"sec-agree\".
### 5.2.3 Subscription to the user\'s registration-state event package
Upon receipt of a 200 (OK) response to the first initial REGISTER request
(i.e. this was the first initial REGISTER request that the P-CSCF received
from the user identified with its private user identity), the P-CSCF shall:
1) generate a SUBSCRIBE request in accordance with RFC 3680 [43], with the
following elements:
\- a Request-URI set to the resource to which the P-CSCF wants to be
subscribed to, i.e. to a SIP URI that contains the default public user
identity of the user;
\- a From header field set to the P-CSCF\'s SIP URI;
\- a To header field, set to a SIP URI that contains the default public user
identity of the user;
\- an Event header field set to the \"reg\" event package;
\- an Expires header field set to a value higher then the registration
expiration interval value indicated in the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER
request;
\- a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to the SIP URI of the P-CSCF,which
was inserted into the Path header field during the registration of the user to
whose registration state the P-CSCF subscribes to; and
\- a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17];
2) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home
network, then the P-CSCF shall forward the request to an IBCF in the visited
network;
3) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network and local policy does not
require the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards
the home network, determine the entry point of the home network (e.g., by
using DNS services) and send the SUBSCRIBE request to that entry point,
according to the procedures of RFC 3261 [26]; and
4) if the P-CSCF is located in the home network, then the P-CSCF shall forward
the request to an I-CSCF in the home network.
NOTE: The subscription to reg event package is done once per private user
identity.
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request, the P-CSCF shall
store the information for the so established dialog and the expiration time as
indicated in the Expires header field of the received response.
If continued subscription is required the P-CSCF shall automatically refresh
the subscription by the reg event package 600 seconds before the expiration
time for a previously registered public user identity, either 600 seconds
before the expiration time if the initial subscription was for greater than
1200 seconds, or when half of the time has expired if the initial subscription
was for 1200 seconds or less. If a SUBSCRIBE request to refresh a subscription
fails with a non-481 response, the P-CSCF shall still consider the original
subscription valid for the duration of the most recently known \"Expires\"
value according to RFC 3265 [28]. Otherwise, the P-CSCF shall consider the
subscription invalid and start a new initial subscription according to RFC
3265 [28].
## 5.2.3A Void
#### 5.2.3B SUBSCRIBE request
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with the Subscription-State header field set
to \"terminated\", once the NOTIFY transaction is terminated, the P-CSCF can
remove all the stored information related to the associated subscription.
### 5.2.4 Registration of multiple public user identities
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request the P-CSCF shall
maintain the generated dialog (identified by the values of the Call-ID header
field, and the values of tags in To and From header fields).
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package of the user, the P-CSCF shall identify
the public user identity as follows:
1) if no \ subelement is included in the \
element, the public user identity is taken from the \'aor\' attribute of the
registration element; or
2) if a \ sub element is included in the \
element, the wildcarded public user identity is taken from the
\ sub element. The wildcardcarded public user identity is
treated as a public user identity in the procedures of this subclause.
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package of the user, the P-CSCF shall perform
the following actions:
1) for each public user identity whose state attribute in the \
element is set to \"active\", i.e. registered; and
\- the state attribute within the \ sub-element is set to \"active\";
and
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the contact address of the user\'s UE; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"registered\" or \"created\";
> the P-CSCF shall:
\- bind the indicated public user identity as registered to the contact
address of the respective user, including any associated display names, and
any parameters associated with either the user or the identities of the user;
and
\- add the public user identity to the list of the public user identities that
are registered for the user saved against the contact address;
2) for each public user identity whose state attribute in the \
element is set to \"active\", i.e. registered: and
\- the state attribute within the \ sub-element is set to
\"terminated\";
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the contact address of the user\'s UE; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"deactivated\", \"expired\", \"probation\", \"unregistered\", or
\"rejected\";
the P-CSCF shall consider the binding between the indicated public user
identity and the contact address and its related information as deregistered
for this user, and shall release all stored information associated with the
deregistered contact address and related information associated with this
contact address; and
3) for each public user identity whose state attribute in the \
element is set to \"terminated\", i.e. deregistered; and for each \
sub-element, if
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside each \ sub-element is
set to the respective contact address of the user\'s UE; and
\- the event attribute of each \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"deactivated\", \"expired\", \"probation\", \"unregistered\", or
\"rejected\";
the P-CSCF shall consider the indicated public user identity and all its
contact addresses as deregistered for this UE, and shall release all stored
information for these public user identity bound to the respective user and
remove the public user identity from the list of the public user identities
that are registered for the user.
If the P-CSCF is informed that all contact addresses that are registered with
this P-CSCF and belonging to the user using its private user identity have
been deregistered, i.e. the state attribute within each \ sub-element
is set to \"terminated\", the P-CSCF shall either unsubscribe to the reg event
package or let the subscription expire.
NOTE 1: Since there may be other active registrations of the user via other
P-CSCFs, the S-CSCF will not terminate the by sending a NOTIFY request that
includes the Subscription-State header set to \"terminated\".
If all public user identities, that were registered by the user using its
private user identity, have been deregistered, the P-CSCF, will receive from
the S-CSCF a NOTIFY request that may include the Subscription-State header
field set to \"terminated\", as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2. If the
Subscription-State header field was not set to \"terminated\", the P-CSCF may
either unsubscribe to the reg event package of the user or let the
subscription expire.
NOTE 2: Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with the Subscription-State header
field set to \"terminated\", the P-CSCF considers the subscription to the reg
event package terminated (i.e. as if the P-CSCF had sent a SUBSCRIBE request
with an Expires header field containing a value of zero).
NOTE 3: There may be public user identities which are implicitly registered
within the registrar (S-CSCF) of the user upon registration of one public user
identity. The procedures in this subclause provide a mechanism to inform the
P-CSCF about these implicitly registered public user identities.
### 5.2.5 Deregistration
#### 5.2.5.1 User-initiated deregistration
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request (sent
according to subclause 5.2.2) sent by this UE, then the P-CSCF shall check
each Contact header field included in the response. If there is a Contact
header field that contains the contact address registered via this P-CSCF via
the respective security associations or TLS sessions, and the value of the
registration expiration interval value equals zero, then the P-CSCF shall:
1) if the \"reg-id\" header field parameter is not included in the Contact
header field, remove the binding between the public user identity found in the
To header field (together with the implicitly registered public user
identities) and the contact address indicated in the Contact header field,
from the registered public user identities list belonging to this UE and all
related stored information;
1A) if the \"reg-id\" header field parameter is included in the Contact header
field, remove the binding between the public user identity found in the To
header field (together with the implicitly registered public user identities)
and from the registered public user identities list belonging to theis IMS
flow identified by the \"reg-id\" header field parameter all its related
stored information belonging to this UE;
2) if the \"reg-id\" header field parameter is not included in the Contact
header field, check if the UE has left any other registered public user
identity. When all of the public user identities that were registered by this
UE are deregistered, the P-CSCF shall delete any security associations, TLS
sessions or IP associations towards the UE, after the server transaction (as
defined in RFC 3261 [26]) pertaining to this deregistration terminates;and
2A) if multiple registrations is used, check if the UE has left any other
registered public user identity that is bound to this flow. When all of the
public user identities that were registered and are bound to this flow are
deregistered, the P-CSCF shall delete any security associations or TLS
sessions associated with this flow, after the server transaction (as defined
in RFC 3261 [26]) pertaining to this deregistration terminates.
NOTE 1: Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with all \ element(s)
having their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user
identities are deregistered) and the Subscription-State header field set to
\"terminated\", the P-CSCF considers the subscription to the reg event package
terminated (i.e. as if the P-CSCF had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires
header field containing a value of zero).
NOTE 2: There is no requirement to distinguish a REGISTER request relating to
a registration from that relating to a deregistration. For administration
reasons the P-CSCF may distinguish such requests, however this has no impact
on the SIP procedures.
NOTE 3: When the P-CSCF has sent the 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER
request of the only public user identity currently registered with its
associated set of implicitly registered public user identities using the
respective security association or TLS session (i.e. no other public user
identity belonging to the user is registered with this contact address the
associated security association or TLS session), the P-CSCF removes the
security association or TLS session established between the P-CSCF and the UE.
Therefore further SIP signalling sent over this security association or TLS
session (e.g. the NOTIFY request containing the deregistration event) will not
reach the UE.
#### 5.2.5.2 Network-initiated deregistration
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package of the UE, as described in subclause
5.2.3, including one or more \ element(s) which were registered
by the UE with either:
\- the state attribute within the \ element set to
\"terminated\"; or
\- the state attribute within the \ element set to \"active\"
and the state attribute within the \ sub-element belonging to this UE
and registered via this P-CSCF set to \"terminated\", and the event attribute
within the \ sub-element belonging to this UE set either to
\"unregistered\", or \"rejected\" or \"deactivated\";
the P-CSCF shall remove all stored information for these public user
identities for this UE and remove these public user identities from the list
of the public user identities that are registered for the user.
NOTE 1: If all public user identities have been removed from the list of the
public user identities registered via this P-CSCF, and the NOTIFY request
indicates that the UE is still registered (e.g. via another P-CSCF), the
P-CSCF can unsubscribe from the reg event package of the UE.
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with all \ element(s) having
their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user identities
are deregistered) and the Subscription-State header field set to
\"terminated\" or when all public user identities of the UE have been
deregistered, the P-CSCF shall shorten any security associations or TLS
sessions towards the UE.
NOTE 2: The security association between the P-CSCF and the UE is shortened to
a value that will allow the NOTIFY request containing the deregistration event
to reach the UE.
NOTE 3: When the P-CSCF receives the NOTIFY request with Subscription-State
header field containing the value of \"terminated\", the P-CSCF considers the
subscription to the reg event package terminated (i.e. as if the P-CSCF had
sent a SUBSCRIBE request to the S-CSCF with an Expires header field containing
a value of zero).
### 5.2.6 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method
#### 5.2.6.1 Introduction
The procedures of subclause 5.2.6 and its subclauses are general to all
requests and responses, except those for the REGISTER method.
#### 5.2.6.2 Determination of UE-originated or UE-terminated case
Upon receipt of an initial request or a target refresh request or a stand-
alone transaction, the P-CSCF shall:
\- perform the procedures for the UE-terminating case as described in
subclause 5.2.6.4 if the request makes use of the information for UE-
terminating calls, which was added to the Path header field entry of the
P-CSCF during registration (see subclause 5.2.2), e.g. the message is received
at a certain port or the topmost Route header field contains a specific user
part or parameter;
\- perform the procedures for the UE-originating case as described in
subclause 5.2.6.3 if this information is not used by the request.
#### 5.2.6.3 Requests initiated by the UE
##### 5.2.6.3.1 General for all requests
When the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction from a UE that is not considered as priviledged sender,
and:
\- the request does not include any P-Preferred-Identity header field or none
of the P-Preferred-Identity header fields included in the request matches any
of the registered public user identities or any of the registered wildcarded
public user identities, then the P-CSCF shall identify the originator and the
served user of the request by the default public user identity;
\- the request includes one or two P-Preferred-Identity header field(s) each
of which matches one of the registered public user identity or a registered
wildcarded public user identity, the P-CSCF shall identify the originator and
the served user of the request by the public user identity from the first such
P-Preferred-Identity header field; and
\- the request includes two P-Preferred-Identity header fields, each of which
matches a registered public user identity or a registered wildcarded public
user identity, the P-CSCF shall identify the alternative identity of the
originator of the request by the public user identity from the second such
P-Preferred-Identity header field.
NOTE: When two identities are provided in the P-Preferred-Identity header
fields, it is assumed that one is an alias of the other but P-CSCF does not
have the information to verify this.
When the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction from a UE that is considered as priviledged sender, and
the request:
a) does not include any P-Preferred-Identity header field, then the Pâ€‘CSCF
shall identify the served user of the request by the default public user
identity;
b) includes a P-Preferred-Identity header field that does not match one of the
registered public user identities or wildcarded public user identities, then
the Pâ€‘CSCF shall identify the served user of the request by the default public
user identity; or
c) includes a P-Preferred-Identity header field that matches one of the
registered public user identities or wildcarded public user identities, then
the Pâ€‘CSCF shall identify the served user of the request by the public user
identity from the P-Preferred-Identity header field.
In addition, if the request from a UE that is considered as priviledged
sender:
1) includes one or two P-Asserted-Identity header field(s) then the Pâ€‘CSCF
shall identify the originator of that request by the public user identity from
the first P-Asserted-Identity header field; or
2) does not include a P-Asserted-Identity header field then the Pâ€‘CSCF shall
identify the originator of that request by the same identity that has been
determined for the served user according to steps a), b), and c) above.
NOTE 1: If no security association was set-up during registration, the P-CSCF
identifies the originator and served user of the request by using the IP
association information stored during the registration for which it holds the
list of registered public user identities.
NOTE 2: The contents of the From header field do not form any part of this
decision process.
NOTE 3: The display-name portion of the P-Preferred-Identity header field and
the registered public user identities is not included in the comparison to
determine a match.
NOTE 4: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE is considered as priviledged sender
based on parameters stored during registration (see subclause 5.2.2.1), if
available. Otherwise the P-CSCF can make the determination based on local
configuration.
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog or a
request for a standalone transaction, if the host portion of the sent-by field
in the topmost Via header field contains a FQDN, or if it contains an IP
address that differs from the source address of the IP packet, the P-CSCF
shall add a \"received\" header field parameter in accordance with the
procedure defined in RFC 3261 [26].
If the P-CSCF adds a \"received\" header field parameter and UDP is being
used, the P-CSCF shall also add an \"rport\" header field parameter. If IMS
AKA is used, the parameter value shall contain the UEs protected server port.
Otherwise the parameter value shall contain the IP source of the request.
##### 5.2.6.3.2 Void
##### 5.2.6.3.2A Abnormal cases
When the P-CSCF is unable to forward the request to the next hop by the Route
header fields, as determined by one of the following:
\- there is no response to the service request and its retransmissions by the
P-CSCF; or
\- by unspecified means available to the P-CSCF;
and:
\- the P-CSCF supports restoration procedures;
then the P-CSCF:
1) shall reject the request by returning a 504 (Server Time-out) response to
the UE;
2) shall assume that the UE supports version 1 of the XML Schema for the 3GPP
IM CN subsystem XML body if support for the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as
described in subclause 7.6 in the Accept header field is not indicated; and
3) shall include in the 504 (Server Time-out) response:
\- a Content-Type header field with the value set to associated MIME type of
the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6.1;
\- a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to the value of the SIP URI of the
P-CSCF included in the Path header field during the registration of the user
whose UE sent the request causing this response (see subclause 5.2.2.1); and
\- a 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body containing:
a) an \ element with the \"version\" attribute set to \"1\" and with
an \ child element, set to the parameters of the
alternative service:
i) a \ child element, set to \"restoration\" (see table 7.7AA) to
indicate that restoration procedures are supported;
ii) a \ child element, set to an operator configurable reason; and
iii) an \ child element, set to \"initial-registration\" (see table
7.7AB).
NOTE: These procedures do not prevent the usage of unspecified reliability or
recovery techniques above and beyond those specified in this subclause.
##### 5.2.6.3.3 Initial request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog, and a
service route value list exists for the served user of the request, the P-CSCF
shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route header fields;
2) verify that the resulting list of Route header fields matches the list of
URIs received in the Service-Route header field (during the last successful
registration or re-registration). This verification is done on a per URI
basis, not as a whole string. If the verification fails, then the P-CSCFshall
either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P-CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 2 onwards; or
b) replace the preloaded Route header field value in the request with the
value of the Service-Route header field received during the last 200 (OK)
response for the last successful registration or reregistration;
3) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home
network, select an IBCF in the visited network and add the URI of the selected
IBCF to the topmost Route header field;
NOTE 1: It is implementation dependent as to how the P-CSCF obtains the
address of the IBCF exit point.
4) add its own address to the Via header field. The P-CSCF Via header field
entry is built in a format that contains the port number of the P-CSCF in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26], and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address, or
b) the P-CSCF IP address;
5) when adding its own SIP URI to the Record-Route header field, build the
P-CSCF SIP URI in a format that contains the port number of the P-CSCF where
it awaits subsequent requests from the called party, and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address.
If the Contact header field in the request contains an \"ob\" SIP URI
parameter, the P-CSCF shall add a flow token and the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter
to its SIP URI;
NOTE 2: The inclusion of these values in the Record-Route header field will
ensure that all subsequent mid dialog requests destined for the UE are sent
over the same IMS flow over which the initial dialog-forming request was
received.
5A) if a P-Private-Network-Indication header field is included in the request,
check whether the information saved during registration or from configuration
allows the receipt of private network traffic from this source. If private
network traffic is allowed, the P-CSCF shall check whether the received domain
name in any included P-Private-Network-Indication header field in the request
is the same as the domain name associated with that saved information. If
private network traffic is not allowed, or the received domain name does not
match, then the P-CSCF shall remove the P-Private-Network-Indication header
field;
5B) if the served user of the request is understood from information saved
during registration or from configuration to always send and receive private
network traffic from this source, insert a P-Private-Network-Indication header
field containing the domain name associated with that saved information;
5C) if the request is originated from a UE which the P-CSCF considers as
priviledged sender, keep the P-Asserted-Identity header field unchnanged if
one was received, or include the originator of the request in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field if no P-Asserted-Identity header field was received. In
addition remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field, include the served user
of the request in the P-Served-User header field as specified in RFC 5502
[133] and skip step 6) below;
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE is considered as priviledged
senderbased on parameters stored during registration (see subclause 5.2.2.1),
if available. Otherwise the P-CSCF can make the determination based on local
configuration.
6) remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field or P-Asserted-Identity header
field, if present, and insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field with the
value identifying the originator of the request and the value of the
alternative identity of the originator of the request, if identified (see
subclause 5.2.6.3.1), including the display name if previously stored during
registration representing the served user of the request;
6A) if the identity of the served user of the request was taken from
P-Preferred-Identity header field by matching a registered wildcarded public
user identity, and the identity of the served user is not a distinct identity
within the range of the wildcarded public user identity, include the
wildcarded public user identity value in the P-Profile-Key header field as
defined in RFC 5002 [97];
NOTE 4: The matching of distinct public user identities takes precedence over
the matching of wildcarded public user identities.
7) add a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17]; and
8) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, CSeq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the P-CSCF is able
to release the session if needed. If the Contact header field in the INVITE
request contains a GRUU but itdoes not include an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter as
defined in RFC 5626 [92], the P-CSCF shall save the GRUU received in the
Contact header field of the request and associate that GRUU with the UE IP
address and the UE port such that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if
needed. The UE port used for the association is determined as follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the UE protected server port for the security association on which the request
was received; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled Authentication is being used as a security mechanism, the UE
unprotected port on which the request was received;
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 5: According to RFC 5626 [92], an approach such as having the Edge Proxy
adds a Record-Route header field with a flow token is one way to ensure that
mid-dialog requests are routed over the correct flow.
##### 5.2.6.3.4 Responses to an initial request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above request, the
P-CSCF shall:
1) store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
2) store the list of Record-Route header fields from the received response;
3) store the dialog ID and associate it with the private user identity and
public user identity involved in the session;
4) if a security association or TLS session exists, in the response rewrite
its own Record Route entry to its own SIP URI that contains the protected
server port number of the security association or TLS session established from
the UE to the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
NOTE: The P-CSCF associates two ports, a protected client port and a protected
server port, with each pair of security associations. For details on the
selection of the protected port values see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
5) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is used, in the response rewrite its own Record-Route
entry to its own SIP URI that contains an unprotected server port number where
the P-CSCF expects subsequent requests from the UE; and
6) if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, save the Contact, From,
To and Record-Route header field values received in the response such that the
P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the response to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.5 Target refresh request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE a target refresh request for a dialog,
the P-CSCF shall:
1) verify if the request relates to a dialog in which the originator of the
request is involved:
a) if the request does not relates to an existing dialog in which the
originator is involved, then the P-CSCF shall answer the request by sending a
403 (Forbidden) response back to the originator. The P-CSCF will not forward
the request. No other actions are required; or
b) if the request relates to an existing dialog in which the originator is
involved, then the P-CSCF shall continue with the following steps;
1A) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route header fields;
2) verify that the resulting list of Route header fields matches the list of
Record-Route header fields constructed by inverting the order of the stored
list of Record-Route header fields and removing its Record-Route header field
value from the list. This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a
whole string. If the verification fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P-CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 3 onwards; or
b) replace the Route header field value in the request with the list of
Record-Route header fields constructed by inverting the order of the stored
list of Record-Route header fields and removing its Record-Route header value
from the list;
3) add its own address to the Via header field. The P-CSCF Via header field
entry is built in a format that contains the port number of the P-CSCF where
it awaits the responses to come, and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address, or
b) the P-CSCF IP address; and
4) void
5) for INVITE dialogs (i.e. dialogs initiated by an INVITE request), replace
the saved Contact and Cseq header field values received in the request such
that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed. If the Contact
header field in the INVITE request contains a GRUU but the Contact header
field does not include an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter as defined in RFC 5626
[92], the P-CSCF shall save the GRUU received in the Contact header field of
the request and associate that GRUU with the UE IP address and the UE port
such that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed. The UE port
used for the association is determined as follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the UE protected server port for the security association on which the request
was received; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled Authentication is being used as a security mechanism, the UE
unprotected port on which the request was received;
NOTE: The replaced Contact header field value is valid only if a 1xx or 2xx
response will be received for the request. In other cases the old value is
still valid.
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.6 Responses to a target refresh request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to the above request, the
P-CSCF shall:
1) if a security association or TLS session exists, [ ]{.underline} rewrite
the the address and port number of its own Record Route entry to the same
value as for the response to the initial request for the dialog; and
2) replace the saved Contact header field value received in the response such
that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the response to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.7 Request for a standalone transaction
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE the request for a standalone transaction,
and a service route value list exists for the served user of the request, the
P-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route header fields;
2) verify that the resulting list of Route header fields matches the list of
URIs received in the Service-Route header field (during the last successful
registration or re-registration). This verification is done on a per URI
basis, not as a whole string. If the verification fails, then the P-CSCF shall
either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P-CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 3 onwards; or
b) replace the preloaded Route header field value in the request with the one
received during the last registration in the Service-Route header field of the
200 (OK) response;
3) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home
network, select an IBCF in the visited network and add the URI of the selected
IBCF to the topmost Route header field;
NOTE 1: It is implementation dependent as to how the P-CSCF obtains the
address of the IBCF exit point.
3A) if the request is originated from a UE which the P-CSCF considers as
priviledged sender, keep the P-Asserted-Identity header field unchnanged if
one was received, or include the originator of the request in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field if no P-Asserted-Identity header field was received. In
addition remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field, include the served user
of the request in the P-Served-User header field as specified in RFC 5502
[133] and skip step 4) below;
NOTE 2: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE is considered as priviledged sender
based on parameters stored during registration (see subclause 5.2.2.1), if
available. Otherwise the P-CSCF can make the determination based on local
configuration.
4) remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field or P-Asserted-Identity header
field, if present, and insert P-Asserted-Identity header fields the value
identifying the served user of the request and the value of the alternative
identity of the originator of the request, if identified (see subclause
5.2.6.3.1), including the display name if previously stored during
registration, representing the served user of the request;
4A) if the identity of the served user of the request was taken from
P-Preferred-Identity header field by matching a registered wildcarded public
user identity, and the identity of the served user is not a distinct identity
within the range of the wildcarded public user identity, include the
wildcarded public user identity value in the P-Profile-Key header field as
defined in RFC 5002 [97];
NOTE 3: The matching of distinct public user identities takes precedence over
the matching of wildcarded public user identities.
4B) if a P-Private-Network-Indication header field is included in the request,
check whether the information saved during registration or from configuration
allows the receipt of private network traffic from this source. If private
network traffic is allowed, the P-CSCF shall check whether the received domain
name in any included P-Private-Network-Indication header field in the request
is the same as the domain name associated with that saved information. If
private network traffic is not allowed, or the received domain name does not
match, then the P-CSCF shall remove the P-Private-Network-Indication header
field;
4C) if the served user of the request is understood from information saved
during registration or from configuration to always send and receive private
network traffic from this source, insert a P-Private-Network-Indication header
field containing the domain name associated with that saved information;
5) add a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17];
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.8 Responses to a request for a standalone transaction
When the P-CSCF receives any response to the above request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
before forwarding the response to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.9 Subsequent request other than a target refresh request
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE subsequent requests other than a target
refresh request (including requests relating to an existing dialog where the
method is unknown), the P-CSCF shall:
1) verify if the request relates to a dialog in which the originator of the
request is involved:
a) if the request does not relates to an existing dialog in which the
originator is involved, then the P-CSCF shall answer the request by sending a
403 (Forbidden) response back to the originator. The P-CSCF will not forward
the request. No other actions are required; or
b) if the request relates to an existing dialog in which the originator is
involved, then the P-CSCF shall continue with the following steps;
1A) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route header fields;
2) verify that the resulting list of Route header fields matches the list of
Record-Route header fields constructed by inverting the order of the stored
list of Record-Route header fields and removing its Record-Route header field
from the list. This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a whole
string. If the verification fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P-CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 3 onwards; or
b) replace the Route header field value in the request with the list of
Record-Route header fields constructed by inverting the order of the stored
list of Record-Route header fields and removing its Record-Route header field
from the list;
3) for dialogs that are not INVITE dialogs, add a P-Charging-Vector header
field with the \"icid-value\" header field parameter populated as specified in
3GPP TS 32.260 [17]; and
4) for INVITE dialogs, replace the saved Cseq header field value received in
the request such that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the request (based on the topmost Route header field), in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.10 Responses to a subsequent request other than a target refresh
request
Void
##### 5.2.6.3.11 Request for an unknown method that does not relate to an
existing dialog
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE the request for an unknown method (that
does not relate to an existing dialog), and a service route value list exists
for the served user of the request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) verify that the list of URIs received in the Service-Route header field
(during the last successful registration or re-registration) is included,
preserving the same order, as a subset of the preloaded Route header fields in
the received request. This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a
whole string. If the verification fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P-CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 2 onwards; or
b) replace the Route header field value in the request with the one received
during the last registration in the Service-Route header field of the 200 (OK)
response;
2) if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home
network, then the P-CSCF shall select an IBCF in the visited network and add
the URI of the selected IBCF to the topmost Route header field;
NOTE 1: It is implementation dependent as to how the P-CSCF obtains the
address of the IBCF exit point.
2A) if the request is originated from a UE which the P-CSCF considers as
priviledged sender, keep the P-Asserted-Identity header field unchnanged if
one was received, or include the originator of the request in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field if no P-Asserted-Identity header field was received. In
addition remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field, include the served user
of the request in the P-Served-User header field as specified in RFC 5502
[133] and skip step 3) below;
NOTE 2: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE is considered priviledged sender
based on parameters stored during registration (see subclause 5.2.2.1), if
available. Otherwise the P-CSCF can make the determination based on local
configuration.
3) remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field or P-Asserted-Identity header
field, if present, and insert a P-Asserted-Identity header fields the value
identifying the originator of the request and the value of the alternative
identity of the originator of the request, if identified (see subclause
5.2.6.3.1), including the display name if previously stored during
registration, representing the served user of the request; and
3A) if the identity of the served user of the request was taken from
P-Preferred-Identity header field by matching a registered wildcarded public
user identity, and the identity of the served user is not a distinct identity
within the range of the wildcarded public user identity, include the
wildcarded public user identity value in the P-Profile-Key header field as
defined in RFC 5002 [97];
NOTE 3: The matching of distinct public user identities takes precedence over
the matching of wildcarded public user identities.
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
##### 5.2.6.3.12 Responses to a request for an unknown method that does not
relate to an existing dialog
Void.
#### 5.2.6.4 Requests terminated by the UE
##### 5.2.6.4.1 Void
##### 5.2.6.4.2 General for all responses
The P-CSCF shall forward the response to the UE using the mechanisms described
in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3581 [56A], i.e. the P-CSCF shall send the response
to the IP address indicated in the \"received\" header field parameter and, in
case UDP is used, to the port indicated in the \"rport\" header field
parameter (if present) of the Via header field associated with the UE. In case
TCP is used, the P-CSCF shall use the TCP connection on which the REGISTER
request was received for sending the response back to the UE.
##### 5.2.6.4.3 Initial request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, an initial request for a
dialog, prior to forwarding the request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) if an indication has been received from the PCRF that the signalling bearer
to the UE is lost, and has not recovered, reject the request by sending 503
(Service Unavailable) response);
NOTE 1: The signalling bearer can be considered as recovered by the P-CSCF
when the registration timer expires in P-CSCF and the user is de-registered
from the IM CN subsystem, a new REGISTER request from the UE is received
providing an indication to the P-CSCF that the signalling bearer to that user
has become available or a P-CSCF implementation dependent function which
discovers that the signalling bearer is available to the UE.
NOTE 2: The Retry-After header field value is set based on operator policy.
2) convert the list of Record-Route header field values into a list of Route
header field values and save this list of Route header fields;
3) if the request is an INVITE request, save a copy of the Contact, CSeq and
Record-Route header field values received in the request such that the P-CSCF
is able to release the session if needed;
4) if a security association or TLS session exists, when adding its own SIP
URI to the top of the list of Record-Route header fields and save the list,
build the P-CSCF SIP URI in a format that contains the protected server port
number of the security association or TLS session established from the UE to
the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
5) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is used, when adding its own SIP URI to the top of the
list of Record-Route header fields and saving the list, build the P-CSCF URI
in a format that contains an unprotected server port number where the P-CSCF
expects subsequent requests from the UE;
6) if a security association or TLS session exists, when adding its own
address to the top of the received list of Via header fields and save the
list, build the P-CSCF Via header field entry in a format that contains the
protected server port number of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF associates two ports, a protected client port and a
protected server port, with each pair of security associations or TLS session.
For details of the usage of the two ports see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
7) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled athentication is used, when adding its own address to the top of the
received list of Via header fields and saving the list, build the P-CSCF Via
header field entry in a format that contains an unprotected server port number
where the P-CSCF expects responses to the current request from the UE;
7A) if the recipient of the request is understood from information saved
during registration or from configuration to always send and receive private
network traffic from this source, remove the P-Private-Network-Indication
header field containing the domain name associated with that saved
information;
8) store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
9) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field; and
10) save a copy of the P-Called-Party-ID header field;
before forwarding the request to the UE either in accordance with the
procedures of RFC 3261 [26] or as specified in RFC 5626 [92].
##### 5.2.6.4.4 Responses to an initial request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above request, the
P-CSCF shall:
0A) if the response is originated from a UE which the P-CSCF considers as
priviledged sender, remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field, and skip
step 1) below;
NOTE: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE is considered priviledged sender
based on parameters stored during registration (see subclause 5.2.2.1), if
available. Otherwise the P-CSCF can make the determination based on local
configuration.
1) remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field or P-Asserted-Identity header
field, if present, and insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field with the
saved public user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID header field that was
received in the request, plus the display name if previously stored during
registration, representing the originator of the response;
2) verify that the list of Via header fields matches the saved list of Via
header fields received in the request corresponding to the same dialog,
including the P-CSCF Via header field value. This verification is done on a
per Via header field value basis, not as a whole string. If the verification
fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Via header field values with those received in the request;
3) verify that the list of URIs received in the Record-Route header field of
the request corresponding to the same dialog is included, preserving the same
order, as a subset of the Record-Route header field list of this response.
This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a whole string.
If the verification fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Record-Route header field values with those received in the
request, and if a security association or TLS session exists, add its own
Record-Route entry with its own SIP URI with the port number where it awaits
subsequent requests from the calling party. The P-CSCF shall include in the
Record-Route header field either:
\- the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to its IP address; or
\- the P-CSCF IP address.
The P-CSCF shall remove the \"comp\" SIP URI parameter from the Record-Route
header field.
If the verification is successful, the P-CSCF shall rewrite its own Record-
Route entry to its SIP URI in a format that contains the port number where it
awaits subsequent requests from the calling party. The P-CSCF shall include in
the Record-Route header field either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to its IP address; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address.
The P-CSCF shall remove the \"comp\" SIP URI parameter from the Record-Route
header field;
When adding its SIP URI to the Record-Route header field, the P-CSCF shall
also copy the flow token and the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter from the Route
header field of the initial dialog-forming request destined for the UE to its
SIP URI, if the Route header field contained these values;
4) store the dialog ID and associate it with the private user identity and
public user identity involved in the session; and
5) if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, save the Contact, To,
From and Record-Route header field value received in the response such that
the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed. If the Contact header
field in the response to the INVITE request contains a GRUU and the INVITE
request was not sent over a bidirectional flow as defined in RFC 5626 [92],
the P-CSCF shall save the GRUU received in the Contact header field of the
response and associate that GRUU with the UE IP address and the UE port, for
the security association on which the INVITE request was sent such that the
P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed. The UE port used for the
association is determined as follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the UE protected server port for the security association on which the request
was received; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled Authentication is being used as a security mechanism, the UE
unprotected port on which the request was received;
before forwarding the response in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261
[26].
When the P-CSCF receives any other response to the above request, the P-CSCF
shall:
1) verify that the list of Via header fields matches the saved list of Via
header fields received in the request corresponding to the same dialog,
including the P-CSCF Via header field value. This verification is done on a
per Via header field value basis, not as a whole string. If these lists do not
match, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Via header field values with those received in the request;
before forwarding the response in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261
[26].
##### 5.2.6.4.5 Target refresh request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a
dialog, prior to forwarding the request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) if a security association or TLS session exists, add its own address to the
top of the received list of Via header fields and save the list. The P-CSCF
Via header field entry is built in a format that contains the protected server
port number of the security association or TLS session established from the UE
to the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
NOTE 1: The P-CSCF associates two ports, a protected client port and a
protected server port, with each pair of security associations or TLS session.
For details of the usage of the two ports see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
2) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is used, when adding its own address to the top of the
received list of Via header fields and saving the list, build the P-CSCF Via
header field entry in a format that contains an unprotected server port number
where the P-CSCF expects responses to the current request from the UE;
3) if a security association or TLS session exists, when adding its own SIP
URI to the top of the list of Record-Route header fields and save the list,
build the P-CSCF SIP URI in a format that contains the protected server port
number of the security association or TLS session established from the UE to
the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
4) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is used, when adding its own SIP URI to the top of the
list of Record-Route header fields and saving the list, build the P-CSCF URI
in a format that contains an unprotected server port number where the P-CSCF
expects subsequent requests from the UE; and
5) for INVITE dialogs, replace the saved Contact and Cseq header field values
received in the request such that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if
needed;
NOTE 2: The replaced Contact header field value is valid only if a 1xx or 2xx
response will be received for the request. In other cases the old value is
still valid.
before forwarding the request to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
either RFC 3261 [26] or RFC 5626 [92].
##### 5.2.6.4.6 Responses to a target refresh request for a dialog
When the P-CSCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to the above request, the
P-CSCF shall:
1) verify that the list of Via header fields matches the saved list of Via
header fields received in the request corresponding to the same dialog,
including the P-CSCF Via header field value. This verification is done on a
per Via header field value basis, not as a whole string. If the verification
fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Via header field values with those received in the request;
2) if a security association or TLS session exists, rewrite its own Record-
Route entry to the same value as for the response to the initial request for
the dialog and remove the \"comp\" SIP URI parameter; and
3) replace the saved Contact header field value received in the response such
that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed. If the Contact
header field in the response to the target refresh request for a dialog
contains a GRUU and target refresh request for a dialog was not sent over a
bidirectional flow, the P-CSCF shall save the GRUU received in the Contact
header field of the response and associate That GRUU with the UE IP address
and the UE port, for the security association on which the target refresh
request for a dialog was sent such that the P-CSCF is able to release the
session if needed. The UE port used for the association is determined as
follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the UE protected server port for the security association on which the request
was received; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled Authentication is being used as a security mechanism, the UE
unprotected port on which the request was received;
before forwarding the response in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261
[26].
When the P-CSCF receives any other response to the above request, the P-CSCF
shall:
1) verify that the list of Via header fields matches the saved list of Via
header fields received in the request corresponding to the same dialog,
including the P-CSCF Via header field value. This verification is done on a
per Via header field value basis, not as a whole string. If the verification
fails, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Via header field values with those received in the request; and
2) if a security association or TLS session exists, rewrite the IP address and
the port number of its own Record-Route entry to the IP address and the port
number where it awaits subsequent requests from the calling party and remove
the \"comp\" SIP URI parameter;
before forwarding the response in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261
[26].
##### 5.2.6.4.7 Request for a standalone transaction
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a request for a standalone
transaction, or a request for an unknown method (that does not relate to an
existing dialog), prior to forwarding the request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) if an indication has been received from the PCRF that the signalling bearer
to the UE is lost, and has not recovered, reject the request by sending 503
(Service Unavailable) response);
NOTE 1: The signalling bearer can be considered as recovered by the P-CSCF
when the registration timer expires in P-CSCF and the user is de-registered
from the IM CN subsystem, a new REGISTER request from the UE is received
providing an indication to the P-CSCF that the signalling bearer to that user
has become available or a P-CSCF implementation dependent function which
discovers that the signalling bearer is available to the UE.
NOTE 2: The Retry-After header field value is set based on operator policy.
2) if a security association or TLS session exists, add its own address to the
top of the received list of Via header fields and save the list. The P-CSCF
Via header field entry is built in a format that contains the protected server
port number of the security association or TLS session established from the UE
to the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF associates two ports, a protected client port and a
protected server port, with each pair of security associations or TLS session.
For details of the usage of the two ports see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
3) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is used, when adding its own address to the top of the
received list of Via header fields and saving the list, build the P-CSCF Via
header field entry in a format that contains an unprotected server port number
where the P-CSCF expects responses to the current request from the UE;
3A) if the recipient of the request is understood from information saved
during registration or from configuration to always send and receive private
network traffic from this source, remove the P-Private-Network-Indication
header field containing the domain name associated with that saved
information;
4) store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
5) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field; and
6) save a copy of the P-Called-Party-ID header field;
before forwarding the request to the UE either in accordance with the
procedures of RFC 3261 [26] or as specified in RFC 5626 [92].
##### 5.2.6.4.8 Responses to a request for a standalone transaction
When the P-CSCF receives any response to the above request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) verify that the list of Via header fields matches the saved list of Via
header fields received in the request corresponding to the same dialog,
including the P-CSCF Via header field value. This verification is done on a
per Via header field value basis, not as a whole string. If these lists do not
match, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Via header field values with those received in the request;
1A) if the response is originated from a UE which the P-CSCF considers as
priviledged sender, remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field, and skip
step 2) below; and
NOTE: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE is considered priviledged sender
based on parameters stored during registration (see subclause 5.2.2.1), if
available. Otherwise the P-CSCF can make the determination based on local
configuration.
2) remove any P-Preferred-Identity header field or P-Asserted-Identity header
field, if present, and insert an P-Asserted-Identity header field with the
saved public user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID header field of the
request, plus the display name if previously stored during registration,
representing the originator of the response;
before forwarding the response in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261
[26].
##### 5.2.6.4.9 Subsequent request other than a target refresh request
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a subsequent request for a
dialog that is not a target refresh request (including requests relating to an
existing dialog where the method is unknown), prior to forwarding the request,
the P-CSCF shall:
1) if a security association or TLS session exists, add its own address to the
top of the received list of Via header fields and save the list The P-CSCF Via
header field entry is built in a format that contains the protected server
port number of the security association or TLS session established from the UE
to the P-CSCF and either:
a) the P-CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
or TLS session established from the UE to the P-CSCF; or
b) the P-CSCF IP address of the security association or TLS session
established from the UE to the P-CSCF;
NOTE: The P-CSCF associates two ports, a protected client port and a protected
server port, with each pair of security associations or TLS session. For
details of the usage of the two ports see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
2) if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled authentication is used, when adding its own address to the top of the
received list of Via header fields and saving the list, build the P-CSCF Via
header field entry in a format that contains an unprotected server port number
where the P-CSCF expects responses to the current request from the UE;
3) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter from P-Charging-Vector
header field; and
4) for INVITE dialogs, replace the saved Cseq header field value received in
the request such that the P-CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the request to the UE either in accordance with the
procedures of RFC 3261 [26] or as specified in RFC 5626 [92].
##### 5.2.6.4.10 Responses to a subsequent request other than a target refresh
request
When the P-CSCF receives any response to the above request, the P-CSCF shall:
1) verify that the list of Via header fields matches the saved list of Via
header fields received in the request corresponding to the same dialog,
including the P-CSCF Via header field value. This verification is done on a
per Via header field value basis, not as a whole string. If these lists do not
match, then the P-CSCF shall either:
a) discard the response; or
b) replace the Via header field values with those received in the request;
before forwarding the response in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261
[26].
##### 5.2.6.4.11 Request for an unknown method that does not relate to an
existing dialog
Void.
##### 5.2.6.4.12 Responses to a request for an unknown method that does not
relate to an existing dialog
Void.
### 5.2.7 Initial INVITE
#### 5.2.7.1 Introduction
In addition to following the procedures for initial requests defined in
subclause 5.2.6, initial INVITE requests also follow the procedures of this
subclause.
#### 5.2.7.2 UE-originating case
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE an INVITE request for which resource
authorization procedure is required, if it receives from the IP-CAN (e.g. via
PCRF) an indication that the requested resources for the multimedia session
being established cannot be granted and this indication does not provide an
acceptable bandwidth information, the Pâ€‘CSCF shall return a 503 (Service
Unavailable) response to the received INVITE request. Depending on local
operator policy, this 503 (Service Unavailable) response may include a Retry-
After header indicating how long the UE shall wait before it can reattempt the
request.
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE an INVITE request, the P-CSCF may require
the periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the P-CSCF. If
the P-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, then the P-CSCF shall apply
the procedures described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 1: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
The P-CSCF shall respond to all INVITE requests with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response.
If received from the IP-CAN, the P-CSCF shall also include the access-network-
charging-info parameter (e.g. received via the PCRF, over the Rx or Gx
interfaces) in the P-Charging-Vector header field in the first request
originated by the UE that traverses the P-CSCF, as soon as the charging
information is available in the P-CSCF, e.g., after the local resource
reservation is complete. Typically, this first request is an UPDATE request if
the remote UA supports the \"integration of resource management in SIP\"
extension or a re-INVITE request if the remote UA does not support the
\"integration of resource management in SIP\" extension. See subclause 5.2.7.4
for further information on the access network charging information.
The P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) shall transparently forward a received Contact header
field towards the UE when the Contact header field contains a GRUU or a media
feature tag indicating a capability for which the URI can be used.
NOTE 2: One examples of such a media feature tag is the isfocus media feature
tag where the URI in the Contact header field is used by conference services
to transport the temporary conference identity that can be used when rejoining
an ongoing conference.
#### 5.2.7.3 UE-terminating case
When the P-CSCF receives an INVITE request destined for the UE the P-CSCF may
require the periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the
P-CSCF. If the P-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, then the P-CSCF
shall apply the procedures described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 1: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it in order to make it work.
When the P-CSCF receives an initial INVITE request destined for the UE, it
will have a list of Record-Route header fields. Prior to forwarding the
initial INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall respond to all INVITE requests with a
100 (Trying) provisional response.
If received from the IP-CAN, the P-CSCF shall also include the access-network-
charging-info parameter (e.g. received via the PCRF, over the Rx or Gx
interfaces) in the P-Charging-Vector header field in the first request or
reliable response originated by the UE that traverses the P-CSCF, as soon as
the charging information is available in the P-CSCF e.g., after the local
resource reservation is complete. See subclause 5.2.7.4 for further
information on the access network charging information.
The P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) shall transparently forward a received Contact header
field towards the UE when the Contact header field contains a GRUU or a media
feature tag indicating a capability for which the URI can be used.
NOTE 2: One examples of such a media feature tag is the isfocus media feature
tag where the URI in the Contact header field is used by conference services
to transport the temporary conference identity that can be used when rejoining
an ongoing conference.
#### 5.2.7.4 Access network charging information
The P-CSCF shall include the \"access-network-charging-info\" header field
parameter within the P-Charging-Vector header field as described in subclause
7.2A.5.
### 5.2.8 Call release
#### 5.2.8.1 P-CSCF-initiated call release
##### 5.2.8.1.1 Cancellation of a session currently being established
Upon receipt of an indication that radio/bearer resources is no longer
available for a multimedia session currently being established (e.g. abort
session request from PCRF), the P-CSCF shall cancel that dialog by applying
the following steps:
1) if the P-CSCF serves the calling user of the session, send out a CANCEL
request to cancel the INVITE request towards the terminating UE that includes
a Reason header field containing a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code
according to the procedures described in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3326 [34A]; and
2) if the P-CSCF serves the called user of the session, send out a 503
(Service Unavailable) response to the received INVITE request.
Upon receipt of an indication that QoS or bearer resources are no longer
available for a multimedia session currently being established (e.g. abort
session request from PCRF), the P-CSCF shall cancel that dialog by responding
to the original INVITE request with a 503 (Servi ce Unavailable) response, and
by sending out a CANCEL request to the INVITE request towards the terminating
UE that includes a Reason header field containing a 503 (Service Unavailable)
status code according to the procedures described in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC
3326 [34A].
##### 5.2.8.1.2 Release of an existing session
Upon receipt of an indication that the radio/bearer resources are no longer
available or the signalling bearer is lost to the UE for a session (e.g. abort
session request from PCRF) or upon detecting that the SDP offer conveyed in a
SIP response contained parameters which are not allowed according to the local
policy (as specified in the subclause 6.2), the P-CSCF shall release the
respective dialog by applying the following steps:
1) if the P-CSCF serves the calling user of the session, then the P-CSCF shall
generate a BYE request destined for the called user based on the information
saved for the related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to the stored Contact header field provided by the
called user;
\- a To header field, set to the To header field value as received in the 200
(OK) response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a From header field, set to the From header field value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a Call-ID header field, set to the Call-Id header field value as received

\- a 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, if the signalling bearer is lost
to the UE; or
\- a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response code, if a SDP offer conveyed in a SIP
response contained parameters which are not allowed according to the local
policy;
\- further header fields, based on local policy; and
\- send the generated BYE requests towards the called user;
2) if the P-CSCF serves the calling user of the session and upon detecting
that the SDP offer conveyed in a SIP response contained parameters which are
not allowed according to the local policy (as specified in the subclause 6.2),
then the P-CSCF shall generate an additional BYE request destined for the
calling user based on the information saved for the related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to a contact address obtained from the stored Contact
header field if provided by the calling user. If the stored Contact header
field contains either a public or a temporary GRUU, the P-CSCF shall set the
Request-URI either to:
a) the stored UE IP address and the UE port associated with the respective
GRUU, if the stored Contact header field contains either a public or a
temporary GRUU and the bidirectional flow as defined in RFC 5626 [92] is not
used for this session; or
b) the UE IP address and UE port associated with the bidirectional flow that
the P-CSCF uses to send the in-dialog requests toward the UE as defined in RFC
5626 [92];
\- a To header field, set to the From header field value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a From header field, set to the To header field value as received in the
200 (OK) response for the initial INVITE request;

in the initial INVITE request;
\- a CSeq header field, set to the current CSeq value stored for the direction
from the called to the calling user, incremented by one;
\- a Route header field, set to the routeing information towards the calling
user as stored for the dialog;
\- a Reason header field that contains a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
code;
\- further header fields, based on local policy; and
\- send the BYE request either:
a) to the contact address indicated in the Request-URI, if the dialog being
released did not use the bidirectional flow to send the requests to the UE as
defined in RFC 5626 [92]; or
b) over the same flow that the P-CSCF uses to send the in-dialog requests
toward the UE as defined in RFC 5626 [92];
3) If the P-CSCF serves the called user of the session, then the P-CSCF shall
generate a BYE request destined for the calling user based on the information
saved for the related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to the stored Contact header field provided by the
calling user;
\- a To header field, set to the From header field value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a From header field, set to the To header field value as received in the
200 (OK) response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a Call-ID header field, set to the Call-Id header field value as received
in the initial INVITE request;

\- a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response code, if SDP payload contained
parameters which are not allowed according to the local policy;
\- further header fields, based on local policy; and
\- send the generated BYE requests towards the calling user;
4) if the P-CSCF serves the called user of the session and upon detecting that
the SDP offer conveyed in a SIP response contained parameters which are not
allowed according to the local policy (as specified in the subclause 6.2),
then the P-CSCF shall generate an additional BYE request destined for the
called user based on the information saved for the related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to a contact address obtained from the stored Contact
header field if provided by the called user. If the stored Contact header
field contains either a public or a temporary GRUU, the P-CSCF shall set the
Request-URI either to:
a) the stored UE IP address and the UE port associated with the respective
GRUU, if the stored Contact header field contains either a public or a
temporary GRUU and the bidirectional flow as defined in RFC 5626 [92] is not
used for this session; or
b) the UE IP address and the UE port associated with the bidirectional flow
that the P-CSCF uses to send the in-dialog requests toward the UE as defined
in RFC 5626 [92];
\- a To header field, set to the To header field value as received in the 200
(OK) response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a From header field, set to the From header field value as received in the

\- a Route header field, set to the routeing information towards the called
user as stored for the dialog;
\- a Reason header field that contains a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
code;
\- further header fields, based on local policy; and
\- send the BYE request either:
a) to the contact address indicated in the Request-URI, if the dialog being
released did not use t the bidirectional flow to send the requests to the UE
as defined in RFC 5626 [92]; or
b) over the same flow that the P-CSCF uses to send the in-dialog requests
toward the UE as defined in RFC 5626 [92].
Upon receipt of the 2xx responses for the BYE requests, the P-CSCF shall
delete all information related to the dialog and the related multimedia
session.
##### 5.2.8.1.3 Abnormal cases
Upon receipt of a request on a dialog for which the P-CSCF initiated session
release, the P-CSCF shall terminate this received request and answer it with a
481 (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) response.
##### 5.2.8.1.4 Release of the existing dialogs due to registration expiration
and deletion of the security association, IP association or TLS session
If there are still active dialogs associated with the user after the security
associations, IP association or TLS sessions were deleted, the P-CSCF shall
discard all information pertaining to these dialogs without performing any
further SIP transactions with the peer entities of the P-CSCF.
NOTE: If the interface between the P-CSCF and the IP-CAN is supported, the
P-CSCF will also indicate (e.g. via the Rx or Gx interface) that the session
has been terminated.
#### 5.2.8.2 Call release initiated by any other entity
When the P-CSCF receives a 2xx response for a BYE request matching an existing
dialog, then the P-CSCF shall delete all the stored information related to the
dialog.
#### 5.2.8.3 Session expiration
If the P-CSCF requested the session to be refreshed periodically, and the
P-CSCF got the indication that the session will be refreshed, when the session
timer expires, the P-CSCF shall delete all the stored information related to
the dialog.
NOTE: If the interface between the P-CSCF and the IP-CAN is supported, the
P-CSCF will also indicate to the IP-CAN (e.g. via the Rx or Gx interface),
that the session has terminated.
### 5.2.9 Subsequent requests
#### 5.2.9.1 UE-originating case
The P-CSCF shall respond to all reINVITE requests with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response.
For a reINVITE request or UPDATE request from the UE within the same dialog,
the P-CSCF shall include the updated access-network-charging-info parameter
from P-Charging-Vector header field when sending the SIP request to the
S-CSCF. See subclause 5.2.7.4 for further information on the access network
charging information.
#### 5.2.9.2 UE-terminating case
The P-CSCF shall respond to all reINVITE requests with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response.
For a reINVITE request or UPDATE request destined towards the UE within the
same dialog, when the P-CSCF sends 200 (OK) response (to the INVITE request or
UPDATE request) towards the S-CSCF, the P-CSCF shall include the updated
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field.
See subclause 5.2.7.4 for further information on the access network charging
information.
### 5.2.10 Emergency service
#### 5.2.10.1 General
If the P-CSCF belongs to a network where the registration is not required to
obtain emergency service, the Pâ€‘CSCF shall accept any unprotected request on
the IP address and port advertised to the UE during the P-CSCF discovery
procedure. The P-CSCF shall also accept any unprotected request on the same IP
address and the default port as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
When the P-CSCF sends unprotected responses to the UE, it shall use the same
IP address and port where the corresponding request was received.
The P-CSCF can handle emergency session and other requests from both a
registered user as well as an unregistered user. Certain networks only allow
emergency session from registered users.
NOTE 1: If only emergency setup from registered users is allowed, a request
from an unregistered user is ignored since it is received outside of the
security association, TLS session or IP association.
The P-CSCF can handle emergency session establishment within a non-emergency
registration, i.e. one that did not contain the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter in
the Contact header field of the 200 (OK) response.
Upon receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request that completes
the emergency registration, as identified by the presence of the \"sos\" SIP
URI parameter in the Contact header field of the 200 (OK) response, the P-CSCF
shall not subscribe to the registration event package for any emergency public
user identity specified in the REGISTER request.
The P-CSCF shall store a configurable list of local emergency service
identifiers, i.e. emergency numbers and the emergency service URNs, which can
be resolved in the network to which the P-CSCF belongs. In addition to that,
the P-CSCF shall store a configurable list of roaming partners\' emergency
service identifiers.
NOTE 2: The emergency service URN is common to all networks, although subtypes
may either not necessarily be in use, or a different set of subtypes is in use
in different networks.
Access technology specific procedures are described in each access technology
specific annex to determine the originating network of the requests.
NOTE 3: Depending on local operator policy, the P-CSCF has the capability to
reject requests relating to specific methods in accordance with RFC 3261 [26],
as an alternative to the functionality described above.
#### 5.2.10.2 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method -- requests from an unregistered user
If the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction, or an unknown method from an unregistered user on the IP address
and the unprotected port advertised to the UE during the P-CSCF discovery or
the SIP default port, the P-CSCF shall inspect the Request-URI independent of
values of possible entries in the received Route header fields for emergency
service identifiers. The P-CSCF shall consider the Request URI of the initial
request as a emergency service identifier, if it is an, emergency number or an
emergency service URN in the list of local emergency service identifiers or in
the list of roaming partners emergency service identifiers.
If the P-CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a dialog
or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method matches one of the emergency
service identifiers, the P-CSCF shall:
1) include in the Request-URI an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN
with a top-level service type of \"sos\" in accordance with RFC 5031 [69]. If
information on the type of emergency service is known include a sub-service
type. The entry in the Request-URI that the P-CSCF includes shall be:
\- as received in the Request-URI from the UE in accordance with RFC 5031
[69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE;
2) select an E-CSCF and add the URI of the selected E-CSCF to the topmost
Route header field;
NOTE: How the list of E-CSCF is obtained by the P-CSCF is implementation
dependent.
3) execute the procedure described in subclause 5.2.6.3.3, subclause
5.2.6.3.7, subclause 5.2.6.3.11 and subclause 5.2.7.2, as appropriate except
for:
\- verifying the preloaded route against the received Service-Route header
field;
\- routing to IBCF;
\- removing the P-Preferred-Identity header field; and
\- inserting a P-Asserted-Identity header field;
3A) insert a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header
field parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17]; and
4) if the P-CSCF detects that the UE is behind a NAT, and the UE\'s Via header
field contains a \"keep\" header field parameter, the P-CSCF shall add a value
to the parameter, to indicate that it is willing to receive keep-alives
associated with the dialog from the UE, as defined in RFC 6223 [143].
When the P-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above requests, the
P-CSCF shall execute the appropriate procedure for the type of request
described in subclause 5.2.6.3.4, subclause 5.2.6.3.8, and subclause
5.2.6.3.12, except that the P-CSCF may rewrite the port number of its own
Record-Route entry to an unprotected port where the P-CSCF wants to receive
the subsequent incoming requests from the UE belonging to this dialog.
If the P-CSCF does not receive any response to the initial request for a
dialog or standalone transaction or unknown method (including its
retransmissions); or receives a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
response to an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction or an
unknown method, the P-CSCF shall select a new E-CSCF and forward the request.
When the P-CSCF receives a target refresh request from the UE for a dialog,
the P-CSCF shall execute the procedure described in subclause 5.2.6.3.5.
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE subsequent requests other than a target
refresh request (including requests relating to an existing dialog where the
method is unknown), the P-CSCF shall execute the procedure described in
subclause 5.2.6.3.9.
When the P-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above requests, the
P-CSCF shall execute the appropriate procedure for the type of request
described in subclause 5.2.6.3.5 or subclause 5.2.6.3.9.
#### 5.2.10.2A General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method -- requests to an unregistered user
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a
dialog, prior to forwarding the request, the P-CSCF shall execute the
procedure described in step 5, the paragraph of subclause 5.2.6.4.5.
When the P-CSCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to the above request the P-CSCF
shall execute the procedure described in subclause 5.2.6.4.6.
When the P-CSCF receives any other response to the above request the P-CSCF
shall execute the procedure described in step 1) to 2) in the paragraph of
subclause 5.2.6.4.6 describing when the P-CSCF receives any other response to
a target request.
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a subsequent request for a
dialog that is not a target refresh request (including requests relating to an
existing dialog where the method is unknown), prior to forwarding the request,
the P-CSCF shall execute the procedure described in steps 3 and 4 of subclause
5.2.6.4.9 describing when a P-CSCF receives a subsequent request.
When the P-CSCF receives any other response to the above request the P-CSCF
shall execute the procedure described in step 1 in the paragraph of subclause
5.2.6.4.10 describing when the P-CSCF receives any other response to a
subsequent request.
#### 5.2.10.3 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method after emergency registration
If the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone
transaction, or an unknown method, for a registered user over the security
association, TLS session, or IP association that was created during the
emergency registration, as identified by the presence of the \"sos\" SIP URI
parameter in the Contact header field of the 200 (OK) response, the P-CSCF
shall inspect the Request-URI independent of values of possible entries in the
received Route header fields for emergency service identifiers. The P-CSCF
shall consider the Request URI of the initial request as an emergency service
identifier, if it is an emergency number or an emergency service URN from the
configurable lists that are associated with:
\- the country of the operator to which the P-CSCF belongs to; and
\- for inbound roamers, the country from which the UE is roaming from. The
P-CSCF determines the country to which the UE is belonging to based on the
content of the P-Assserted-Identity header field which contains the home
network domain name in a SIP URI belonging to the user.
If the P-CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a
dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method does not match any
one of the emergency service identifiers in the associated lists, the P-CSCF
shall reject the request by returning a 403 (Forbidden) response to the UE.
If the P-CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a
dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method matches one of the
emergency service identifiers in the associated lists, the P-CSCF shall:
1) include in the Request-URI an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN
with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69], if
necessary. If information on the type of emergency service is known include a
sub-service type. The entry in the Request-URI that the P-CSCF includes shall
be:
\- as received from the UE in the Request-URI in accordance with RFC 5031
[69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE.
1A) execute the procedure described in subclause 5.2.6.3.3, subclause
5.2.6.3.7, subclause 5.2.6.3.11 and subclause 5.2.7.2, as appropriate except
for:
a) verifying the preloaded route against the received Service-Route header
field; and
b) routing to IBCF.
When executing the referenced procedures, P-CSCF shall additionally:
a) select an E-CSCF and add the URI of the selected E-CSCF to the topmost
Route header field; and
NOTE: It is implementation dependant as to how the P-CSCF obtains the list of
E-CSCFs.
b) if the request is from a UE that is not considered as priviledged sender
and if the alternative identity of the originator of the request was not
identified (see subclause 5.2.6.3.1):
i) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field in the request to be sent contains
a SIP URI and if a tel URI belongs to the set of implicitly registered public
user identities that contains the SIP URI, add a second P-Asserted-Identity
header field that contains the first tel URI of the implicitly registered
public user identities; and
ii) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field in the request to be sent contains
a tel URI, add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field that contains the
first SIP URI of the implicitly registered public user identities that
contains the tel URI;
2) if the request contains a Contact header field containing a GRUU the P-CSCF
shall save the GRUU received in the Contact header field of the request and
associate it with the UE IP address and UE port such that the P-CSCF is able
to route target refresh request containing that GRUU in the Request-URI. The
UE port used for the association is determined as follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the UE protected server port for the security association on which the request
was received; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS, NASS-IMS bundled authentication or GPRS-IMS-
Bundled Authentication is being used as a security mechanism, the UE
unprotected port on which the request was received; and
2A) insert a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header
field parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
If the P-CSCF does not receive any response to the initial request for a
dialog or standalone transaction or an unknown method (including its
retransmissions); or receives a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
response to an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction or an
unknown method, the P-CSCF shall select a new E-CSCF and forward the request.
When the P-CSCF receives a target refresh request for a dialog with the
Request-URI containing a GRUU the P-CSCF shall:
\- obtain the UE IP address and UE port associated to the GRUU contained in
the Request-URI and rewrite the Request-URI with that UE IP address and UE
port; and
\- perform the steps in subclause 5.2.6.4.5 for when the P-CSCF receives,
destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a dialog.
#### 5.2.10.4 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method - non-emergency registration
If the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone
transaction, or an unknown method, for a registered user, and the request is
not understood from saved or included information to relate to private network
traffic (see subclause 5.2.6.3), the P-CSCF shall inspect the Request-URI
independent of values of possible entries in the received Route header fields
for emergency service identifiers. The P-CSCF shall consider the Request URI
of the initial request as a emergency service identifier, if it is an
emergency numbers or an emergency service URN from the configurable lists that
are associated with:
\- the country of the operator to which the P-CSCF belongs to;
\- for inbound roamers , the country from which the UE is roaming from. The
P-CSCF determines the country to which the UE is belonging to based on the
content of the P-Assserted-Identity header field which contains the home
network domain name in a SIP URI belonging to the user; and
\- the country of roaming partners, if the request originates from a different
country then the country of the network to which the P-CSCF belongs to. Access
technology specific procedures are described in each access technology
specific annex to determine from which country and roaming partner the request
was originated. If the country from which the request originates can not be
determined all lists are associated.
If the P-CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a
dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method matches one of the
emergency service identifiers in the associated lists, the P-CSCF shall:
0A) determine the geographical location of the UE. Access technology specific
procedures are described in each access technology specific annex:
a) if the UE is roaming and the P-CSCF is in the home operator\'s network, or
the SDP of the request describes CS media (see 3GPP TS 24.292 [8O]), then the
P-CSCF:
I) shall reject the request by returning a 380 (Alternative Service) response
to the UE;
II) if:
\- support for the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6
in the Accept header field is not indicated, the P-CSCF shall assume that the
UE supports version 1 of the XML Schema for the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML; or
\- if both the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameters are present, then the
P-CSCF shall ignore the value of the \"schemaversion\" parameter;
III) shall include in the 380 (Alternative Service) response:
\- a Content-Type header field with the value set to associated MIME type of
the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6.1;
\- a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to the value of the SIP URI of the
P-CSCF included in the Path header field during the registration of the user
whose UE sent the request causing this response (see subclause 5.2.2.1); and
\- if the type of emergency service can be deduced from the Request-URI
received from the UE, a Contact header field with an emergency service URN,
i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in
RFC 5031 [69], including sub-service type deduced from the Request-URI
received from the UE; and
IV) shall include an IM CN subsystem XML body with the following elements:
a) an \ element with the \"version\" attribute set to \"1\" and with
an \ child element, set to the parameters of the
alternative service:
i) a \ child element, set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA) to indicate
that it was an emergency call;
ii) a \ child element, set to an operator configurable reason; and
iii) an \ child element, set to \"emergency-registration\" (see table
7.7AB) if the P-CSCF is accordingly configured by the operator; and
b) if the UE is roaming and the P-CSCF is in the same network where the UE is
roaming, or the UE is not roaming, then the P-CSCF, depending on operator
policies, shall either:
I) apply items of bullet a) of bullet 0A); or
II) continue with the next steps; and
NOTE 1: Roaming is when a UE is in a geographic area that is outside the
serving geographic area of the home IM CN subsystem.
NOTE 2: Emergency service URN in the request-URI indicates for the network
that the emergency call attempt is recognized by the UE.
1) include in the Request-URI an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN
with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69], if
necessary. If information on the type of emergency service is known include a
sub-service type. The entry in the Request-URI that the P-CSCF includes shall
be:
\- as received from the UE in the Request-URI in accordance with RFC 5031
[69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE; and
1A) execute the procedure described in subclause 5.2.6.3.3, subclause
5.2.6.3.7, subclause 5.2.6.3.11 and subclause 5.2.7.2, as appropriate except
for:
a) verifying the preloaded route against the received Service-Route header
field; and
b) routing to IBCF.
When executing the referenced procedures, P-CSCF shall additionally:
a) remove all Route header fields;
b) select an E-CSCF and add a Route header field with the URI of the selected
E-CSCF; and
NOTE 3: It is implementation dependant as to how the P-CSCF obtains the list
of E-CSCFs.
c) if the request is from a UE that is not considered as priviledged sender
and if the alternative identity of the originator of the request was not
identified (see subclause 5.2.6.3.1):
i) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field in the request to be sent contains
a SIP URI and if a tel URI belongs to the set of implicitly registered public
user identities that contains the SIP URI, add a second P-Asserted-Identity
header field that contains the first tel URI of the implicitly registered
public user identities; and
ii) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field in the request to be sent contains
a tel URI, add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field that contains the
first SIP URI of the implicitly registered public user identities that
contains the tel URI; and
2) if the request contains a Contact header field containing a GRUU the P-CSCF
shall save the GRUU received in the Contact header field of the request and
associate it with the UE IP address and UE port such that the P-CSCF is able
to route target refresh request containing that GRUU in the Request-URI. The
UE port used for the association is determined as follows:
\- if IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS is being used as a security mechanism,
the UE protected server port for the security association on which the request
was received; or
\- if SIP digest without TLS is being used as a security mechanism, the UE
unprotected port on which the request was received.
If the P-CSCF:
\- does not receive any response to the initial request for a dialog or
standalone transaction or an unknown method (including its retransmissions);
or receives a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to an
initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction or an unknown method,
the P-CSCF shall select a different E-CSCF that has not been tried before for
this initial request for the dialog or standalone transaction (including its
retransmissions), and forward the request. If all E-CSCFs have been tried
before for this initial request for the dialog or standalone transaction
(including its retransmissions), the P-CSCF shall reject this request by
returning a 380 (Alternative Service) response to the UE as described in items
I), II), III) and IV) within bullet 0A);
\- receives:
1) any 4xx response other than a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response;
2) any 5xx response;
3) any 6xx response,
and the entry in the Request-URI as received from the UE is not in accordance
with RFC 5031 [69], then the P-CSCF shall reject this request by returning a
380 (Alternative Service) response to the UE as described in items I), II),
III) and IV) within bullet 0A).
If the P-CSCF receives from the IP-CAN (e.g. via PCRF) an indication that the
requested resources for the multimedia session being established cannot be
granted and the entry in the Request-URI as received from the UE is not in
accordance with RFC 5031 [69], then the P-CSCF shall:
\- send a CANCEL request to cancel the request forwarded to the selected
E-CSCF; and
\- reject this request by returning a 380 (Alternative Service) response to
the UE as described in items I), II), III) and IV) within bullet 0A).
When the P-CSCF receives a target refresh request for a dialog with the
Request-URI containing a GRUU the P-CSCF shall:
\- obtain the UE IP address and UE port associated to the GRUU contained in
the Request-URI and rewrite the Request-URI with that UE IP address and UE
port; and
\- perform the steps in subclause 5.2.6.4 for when the P-CSCF receives,
destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a dialog.
#### 5.2.10.5 Abnormal cases
If the IM CN subsystem to where the P-CSCF belongs to is not capable to handle
emergency sessions or due to local policy does not handle emergency sessions
or only handles certain type of emergency session request or does not support
emergency sessions for either the geographical location of the UE is located
or the IP-CAN to which the UE is attached, or the SDP of the request describes
CS media (see 3GPP TS 24.292 [8O]), the P-CSCF shall not forward the initial
request for a dialog or standalone transaction or an unknown method. The
P-CSCF:
I) shall respond to the initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction
or an unknown method with a 380 (Alternative Service) response;
II) if:
\- support for the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6
in the Accept header field is not indicated, the P-CSCF shall assume that the
UE supports version 1 of the 3GPP XML Schema for the IM CN subsystem XML; or
\- if both the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameters are present, then the
P-CSCF shall ignore the value of the \"schemaversion\" parameter;
III) shall include in the 380 (Alternative Service) response:
\- a Content-Type header field with the value set to associated MIME type of
the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6.1; and
\- a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to the value of the SIP URI of the
P-CSCF included in the Path header field during the registration of the user
whose UE sent the request causing this response (see subclause 5.2.2.1);
\- if the type of emergency service can be deduced from the Request-URI
received from the UE, a Contact header field with an emergency service URN,
i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in
RFC 5031 [69], including sub-service type deduced from the Request-URI
received from the UE; and
IV) shall include an IM CN subsystem XML body with the following elements:
a) an \ element with the \"version\" attribute set to \"1\" and with
an \ child element, set to the parameters of the
alternative service;
i) a \ child element, set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA) to indicate
that it was an emergency call;
ii) a \ child element, set to an operator configurable reason; and
iii) an \ child element, set to \"emergency-registration\" (see table
7.7AB) if the P-CSCF is accordingly configured by the operator.
NOTE 1: Emergency service URN in the request-URI indicates for the network
that the emergency call attempt is recognized by the UE.
NOTE 2: Some networks only allow session requests with a Request-URI
containing an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a top-level
service type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69].
### 5.2.11 Void
## 5.3 Procedures at the I-CSCF
### 5.3.1 Registration procedure
#### 5.3.1.1 General
During the registration procedure the I-CSCF shall behave as a stateful proxy.
#### 5.3.1.2 Normal procedures
When the I-CSCF receives a REGISTER request, the I-CSCF shall verify whether
or not it has arrived from a trusted domain. If the request has not arrived
from a trusted domain, the I-CSCF shall complete the processing of the request
by responding with 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, the I-CSCF starts the
user registration status query procedure to the HSS as specified in 3GPP TS
29.228 [14].
NOTE 1: The I-CSCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
NOTE 2: Different UEs, each with its own private user identity, can register
the same shared public user identity. Registrations of all public user
identities belonging to these UEs are directed to the same S-CSCF as described
in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
If the REGISTER request does not include an Authorization header field and
private user identity, the I-CSCF shall derive the private user identity from
the public user identity being registered, contained in the To header field,
by removing URI scheme and the following parts of the URI if present: port
number, URI parameters, and To header field parameters.
Prior to performing the user registration query procedure to the HSS, the
I-CSCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a result of a query to the
Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14]. As a result of the query the I-CSCF gets the Redirect-Host AVP.
If the user registration status query response from the HSS includes a valid
SIP URI, the I-CSCF shall:
1) replace the Request-URI of the received REGISTER request with the SIP URI
received from the HSS in the Server-Name AVP;
2) optionally include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header field as defined in RFC 4457 [82]; and
3) forward the REGISTER request to the indicated S-CSCF.
NOTE 3: The P-User-Database header field can be included only if the I-CSCF
can assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will
be able to process the header field.
If the user registration status query response from the HSS includes a list of
capabilities, the I-CSCF shall:
1) select a S-CSCF that fulfils the indicated mandatory capabilities -- if
more than one S-CSCFs fulfils the indicated mandatory capabilities the S-CSCF
which fulfils most of the possibly additionally indicated optional
capabilities;
2) replace the Request-URI of the received REGISTER request with the URI of
the S-CSCF;
3) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header field as defined in RFC 4457 [82]; and
4) forward the REGISTER request to the selected S-CSCF.
NOTE 4: The P-User-Database header field can be included only if the I-CSCF
can assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will
be able to process the header field.
NOTE 5: It is important that the I-CSCF does not alter the Via header field
for requests and responses sent in the direction from the UE to the S-CSCF in
the case of GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication
When the I-CSCF receives a 2xx response to a REGISTER request, the I-CSCF
shall forward the 2xx response to the P-CSCF.
#### 5.3.1.3 Abnormal cases
In the case of SLF query, if the SLF does not send HSS address to the I-CSCF,
the I-CSCF shall send back a 403 (Forbidden) response to the UE.
If the HSS sends a negative response to the user registration status query
request, the I-CSCF shall send back a 403 (Forbidden) response.
If the user registration status query procedure cannot be completed, e.g. due
to time-out or incorrect information from the HSS, the I-CSCF shall send back
a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to the UE.
If a selected S-CSCF:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
I-CSCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
and:
\- the REGISTER request did not include an \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header field;
\- the REGISTER request did include an \"integrity-protected\" header field
parameter in the Authorization header field with a value set to \"no\" in the
Authorization header field;
\- the REGISTER request did include an \"integrity-protected\" header field
parameter in the Authorization header field with a value set to other than
\"no\" and the I-CSCF supports restoration procedures; or
\- the REGISTER request did not include an Authorization header field and the
I-CSCF supports restoration procedures;
then:
\- if the I-CSCF has received the list of capabilities from the HSS, the
I-CSCF shall select a new S-CSCF as described in subclause 5.3.1.2, based on
the capabilities indicated from the HSS. The newly selected S-CSCF shall not
be one of any S-CSCFs selected previously during this same registration
procedure; or
\- if the I-CSCF has received a valid SIP URI from the HSS because the S-CSCF
is already assigned to other UEs sharing the same public user identity, it
will request the list of capabilities from the HSS and, on receiving these
capabilities, the I-CSCF shall select a new S-CSCF as described in subclause
5.3.1.2, based on the capabilities indicated from the HSS. The newly selected
S-CSCF shall not be one of any S-CSCFs selected previously during this same
registration procedure.
NOTE 1: Checking for the inclusion of the Authorization header field is
necessary to prevent S-CSCF reselection in the case of GPRS-IMS-Bundled
authentication or NASS-IMS bundled authentication when no Authorization header
field is present in case I-CSCF does not support restoration procedures.
NOTE 2: In case the S-CSCF does not respond, the I-CSCF can apply a pre-
configured timer based on local policy before re-selecting a new S-CSCF.
If a selected S-CSCF does not respond to a REGISTER request and its
retransmissions by the I-CSCF and none of the conditions specified above in
this case are fulfilled, the I-CSCF shall send back a or 504 (Server Time-Out)
response to the user, in accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].
If the I-CSCF cannot select a S-CSCF which fulfils the mandatory capabilities
indicated by the HSS, the I-CSCF shall send back a 600 (Busy Everywhere)
response to the user.
### 5.3.2 Initial requests
#### 5.3.2.1 Normal procedures
The I-CSCF may behave as a stateful proxy for initial requests.
Upon receipt of a request, the I-CSCF shall perform the originating procedures
as described in subclause 5.3.2.1A if the topmost Route header field of the
request contains the \"orig\" parameter. Otherwise, the I-CSCF shall continue
with the rest of the procedures of this subclause.
When the I-CSCF receives a request, the I-CSCF shall verify whether it has
arrived from a trusted domain or not. If the request has arrived from a non
trusted domain, then the I-CSCF shall remove all P-Charging-Vector header
fields and all P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields the request may
contain.
NOTE 1: The I-CSCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the I-CSCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE 2: The special treatment can included filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
The I-CSCF shall discard the P-Profile-Key header field, if the I-CSCF
receives the P-Profile-Key header field in a SIP request or response.
When the I-CSCF receives, destined for a served user or a PSI, an initial
request for a dialog or standalone transaction the I-CSCF shall:
1) if the Request-URI includes:
a) a pres: or an im: URI, then translate the pres: or im: URI to a public user
identity and replace the Request-URI of the incoming request with that public
user identity; or
b) a SIP-URI that is not a GRUU and with the user part starting with a \+ and
the \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\" then replace the Request-URI
with a tel-URI with the user part of the SIP-URI in the telephone-subscriber
element in the tel-URI, and carry forward the tel-URI parameters that may be
present in the Request-URI; or
c) a SIP URI that is a GRUU, then obtain the public user identity from the
Request-URI and use it for location query procedure to the HSS. When
forwarding the request, the I-CSCF shall not modify the Request-URI of the
incoming request;
NOTE 3: SRV records have to be advertised in DNS pointing to the I-CSCF for
pres: and im: queries.
2) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field, if present; and
3) check if the domain name of the Request-URI matches with one of the PSI
subdomains configured in the I-CSCF. If the match is successful, the I-CSCF
resolves the Request-URI by an internal DNS mechanism into the IP address of
the AS hosting the PSI and does not start the user location query procedure.
Otherwise, the I-CSCF will start the user location query procedure to the HSS
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] for the called PSI or user, indicated in
or derived from the Request-URI. Prior to performing the user location query
procedure to the HSS, the I-CSCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a
result of a query to the Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
When the I-CSCF receives any response to such a request, the I-CSCF shall
store the value of the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field, if present.
NOTE 4: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the response was
sent.
When the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request, the I-CSCF may require the
periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the I-CSCF. If the
I-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, then the I-CSCF shall apply the
procedures described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 5: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
In case the I-CSCF is able to resolve the Request-URI into the IP address of
the AS hosting the PSI, then the I-CSCF shall:
1) store the value of the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in
the P-Charging-Vector header field and retain the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field. If no \"icid-value\" header
field parameter was found, then create a new, globally unique value for the
\"icid-value\" header field parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector
header field. The I-CSCF shall insert a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter in place of any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The
I-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to a value
that identifies the sending network of the request. The I-CSCF shall not
include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter;; and
2) forward the request directly to the AS hosting the PSI.
Upon successful user location query, when the response contains the URI of the
assigned S-CSCF, or the URI of an AS hosting the PSI, the I-CSCF shall:
1) insert the URI received from the HSS as the topmost Route header field;
2) store the value of the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in
the P-Charging-Vector header field and retain the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field. If no \"icid-value\" header
field parameter was found, then create a new, globally unique value for the
\"icid-value\" header field parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector
header field;
3) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header field as defined in RFC 4457 [82];
3A) if the Wildcarded Identity value is received from the HSS in the
Wildcarded-Identity AVP and the I-CSCF supports the SIP P-Profile-Key private
header extension, include the wildcarded identity value in the P-Profile-Key
header field as defined in RFC 5002 [97]; and
4) forward the request based on the topmost Route header field.
NOTE 6: The P-User-Database header field can be included only if the I-CSCF
can assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will
be able to process the header field.
Upon successful user location query, when the response contains information
about the required S-CSCF capabilities, the I-CSCF shall:
1) if overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITEs method is supported as a
network option, and if the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request outside an
existing dialog with the same Call ID and From header as a previous INVITE
request during a certain period of time, route the new INVITE to the same next
hop as the previous INVITE request; otherwise
2) select a S-CSCF according to the method described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14];
3) insert the URI of the selected S-CSCF as the topmost Route header field
value;
4) execute the procedure described in step 2 and 3 in the above paragraph
(upon successful user location query, when the response contains the URI of
the assigned S-CSCF);
5) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header field as defined in RFC 4457 [82];
6) if the Wildcarded Identity value is received from the HSS in the
Wildcarded-Identity AVP and the I-CSCF supports the the SIP P-Profile-Key
private header extension, include the wildcarded identity value in the
P-Profile-Key header field as defined in RFC 5002 [97]; and
NOTE 7: A Wildcarded Identity can be either a PSI or a public user identity.
7) forward the request to the selected S-CSCF.
NOTE 8: The P-User-Database header field can be included only if the I-CSCF
can assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will
be able to process the header field.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query when the response from the HSS
indicates that the user does not exist, and if the Request-URI is a tel URI
containing a public telecommunications number as specified in RFC 3966 [22],
the I-CSCF may support a local configuration option that indicates whether or
not request routeing is to be attempted. If the local configuration option
indicates that request routeing is to be attempted, then the I-CSCF shall
perform one of the following procedures based on local operator policy:
1) forward the request to the transit functionality for subsequent routeing;
or
2) invoke the portion of the transit functionality that translates the public
telecommunications number contained in the Request-URI to a routeable SIP URI,
and process the request based on the result, as follows:
a) if the translation fails, the request may be forwarded to a BGCF or any
other appropriate entity (e.g. a MRFC to play an announcement) in the home
network, or the I-CSCF may send an appropriate SIP response to the originator,
such as 404 (Not Found) or 604 (Does not exist anywhere). When forwarding the
request to a BGCF or any other appropriate entity, the I-CSCF shall leave the
original Request-URI containing the tel URI unmodified:
i) if overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITEs method is supported as a
network option, and if the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request outside an
existing dialog with the same Call ID and From header as a previous INVITE
request during a certain period of time, the I-CSCF shall route the new INVITE
to the same next hop as the previous INVITE request; and
ii) additional procedures apply if the I-CSCF supports NP capabilities and
these capabilities are enabled by local policy, and the database used for
translation from an international public telecommunications number to a SIP
URI also provides NP data (for example, based on the PSTN Enumservice as
defined by RFC 4769 [114] or other appropriate data bases). If the above
translation from an international public telecommunications number to a SIP
URI failed, but NP data was obtained from the database, then the I-CSCF shall
update the tel-URI in the Request-URI with the obtained NP data, prior to
forwarding the request to the BGCF or other appropriate entity. The URI is
updated by the I-CSCF by adding the NP parameters defined by RFC 4694 [112] to
the tel-URI in the Request-URI: an \"npdi\" tel-URI parameter is added to
indicate that NP data retrieval has been performed, and if the number is
ported, an \"rn\" tel-URI parameter is added to identify the ported-to
routeing number. The I-CSCF shall perform these procedures if the tel-URI in
the received Request-URI does not contain an \"npdi\" tel-URI parameter. In
addition, the I-CSCF may, based on local policy, perform these procedures when
the tel-URI in the received Request-URI contains an \"npdi\" tel-URI parameter
indicating that the NP data has been previously obtained; or
NOTE 9: The I-CSCF might need to update NP data added by a previous network if
the previous network\'s NP database did not contain the local ported data for
the called number.
b) if this translation succeeds, then replace the Request-URI with the
routeable SIP URI and process the request as follows:
\- determine the destination address (e.g. DNS access) using the URI placed in
the topmost Route header field if present, otherwise based on the Request-URI.
If the destination requires interconnect functionalities (e.g. the destination
address is of an IP address type other than the IP address type used in the IM
CN subsystem), the I-CSCF shall forward the request to the destination address
via an IBCF in the same network;
\- if network hiding is needed due to local policy, put the address of the
IBCF to the topmost Route header field;
\- route the request based on SIP routeing procedures; and
\- if overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITE method is supported as a
network option, and if the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request outside an
existing dialog with the same Call ID and From header as a previous INVITE
request during a certain period of time, route the new INVITE to the same next
hop as the previous INVITE request.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query when the response from the HSS
indicates that the user does not exist, and if local operator policy does not
indicate that request routeing is to be attempted, then, the I-CSCF shall
return an appropriate unsuccessful SIP response. This response may be a 404
(Not found) or 604 (Does not exist anywhere) in the case the user is not a
user of the home network.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query when the response from the HSS
indicates that the user is not registered and no services are provided for
such a user, the I-CSCF shall return an appropriate unsuccessful SIP response.
This response may be a 480 (Temporarily unavailable) response if the user is
recognized as a valid user, but is not registered at the moment and it does
not have services for unregistered users.
When the I-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction, that contains a single Route header field pointing to itself, the
I-CSCF shall determine from the entry in the Route header field whether it
needs to do HSS query. In case HSS query not is needed, then the I-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field; and
2) route the request based on the Request-URI.
When the I-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction containing more than one Route header field, the I-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field; and
2) forward the request based on the topmost Route header field.
NOTE 10: In accordance with SIP the I-CSCF can add its own routeable SIP URI
to the top of the Record-Route header field to any request, independently of
whether it is an initial request. The P-CSCF will ignore any Record-Route
header field that is not in the initial request of a dialog.
When the I-CSCF receives a response to an initial request (e.g. 183 (Session
Progress) response or 2xx response), the I-CSCF shall store the values from
the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field, if present. If the next hop is
outside of the current network, then the I-CSCF shall remove the P-Charging-
Function-Addresses header field prior to forwarding the message.
When the I-CSCF, upon sending an initial INVITE request to the S-CSCF,
receives a 305 (Use Proxy) response from the S-CSCF, the I-CSCF shall forward
the initial INVITE request to the SIP URI indicated in the Contact field of
the 305 (Use Proxy) response, as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
#### 5.3.2.1A Originating procedures for requests containing the \"orig\"
parameter
The procedures of this subclause apply for requests received at the I-CSCF
when the topmost Route header field of the request contains the \"orig\"
parameter.
The I-CSCF shall verify for all requests whether they arrived from a trusted
domain or not. If the request arrived from a non trusted domain, then the
I-CSCF shall respond with 403 (Forbidden) response.
If the request arrived from a trusted domain, the I-CSCF shall perform the
procedures below.
NOTE 1: The I-CSCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the I-CSCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE 2 The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
When the I-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction the I-CSCF will start the user location query procedure to the HSS
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] for the calling user, indicated in either:
1) the P-Served-User header field, if included in the request; or
2) the P-Asserted-Identity header field, if the P-Served-User header field is
not included in the request.
Prior to performing the user location query procedure to the HSS, the I-CSCF
decides which HSS to query, possibly as a result of a query to the
Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14].
When the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request, the I-CSCF may require the
periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the I-CSCF. If the
I-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, the I-CSCF shall apply the
procedures described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 3: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
If the I-CSCF receives the P-Profile-Key header field in a SIP request or
response the I-CSCF shall discard the P-Profile-Key header field.
When the response for user location query contains information about the
required S-CSCF capabilities, the I-CSCF shall select an S-CSCF according to
the method described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
If the user location query was successful, the I-CSCF shall:
1) insert the URI of an AS hosting the PSI, or the URI of the S-CSCF - either
received from the HSS, or selected by the I-CSCF based on capabilities - as
the topmost Route header field appending the \"orig\" parameter to the URI of
the S-CSCF;
2) store the value of the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in
the P-Charging-Vector header field and retain the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field. If no \"icid-value\" header
field parameter was found, then create a new, globally unique value for the
\"icid-value\" header field parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector
header field;
3) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header field as defined in draft-camarillo-sipping-user-database
[82];
4) if a wildcarded user value is received from the HSS in the Wildcarded-
Identity AVP and the I-CSCF supports the SIP P-Profile-Key private header
extension, include the wildcarded identity value in the P-Profile-Key header
field as defined in RFC 5002 [97]; and
5) forward the request based on the topmost Route header field.
NOTE 4: The P-User-Database header field can be included only if the I-CSCF
can assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will
be able to process the header field.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query, the I-CSCF shall return an
appropriate unsuccessful SIP response. This response may be a 404 (Not found)
response or 604 (Does not exist anywhere) response in the case the user is not
a user of the home network.
When the I-CSCF receives any response to the above request, and forwards it to
AS, the I-CSCF shall:
\- store the values from the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field, if
present. If the next hop is outside of the current network, then the I-CSCF
shall remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field prior to
forwarding the message; and
\- insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the type 3 \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter, if received in the request, and a type 3 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter in the response. The I-CSCF shall set the type 3
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending
network of the response and the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is
set to the previously received value of type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter.
#### 5.3.2.2 Abnormal cases
In the case of SLF query, if the SLF does not send HSS address to the I-CSCF,
the I-CSCF shall send back a 404 (Not Found) response to the UE.
Upon successful user location query, when the response contains the URI of the
assigned S-CSCF, if the Iâ€‘CSCF is unable to contact the assigned S-CSCF, as
determined by one of the following:
\- the S-CSCF does not respond to the service request and its retransmissions
by the I-CSCF; or
\- by unspecified means available to the I-CSCF;
and:
\- the I-CSCF supports restoration procedures;
then:
\- the I-CSCF shall explicitly request the list of capabilities from the HSS
and, on receiving these capabilities, the I-CSCF shall select a new S-CSCF,
based on the capabilities indicated from the HSS. The newly selected S-CSCF
shall not be one of any S-CSCFs selected previously during this same
terminating procedure. Re-selection shall be performed until SIP transaction
timer expires as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 1: These procedures do not prevent the usage of unspecified reliability
or recovery techniques above and beyond those specified in this subclause.
Upon successful user location query, when the response contains information
about the required S-CSCF capabilities, if the I-CSCF is unable to contact a
selected S-CSCF, as determined by one of the following:
\- the S-CSCF does not respond to the service request and its retransmissions
by the I-CSCF; or
\- by unspecified means available to the I-CSCF;
then:
\- the I-CSCF shall select a new S-CSCF, based on the capabilities indicated
from the HSS. The newly selected Sâ€‘CSCF shall not be one of any S-CSCFs
selected previously during this same terminating procedure. Re-selection shall
be performed until SIP transaction timer expires as specified in RFC 3261
[26].
NOTE 2: These procedures do not prevent the usage of unspecified reliability
or recovery techniques above and beyond those specified in this subclause.
If the I-CSCF receives a negative response to the user location query, the
I-CSCF shall send back a 404 (Not Found) response.
If the I-CSCF receives a CANCEL request and if the I-CSCF finds an internal
state indicating a pending Cx transaction with the HSS, the I-CSCF:
\- shall answer the CANCEL request with a 200 (OK) response; and
\- shall answer the original request with a 487 (Request Terminated) response.
NOTE 3: The I-CSCF will discard any later arriving (pending) Cx answer message
from the HSS.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) response, the I-CSCF may recurse on a
3xx response only when the domain part of the URI contained in the 3xx
response is in the same domain as the I-CSCF. For the same cases, if the URI
is an IP address, the I-CSCF shall only recurse if the IP address is known
locally to be a address that represents the same domain as the I-CSCF.

## 5.4 Procedures at the S-CSCF
### 5.4.0 General
Where the S CSCF provides emergency call support, the procedures of subclause
5.4.8 shall be applied first.
### 5.4.1 Registration and authentication
#### 5.4.1.1 Introduction
The S-CSCF shall determine which authentication mechanism applies based on the
contents of the REGISTER request and the authentication mechanism assigned in
the HSS:
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field with the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter set to \"no\", the S-CSCF shall
perform the initial registration procedures with IMS-AKA authentication
described in subclauses 5.4.1.2.1 and 5.4.1.2.1A;
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field with the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter set to \"yes\", the S-CSCF
shall perform the protected registration procedures with IMS-AKA as a security
mechanism as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2;
\- if the REGISTER request does not contain an Authorization header field and
the access type field in the P-Access-Network-Info header field indicated xDSL
or Ethernet access and containing the \"network provided\" header field
parameter, then S-CSCF shall perform the initial registration procedures with
NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a security mechanism as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.1D;
\- if the REGISTER request does not contain an Authorization header field and
the P-Access-Network-Info header field indicates it is received from a 3GPP
access and containing the \"network provided\" header field parameter, the
S-CSCF shall perform the initial registration procedures with GPRS-IMS-Bundled
authentication described in subclause 5.4.1.2.1E;
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field without an
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter, the S-CSCF shall send an
authentication request for the user to the HSS indicating that the
authentication scheme is unknown as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]:
\- if the HSS responds with an authentication scheme of NASS-IMS bundled
authentication and the request was received from a P-CSCF is in the home
network and the P-CSCF is \"TISPAN-enabled\", then the S-CSCF shall perform
the initial registration procedures with NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a
security mechanism as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.1D; or
\- if the HSS responds with an authentication scheme of SIP digest, then the
S-CSCF shall perform the initial registration procedures with SIPdigest as a
security mechanism as described in subclauses 5.4.1.2.1 and 5.4.1.2.1B;
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field with the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter set to \"tls-pending\", \"tls-
yes\", \"ip-assoc-pending\" or \"ip-assoc-yes\", the S-CSCF shall perform the
protected registration procedures for SIP digest described in subclause
5.4.1.2.2A; and
\- if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field with the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter set to \"auth-done\", the
S-CSCF shall perform the protected registration procedures described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.2E.
NOTE 1: The S-CSCF needs to be configured to know which P-CSCFs are \"TISPAN-
enabled\" and uses the Via header field to determine which P-CSCF forwarded
the registration request.
The S-CSCF shall act as the SIP registrar for all UAs belonging to the IM CN
subsystem and with public user identities.
Subclause 5.4.1.2 through subclause 5.4.1.7 define S-CSCF procedures for SIP
registration that do not relate to emergency. All registration requests are
first screened according to the procedures of subclause 5.4.8.2 to see if they
do relate to an emergency registration.
For all SIP registrations identified:
\- as relating to an emergency; or
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field;
the S-CSCF shall give priority over other registrations. This allows special
treatment of such registrations.
NOTE 2: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
The S-CSCF shall support the use of the Path and Service-Route header field.
The S-CSCF shall also support the Require and Supported header fields. The
Path header field is only applicable to the REGISTER request and its 200 (OK)
response. The Service-Route header field is only applicable to the 200 (OK)
response of REGISTER. The S-CSCF shall not act as a redirect server for
REGISTER requests.
The network operator defines minimum and maximum times for each registration.
These values are provided within the S-CSCF.
The procedures for notification concerning automatically registered public
user identities of a user are described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT, the S-CSCF may need to modify the SIP signalling
according to the procedures described in annex K if both a \"reg-id\" and
\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter are present in the received Contact
header field as described in RFC 5626 [92].
#### 5.4.1.2 Initial registration and user-initiated reregistration
##### 5.4.1.2.1 Unprotected REGISTER
Any REGISTER request sent unprotected by the UE with an Authorization header
field and with the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header field set to \"no\", or without an \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter is considered to be an initial
registration. If such an initial registration contains a private user identity
specifically reserved for IM CN subsystem registrations from an MSC Server
enhanced for ICS as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], the S-CSCF shall respond
with a 403 (Forbidden) response. The Sâ€‘CSCF shall consider this registration
attempt as failed..
NOTE 1: For NASS-IMS bundled authentication and GPRS-IMS-Bundled
Authentication there is no distinction between a protected and an unprotected
REGISTER. There is only an unprotected REGISTER to consider.
NOTE 2: If IMS AKA or SIP digest with TLS are used as a security mechanism, a
200 (OK) final response to an initial registration will only be sent back
after the S-CSCF receives a correct authentication challenge response in a
REGISTER request that is sent integrity protected.
NOTE 3: A REGISTER with the registration expiration interval value equal to
zero will always be received protected. However, it is possible that in error
conditions a REGISTER with the registration expiration interval value equal to
zero can be received unprotected. In that instance the procedures below will
be applied.
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request that is part of an initial registration as
outlined above, for a user identity linked to a private user identity and
instance ID/reg-id if available, that has previously registered one or more
public user identities, the S-CSCF shall:
1) perform the procedure below in this subclause for receipt of a REGISTER
request for a public user identity which is not already registered, for the
received public user identity;
2) if the multiple registrations is not used and if the authentication that in
step 1) has been successful, and there are public user identities (including
the public user identity being registered, if previously registered) that
belong to this user that have been previously registered with the same private
user identity, and with an old contact address different from the one received
in the REGISTER request, and the previous registrations have not expired, the
S-CSCF shall perform the network initiated deregistration procedure (as
described in subclause 5.4.1.5) for the previously registered public user
identities belonging to this user including the public user identity being
registered, if previously registered; and
3) if the multiple registrations is used (i.e., the \"reg-id\" header field
parameter is included in the REGISTER request) and if the authentication that
concludes the initial registration has been successful, and if the public user
identity being registered has been previously registered with the same private
user identity and the same \"+sip.instance\" and \"reg-id\" header field
parameter values, and the previous registration has not expired, then the
S-CSCF shall:
a) identify the registration flow being replaced;
b) terminate any dialog, as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2, associated with
the registration flow being replaced; and
c) send a NOTIFY request to the subscribers to the registration event package
for the public user identity indicated in the REGISTER request, as described
in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
NOTE 4: The way the S-CSCF identifies the dialogs associated with the
registration flow being replaced is implementation specific.
NOTE 5: The S-CSCF will inform the HSS that the previously registered public
user identities, excluding the public user identity being registered, have
been deregistered.
NOTE 6: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. S-CSCF is
not able deregister contact related to emergency registration and will not
delete that.
When S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\"
header field parameter in the Authorization header field set to \"no\" and a
non-empty \"response\" Authorization header field parameter, the S-CSCF shall
ignore the value of the \"response\" header field parameter.
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request that is part of an initial registration as
outlined above, for a public user identity which is not already registered
linked to the same private user identity and the \"+sip.instance\" and \"reg-
id\" header field parameters, if available, the S-CSCF shall:
1) identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To header
field and the private user identity as received in the \"username\"
Authorization header field parameter of the REGISTER request;
2) check if the P-Visited-Network-ID header field is included in the REGISTER
request, and if it is included identify the visited network by the value of
this header field;
3) select an authentication vector for the user. If no authentication vector
for this user is available, after the S-CSCF has performed the Authentication
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the S-CSCF shall
select an authentication vector as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
Prior to performing Authentication procedure with the HSS, the S-CSCF decides
which HSS to query, possibly as a result of a query to the Subscription
Locator Functional (SLF) entity as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or use the
value as received in the P-User-Database header field in the REGISTER request
as defined in RFC 4457 [82];
NOTE 7: The HSS address received in the response to SLF query or as a value of
P-User-Database header field can be used to address the HSS of the public user
identity in further queries.
NOTE 8: At this point the S-CSCF informs the HSS, that the user currently
registering will be served by the S-CSCF by passing its SIP URI to the HSS.
This will be used by the HSS to direct all subsequent incoming initial
requests for a dialog or standalone transactions destined for this user to
this S-CSCF.
NOTE 9: When passing its SIP URI to the HSS, the S-CSCF may include in its SIP
URI the transport protocol and the port number where it wants to be contacted.
4) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field;
5) challenge the user by generating a 401 (Unauthorized) response for the
received REGISTER request appropriate to the security mechanism in use;
6) send the so generated 401 (Unauthorized) response towards the UE, and if
the URI in the first Path header field has an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter,
include a Require header field with the option-tag \"outbound\" as described
in RFC 5626 [92]; and,
7) start timer reg-await-auth which guards the receipt of the next REGISTER
request.
If the received REGISTER request indicates that the challenge sent previously
by the S-CSCF to the UE was deemed to be invalid by the UE, the S-CSCF shall
stop the timer reg-await-auth and proceed as described in the subclause
5.4.1.2.3.
##### 5.4.1.2.1A Challenge with IMS AKA as security mechanism
On sending a 401 (Unauthorized) response to an unprotected REGISTER request,
the S-CSCF shall populate the header fields as follows:
1) a WWW-Authenticate header field which transports:
\- a globally unique name of the S-CSCF in the \"realm\" header field
parameter;
\- the RAND and AUTN parameters and optional server specific data for the UE
in the \"nonce\" header field parameter;
\- the security mechanism, which is \"AKAv1-MD5\", in the \"algorithm\" header
field parameter;
\- the IK (Integrity Key) parameter for the P-CSCF in the \"ik\" header field
parameter (see subclause 7.2A.1); and
\- the CK (Cipher Key) parameter for the P-CSCF in the \"ck\" header field
parameter (see subclause 7.2A.1).
The S-CSCF shall store the RAND parameter used in the 401 (Unathorized)
response for future use in case of a resynchronisation. If a stored RAND
already exists in the S-CSCF, the S-CSCF shall overwrite the stored RAND with
the RAND used in the most recent 401 (Unauthorized) response.
##### 5.4.1.2.1B Challenge with SIP digest as security mechanism
On sending a 401 (Unauthorized) response to an unprotected REGISTER request,
the S-CSCF shall populate the header fields as follows:
1) a WWW-Authenticate header field as defined in RFC 2617 [21], which
transports:
\- a protection domain in the \"realm\" header field parameter;
\- a \"nonce\" header field parameter (generated by the S-CSCF);
\- an \"algorithm\" header field parameter; if the algorithm value is not
provided in the authentication vector, it shall have the value \"MD5\"; and
\- a \"qop\" header field parameter; if the qop value is not provided in the
authentication vector, it shall contain the value \"auth\".
##### 5.4.1.2.1C Challenge with SIP digest with TLS as security mechanism
The procedures for subclause 5.4.1.2.1B apply.
NOTE: The S-CSCF is not able to distinguish between SIP Digest with TLS and
SIP Digest without TLS for the case of an unprotected REGISTER request,
therefore the procedures are the same for both.
##### 5.4.1.2.1D Initial registration and user-initiated reregistration for
NASS-IMS bundled authentication
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request that is determined to be NASS-IMS bundled
authentication, for a user identity linked to a private user identity that has
a registered public user identity but with a new contact address, the S-CSCF
shall:
1) perform the procedure for receipt of a REGISTER request without the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header
field or without the Authorization header field, for the received public user
identity; and
2) if the Contact header field of the REGISTER request does not contain a
\"reg-id\" header field parameter (i.e., the multiple registrations mechanism
is not used), and the authentication has been successful, and there are public
user identities (including the public user identity being registered, if
previously registered) belonging to this user that have been previously
registered with the same private user identity and with an old contact address
different from the one received in the REGISTER request and if the previous
registration have not expired:
a) terminate all dialogs, if any, associated with the previously registered
public user identities (including the public user identity being registered,
if previously registered), as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2;
b) send a NOTIFY request, to the subscribers to the registration event package
of the previously registered public user identities, that indicates that all
previously registered public user identities (excluding the public user
identity being registered) belonging to this user identified with its private
user identity, have been deregistered, as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
For the public user identity being registered, the NOTIFY request contains the
new contact information; and
NOTE 1: The last dialog to be terminated will be the dialog established by the
UE subscribing to the reg event package. When sending the NOTIFY request to
the UE over this dialog, the S-CSCF will terminate this dialog by setting in
the NOTIFY request the Subscription-State header field to the value of
\"terminated\".
c) delete all information associated with the previously registered public
user identities.
NOTE 2: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. The S-CSCF
is not able to deregister contact related to emergency registration and will
not delete it.
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request without the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header field or without an Authorization
header field, which is not for an already registered public user identity
linked to the same private user identity, the S-CSCF shall:
1) identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To header
field of the REGISTER request and if the Authorization header field is
present, the private user identity as received in the Authorization header
field of the REGISTER request. If the Authorization header field is not
present, the S-CSCF shall derive the private user identity from the public
user identity being registered by removing SIP URI scheme and the following
parts of the SIP URI if present: port number, URI parameters, and To header
field parameters.
2) check whether one or more Line-Identifiers previously received over the Cx
interface, and stored as a result of a Authentication procedure with the HSS,
are available for the user. If not, the S-CSCF performs the Authentication
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], in order to
obtain these Line-Identifiers.
3) In the particular case where the S-CSCF received via the Cx interface one
or more Line-Identifiers, compare each of the \"dsl-location\" parameter of
the P-Access-Network-Info header field (if present and if it includes the
\"network-provided\" parameter),
\- if one of these match, the user is considered authenticated and the S-CSCF
behave as described in step 5) to 11) of subclause 5.4.1.2.2,
\- otherwise i.e. if these do not match the S-CSCF shall return a 403
(Forbidden) response to the REGISTER request; and
4) if no Line-Identifier is received over the Cx interface, send a 500 (Server
Internal Error) response to the REGISTER request.
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request without the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header field or without an Authorization
header field, for an already registered public user identity linked to the
same private user identity, and for existing contact information, the S-CSCF
shall behave as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2F.
##### 5.4.1.2.1E Initial registration and user-initiated reregistration for
GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request without an Authorization header field, the
S-CSCF shall:
1) identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To header
field of the REGISTER request. The S-CSCF shall derive the private user
identity from the public user identity being registered by removing URI scheme
and the following parts of the URI if present: port number, URI parameters,
and To header field parameters.
2) check if the P-Visited-Network-ID header field is included in the REGISTER
request, and if it is included identify the visited network by the value of
this header field.
3) check whether an IP address is stored for this UE. If no IP address (or
prefix) is stored for the UE, query the HSS as described in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14] with the derived private user identity and the public user identity as
input and store the received IP address (or prefix) of the UE; if the S-CSCF
receives a prefix from the HSS, it will only check against prefixes otherwise
it will check against the full IP address.
NOTE 1: At this point the S-CSCF informs the HSS, that the user currently
registering will be served by the Sâ€‘CSCF by passing its SIP URI to the HSS.
This will be indicated by the HSS for all further incoming requests to this
user, in order to direct all these requests directly to this S-CSCF.
4) check whether a \"received\" header field parameter exists in the Via
header field provided by the UE. If a \"received\" header field parameter
exists, the S-CSCF shall compare the IP address recorded in the \"received\"
header field parameter against the UE\'s IP address stored during
registration. In case of IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration, the S-CSCF shall
compare the prefix of the IP address recorded in the \"received\" header field
parameter against the UE\'s IP address prefix stored during registration. If
no \"received\" header field parameter exists in the Via header field provided
by the UE, then the S-CSCF shall compare IP address recorded in the \"sent-
by\" parameter against the stored UE IP address. In case of IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration, S-CSCF shall compare the prefix of the IP address recorded
in the \"sent-by\" parameter against the UE\'s IP address prefix stored during
registration. In any case, if the stored IP address (or prefix) and the
(prefix of the) IP address recorded in the Via header field provided by the UE
do not match, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall query the HSS as described in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14] with the derived private user identity and the public user identity as
input and store the received IP address (or prefix) of the UE. If the stored
IP address (or prefix) and the (prefix of the) IP address recorded in the Via
header field provided by the UE still do not match the S-CSCF shall reject the
registration with a 403 (Forbidden) response and skip the following steps.
5) after performing the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration notification
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], store the
following information in the local data:
a) the list of public user identities, including the registered own public
user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities and wildcarded public user identities due to the received REGISTER
request. Each public user identity is identified as either barred or non-
barred;
b) all the service profile(s) corresponding to the public user identities
being registered (explicitly or implicitly), including initial Filter Criteria
(the initial Filter Criteria for the Registered and common parts is stored and
the unregistered part is retained for possible use later - in the case the
S-CSCF is retained if the user becomes unregistered); and
c) if restoration procedures are supported, the restoration information if
received as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14];
NOTE 2: There might be more than one set of initial Filter Criteria received
because some implicitly registered public user identities that are part of the
same implicit registration set belong to different service profiles.
6) update registration bindings as follows:
a) bind to each non-barred registered public user identity all registered
contact information including all header field parameters contained in the
Contact header field and all associated URI parameters with the exception of
the \"pub-gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" header field parameters as specified in RFC
5627 [93], and store information for future use; and
b) for each binding that contains a \"+sip.instance\" Contact header field
parameter, assign a new temporary GRUU, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.3;
NOTE 3: There might be more than one contact information available for one
public user identity.
NOTE 4: The barred public user identities are not bound to the contact
information.
7) check whether a Path header field was included in the REGISTER request and
construct a list of preloaded Route header fields from the list of entries in
the received Path header field. The S-CSCF shall preserve the order of the
preloaded Route header fields and bind them either to the contact address of
the UE or to the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) and the contact information that was
received in the REGISTER request;
NOTE 5: If this registration is a reregistration or an initial registration
(i.e., there are previously registered public user identities belonging to the
user that have not been deregistered or expired), then a list of pre-loaded
Route header fields will already exist. If multiple registration mechanism was
not used, then the existing list of pre-loaded Route header fields is bound to
a respective contact address of the UE. However, if multiple registration
mechanism was used, then the existing list of pre-loaded Route header fields
is bound to a registration flow and the associated contact address that was
used to send the REGISTER request. In either case, the new list replaces the
old list.
8) determine the duration of the registration by checking the registration
expiration interval value in the received REGISTER request and bind it either
to the respective contact address of the UE or to the registration flow and
the associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used). The S-CSCF may reduce the duration of the registration due to local
policy or send back a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response specifying the minimum
allowed time for registration;
9) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field;
10) create and send a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request as specified
in subclause 5.4.1.2.2F.
When a user de-registers, or is de-registered by the HSS, the S-CSCF shall
delete the IP address stored for the UE.
##### 5.4.1.2.2 Protected REGISTER with IMS AKA as a security mechanism
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header field set to \"yes\", the S-CSCF
shall identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To
header field and the private user identity as received in the Authorization
header field of the REGISTER request, and:
In the case that there is no authentication currently ongoing for this user
(i.e. no timer reg-await-auth is running):
1) check if the user needs to be reauthenticated.
> The S-CSCF may require authentication of the user for any REGISTER request,
> and shall always require authentication for REGISTER requests received
> without the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
> Authorization header field set to \"yes\".
>
> If the user needs to be reauthenticated, the S-CSCF shall proceed with the
> procedures as described for the unprotected REGISTER in subclause 5.4.1.2.1,
> beginning with step 3). If the user does not need to be reauthenticated, the
> S-CSCF shall proceed with the following steps in this paragraph;
2) check whether a registration expiration interval value is included in the
REGISTER request and its value. If the registration expiration interval value
indicates a zero value, the S-CSCF shall perform the deregistration procedures
as described in subclause 5.4.1.4. If the registration expiration interval
value does not indicate zero, the S-CSCF shall:
\- if the REGISTER request does not contain a \"reg-id\" header field
parameter and the contact address indicated in the Contact header field was
not previously registered, send a 403 (Forbidden) response to the UE; and
NOTE 1: New contact address is always registered via an initial registration.
3) check whether the public user identity received in the To header field is
already registered. If it is not registered, the S-CSCF shall proceed
beginning with step 4B below. Otherwise, the S-CSCF shall:
\- send a 439 (First Hop Lacks Outbound Support) response to the UE, if the
REGISTER request contains the \"reg-id\" Contact header field parameter and
the \"outbound\" option tag in a Supported header field, but the first URI in
the Path header field does not have an \"ob\" URI parameter; or
\- otherwise proceed beginning with step 6 below.
In the case that a timer reg-await-auth is running for this user the S-CSCF
shall:
1) check if the Call-ID of the request matches with the Call-ID of the 401
(Unauthorized) response which carried the last challenge. The S-CSCF shall
only proceed further if the Call-IDs match.
2) stop timer reg-await-auth;
3) check whether an Authorization header field is included, containing:
a) the private user identity of the user in the \"username\" header field
parameter;
b) the algorithm which is \"AKAv1-MD5\" in the \"algorithm\" header field
parameter; and
c) the authentication challenge response needed for the authentication
procedure in the \"response\" header field parameter.
> The S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps in this paragraph if
> the authentication challenge response was included;
4) check whether the received authentication challenge response and the
expected authentication challenge response (calculated by the S-CSCF using
XRES and other parameters as described in RFC 3310 [49]) match. The XRES
parameter was received from the HSS as part of the Authentication Vector. The
S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps if the challenge response
received from the UE and the expected response calculated by the S-CSCF match;
4A) if the Contact header field of the REGISTER request does not contain a
\"reg-id\" header field parameter (i.e., the multiple registrations mechanism
is not used), and there are public user identities (including the public user
identity being registered, if previously registered) that belong to this user
that have been previously registered with the same private user identity, and
with an old contact address different from the one received in the REGISTER
request and if the previous registrations have not expired:
a) terminate all dialogs, associated with the previously registered public
user identities (including the public user identity being registered, if
previously registered), as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2;
b) send a NOTIFY request, to the subscribers to the registration event package
of the previously registered public user identities, that indicates that all
previously registered public user identities (excluding the public user
identity being registered) belonging to this user identified with its private
user identity, have been deregistered, as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
For the public user identity being registered, the NOTIFY request contains the
new contact information; and
NOTE 2: The last dialog to be terminated will be the dialog established by the
UE subscribing to the reg event package. When sending the NOTIFY request to
the UE over this dialog, the S-CSCF will terminate this dialog by setting in
the NOTIFY request the Subscription-State header field to the value of
\"terminated\".
c) delete all information associated with the previously registered public
user identities;
NOTE 3: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. The S-CSCF
is not able to deregister contact related to emergency registration and will
not delete it.
4B) if the REGISTER request contains the \"reg-id\" Contact header field
parameter and the \"outbound\" option tag in a Supported header field, but the
first URI in the Path header field does not have an \"ob\" URI parameter, send
a 439 (First Hop Lacks Outbound Support) response to the UE;
5) after performing the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration notification
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], store the
following information in the local data:
a) the list of public user identities, including the registered own public
user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities and wildcarded public user identities due to the received REGISTER
request. Each public user identity is identified as either barred or non-
barred;
b) all the service profile(s) corresponding to the public user identities
being registered (explicitly or implicitly), including initial Filter
Criteria(the initial Filter Criteria for the Registered and common parts is
stored and the unregistered part is retained for possible use later - in the
case of the S-CSCF is retained if the user becomes unregistered); and
c) if restoration procedures are supported, the restoration information if
received as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14];
NOTE 4: There might be more than one set of initial Filter Criteria received
because some implicitly registered public user identities that are part of the
same implicit registration set belong to different service profiles.
6) update registration bindings:
a) bind to each non-barred registered public user identity all registered
contact information including all header field parameters contained in the
Contact header field and all associated SIP URI parameters, with the exception
of the \"pub-gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" header field parameters as specified in
RFC 5627 [93], and store information for future use;
b) for each binding that contains a \"+sip.instance\" Contact header field
parameter, assign a new temporary GRUU, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.3;
c) if the Contact header field of the REGISTER request contained a
\"+sip.instance\" and a \"reg-id\" header field parameter, and the SIP URI in
the Path header field inserted by the P-CSCF contained an \"ob\" SIP URI
parameter header field, and:
\- if the public user identity has not previously been registered with the
same \"+sip.instance\" and \"reg-id\" header field parameter values, then the
registration flow being created shall be in addition to any existing
registration flows; or
\- if the public user identity has previously been registered with its
\"+sip.instance\" and \"reg-id\" values, then the S-CSCF shall determine
whether the request refreshes or replaces an existing registration flow. If
the request:
i) refreshes an existing registration flow, then the S-CSCF shall leave the
flow intact; or
ii) replaces the existing registration flow with a new flow, then the S-CSCF
shall:
a) terminate any dialog, as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2, associated with
the registration flow being replaced; and
b) send a NOTIFY request to the subscribers to the registration event package
for the public user identity indicated in the REGISTER request, as described
in subclause 5.4.2.1.2;
NOTE 5: The S-CSCF determines whether this REGISTER request replaces or
refreshes an existing registration flow by examining the SIP URI in the Path
header field inserted into the request by the P-CSCF (see subclause 5.2.2.1).
NOTE 6: The way the S-CSCF identifies the dialogs associated with the
registration flow being replaced is implementation specific.
NOTE 7: There might be more then one contact information available for one
public user identity.
NOTE 8: The barred public user identities are not bound to the contact
information.
NOTE 9: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. S-CSCF is
not able deregister contact related to emergency registration and will not
delete that.
7) check whether a Path header field was included in the REGISTER request and
construct a list of preloaded Route header fields from the list of entries in
the received Path header field. The S-CSCF shall preserve the order of the
preloaded Route header fields and bind them either to the contact address of
the UE or to the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) and the contact information that was
received in the REGISTER request;
NOTE 10: If this registration is a reregistration or an initial registration
(i.e., there are previously registered public user identities belonging to the
user that have not been deregistered or expired), then a list of pre-loaded
Route header fields will already exist. If multiple registration mechanism was
not used, then the existing list of pre-loaded Route header fields is bound to
a respective contact address of the UE. However, if multiple registration
mechanism was used, then the existing list of pre-loaded Route header fields
is bound to a registration flow and the associated contact address that was
used to send the REGISTER request. In either case, the new list replaces the
old list.
8) determine the duration of the registration by checking the value of the
registration expiration interval value in the received REGISTER request and
bind it either to the respective contact address of the UE or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used). The S-CSCF may reduce the duration of the
registration due to local policy or send back a 423 (Interval Too Brief)
response specifying the minimum allowed time for registration;
9) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field;
10) if an \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter; and
NOTE 11: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 1
IOI. The type 1 IOI identifies the network from which the request was sent.
11) create and send a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request as specified
in subclause 5.4.1.2.2F.
##### 5.4.1.2.2A Protected REGISTER with SIP digest as a security mechanism
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header field set to \"tls-pending\",
\"tls-yes\", \"ip-assoc-pending\", or \"ip-assoc-yes\", the S-CSCF shall
identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To header
field and the private user identity as received in the Authorization header
field of the REGISTER request, and:
NOTE: Although the REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter set to \"ip-assoc-pending\" or \"ip-assoc-yes\" is handled as
protected REGISTER request, the integrity of the request is actually not
protected by SIP digest.
In the case that there is no authentication currently ongoing for this user
(i.e. no timer reg-await-auth is running):
1) check if the user needs to be reauthenticated. The S-CSCF may require
authentication of the user for any REGISTER request, and shall always require
authentication for REGISTER requests received without the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header field set to
\"tls-yes\".
If the user needs to be reauthenticated and the REGISTER did not include an
Authorization header field with a digest response, the S-CSCF shall proceed
with the authentication procedures as described for the initial REGISTER in
subclause 5.4.1.2.1 and subclause 5.4.1.2.1B.
If the user needs to be reauthenticated and the REGISTER included an
Authorization header field with a digest response, the S-CSCF shall proceed
with the authentication procedures as described for the initial REGISTER in
subclause 5.4.1.2.1 and subclause 5.4.1.2.1B and include the \"stale\" header
field parameter with value \"true\" in the WWW-Authenticate header field.
In the case that a timer reg-await-auth is running for this user the S-CSCF
shall:
1) check if the Call-ID of the request matches with the Call-ID of the 401
(Unauthorized) response which carried the last challenge. The S-CSCF shall
only proceed further if the Call-IDs match.
2) stop timer reg-await-auth;
3) in the case the algorithm is \"MD5\", check the following additional
fields:
\- a \"realm\" header field parameter matching the \"realm\" header field
parameter in the authentication challenge;
\- an \"algorithm\" header field parameter which matches the \"algorithm\"
header field parameter sent in the authentication challenge;
\- \"nonce\" header field parameter matching the \"nonce\" header field
parameter in the authentication challenge;
\- a \"cnonce\" header field parameter; and
\- a nonce-count field.
The S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps in this paragraph if
the authentication challenge response was included;
4) check whether the received authentication challenge response and the
expected authentication challenge response match. The expected response is
calculated by the S-CSCF as described in RFC 2617 [21] using the H(A1) value
provided by the HSS. If the received authentication challenge response and the
expected authentication challenge response match, then the UE is considered
authenticated. If the UE is considered authenticated, and if the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header field is set to
the value \"tls-pending\" or \"tls-yes\", then the S-CSCF shall associate the
registration with the local state of \"tls-protected\";
NOTE 1: The S-CSCF can have a local security policy to treat messages other
than initial REGISTER requests, messages relating to emergency services, and
error messages, differently depending on whether the registration is
associated with the state \"tls-protected\".
4A) if the REGISTER request contains the \"reg-id\" Contact header field
parameter and the \"outbound\" option tag in a Supported header field, but the
first URI in the Path header does not have an \"ob\" URI parameter, send a 439
(First Hop Lacks Outbound Support) response to the UE;
5) after performing the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration notification
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], store the
following information in the local data:
a) the list of public user identities, including the registered own public
user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities and wildcarded public user identities due to the received REGISTER
request. Each public user identity is identified as either barred or non-
barred;
b) all the service profile(s) corresponding to the public user identities
being registered (explicitly or implicitly), including initial Filter
Criteria(the initial Filter Criteria for the Registered and common parts is
stored and the unregisterd part is retained for possible use later - in the
case of the S-CSCF is retained if the user becomes unregistered); and
c) if restoration procedures are supported, the restoration information, if
received, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14];
NOTE 2: There might be more than one set of initial Filter Criteria received
because some implicitly registered public user identities that are part of the
same implicit registration set belong to different service profiles.
6) update registration bindings:
a) bind to each non-barred registered public user identity all registered
contact information including all header field parameters contained in the
Contact header field and all associated URI parameters, with the exception of
the \"pub-gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" header field parameters as specified in RFC
5627 [93], and store information for future use;
b) for each binding that contains a \"+sip.instance\" Contact header field
parameter, assign a new temporary GRUU, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.3;
c) if the Contact header field of the REGISTER request does not contain a
\"reg-id\" header field parameter (i.e., the multiple registrations mechanism
is not used), and there are public user identities (including the public user
identity being registered, if previously registered) that belong to this user
that have been previously registered with the same private user identity, and
with an old contact address different from the one received in the REGISTER
request and if the previous registrations have not expired:
\- terminate all dialogs, associated with the previously registered public
user identities (including the public user identity being registered, if
previously registered), as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2;
\- send a NOTIFY request, to the subscribers to the registration event package
of the previously registered public user identities, that indicates that all
previously registered public user identities (excluding the public user
identity being registered) belonging to this user identified with its private
user identity, have been deregistered, as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
For the public user identity being registered, the NOTIFY request contains the
new contact information; and
NOTE 3: The last dialog to be terminated will be the dialog established by the
UE subscribing to the reg event package. When sending the NOTIFY request to
the UE over this dialog, the S-CSCF will terminate this dialog by setting in
the NOTIFY request the Subscription-State header field to the value of
\"terminated\".
\- delete all information associated with the previously registered public
user identities; and
NOTE 4: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. The S-CSCF
is not able to deregister contact related to emergency registration and will
not delete it.
d) if the Contact header field of the REGISTER request contained a
\"+sip.instance\" and a \"reg-id\" header field parameter, and the SIP URI in
the Path header field inserted by the P-CSCF contained an \"ob\" SIP URI
parameter header field, and:
\- if the public user identity has not previously been registered with the
same \"+sip.instance\" and \"reg-id\" header field parameter values, then this
registration shall be in addition to any existing registration flows; or
\- if the public user identity has previously been registered with the same
\"+sip.instance\" and \"reg-id\" header field parameter values, then the
S-CSCF shall determine whether the request refreshes or replaces an existing
registration flow. If the request:
i) refreshes an existing registration flow, then the S-CSCF shall leave the
flow intact; or
ii) replaces the existing registration flow with a new flow, then the S-CSCF
shall:
a) terminate any dialog, as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2, associated with
the registration flow being replaced; and
b) send a NOTIFY request to the subscribers to the registration event package
for the public user identity indicated in the REGISTER request, as described
in subclause 5.4.2.1.2;
NOTE 5: The S-CSCF determines whether this REGISTER request replaces or
refreshes an existing registration flow by examining the SIP URI in the Path
header field inserted into the request by the P-CSCF (see subclause 5.2.2.1).
NOTE 6: The way the S-CSCF identifies the dialogs associated with the
registration flow being replaced is implementation specific.
NOTE 7: There might be more then one contact information available for one
public user identity.
NOTE 8: The barred public user identities are not bound to the contact
information.
NOTE 9: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. S-CSCF is
not able deregister contact related to emergency registration and will not
delete that.
7) check whether a Path header field was included in the REGISTER request and
construct a list of preloaded Route header fields from the list of entries in
the received Path header field. The S-CSCF shall preserve the order of the
preloaded Route header fields and bind them either to the contact address of
the UE or to the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) and the contact information that was
received in the REGISTER request;
NOTE 10: If this registration is a reregistration or an initial registration
(i.e., there are previously registered public user identities belonging to the
user that have not been deregistered or expired), then a list of pre-loaded
Route header fields will already exist. If multiple registration mechanism was
not used, then the existing list of pre-loaded Route header fields is bound to
a respective contact address of the UE. However, if multiple registration
mechanism was used, then the existing list of pre-loaded Route header fields
is bound to a registration flow and the associated contact address that was
used to send the REGISTER request. In either case, the new list replaces the
old list.
8) determine the duration of the registration by checking the value of the
registration expiration interval value in the received REGISTER request and
bind it either to the respective contact address of the UE or to the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used). The S-CSCF may reduce the duration of the
registration due to local policy or send back a 423 (Interval Too Brief)
response specifying the minimum allowed time for registration;
9) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field;
10) if an \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter; and
NOTE 11: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 1
IOI. The type 1 IOI identifies the network from which the request was sent.
11) create and send a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request as specified
in subclause 5.4.1.2.2F. The S-CSCF shall also store the nonce-count value in
the received REGISTER request and include an Authentication-Info header field
containing the fields described in RFC 2617 [21] as follows:
\- a \"nextnonce\" header field parameter if the S-CSCF requires a new nonce
for subsequent authentication responses from the UE;
\- a \"qop\" header field parameter matching the \"qop\" Authorization header
field parameter sent by the UE;
\- a \"rspauth\" header field parameter with a response-digest calculated as
described in RFC 2617 [21];
\- a \"cnonce\" header field parameter value matching the cnonce in the
Authorization header field sent by the UE; and
\- a \"nonce-count\" header field parameter matching the \"nonce-count\"
Authorization header field parameter sent by the UE.
##### 5.4.1.2.2B Protected REGISTER with SIP digest with TLS as a security
mechanism
The procedures for subclause 5.4.1.2.2A apply.
##### 5.4.1.2.2C NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a security mechanism
There is no protected REGISTER when NASS-IMS bundled authentication is used as
a security mechanism. The procedures of subclause 5.4.1.2.1D apply to all
REGISTER requests.
##### 5.4.1.2.2D GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication as a security mechanism
There is no protected REGISTER when GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication is used as
a security mechanism. The procedures of subclause 5.4.1.2.1E apply to all
REGISTER requests.
##### 5.4.1.2.2E Protected REGISTER -- Authentication already performed
The S-CSCF shall not perform authentication of the user for any REGISTER
request with the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header set to \"auth-done\".
In this release of this document, when the registration procedure as specified
in this subclause is performed, i.e., the REGISTER request contains the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header set
to \"auth-done\", the S-CSCF shall not employ outbound registration as
described in RFC 5626 [92].
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the Authorization header set to \"auth-done\", the S-CSCF
shall identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To
header field and the private user identity as received in the Authorization
header field of the REGISTER request.
In addition the S-CSCF shall check whether a registration expiration interval
value is included in the REGISTER request and its value. If the registration
expiration interval value indicates a zero value, the S-CSCF shall perform the
deregistration procedures as described in subclause 5.4.1.4. If the
registration expiration interval value does not indicate zero, the S-CSCF
shall:
1) if the REGISTER request contains the \"reg-id\" header field parameter in
the Contact header field, respond with a 403 (Forbidden) response to the
REGISTER request; and
2) if there are public user identities (including the public user identity
being registered, if previously registered) that belong to this user that have
been previously registered with the same private user identity, and with an
old contact address different from the one received in the REGISTER request
and if the previous registrations have not expired:
a) terminate all dialogs, associated with the previously registered public
user identities (including the public user identity being registered, if
previously registered), as specified in subclause 5.4.5.1.2;
b) send a NOTIFY request, to the subscribers to the registration event package
of the previously registered public user identities, that indicates that all
previously registered public user identities (excluding the public user
identity being registered) belonging to this user identified with its private
user identity, have been deregistered, as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
For the public user identity being registered, the NOTIFY request contains the
new contact information; and
NOTE 1: The last dialog to be terminated will be the dialog established by the
user (identified with its private user identity) subscribing to its own reg
event package using the old contact address. When sending the NOTIFY request
over this dialog, the S-CSCF will terminate this dialog by setting in the
NOTIFY request the Subscription-State header field to the value of
\"terminated\".
c) delete all information associated with the previously registered public
user identities;
Subsequently, the S-CSCF shall check whether the public user identity received
in the To header field is already registered. If it is not registered, the
S-CSCF shall proceed beginning with step 1 below. Otherwise, the S-CSCF shall
proceed beginning with step 2 below.
1) after performing the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration notification
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], store the
following information in the local data:
a) the list of public user identities, including the registered own public
user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities and wildcarded public user identities due to the received REGISTER
request. Each public user identity is identified as either barred or non-
barred; and,
b) all the service profile(s) corresponding to the public user identities
being registered (explicitly or implicitly), including initial Filter
Criteria(the initial Filter Criteria for the Registered and common parts is
stored and the unregisterd part is retained for possible use later - in the
case of the S-CSCF is retained if the user becomes unregistered);
NOTE 2: There might be more than one set of initial Filter Criteria received
because some implicitly registered public user identities that are part of the
same implicit registration set belong to different service profiles.
2) update registration bindings:
a) bind to each non-barred registered public user identity all registered
contact information including all header parameters contained in the Contact
header and all associated URI parameters, with the exception of the URI \"pub-
gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" parameters as specified in RFC 5627 [93], and store
information for future use;
b) for each binding that contains a \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter,
assign a new temporary GRUU, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.3.
NOTE 3: There might be more then one contact information available for one
public user identity.
NOTE 4: The barred public user identities are not bound to the contact
information.
3) check whether a Path header was included in the REGISTER request and
construct a list of preloaded Route headers from the list of entries in the
received Path header field. The S-CSCF shall preserve the order of the
preloaded Route header fields and bind them to the contact information that
was received in the REGISTER request;
NOTE 5: If this registration is a reregistration or an initial registration
(i.e., there are previously registered public user identities belonging to the
user that have not been deregistered or expired), then a list of pre-loaded
Route headers will already exist. The new list replaces the old list.
4) determine the duration of the registration by checking the value of the
registration expiration interval value in the received REGISTER request. The
S-CSCF may reduce the duration of the registration due to local policy or send
back a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response specifying the minimum allowed time
for registration;
5) store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-
Vector header;
6) if an \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header, store the value of the received \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter; and
NOTE 6: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 1 IOI.
The type 1 IOI identifies the network from which the request was sent.
7) create and send a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request as specified
in subclause 5.4.1.2.2F.
##### 5.4.1.2.2F Successful registration
If a 200 (OK) response is to be sent for a REGISTER request, the S-CSCF shall,
in addition to any contents identified elsewhere in subclause 5.4.1.2,
include:
a) the list of received Path header fields;
b) a P-Associated-URI header field containing the list of the registered
public user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public
user identities. The first URI in the list of public user identities supplied
by the HSS to the S-CSCF will indicate the default public user identity to be
used by the S-CSCF. The public user identity indicated as the default public
user identity must be a registered public user identity. The S-CSCF shall
place the default public user identity as the first entry in the list of URIs
present in the P-Associated-URI header field. The default public user identity
will be used by the P-CSCF in conjunction with the procedures for the
P-Asserted-Identity header field, as described in subclause 5.2.6.3. If the
S-CSCF received a display name from the HSS for a public user identity, then
the S-CSCF shall populate the P-Associated-URI header field entry for that
public identity with the associated display name. The S-CSCF shall not add a
barred public user identity to the list of URIs in the P-Associated-URI header
field;
NOTE 1: The P-Associated-URI header field lists only the public user identity
and its associated set of implicitly registered public user identities that
have been registered, rather than the list of user\'s URIs that may be either
registered or unregistered as specified in RFC 3455 [52]. If the registered
public user identity which is not barred does not have any other associated
public user identities or wildcarded public user identities, the P-Associated-
URI header field lists only the registered public user identity itself, rather
than an empty P-Associated-URI header field as specified in RFC 3455 [52]. The
P-Associated-URI header field does not list wildcarded public user identities.
c) a Service-Route header field containing:
\- the SIP URI identifying the S-CSCF containing an indication that subsequent
requests routed via this service route (i.e. from the P-CSCF to the S-CSCF)
was sent by the UE using either the contact address of the UE or the
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used) that has been registered and are treated as
for the UE-originating case. This indication may e.g. be in a URI parameter, a
character string in the user part of the URI or be a port number in the URI.
The S-CSCF shall use a different SIP-URI for each registration. If the
multiple registration mechanism is used, the S-CSCF shall also use a different
SIP-URI for each registration flow associated with the registration; and
\- if network topology hiding is required a SIP URI identifying an IBCF as the
topmost entry;
NOTE 2: In accordance with the procedures described in RFC 3608 [38], an IBCF
does not insert its own routable SIP URI to the Service-Route header field.
d) a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field containing the values received
from the HSS if the P-CSCF is in the same network as the S-CSCF. It can be
determined if the P-CSCF is in the same network as the S-CSCF by the contents
of the P-Visited-Network-ID header field included in the REGISTER request;
e) a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter, if received in the REGISTER request and a type 1 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter. The S-CSCF shall set the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header
field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the response
and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously received
value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter;
f) a Contact header field listing all contact addresses for this public user
identity, including all saved header field parameters and URI parameters
(including all ICSI values and IARI values) received in the Contact header
field of the REGISTER request,
g) GRUUs in the Contact header field. If the REGISTER request contained a
Required or Supported header field containing the value \"gruu\" then for each
contact address in the Contact header field that has a \"+sip.instance\"
header field parameter, add \"pub-gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" header field
parameters. The values of these parameters shall contain, respectively, the
public GRUU and the most recently assigned temporary GRUU representing (as
specified in subclause 5.4.7A) the association between the public user
identity from the To header field in the REGISTER request and the instance ID
contained in the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter; and
h) if the received REGISTER request contained both a \"reg-id\" and
\"+sip.instance\" header field parameters in the Contact header field, and the
first URI within the Path header field contains the \"ob\" SIP URI parameter a
Require header field with the \"outbound\" option-tag as described in RFC 5626
[92];
NOTE 3: There might be other contact addresses available, that this UE or
other UEs have registered for the same public user identity.
and send the so created 200 (OK) response to the UE.
For all service profiles in the implicit registration set, the S-CSCF shall
send a third-party REGISTER request, as described in subclause 5.4.1.7, to
each AS that matches the Filter Criteria of the service profile from the HSS
for the REGISTER event.
NOTE 4: If this registration is a reregistration, the Filter Criteria already
exists in the local data.
NOTE 5: If the same AS matches the Filter Criteria of several service profiles
for the event of REGISTER request, then the AS will receive several third-
party REGISTER requests. Each of these requests will include a public user
identity from the corresponding service profile.
The S-CSCF shall consider the public user identity being registered to be
bound either to the contact address of the UE or to the registration flow and
the associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used), as specified in the Contact header field, for the duration indicated in
the registration expiration interval value.
##### 5.4.1.2.3 Abnormal cases - general
In the case that the expiration timer from the UE is too short to be accepted
by the S-CSCF, the S-CSCF shall:
\- reject the REGISTER request with a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response,
containing a Min-Expires header field with the minimum registration time the
S-CSCF will accept.
On receiving a failure response to one of the third-party REGISTER requests,
based on the information in the Filter Criteria the S-CSCF may:
\- abort sending third-party REGISTER requests; and
\- initiate network-initiated deregistration procedure.
If the Filter Criteria does not contain instruction to the S-CSCF regarding
the failure of the contact to the AS, the S-CSCF shall not initiate network-
initiated deregistration procedure.
In the case that the REGISTER request from the UE contains multiple SIP URIs
which are different addresses as Contact header field entries, the S-CSCF
shall store:
\- the entry in the Contact header field with the highest value of the \"q\"
header field parameter; or
\- an entry decided by the S-CSCF based on local policy;
and include the stored entry in the 200 (OK) response.
In the case that the REGISTER request from the UE contains multiple SIP URIs
which are the same addresses with the same value of the \"q\" Contact header
field parameter, the S-CSCF shall not store multiple entries with the same
\"q\" value but store one of the entries with the same \"q\" value based on
local policy along with any entries that have different \"q\" values and
include only the stored entries in the 200 (OK) response.
NOTE 1: The UE can register multiple SIP URIs in the Contact header field
simultanously, provided they all contain the same IP address and port number.
In this case the S-CSCF behaviour is as defined RFC 3261 [26] (i.e multiple
Contact header field entries are bound to the public user identity in the To
header field and are returned in the 200 (OK) response).
NOTE 2: If the timer reg-await-auth expires, the S-CSCF will consider the
authentication to have failed. If the public user identity was already
registered, the S-CSCF will leave it registered, as described in 3GPP TS
33.203 [19].
For any error response, the S-CSCF shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header
field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the
REGISTER request and a type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter. The S-CSCF
shall set the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that
identifies the sending network of the response and the \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter is set to the previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header
field.
NOTE 3: Any previously received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a
type 1 IOI. The type 1 IOI identifies the visited network of the registered
user.
##### 5.4.1.2.3A Abnormal cases -- IMS AKA as security mechanism
In the case that the REGISTER request, that contains the authentication
challenge response from the UE does not match with the expected REGISTER
request (e.g. wrong Call-Id or authentication challenge response) and the
request has the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header field set to \"yes\", the S-CSCF shall:
\- send a 403 (Forbidden) response to the UE. The Sâ€‘CSCF shall consider this
authentication attempt as failed. The S-CSCF shall not update the registration
state of the subscriber.
NOTE 1: If the UE was registered before, it stays registered until the
registration expiration time expires.
In the case that the REGISTER request, which was supposed to carry the
response to the challenge, contains and empty \"response\" Authorization
header field parameter (i.e. no authentication challenge response) and no
\"auts\" Authorization header field parameters indicating that the MAC
parameter was invalid in the challenge, the S-CSCF shall:
\- respond with a 403 (Forbidden) response to the UE. The S-CSCF shall not
update the registration state of the subscriber.
NOTE 2: If the UE was registered before, it stays registered until the
registration expiration time expires.
In the case that the REGISTER request from the UE containing an \"auts\"
Authorization header field parameter, indicating that the SQN was deemed to be
out of range by the UE), the S-CSCF will fetch new authentication vectors from
the HSS. In order to indicate a resynchronisation, the S-CSCF shall include
the value of the \"auts\" header field parameter received from the UE and the
stored RAND, when fetching the new authentication vectors. On receipt of the
new authentication vectors from the HSS, the S-CSCF shall either:
\- send a 401 (Unauthorized) response to initiate a further authentication
attempt, using these new vectors; or
\- respond with a 403 (Forbidden) response if the authentication attempt is to
be abandoned. The S-CSCF shall not update the registration state of the
subscriber.
NOTE 3: If the UE was registered before, it stays registered until the
registration expiration time expires.
NOTE 4: Since the UE responds only to two consecutive invalid challenges, the
S-CSCF will send a 401 (Unauthorized) response that contains a new challenge
only twice.
NOTE 5: In the case of an \"auts\" Authorization header field parameter being
present in the REGISTER request, the \"response\" Authorization header field
parameter in the same REGISTER request will not be taken into account by the
S-CSCF.
In the case that the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header field set to
\"yes\", for which the public user identity received in the To header field
and the private user identity received in the \"username\" Authorization
header field parameter of the REGISTER request do not match to any registered
user at this S-CSCF, if the S-CSCF supports restoration procedures, the S-CSCF
shall behave as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2, otherwise the S-CSCF shall:
\- respond with a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the UE.
NOTE 6: This error is not raised if there is a match on the private user
identity, but no match on the public user identity.
##### 5.4.1.2.3B Abnormal cases -- SIP digest as security mechanism
In the case that the REGISTER request, that contains the authentication
challenge response from the UE does not match with the expected REGISTER
request (e.g. wrong Call-Id or authentication challenge response) and the
request has the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header field set to either \"tls-pending\", \"tls-yes\", \"ip-
assoc-pending\", or \"ip-assoc-yes\", the S-CSCF shall do one of the
following:
\- send a 403 (Forbidden) response to the UE. The S CSCF shall consider this
authentication attempt as failed. The S-CSCF shall not update the registration
state of the subscriber; or
\- rechallenge the user by issuing a 401 (Unauthorized) response including a
challenge as per the authentication procedures described in subclause
5.4.1.2.1B.
NOTE 1: If the UE was registered before, it stays registered until the
registration expiration time expires.
In the case that the REGISTER request from the UE contains an invalid
\"nonce\" Authorization header field parameter with a valid challenge response
for that nonce (indicating that the client knows the correct
username/password), or when the nonce-count value sent by the UE is not the
expected value, the S-CSCF shall:
\- send a 401 (Unauthorized) response to initiate a further authentication
attempt with a fresh nonce and the \"stale\" header field parameter set to
\"true\" in the WWW-Authenticate header field.
In the case that the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header field set to
\"tls-pending\", \"tls-yes\", \"ip-assoc-pending\", or \"ip-assoc-yes\", for
which the public user identity received in the To header field and the private
user identity received in the Authorization header field of the REGISTER
request do not match to any registered or initial registration pending user at
this S-CSCF, if the S-CSCF supports restoration procedures, the S-CSCF shall
behave as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2A, otherwise the S-CSCF shall:
\- respond with a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the UE.
NOTE 2: This error is not raised if there is a match on the private user
identity, but no match on the public user identity.
##### 5.4.1.2.3C Abnormal cases -- SIP digest with TLS as security mechanism
The procedures for subclause 5.4.1.2.3B apply.
##### 5.4.1.2.3D Abnormal cases -- NASS-IMS bundled authentication as security
mechanism
There are no abnormal cases for NASS-IMS bundled authentication.
##### 5.4.1.2.3E Abnormal cases -- GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication as security
mechanism
There are no abnormal cases for GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication.
#### 5.4.1.3 Authentication and reauthentication
Authentication and reauthentication is performed by the registration
procedures as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.
#### 5.4.1.4 User-initiated deregistration
##### 5.4.1.4.1 Normal cases
When S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the registration expiration
interval value containing the value zero, the S-CSCF shall:
1) verify that the REGISTER request is associated with an existing registered
contact or an existing flow or, if the restoration procedures are supported by
this S-CSCF, attempt to restore a contact or flow from HSS associated with the
REGISTER request. If no associated contact or flow exists then the S-CSCF
shall send a 481 (Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist) response to the UE and
skip the remaining procedures in this subclause;
2) if IMS AKA is in use as the security mechanism, check whether the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header
field set to \"yes\", indicating that the REGISTER request was received
integrity protected. The S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps if
the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter is set to \"yes\";
3) if SIP digest without TLS or SIP digest with TLS is in use as a security
mechanism, check whether the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in
the Authorization header field set to \"tls-yes\" or \"ip-assoc-yes\",
indicating that the REGISTER request was received from a previously registered
user. If the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter is set to \"tls-
pending\", \"ip-assoc-pending\" or is not present the S-CSCF shall ensure
authentication is performed as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.1 (and
consequently subclause 5.4.1.2.1B or 5.4.1.2.1C) if local policy requires. The
S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps if the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter is set to \"tls-yes\", \"ip-assoc-yes\", or
the required authentication is successfully performed if required by local
policy;
4) if NASS-IMS bundled authentication is in use as a security mechanism, the
S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps if the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header field does not
exist or without an Authorization header field, and one or more Line-
Identifiers previously received over the Cx interface, stored as a result of
an Authentication procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14],
are available for the user;
4A) if the security mechanism as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2E is in use,
check whether the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header field set to \"auth-done\". The S-CSCF shall only proceed
with the following steps if the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter
is set to \"auth-done\";
5) release all dialogs that include this user\'s contact addresses or the
flows that are being deregistered, and where these dialogs were initiated by
or terminated towards these contact addresses and the same public user
identity found that was To header field that was received REGISTER request or
with one of the implicitly registered public user identities by applying the
steps listed in subclause 5.4.5.1.2. However:
a) if the dialog that was established by the UE subscribing to the reg event
package used the public user identity that is going to be deregistered; and
b) this dialog is the only remaining dialog used for subscription to reg event
package;
then the S-CSCF shall not release this dialog;
\- examine the Contact header field in the REGISTER request, and:
a) if the value \"*\" is not included in the Contact header field and:
i) if the \"reg-id\" header field parameter is not included in the Contact
header field,then:
\- remove the binding (i.e. deregister) between the public user identity found
in the To header field together with the implicitly registered public user
identities and the contact addresses specified in the REGISTER request. The
S-CSCF shall only remove the contact addresses that were registered by this
UE;
ii) if the \"reg-id\" header field parameter and \"+sip.instance\" header
field parameter are included in the Contact header field, and the UE supports
multiple registrations (i.e. the \"outbound\" option tag is included in the
Supported header field), then:
\- remove the binding (i.e. deregister) between the public user identity
indicated in the To header field (together with the associated implicitly
registered public user identities) and the flow identified by the \"reg-id\"
header field parameter;
6) if the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the value \"*\" in the
Contact header field and the value zero in the Expires header field, the
S-CSCF shall remove all contact addresses that were bound to the public user
identity found in the To header field and have been registered by this UE
identified with its private user identity;
7) for all service profiles in the implicit registration set send a third-
party REGISTER request, as described in subclause 5.4.1.7, to each AS that
matches the Filter Criteria of the service profile from the HSS for the
REGISTER event;
8) if this is a deregistration request for the only public user identity
currently registered with its associated set of implicitly registered public
user identities (i.e. no other is registered) and there are still active
multimedia sessions that includes this user\'s registered contact address,
where the session was initiated by or terminated towards the contact with the
registered contact address for that public user identity which is currently
registered or with one of the implicitly registered public user identities,
release only each of these multimedia sessions associated with the registered
contact address by applying the steps listed in subclause 5.4.5.1.2. The
S-CSCF shall only release dialogs associated to the multimedia sessions
originated or terminated towards the registered user\'s contact address; and
9) send a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request that contains a list of
Contact header fields enumerating all contacts and flows that are currently
registered, and all contacts that have been deregistered. For each contact
address and the flow that has been deregistered, the Contact header field
shall contain the contact address and the \"reg-id\" header field parameter
that identifies the flow, if a flow was deregistered, and the associated
information, and the registration expiration interval value shall be set to
zero.
If all public user identities of the UE are deregistered, then the S-CSCF may
consider the UE and P-CSCF subscriptions to the reg event package cancelled
(i.e. as if the UE had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires header field
containing a value of zero).
If the Authorization header field of the REGISTER request contained an
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter set to the value \"no\", the
S-CSCF shall apply the procedures described in subclause 5.4.1.2.1.
On completion of the above procedures in this subclause and of the S-CSCF
Registration/deregistration notification procedure with the HSS, as described
in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], for one or more public user identities, the S-CSCF
shall update or remove those public user identities, their registration state
and the associated service profiles from the local data. Based on operators\'
policy the S-CSCF can request the HSS to either be kept or cleared as the
S-CSCF allocated to this subscriber. If emergency contacts are still
registered for this subscriber, the S-CSCF requests the HSS to be kept as the
S-CSCF allocated to this subscriber.
##### 5.4.1.4.2 Abnormal cases - IMS AKA as security mechanism
If case that the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the Authorization header set to \"yes\",
for which the public user identity received in the To header and the private
user identity received in the Authorization header of the REGISTER request do
not match to any registered user at this S-CSCF, if the S-CSCF supports
restoration procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [7D], the S-CSCF shall
behave as described in subclause 5.4.1.4.1, otherwise the S-CSCF shall:
\- respond with a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the UE.
NOTE: This error is not raised if there is a match on the private user
identity, but no match on the public user identity.
##### 5.4.1.4.4 Abnormal cases -- SIP digest with TLS as security mechanism
The procedures for subclause 5.4.1.4.2 apply.
##### 5.4.1.4.5 Abnormal cases -- NASS-IMS bundled authentication as security
mechanism
There are no abnormal cases for NASS-IMS bundled authentication.
##### 5.4.1.4.6 Abnormal cases -- GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication as security
mechanism
There are no abnormal cases for GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication.
#### 5.4.1.5 Network-initiated deregistration
NOTE 1: A network-initiated deregistration event that occurs at the S-CSCF may
be received from the HSS or may be an internal event in the S-CSCF.
For any registered public user identity, the S-CSCF can deregister:
\- all contact addresses bound to the indicated public user identity (i.e.
deregister the respective public user identity);
\- some contact addresses bound to the indicated public user identity;
\- a particular contact address bound to the indicated public user identity;
or
\- one or more registration flows and the associated contact address bound to
the indicated public user identity, when the UE supports multiple registration
procedure;
by sending a single NOTIFY request.
Prior to initiating the network-initiated deregistration for the only
currently registered public user identity and its associated set of implicitly
registered public user identities and wildcarded public user identities that
have been registered either with the same contact address of the UE or the
same registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used), i.e. there are no other public user
identities registered either with this contact address or with this
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used), and there are still active multimedia
sessions belonging either to this contact address or to this registration flow
and the associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used), the S-CSCF shall release only multimedia sessions belonging to this
contact address or to this registration flow and the associated contact
address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used) as described in the
following paragraph. The multimedia sessions for the same public user
identity, if registered either with another contact address or another
registration flow and the associated contact address (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used) remain unchanged.
Prior to initiating the network-initiated deregistration while there are still
active multimedia sessions that are associated with this user and contact, the
S-CSCF shall release none, some or all of these multimedia sessions by
applying the steps listed in subclause 5.4.5.1.2 under the following
conditions:
\- when the S-CSCF does not expect the UE to reregister a given public user
identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities that have been registered with respective contact address (i.e.
S-CSCF will set the event attribute within the respective \ element
to \"rejected\" for the NOTIFY request, as described below), the S-CSCF shall
release all sessions that are associated with the registered contact address
for the public user identities using the contact address that is being
deregistered, which includes the implicitly registered public user identities.
\- when the S-CSCF expects the UE to reregister a given public user identity
and its associated set of implicitly registered public user identities that
have been registered with respective contact address (i.e. S-CSCF will set the
event attribute within the respective \ element to \"deactivated\"
for the NOTIFY request, as described below), the S-CSCF shall only release
sessions that currently include the user\'s contact address, where the session
was initiated by or terminated towards the user with the contact address
registered to one of the public user identities using the contact address that
is being deregistered, which includes the implicitly registered public user
identities.
When a network-initiated deregistration event occurs for one or more public
user identities that are bound either to one or more contact addresses or
registration flows and the associated contact addresses (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used), the S-CSCF shall send a NOTIFY request to all
subscribers that have subscribed to the respective reg event package. For each
NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall:
1) set the Request-URI and Route header field to the saved route information
during subscription;
2) set the Event header field to the \"reg\" value;
3) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include as many \ elements
as many public user identities the S-CSCF is aware of the user owns;
4) set the aor attribute within each \ element to one public
user identity:
a) set the \ sub-element inside each \ sub-element of each
\ element to the respective contact address provided by the UE;
b) if the public user identity:
i) has been deregistered (i.e. all contact addresses and all registration
flows and associated contact addresses bound to the indicated public user
identity are removed) then:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to
\"terminated\";
\- set the state attribute within each \ element belonging to this UE
to \"terminated\"; and
\- set the event attribute within each \ element belonging to this UE
to either \"unregistered\", or \"deactivated\" if the S-CSCF expects the UE to
reregister or \"rejected\" if the S-CSCF does not expect the UE to reregister;
or
NOTE 2: If the multiple registration mechanism is used, then the reg-id header
field parameter will be included as an \ element within each
respective \ element.
NOTE 3: The UE will consider its public user identity as deregistered when the
binding between the respective public user identity and all contact addresses
and all registration flows and associated contact addresses (if the multiple
registration mechanism is used) belonging to the UE have been removed.
ii) has been kept registered then:
I) set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\";
II) set the state attribute within each \ element to:
\- for the binding between the public user identity and either the contact
address or a registration flow and associated contact addresses (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) to be removed set the state attribute
within the \ element to \"terminated\", and event attribute element
to either \"unregistered\", or \"deactivated\" if the S-CSCF expects the UE to
reregister or \"rejected\" if the S-CSCF does not expect the UE to reregister;
or
\- for the binding between the public user identity and either the contact
address or a registration flow and associated contact addresses (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) which remain unchanged, if any, leave
the \ element unmodified, and if the contact has been assigned GRUUs
set the \ and \ sub-elements of the \ element as
specified in RFC 5628 [94] and include the \ sub-element within
each \ to any additional header field parameters contained in the
Contact header field of the REGISTER request according to RFC 3680 [43]; and
NOTE 4: There might be more than one contact information available for one
public user identity. When deregistering this UE, the S-CSCF will only modify
the \ elements that were originally registered by this UE using its
private user identity. The \ elements of the same public user
identity, if registered by another UE using different private user identities
remain unchanged.
5) add a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
When sending a final NOTIFY request with all \ element(s) having
their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user identities
have been deregistered or expired), the S-CSCF shall also terminate the
subscription to the registration event package by setting the Subscription-
State header field to the value of \"terminated\".
Also, for all service profiles in the implicit registration set the S-CSCF
shall send a third-party REGISTER request, as described in subclause 5.4.1.7,
to each AS that matches the Filter Criteria of the service profile from the
HSS as if a equivalent REGISTER request had been received from the user
deregistering that public user identity, or combination of public user
identities.
On completion of the above procedures for one or more public user identities
linked to the same private user identity, the S-CSCF shall consider those
public user identities and the associated implicitly registered public user
identities which have no contact address or a registration flow and associated
contact addresses (if the multiple registration mechanism is used) bound to
them as deregistered. On completion of the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration
notification procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the
S-CSCF shall update or remove those public user identities linked to the same
private user identity, their registration state and the associated service
profiles from the local data (based on operators\' policy the S-CSCF can
request of the HSS to either be kept or cleared as the S-CSCF allocated to
this subscriber). On the completion of the Network initiated de-registration
by the HSS procedure, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the S-CSCF shall
remove those public user identities, their registration state and the
associated service profiles from the local data.
#### 5.4.1.6 Network-initiated reauthentication
The S-CSCF may request a subscriber to reauthenticate at any time, based on a
number of possible operator settable triggers as described in subclause
5.4.1.2.
If the S-CSCF is informed that a private user identity needs to be re-
authenticated, the S-CSCF shall generate a NOTIFY request on all dialogs which
have been established due to subscription to the reg event package of that
user. For each NOTIFY request the S-CSCF shall:
1) set the Request-URI and Route header field to the saved route information
during subscription;
2) set the Event header field to the \"reg\" value;
3) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include as many \ elements
as many public user identities the S-CSCF is aware of the user owns:
a) set the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element of each
\ element to the contact address provided by the UE;
b) set the aor attribute within each \ element to one public
user identity;
c) set the state attribute within each \ element to \"active\";
d) set the state attribute within each \ element to \"active\";
e) set the event attribute within each \ element that was registered
by this UE to \"shortened\";
f) set the expiry attribute within each \ element that was registered
by this UE to an operator defined value; and
g) set the \ and \ sub-elements within each \
element as specified in subclause 5.4.2.1.2; and
NOTE 1: There might be more than one contact information available for one
public user identity. The S-CSCF will only modify the \ elements that
were originally registered by this UE using its private user identity. The
S-CSCF will not modify the \ elements for the same public user
identitity, if registered by another UE using different private user identity.
4) set a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
Afterwards the S-CSCF shall wait for the user to reauthenticate (see subclause
5.4.1.2).
NOTE 2: Network initiated re-authentication may occur due to internal
processing within the S-CSCF.
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
When generating the NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall shorten the validity of
all registration lifetimes associated with this private user identity to an
operator defined value that will allow the user to be re-authenticated.
#### 5.4.1.7 Notification of Application Servers about registration status
During registration, the S-CSCF shall include the P-Access-Network-Info header
fields (as received in the REGISTER request from the UE and the P-CSCF) and a
P-Visited-Network-ID header field (as received in the REGISTER request from
the UE) in the 3rd-party REGISTER request sent towards the ASs, if the AS is
part of the trust domain. If the AS is not part of the trust domain, the
S-CSCF shall not include any P-Access-Network-Info header field or P-Visited-
Network-ID header field. The S-CSCF shall not include a P-Access-Network-Info
header field in any responses to the REGISTER request.
If the registration procedure described in subclauses 5.4.1.2, 5.4.1.4 or
5.4.1.5 (as appropriate) was successful, the S-CSCF shall send a third-party
REGISTER request to each AS with the following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain the AS\'s SIP URI;
b) the From header field, which shall contain the S-CSCF\'s SIP URI;
c) the To header field, which shall contain a non-barred public user identity
belonging to the service profile of the processed Filter Criteria. It may be
either a public user identity as contained in the REGISTER request received
from the UE or one of the implicitly registered public user identities in the
service profile, as configured by the operator;
NOTE 1: For the whole implicit registration set only one public user identity
per service profile appears in the third-party REGISTER requests. Thus, based
on third-party REGISTER requests only, the ASs will not have complete
information on the registration state of each public user identity in the
implicit registration set. The only way to have a complete and continuously
updated information (even upon administrative change in subscriber\'s profile)
is to subscribe to the reg event package.
d) the Contact header field, which shall contain the S-CSCF\'s SIP URI;
e) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration (subclause
5.4.1.2), the registration expiration interval value, which shall contain the
same value that the S-CSCF returned in the 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER
request received from the UE;
f) for user-initiated deregistration (subclause 5.4.1.4) and network-initiated
deregistration (subclause 5.4.1.5), the registration expiration interval
value, which shall contain the value zero;
g) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration (subclause
5.4.1.2), a message body, if there is Filter Criteria indicating the need to
include HSS provided data for the REGISTER event (e.g. HSS may provide AS
specific data to be included in the third-party REGISTER) or if there is
Filter Criteria indicating the need to include the contents of the incoming
REGISTER request or the contents of the 200 (OK) response to the incoming
REGISTER request in the body of the third-party REGISTER. The S-CSCF shall
format the MIME body and set the value of the Content-Type header field to
include the MIME type specified in subclause 5.4.1.7A;
NOTE 2: When the AS is outside the trust domain for any header field that is
permitted in the REGISTER request received from the UE or final response to
the REGISTER request received from the UE, including an Include Register
Request or Include Register Response indication in the initial Filter Criteria
would cause the incoming REGISTER request or 200 (OK) response to the incoming
REGISTER request contents to be delivered to the AS revealing information that
AS is not trusted to obtain. Include Register Request and Include Register
Response indication is therefore not included in the initial Filter Criteria
for an AS that exists outside the trust domain for any such header field.
h) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration, the P-Charging-
Vector header field, which shall contain the same \"icid-value\" header field
parameter that the S-CSCF received in the REGISTER request from the UE and
which shall contain a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The S-CSCF
shall insert the type 3 orig ioi parameter in place of any received \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter and shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the request.
The S-CSCF shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter;
i) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration, a P-Charging-
Function-Addresses header field, which shall contain the values received from
the HSS if the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network; and
j) in case the received REGISTER request contained a P-User-Database header
field and the AS belongs to the same operator as the S-CSCF, optionally a
P-User-Database header field which shall contain the received value.
When the S-CSCF receives any response to a third-party REGISTER request, the
S-CSCF shall store the value of the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter
received in the P-Charging-Vector header field, if present.
NOTE 3: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the response was
sent.
If the S-CSCF fails to receive a SIP response or receives a 408 (Request
Timeout) response or a 5xx response to a third-party REGISTER, the S-CSCF
shall:
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_CONTINUED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or no default
handling is indicated, no further action is needed; and
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_TERMINATED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the S-CSCF shall
initiate the network-initiated deregistration as described in subclause
5.4.1.5 for the currently registered public user identity and its associated
set of implicitly registered non-barred public user identities bound to the
contact(s) registered in the REGISTER request causing the third-party REGISTER
request.
#### 5.4.1.7A Including contents in the body of the third-party REGISTER
request
If there is a service information XML element provided in the HSS Filter
Criteria for an AS (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]), then in the third-party REGISTER
request the S-CSCF shall:
\- include in the message body the service information within the \ XML which is a child XML element of an \ element with the
\"version\" attribute set to \"1\" element as described in subclause 7.6; and
\- set the value of the content type to the MIME type specified in subclause
7.6.
If there is an Include Register Request XML element provided in the HSS Filter
Criteria for an AS (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]), then in the third-party REGISTER
request the S-CSCF shall:
\- include in the message body the incoming SIP REGISTER request within a
\"message/sip\" MIME body as defined in RFC 3261 [26]; and
\- set the value of the content type to \"message/sip\".
If there is an Include Register Response XML element provided in the HSS
Filter Criteria for an AS (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]), then in the third-party
REGISTER request, the S-CSCF shall:
\- include in the message body the 200 (OK) response to the incoming SIP
REGISTER request within a \"message/sip\" MIME body as defined in RFC 3261
[26]; and
\- set the value of the content type to \"message/sip\".
If there is more than one message body to be included in the third-party
REGISTER request then in the third-party REGISTER request the S-CSCF shall:
\- include a multipart message body and set the value of the Content-Type
header field to \"multipart/mixed\" as specified in RFC 2046 [149] and RFC
5621 [150]; and
\- set the Content-Type of the elements of the MIME body to the content type
specified for the body.
If there is only one message body to be included in the third-party REGISTER
request then the S-CSCF sets the Content-Type header field to the content type
specified for the body.
#### 5.4.1.8 Service profile updates
NOTE 1: The S-CSCF can receive an update of subscriber data notification on
the Cx interface, from the HSS, which can affect the stored information about
served public user identities. According to 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the changes
are guaranteed not to affect the default public user identity within the
registration implicit set.
When receiving a Push-Profile-Request (PPR) from the HSS (as described in 3GPP
TS 29.228 [14]), modifying the service profile of served public user
identities, the S-CSCF shall
1) if the modification consists in the addition of a new non-barred public
user identity to an implicit set, or in the change of status from barred to
non-barred for a public user identity already in the implicit set, add the
public user identity to the list of registered, non-barred public user
identities;
2) if the modification consists in the deletion of a public user identity
while there are no active multimedia session belonging to this public user
identity, or in the change of status from non-barred to barred of a public
user identity in an implicit set, remove the public user identity from the
list of registered, non-barred public user identities;
NOTE 2: As the S-CSCF checks the barring status of the public user identity on
receipt of a initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, the
above procedures have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in progress
and are effective only for new transactions and dialogs.
3) if the modification consists of deletion of a public user identity from an
implicit registration set while there are active multimedia session belonging
to this public user identity and contact, release these multimedia sessions as
described in subclause 5.4.5.1.2 and after all multimedia sessions are
released, remove the public user identity from the list of registered, non-
barred public user identities; and
4) synchronize with the UE and IM CN entities, by either:
\- performing the procedures for notification of the reg-event subscribers
about registration state, as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2; or
\- triggering the UE to re-register, by shortening the life time of the
current registration, as described in subclause 5.4.1.6, e.g. when a new
trigger point of Register method is added in the iFCs.
### 5.4.2 Subscription and notification
#### 5.4.2.1 Subscriptions to S-CSCF events
##### 5.4.2.1.1 Subscription to the event providing registration state
When an incoming SUBSCRIBE request addressed to S-CSCF arrives containing the
Event header field with the reg event package, the S-CSCF shall:
1) check if, based on the local policy, the request was generated by a
subscriber who is authorised to subscribe to the registration state of this
particular user. The authorized subscribers include:
\- all public user identities this particular user owns, that the S-CSCF is
aware of, and which are not-barred;
\- all the entities identified by the Path header field (i.e. the P-CSCF to
which this user is attached to); and
\- all the ASs listed in the initial filter criteria that are part of the
trust domain; and
NOTE 1: The S-CSCF finds the identity for authentication of the subscription
in the P-Asserted-Identity header field received in the SUBSCRIBE request.
2) store the value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field if present; and
NOTE 2: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the request was
sent.
3) generate a 2xx response acknowledging the SUBSCRIBE request and indicating
that the authorised subscription was successful as described in RFC 3680 [43].
The S-CSCF shall populate the header fields as follows:
\- an Expires header field, set to either the same or a decreased value as the
Expires header field in SUBSCRIBE request; and
\- if the request originated from an ASs listed in the initial filter
criteria, a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter, if received in the SUBSCRIBE request, and a type 3 \"term-
ioi\" header field parameter. The S-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the
response and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously
received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
The S-CSCF may set the Contact header field to an identifier uniquely
associated to the SUBSCRIBE request and generated within the S-CSCF, that may
help the S-CSCF to correlate refreshes for the SUBSCRIBE dialog.
NOTE 3: The S-CSCF could use such unique identifiers to distinguish between
UEs, when two or more users, holding a shared subscription, register under the
same public user identity.
Afterwards the S-CSCF shall perform the procedures for notification about
registration state as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
If the SUBSCRIBE request originated from an AS listed in the initial filter
criteria, for any final response that is not a 2xx response, the S-CSCF shall
insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter, if received in the SUBSCRIBE request and a type 3 \"term-
ioi\" header field parameter. The S-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the
response and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously
received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
When the S-CSCF receives a subscription refresh request for a dialog that was
established by the UE subscribing to the reg event package, the S-CSCF shall
accept the request irrespective if the user\'s public user identity specified
in the SUBSCRIBE request is either registered or has been deregistered.
##### 5.4.2.1.2 Notification about registration state
The UE can bind any one of its public user identities either to its contact
address or to a registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used) via a single registration procedure.
When multiple registrations mechanism is used to register a public user
identity and bind it to a registration flow and the associated contact
address, the S-CSCF shall generate a NOTIFY request that includes one
\ element for each binding between a public user identity and a
registration flow and the associated contact address.
NOTE 1: If the UE binds a given public user identity to the same contact
address but several registration flows and the associated contact address (via
several registrations), then the NOTIFY request will contain one \
element for each registration flow and the associated contact address. Each
respective \ elements will contain the same contact address in the
\"uri\" sub-element, but different value in the \"id\" sub-element and
different \"reg-id\" value included in the respective \
element.
For every successful registration that creates a new binding between a public
user identity and either its contact address or the registration flow and the
associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used,
the NOTIFY request shall always include a new \ element containing
new value in the \"id\" sub-element, the state attribute set to \"active\",
and event attribute set to either \"registered\" or \"created\".
Any successful registration (that creates a new binding between a public user
identity and either its contact address or a registration flow and associated
contact address) may additionally replace or remove one or more existing
bindings. In the NOTIFY request, for each replaced or removed binding, the
\ element shall have the state attribute set to \"terminated\" and
the event attribute set to \"unregistered\", \"deactivated\", or \"rejected\".
NOTE 2: When multiple registrations mechanism is not used, if the UE registers
new contact address then all registrations, if any, using an old contact
address are deregistered, i.e. the new registration replaces the old
registrations. Hence, for each deregistered public user identity, the NOTIFY
request will have the state attribute within the \ element set
to \"terminated\" and the state attribute in the \ element set to
\"terminated\" and the event attribute set to \"unregistered\",
\"deactivated\", or \"rejected\".
NOTE 3: If the UE uses a multiple registrations mechanism to bind a public
user identity to a new registration flow the registration flow and the
associated contact address, and if the new registration flow replaces an
existing registration flow, then for the registration flow and the associated
contact address being replaced, the respective \ element in the
NOTIFY request will have the state attribute set to \"terminated\" and the
event attribute set to \"unregistered\", \"deactivated\", or \"rejected\".
The S-CSCF shall send a NOTIFY request:
\- when an event pertaining to the user occurs. In this case the NOTIFY
request is sent on all dialogs which have been established due to subscription
to the reg event package of that user; and
\- as specified in RFC 3265 [28].
When sending a NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall not use the default filtering
policy as specified in RFC 3680 [43], i.e. the S-CSCF shall always include in
every NOTIFY request the state information of all registered public user
identities of the user (i.e. the full state information).
NOTE 4: Contact information related to emergency registration is not included.
When generating NOTIFY requests, the S-CSCF shall not preclude any valid reg
event package parameters in accordance with RFC 3680 [43].
For each NOTIFY request triggered by an event and on all dialogs which have
been established due to subscription to the reg event package of that user,
the S-CSCF shall:
1) set the Request-URI and Route header field to the saved route information
during subscription;
2) set the Event header field to the \"reg\" value;
3) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include one \ elements for
each public user identity that the S-CSCF is aware the user owns.
If the user shares one or more public user identities with other users, the
S-CSCF shall include any contact addresses registered by other users of the
shared public user identity in the NOTIFY request;
4) for each \ element:
a) set the aor attribute to one public user identity or if the public user
identity of this \ element is a wildcarded public user identiy,
then choose arbitrarily a public user identity that matches the wildcarded
public user identity and the service profile of the wildcarded public user
identity and set the aor attribute to this public user identity;
NOTE 5: The value of the aor attribute will not be used by the receiver of the
NOTIFY in this release of the specification.
b) set the \ sub-element inside each \ sub-element of the
\ element to the contact address provided by the respective UE
as follows:
I) if the aor attribute of the \ element contains a SIP URI,
then for each contact address that contains a \"+sip.instance\" Contact header
field parameter, include \ and \ sub-elements within the
corresponding \ element. The S-CSCF shall set the contents of these
elements as specified in RFC 5628 [94]; or
II) if the aor attribute of the \ element contains a tel-URI,
determine its alias SIP URI and then include a copy of the \ and
\ sub-elements from that equivalent element;
c) if the respective UE has provided a display-name in a Contact header field,
set the \ sub-element inside the respective \ sub-
element of the \ element to the value provided by the UE
according to RFC3680 [43];
d) if the user owns a wildcarded public user identity then include a
\ sub-element as described in subclause 7.10.2; and
e) if the public user identity set in step a):
I) has been deregistered either by the UE or the S-CSCF (i.e. upon the
deregistration, there are no binding left between this public user identity
and either a contact address or a registaration flows and associated contact
addresses that belonging to this user) then:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to
\"terminated\";
\- set the state attribute within each \ element belonging to this
user to \"terminated\"; and
\- set the event attribute within each \ element to \"deactivated\",
\"expired\", \"unregistered\", \"rejected\" or \"probation\" according to RFC
3680 [43].
If the public user identity has been deregistered for this user and this
deregistration has already been indicated in the NOTIFY request, and no new
registration for this user has occurred, its \ element shall not
be included in the subsequent NOTIFY requests; or
II) has been registered by the UE (i.e. the public user identity has not been
previously bound either to a contact address or to a registration flow and the
associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used))
then:
\- set the \ element to any additional header field parameters
contained in the Contact header field of the REGISTER request according to RFC
3680 [43];
NOTE 5: If the multiple registration mechanism is used, then the reg-id header
field parameter will be included as an \ element.
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\";
and:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element belonging to this
user to \"active\", include new value in the \"id\" sub-element, and set the
event attribute within this \ element to \"registered\"; or
NOTE 6: If this registration, that created new binding, additionally replaces
or removes one or more existing registrations, then for the replaced or
removed registrations the respective \ elements and \
elements will be modified accordingly.
III) has been re-registered (i.e. it has been previously registered) then:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\";
\- set the \ element to any additional header field parameters
contained in the Contact header field of the REGISTER request according to RFC
3680 [43];
\- for contact addresses to be registered: set the state attribute within the
\ element to \"active\"; and set the event attribute within the
\ element to \"registered\"; or
\- for contact addresses to be re-registered, set the state attribute within
the \ element to \"active\"; and set the event attribute within the
\ element to \"refreshed\" or \"shortened\" according to RFC 3680
[43]; or
\- for contact addresses that remain unchanged, if any, leave the \
element unmodified (i.e. the event attribute within the \ element
includes the last event that caused the transition to the respective state);
or
IV) has been automatically registered or registered by the S-CSCF, and has not
been previously automatically registered:
\- set the \ element to any additional header field parameters
contained in the Contact header field of the REGISTER request according to RFC
3680 [43];
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\";
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\"; and
\- set the event attribute within the \ element to \"created\"; and
V) is hosted (unregistered case) at the S-CSCF:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to
\"terminated\";
\- set the state attribute within each \ element to \"terminated\";
and
\- set the event attribute within each \ element to \"unregistered\".
> The S-CSCF shall also terminate the subscription to the registration event
> package by setting the Subscription-State header field to the value of
> \"terminated\"; and
NOTE 7: The value of \"init\" for the state attribute within the
\ element is not used.
5) set the P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17], and if the NOTIFY
request is sent towards an AS listed in the initial filter criteria a type 3
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The S-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of
the request. The S-CSCF shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter.
NOTE 8: When sending a NOTIFY request to a subscriber subscribing or
unsubscribing to the reg event package, or when the S-CSCF terminates the
subscription, the event attribute within the \ element includes the
last event that caused the transition to the respective state.
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
EXAMPLE 1: If sip:user1_public1\@home1.net is registered, the public user
identity sip:user1_public2\@home1.net can automatically be registered.
Therefore the entries in the body of the NOTIFY request look like:
\
\
\
\
\sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]\
\
\
\
\
\
\sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]\
\
\
\
\
> EXAMPLE 2: If sip:user1_public1\@home1.net is registered, the public user
> identity sip:ep_user1\@home1.net can automatically be registered.
> sip:ep_user1\@home1.net is a dedicated identity out of the related range
> indicated in the \ element. Therefore the entries in the
> body of the NOTIFY request look like:
\
\
\
\
\sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]\
\
\
\
\
\sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]\
\
\
\
\
\
When sending a final NOTIFY request with all \ element(s) having
their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user identities
have been deregistered, expired or are hosted (unregistered case) at the
S-CSCF), the S-CSCF shall also terminate the subscription to the registration
event package by setting the Subscription-State header field to the value of
\"terminated\".
When all of a UE\'s contact addresses have been deregistered (i.e.there is no
\ element set to \"active\" for this UE), the S-CSCF shall consider
subscription to the reg event package belonging to the UE cancelled (i.e. as
if the UE had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires header field containing
a value of zero).
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
When the S-CSCF receives any response to the NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall
store the value of the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field, if present.
NOTE 9: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the response was
sent.
##### 5.4.2.1.3 Void
##### 5.4.2.1.4 Void
#### 5.4.2.2 Other subscriptions
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with the Subscription-State header field set
to \"terminated\"and the S-CSCF has retained the SIP dialog state information
for the associated subscription, once the NOTIFY transaction is terminated,
the S-CSCF can remove all the stored information related to the associated
subscription.
### 5.4.3 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding requests terminated by the S-CSCF
#### 5.4.3.1 Determination of UE-originated or UE-terminated case
Upon receipt of an initial request or a stand-alone transaction, the S-CSCF
shall:
\- perform the procedures for the UE-originating case as described in
subclause 5.4.3.2 if the request makes use of the information for UE-
originating calls, which was added to the Service-Route header field entry of
the S-CSCF during registration (see subclause 5.4.1.2), e.g. the message is
received at a certain port or the topmost Route header field contains a
specific user part or parameter; or,
\- perform the procedures for the UE-originating case as described in
subclause 5.4.3.2 if the topmost Route header field of the request contains
the \"orig\" parameter. The S-CSCF shall remove the \"orig\" parameter from
the topmost Route header field; or,
\- perform the procedures for the UE-terminating case as described in
subclause 5.4.3.3 if this information is not used by the request.
#### 5.4.3.2 Requests initiated by the served user
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the S-CSCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE 1 The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
When the S-CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog, which
contains a GRUU and an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter in the Contact header field,
and multiple contact addresses have been registered for the specific GRUU,
then for all subsequent in-dialog requests sent toward the UE\'s, the S-CSCF
shall populate the Request-URI with the registered contact address from which
the UE sent the initial request for the dialog.
NOTE 2: When a given contact address is registered, the S-CSCF can use a
dedicated value in its Service-Route header field entry to identify the given
contact address. When the S-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog, the
S-CSCF can find out from which contact address the initial request was sent by
looking at the preloaded Route header field (constructed from the Service-
Route header field returned in the response for the REGISTER request) which
contains the entry of the S-CSCF.
When performing SIP digest without TLS, when the S-CSCF receives from the
served user an initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone
transaction, the S-CSCF may perform the steps in subclause 5.4.3.6 to
challenge the request based on local policy.
NOTE 3: If the user registration is associated with the state \"tls-
protected\", then the execution of Proxy-Authorization as described in
subclause 5.4.3.6 is still possible, although it is unlikely this would add
additional security provided the P-CSCF is trusted. Thus, in most cases the
state \"tls-protected\" will be reason for the S-CSCF to not desire Proxy-
Authentication for this user.
NOTE 4: The option for the S-CSCF to challenge the request does not apply to a
request from an AS acting as an originating UA.
When performing GPRS-IMS-Bundled authentication, when the S-CSCF receives from
the served user an initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone
transaction, the S-CSCF shall check whether a \"received\" header field
parameter exists in the Via header field provided by the UE. If a \"received\"
header field parameter exists, S-CSCF shall compare the (prefix of the) IP
address received in the \"received\" header field parameter against the UE\'s
IP address (or prefix) stored during registration. If no \"received\" header
field parameter exists in the Via header field provided by the UE, then S-CSCF
shall compare the (prefix of the) IP address received in the \"sent-by\"
parameter against the IP address (or prefix) stored during registration. If
the stored IP address (or prefix) and the (prefix of the) IP address in the
\"received\" Via header field parameter provided by the UE do not match, the
S-CSCF shall reject the request with a 403 (Forbidden) response. In case the
stored IP address (or prefix) and the (prefix of the) IP address in the
\"received\" Via header field parameter provided by the UE do match, the
S-CSCF shall proceed as described in the remainder of this subclause.
When the S-CSCF receives from the served user or from a PSI an initial request
for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, and the request is
received either from a functional entity within the same trust domain or
contains a valid original dialog identifier (see step 3) or the dialog
identifier (From, To and Call-ID header fields) relates to an existing request
processed by the S-CSCF, then prior to forwarding the request, the S-CSCF
shall:
0) if the request is received from a P-CSCF that does not support the trust
domain handling of the P-Served-User header field then remove any P-Served-
User header fields;
1) determine the served user as follows:
a) if the request contains a P-Served-User header field then
i) determine the served user by taking the identity contained in a P-Served-
User header field as defined in RFC 5502 [133]. Then check whether the
determined served user is a barred public user identity. In case the said
header field contains the served user identity is a barred public user
identity for the user, then the S-CSCF shall reject the request by generating
a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, the S-CSCF shall save the public user
identity of the served user and continue with the rest of the steps;
b) if the request does not contain a P-Served-User header field then
i) determine the served user by taking the identity contained in one of the
URI(s) of the P-Asserted-Identity header field. In case the determined served
user is a barred public user identity, then the S-CSCF shall reject the
request by generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, the S-CSCF shall
save the public user identity of the served user and continue with the rest of
the steps; and
ii) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains two URIs and the URI
other than the determined served user is not an alias of the determined served
user or is barred then act based on local policy, e.g. reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response or remove the URI not identifying the
determined served user from the P-Asserted-Identity header field;
NOTE 5: If the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains a barred public user
identity, then the message has been received, either directly or indirectly,
from a non-compliant entity which should have had generated the content with a
non-barred public user identity.
1A) if the Contact is a GRUU, but is not valid as defined in subclause
5.4.7A.4, then return a 4xx response as specified in RFC 5627 [93];
2) store the value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field if present, and remove it from any forwarded
request;
NOTE 6: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the request was sent
(AS initiating a session on behalf of a user or a PSI);
3) check if an original dialog identifier that the S-CSCF previously placed in
a Route header field is present in the topmost Route header field of the
incoming request.
\- If not present, the S-CSCF shall build an ordered list of initial filter
criteria based on the public user identity of the served user (as determined
in step 1) of the received request as described in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5].
\- If present, the request has been sent from an AS in response to a
previously sent request, an ordered list of initial filter criteria already
exists and the S-CSCF shall not change the ordered list of initial filter
criteria even if the AS has changed the P-Served-User header field or the or
the P-Asserted-Identity header field;
NOTE 7: An original dialog identifier is sent to each AS invoked due to iFC
evaluation such that the S-CSCF can associate requests as part of the same
sequence that trigger iFC evaluation in priority order (and not rely on SIP
dialog information that may change due to B2BUA AS). If the same original
dialog identifier is included in more than one request from a particular AS
(based on service logic in the AS), then the S-CSCF will continue the iFC
evaluation sequence rather than build a new ordered list of iFC;
4) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field;
4A) if there was an original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request and the request is received from a
functional entity within the same trust domain and contains a P-Asserted-
Service header field, continue the procedure with step 5;
4B) if the request contains a P-Preferred-Service header field, check whether
the ICSI value contained in the P-Preferred-Service header field is part of
the set of the subscribed services for the served user and determine whether
the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header
field) match the ICSI for the subscribed service:
a) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise remove the P-Preferred-
Service header field and continue with the rest of the steps; and
b) if so, then include a P-Asserted-Service header field in the request
containing the ICSI value contained in the P-Preferred-Service header field,
remove the P-Preferred-Service header field, and continue the procedure with
step 5;
4C) if the request does not contain a P-Preferred-Service header field, check
whether the contents of the request match a subscribed service for each and
any of the subscribed services for the served user:
a) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response; and
b) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service requires the use of an ICSI value then select an
ICSI value for the related IMS communication service and include a P-Asserted-
Service header field in the request containing the selected ICSI value; and
c) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service does not require the use of an ICSI value then
continue without including an ICSI value; and
d) if so, and if the request does not relate to an IMS communication service
(or if the S-CSCF is unable to unambiguously determine the service being
requested but decides to allow the session to continue) then continue without
inclding an ICSI value;
5) check whether the initial request matches any unexecuted initial filter
criteria. If there is a match, then the S-CSCF shall select the first matching
unexecuted initial filter criteria from the ordered list of initial filter
criteria and the S-CSCF shall:
a) insert the AS URI to be contacted into the Route header field as the
topmost entry followed by its own URI populated as specified in the subclause
5.4.3.4;
b) if the S-CSCF supports the P-Served-User extension as specified in RFC 5502
[133] insert P-Served-User header field populated with the served user
identity as determined in step 1;
c) if the AS is located outside the trust domain then the S-CSCF shall remove
the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header
field from the request that is forwarded to the AS; if the AS is located
within the trust domain, then the S-CSCF shall retain the access-network-
charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field in the request
that is forwarded to the AS; and
d) insert a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter in place of any
received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameters in the P-Charging-Vector header
field. The S-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to
a value that identifies the sending network of the request. The S-CSCF shall
not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter;
NOTE 8: Depending on the result of processing the filter criteria the S-CSCF
might contact one or more AS(s) before processing the outgoing Request-URI.
> NOTE 9: An AS can activate or deactivate its own filter criteria via the Sh
> interface. As the S-CSCF checks initial filter criteria only on receipt of
> an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, a modified
> service profile will have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in
> progress and the modified profile will be effective only for new
> transactions and dialogs. If the S-CSCF receives a modification of the iFC
> during their execution, then it should not update the stored initial Filter
> Criteria until the iFC related to the initial request have been completely
> executed.
6) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request store the value of the \"icid-value\"
header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field and
retain the \"icid-value\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field. Optionally, the S-CSCF may generate a new, globally unique ICID
and insert the new value in the \"icid-value\" header field parameter of the
P-Charging-Vector header field when forwarding the message. If the S-CSCF
creates a new ICID, then it is responsible for maintaining the two ICID values
in the subsequent messaging;
7) in step 5, if the initial request did not match any unexecuted initial
filter criteria (i.e. the request is not forwarded to an AS), insert an
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter into the P-Charging-Vector header field.
The S-CSCF shall set the type 2 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to a value
that identifies the sending network. The S-CSCF shall not include the type 2
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter;
8) insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field populated with values
received from the HSS if the request does not contain a Charging-Function-
Addresses header field and the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home
network, including towards AS;
9) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request and if the served user is not considered
a priviledged sender then:
a) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains only a SIP URI and if the
S-CSCF has knowledge that the SIP URI contained in the received P-Asserted-
Identity header field is an alias SIP URI for a tel URI, add a second
P-Asserted-Identity header field containing this tel-URI, including the
display name associated with the tel URI, if available; and
b) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains only a tel URI, the S-CSCF
shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field containing a SIP URI. The
added SIP URI shall contain in the user part a \"+\" followed by the
international public telecommunication number contained in tel URI, and
user\'s home domain name in the hostport part. The added SIP URI shall contain
the same value in the display name as contained in the tel URI. The S-CSCF
shall also add a \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\" to the SIP URI;
NOTE 10: The S-CSCF recognizes that a given SIP URI is an alias SIP URI of a
tel URI, since this grouping is sent from the HSS (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]).
If tel URI is shared URI so is the alias SIP URI.
10) if the request is not forwarded to an AS and if the outgoing Request-URI
is:
\- a SIP URI with the user part starting with a + and the \"user\" SIP URI
parameter equals \"phone\", and if configured per local operator policy, the
S-CSCF shall perform the procedure described here. Local policy can dictate
whether this procedure is performed for all domains of the SIP URI, only if
the domain belongs to the home network, or not at all. If local policy
indicates that the procedure is to be performed, then the S-CSCF shall
translate the international public telecommunications number contained in the
user part of the SIP URI (see RFC 3966 [22]) to a globally routeable SIP URI
using either an ENUM/DNS translation mechanism with the format specified in
RFC 3761 [24], or any other available database. Database aspects of ENUM are
outside the scope of the present document. An S-CSCF that implements the
additional routeing functionality described in annex I may forward the request
without attempting translation. If a translation is in fact performed and it
succeeds, the S-CSCF shall update the Request-URI with the globally routeable
SIP URI either returned by ENUM/DNS or obtained from any other available
database. If this translation fails, the request may be forwarded to a BGCF or
any other appropriate entity (e.g. a MRFC to play an announcement) in the
originator\'s home network or the S-CSCF may send an appropriate SIP response
to the originator. When forwarding the request to a BGCF or any other
appropriate entity, the S-CSCF shall leave the original Request-URI containing
the SIP URI with \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals phone unmodified. If the
request is forwarded, the S-CSCF shall remove the access-network-charging-info
parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field prior to forwarding the
message;
\- a SIP URI with a \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"dialstring\" and the
domain name of the SIP URI belongs to the home network (i.e. the local number
analysis and handling is either failed in the appropriate AS or the request
has not been forwarded to AS for local number analysis and handling at all),
either forward the request to any appropriate entity (e.g a MRFC to play an
announcement) in the originator\'s home network or send an appropriate SIP
response to the originator;
\- a SIP URI with a local number (see RFC 3966 [22]) in the user part and a
\"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\" and the domain name of the SIP URI
belongs to the home network (i.e. the local number analysis and handling is
either failed in the appropriate AS or the request has not been forwarded to
AS for local number analysis and handling at all), either forward the request
to to a BGCFor any appropriate entity (e.g a MRFC to play an announcement) in
the originator\'s home network or send an appropriate SIP response to the
originator;
\- a tel URI containing a global number (see RFC 3966 [22]) in the
international format, the S-CSCF shall translate the E.164 address to a
globally routeable SIP URI using either an ENUM/DNS translation mechanism with
the format specified in RFC 3761 [24], or any other available database.
Database aspects of ENUM are outside the scope of the present document. An
S-CSCF that implements the additional routeing functionality described in
Annex I may forward the request without attempting translation. If this
translation is in fact performed and it succeeds, the S-CSCF shall update the
Request-URI with the globally routeable SIP URI returned by ENUM/DNS. If this
translation fails, the request may be forwarded to a BGCF or any other
appropriate entity (e.g a MRFC to play an announcement) in the originator\'s
home network or the S-CSCF may send an appropriate SIP response to the
originator. When forwarding the request to a BGCF or any other appropriate
entity, the S-CSCF shall leave the original Request-URI containing the tel URI
unmodified. If the request is forwarded, the S-CSCF shall remove the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field prior
to forwarding the message;
\- a tel URI containing a local number (see RFC 3966 [22]) (i.e. the local
number analysis and handling is either failed in the appropriate AS or the
request has not been forwarded to AS for local number analysis and handling at
all), either forward the request to a BGCF or any other appropriate entity
(e.g. a MRFC to play an announcement) in the originator\'s home network or
send an appropriate SIP response to the originator; and
\- a pres URI or an im URI, the S-CSCF shall forward the request as specified
in RFC 3861 [63]. In this case, the S-CSCF shall not modify the received
Request-URI.
NOTE 11: If there is no SIP-based transport found after applying the procedure
specified in RFC 3861 [63], the S-CSCF can forward the request to a
translating gateway.
> Additional procedures apply if the S-CSCF supports NP capabilities and these
> capabilities are enabled by local policy, and the database used for
> translation from an international public telecommunications number to a SIP
> URI also provides NP data (for example, based on the PSTN Enumservice as
> defined by RFC 4769 [114] or other appropriate data bases) . If the above
> translation from an international public telecommunications number to a SIP
> URI failed, but NP data was obtained from the database and there is no
> \"npdi\" parameter in the received request, then the S-CSCF shall, based on
> operator policy, update the URI in the Request-URI with the obtained NP
> data, prior to forwarding the request to the BGCF or other appropriate
> entity. If the received request already contains a tel-URI \"npdi\"
> parameter, then the S-CSCF may update the URI with the obtained NP data. The
> URI is updated by the S-CSCF by adding NP parameters defined by RFC 4694
> [112]. If the Request-URI is a tel-URI, then an \"npdi\" tel-URI parameter
> is added to indicate that NP data retrieval has been performed, and if the
> number is ported, an \"rn\" tel-URI parameter is added to identify the
> ported-to routeing number. If the Request-URI is in the form of a SIP URI
> user=phone, the \"npdi\" and \"rn\" tel-URI parameters are added as
> described above to the userinfo part of the SIP URI;
11) determine the destination address (e.g. DNS access) using the URI placed
in the topmost Route header field if present, otherwise based on the Request-
URI. If the destination requires interconnect functionalities (e.g. the
destination address is of an IP address type other than the IP address type
used in the IM CN subsystem), the S-CSCF shall forward the request to the
destination address via an IBCF in the same network;
12) if network hiding is needed due to local policy, put the address of the
IBCF to the topmost Route header field;
13) in case of an initial request for a dialog:
a) determine the need for GRUU processing. GRUU processing is required if:
\- an original dialog identifier that the S-CSCF previously placed in a Route
header field is not present in the topmost Route header field of the incoming
request (this means the request is not returning after having been sent to an
AS), and
\- the contact address contains a GRUU that was assigned by the S-CSCF that is
valid as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.4.
b) if GRUU processing is not required and the initial request originated from
a served user, then determine the need to record-route for other reasons:
\- if the request is routed to an AS which is part of the trust domain, the
S-CSCF shall decide, based on operator policy, whether to record-route or not.
The decision is configured in the S-CSCF using any information in the received
request that may otherwise be used for the initial filter criteria. If the
request is record-routed the S-CSCF shall create a Record-Route header field
containing its own SIP URI;
\- if the request is a SUBSCRIBE request and routed elsewhere, the S-CSCF
shall decide, based on operator policy, whether to record-route or not. The
decision is configured in the S-CSCF using any information in the received
request (e.g. event package name). If the request is record-routed the S-CSCF
shall create a Record-Route header field containing its own SIP URI; or
NOTE 12: Some subscriptions to event packages (e.g. presence) can result in
virtually persistent subscriptions and if the S-CSCF Record-Routes this can
prevent reassignment of the S-CSCF.
NOTE 13: If the S-CSCF does not Record-Route the initial SUBSCRIBE request, it
will not be possible to perform SIP digest authentication of SIP requests sent
inside the SIP dialog related to the associated subscription.
\- if the request not a SUBSCRIBE request and is routed elsewhere, create a
Record-Route header field containing its own SIP URI;
NOTE 14: For requests originated from a PSI the S-CSCF can decide whether to
record-route or not based on operator policy.
c) if GRUU processing is required, the S-CSCF shall create a Record-Route
header field containing its own SIP URI;
d) if GRUU processing is required, the S-CSCF shall save an indication that
GRUU-routeing is to be performed for in-dialog requests that reach the S-CSCF
because of the Record-route header field added in step c);
NOTE 15: The manner of representing the GRUU-routeing indication is a private
matter for the S-CSCF. The indication is used during termination processing of
in-dialog requests to cause the S-CSCF to replace a Request-URI containing a
GRUU with the corresponding registered contact address. It can be saved using
values in the Record-Route header field, or in dialog state.
14) based on the destination user (Request-URI), remove any P-Access-Network-
Info header field and the access-network-charging-info parameter in the
P-Charging-Vector header field prior to forwarding the message;
14A) if the request is not routed to an AS, remove the P-Served-User header
field prior to forwarding the request;
15) route the request based on SIP routeing procedures; and
16) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, Cseq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the S-CSCF is able
to release the session if needed.
When the S-CSCF receives, an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction, from an AS acting on behalf of an unregistered user,
the S-CSCF shall:
1) execute the procedures described in the steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 4A, 4B, 4C, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 in the above paragraph (when the S-CSCF
receives, from a registered served user, an initial request for a dialog or a
request for a standalone transaction).
NOTE 16: When the S-CSCF does not have the user profile, before executing the
actions as listed above, it initiates the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration
notification procedure, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]; with the purpose
of downloading the relevant user profile (i.e. for unregistered user) and
informs the HSS that the user is unregistered. The S-CSCF will assess
triggering of services for the unregistered user, as described in 3GPP TS
29.228 [14].
When the S-CSCF receives a request initiated by the served user for which the
S-CSCF does not have the user profile or does not trust the data that it has
(e.g. due to restart), the S-CSCF shall attempt to retrieve the user profile
from the HSS. If the S-CSCF fails to retrieve the user profile and the S-CSCF
supports restoration procedures, then the S-CSCF shall:
1) reject the request by returning a 504 (Server Time-out) response to the UE;
2) assume that the UE supports version 1 of the XML Schema for the 3GPP IM CN
subsystem XML body if support for the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as
described in subclause 7.6 in the Accept header field is not indicated; and
3) include in the 504 (Server Time-out) response:
\- a Content-Type header field with the value set to associated MIME type of
the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6.1;
\- a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to the value of the SIP URI of the
S-CSCF included in the Service-Route header field (see subclause 5.4.1.2.2F)
during the registration of the user whose UE sent the request causing this
response; and
\- a 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body:
a) an \ element with the \"version\" attribute set to \"1\" and with
an \ child element, set to the parameters of the
alternative service;
i) a \ child element, set to \"restoration\" (see table 7.7AA) to
indicate that restoration procedures are supported;
ii) a \ child element, set to an operator configurable reason; and
iii) an \ child element, set to \"initial-registration\" (see table
7.7AB).
NOTE 17: These procedures do not prevent the usage of unspecified reliability
or recovery techniques above and beyond those specified in this subclause.
If the S-CSCF fails to receive a SIP response or receives a 408 (Request
Timeout) response or a 5xx response from the AS, the S-CSCF shall:
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_CONTINUED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or no default
handling is indicated, execute the procedure from step 5; and
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_TERMINATED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], either forward the
received response or, if the request is an initial INVITE request, send a 408
(Request Timeout) response or a 5xx response towards the served UE as
appropriate (without verifying the matching of filter criteria of lower
priority and without proceeding for further steps).
If the S-CSCF receives any final response from the AS, the S-CSCF shall
forward the response towards the served UE (without verifying the matching of
filter criteria of lower priority and without proceeding for further steps).
When the S-CSCF receives any response to the above request, the S-CSCF may:
1) apply any privacy required by RFC 3323 [33] and RFC 3325 [34] to the
P-Asserted-Identity header field.
NOTE 18: The P-Asserted-Identity header field would normally only be expected
in 1xx or 2xx responses.
NOTE 19: The optional procedure above is in addition to any procedure for the
application of privacy at the edge of the trust domain specified by RFC 3325
[34].
When the S-CSCF receives any response to the above request containing a
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter, the S-CSCF shall store the value of the
received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header field, if present, and remove all received \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-
ioi\" header field parameters from the forwarded response if next hop is not
an AS.
NOTE 20: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 2 IOI
or type 3 IOI. The IOI identifies the sending network of the response message.
When the S-CSCF receives any response to the above request, and forwards it to
AS, the S-CSCF shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the request, and a type 3
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter in the response. The S-CSCF shall set the
type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
sending network of the response and the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter is set to the previously received value of type 3 \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter.
When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the initial request for a
dialog, if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, the S-CSCF shall
save the Contact and Record-Route header field values in the response in order
to be able to release the session if needed.
When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to an initial request for a
dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, if the response is forwarded
within the S-CSCF home network and not to an AS, the S-CSCF shall insert a
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field populated with values received from
the HSS if the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network, and if
next hop is not AS.
When the S-CSCF, upon sending an initial INVITE request that includes an IP
address in the SDP offer (in \"c=\" parameter), receives an error response
indicating that the the IP address type is not supported, (e.g., the S-CSCF
receives the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) with 301 Warning header field
indicating \"incompatible network address format\"), the S-CSCF shall either:
\- fork the initial INVITE request to the IBCF; or
\- process the error response and forward it using the Via header field.
NOTE 21: If the S-CSCF knows that the originating UE supports both IPv6 and
IPv4 addresses simultaneously, the S-CSCF will forward the error response to
the UE using the Via header field.
When the S-CSCF receives from the served user a target refresh request for a
dialog, prior to forwarding the request the S-CSCF shall:
0A) if the dialog is related to an IMS communication service determine whether
the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header
field) match the IMS communication service as received as the ICSI value in
the P-Asserted-Service header field in the initial request. As an operator
option, if the contents of the request do not match the IMS communication
service the S-CSCF may reject the request by generating a status code
reflecting which added contents are not matching. Otherwise, continue with the
rest of the steps;
1) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header field;
2) create a Record-Route header field containing its own SIP URI;
3) for INVITE dialogs (i.e. dialogs initiated by an INVITE request), save the
Contact and Cseq header field values received in the request such that the
S-CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
4) in case the request is routed towards the destination user (Request-URI) or
in case the request is routed to an AS located outside the trust domain,
remove the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field; and
5) route the request based on the topmost Route header field.
When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the target refresh request
for an INVITE dialog, the S-CSCF shall replace the saved Contact header field
values in the response such that the S-CSCF is able to release the session if
needed.
When the S-CSCF receives from the served user a subsequent request other than
a target refresh request for a dialog, prior to forwarding the request the
S-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header field;
2) in case the request is routed towards the destination user (Request-URI) or
in case the request is routed to an AS located outside the trust domain,
remove the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field; and
3) route the request based on the topmost Route header field.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the S-CSCF shall not recurse
on 3xx responses.
#### 5.4.3.3 Requests terminated at the served user
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the S-CSCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment such trasactions or dialogs.
NOTE 1: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
When the S-CSCF receives, destined for a statically pre-configured PSI or a
registered served user, an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction, and the request is received either from a functional
entity within the same trust domain or contains a valid original dialog
identifier or the dialog identifier (From, To and Call-ID header fields)
relates to an existing request processed by the S-CSCF, then prior to
forwarding the request, the S-CSCF shall:
1) check if an original dialog identifier that the S-CSCF previously placed in
a Route header field is present in the topmost Route header field of the
incoming request.
\- If present, the request has been sent from an AS in response to a
previously sent request.
\- If not present, it indicates that the request is visiting the S-CSCF for
the first time and in this case the S-CSCF shall determine the served user by
taking the identity contained in the Request-URI. If the Request-URI is a
temporary GRUU assigned by the S-CSCF as defined in subclause 5.4.7A.3, then
take the public user identity that is associated with the temporary GRUU to be
the served user identity. Then check whether the determined served user
identity is a barred public user identity. In case the served user identity is
a barred public user identity for the user, then the S-CSCF shall reject the
request by generating a 404 (Not Found) response. Otherwise, the S-CSCF shall
save the Request-URI from the request, the served user identity and the public
user identity of the served user and continue with the rest of the steps;
NOTE 2: An original dialog identifier is sent to each AS invoked due to iFC
evaluation such that the S-CSCF can associate requests as part of the same
sequence that trigger iFC evaluation in priority order (and not rely on SIP
dialog information that may change due to B2BUA AS). If the same original
dialog identifier is included in more than one request from a particular AS
(based on service logic in the AS), then the S-CSCF will continue the iFC
evaluation sequence rather than build a new ordered list of iFC;
2) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header field;
2A) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request build an ordered list of initial filter
criteria based on the public user identity in the Request-URI of the received
request as described in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5].
NOTE 3: When the S-CSCF does not have the user profile, before executing the
actions as listed above, it initiates the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration
notification procedure, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]; with the purpose
of downloading the relevant user profile (i.e. for unregistered user) and
informs the HSS that the user is unregistered. The S-CSCF will assess
triggering of services for the unregistered user, as described in 3GPP TS
29.228 [14].
3) if there was an original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request then check whether the Request-URI
matches the saved Request-URI. The Request-URI and saved Request-URI are
considered a match:
a) if the canonical forms of the two Request-URI are equal to the saved value
of the Request-URI;
b) if the Request-URI is a GRUU (public or temporary) and the saved value of
the Request-URI is a GRUU (public or temporary) and both GRUUs represent the
same public user identity; or
c) if the Request-URI is an alias SIP URI of the saved value of the Request-
URI.
NOTE 4: The canonical form of the Request-URI is obtained by removing all URI
parameters (including the user-param), and by converting any escaped
characters into unescaped form. The alias SIP URI is defined in subclause 3.1.
If there is no match, then the S-CSCF shall decide whether to trigger the
originating services to be executed after retargeting. The decision is
configured in the S-CSCF and may use any information in the received request
that is used for the initial filter criteria or an operator policy. The S-CSCF
shall decide either to:
NOTE 5: The S-CSCF will assess triggering of services for the originating
services after retargeting, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] \"Assess
triggering of services for the originating services after retargeting\" means
setting the SessionCase parameter (defined in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]) to a value
belonging to the \"originating services after retargeting\" case.
a) stop evaluating current iFC. In that case, if the request is an INVITE
request, save the Contact, CSeq and Record-Route header field values received
in the request such that the S-CSCF is able to release the session if needed,
forward the request based on the topmost Route header field or if not
available forward the request based on the Request-URI (routeing based on
Request-URI is specified in steps 7 and 10 through 14a from subclause 5.4.3.2)
and skip the following steps; or
b) stop evaluating current iFC and build an ordered list of iFC with the
originating services to be executed after retargeting as described in 3GPP TS
23.218 [5] criteria based on the public user identity of the served user and
start the evaluation of that iFC as described in subclause 5.4.3.2 starting at
step 4A of subclause 5.4.3.2;
NOTE 6: The identity of the served user can be obtained from the History-Info
header field (see RFC 4244 [66]) or the P-Served User header field as
specified in RFC 5502 [133]. The served user can be a public user identity, a
public GRUU, or a temporary GRUU. It needs to be ensure, that all ASs in the
iFC can determine the served user correctly.
NOTE 7: The S-CSCF determines whether to apply a) or b) based on information
in the initial Filter Criteria.
3A) if the Request-URI is a GRUU, but is not valid as defined in subclause
5.4.7A.4, then return a 4xx response as specified in RFC 5627 [93];
3B) if the Request-URI contains a public GRUU and the saved value of the
Request-URI is a temporary GRUU, then replace the Request-URI with the saved
value of the Request-URI;
3C) if the request contains a P-Asserted-Service header field check whether
the IMS communication service identified by the ICSI value contained in the
P-Asserted-Service header field is allowed by the subscribed services for the
served user:
a) if so, continue from step 4; and
b) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, remove the P-Asserted-
Service header field and continue with the rest of the steps;
3D) if the request does not contain a P-Asserted-Service header field check if
the contents of the request matches a subscribed service (e.g. SDP media
capabilities, Content-Type header field) for each and any of the subscribed
services for the served user:
a) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of
the steps; and
b) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service requires the use of an ICSI value then include a
P-Asserted-Service header field in the request containing the ICSI value for
the related IMS communication service, and use it as a header field in the
initial request when matching initial filter criteria in step 4; and
c) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service does not require the use of an ICSI value then
continue without including an ICSI value; and
d) if so, and if the request does not relate to an IMS communication service
(or if the S-CSCF is unable to unambiguously determine the service being
requested but decides to allow the session to continue) then continue without
inclding an ICSI value;
4) check whether the initial request matches any unexecuted initial filter
criteria based on the public user identity of the served user in the priority
order and apply the filter criteria on the SIP method as described in 3GPP TS
23.218 [5] subclause 6.5. If there is a match, then the S-CSCF shall select
the first matching unexecuted initial filter criteria and:
\- if the Request-URI is a temporary GRUU as defined in section 5.4.7A.3, then
replace the Request-URI with the public GRUU that is associated with the
temporary GRUU (i.e. the public GRUU representing the same public user
identity and instance ID as the temporary GRUU);
\- insert the AS URI to be contacted into the Route header field as the
topmost entry followed by its own URI populated as specified in the subclause
5.4.3.4;
\- if the S-CSCF supports the P-Served-User extension as specified in RFC 5502
[133], insert the P-Served-User header field populated with the served user
identity as determined in step 1; and
\- insert a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter replacing any received
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field. The
type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter identifies the sending network of
the request message before the received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
The S-CSCF shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter;
NOTE 8: Depending on the result of the previous process, the S-CSCF can
contact one or more AS(s) before processing the outgoing Request-URI.
NOTE 9: If the Request-URI of the received terminating request contains a
temporary GRUU, then step 4 replaces the Request-URI with the associated
public GRUU before invoking the AS, and step 3B restores the original
temporary GRUU when the request is returned from the AS.
> NOTE 10: An AS can activate or deactivate its own filter criteria via the Sh
> interface. As the S-CSCF checks initial filter criteria only on receipt of
> an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, a modified
> service profile will have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in
> progress and the modified profile will be effective only for new
> transactions and dialogs. If the S-CSCF receives a modification of the iFC
> during their execution, then it should not update the stored initial Filter
> Criteria until the iFC related to the initial request have been completely
> executed.
5) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses
header field, if not present, populated with values received from the HSS if
the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network, including towards AS;
6) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request store the value of the \"icid-value\"
header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field and
retain the \"icid-value\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field;
7) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header field of the incoming request store the value of the \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field, if
present, and remove received \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\" header field
parameters from the forwarded request if next hop is not an AS;
NOTE 11: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 2
IOI. or type 3 IOI. The type 2 IOI identifies the sending network of the
request message.
8) in the case:
i) there are no Route header fields in the request; and
ii) there are bindings saved during registration or re-registration as
described in subclause 5.4.1.2 which are not marked as created by an emergency
registration as described in subclause 5.4.8.2;
then, create a target set of potential routes from the the list of preloaded
routes associated with the bindings in item 8) ii), as follows:
a) if the Request-URI contains a valid GRUU assigned by the S-CSCF as defined
in subclause 5.4.7A.4, then the target set is determined by following the
procedures for Request Targeting specified in RFC 5627 [93], using the public
user identity and instance ID derived from the GRUU using the procedures of
subclause 5.4.7A;
b) if the Request-URI contains a public user identity or a GRUU not assigned
by the S-CSCF, then the target set is all the registered contacts saved for
the destination public user identity;
NOTE 12: In this release of the specification, use of preloaded routes saved
during registration or re-registration which created or refreshed bindings
marked as created by an emergency registration is out of scope.
9) if necessary perform the caller preferences to callee capabilities matching
according to RFC 3841 [56B] to the target set;
NOTE 13: This might eliminate entries and reorder the target set.
10) in case there are no Route header fields in the request:
a) if there is more than one route in the target set determined in steps 8)
and 9) above:
\- if the fork directive in the Request Disposition header field was set to
\"no-fork\", use the contact with the highest qvalue parameter to build the
target URI. In case no qvalue parameters were provided, the S-CSCF shall
decide locally what contact address to be used to build the target URI;
\- if the fork directive in the Request Disposition header field was not set
to \"no-fork\", fork the request or perform sequential search based on the
relative preference indicated by the qvalue parameter of the Contact header
field in the REGISTER request, as described in RFC 3261 [26]. In case no
qvalue parameters were provided, then the S-CSCF determine the contact address
to be used to build the target URI as directed by the Request Disposition
header field as described in RFC 3841 [56B]. If the Request-Disposition header
field is not present, the S-CSCF shall decide locally whether to fork or
perform sequential search among the contact addresses;
\- in case that no route is chosen, return a 480 (Temporarily unavailable)
response or another appropriate unsuccessful SIP response and terminate these
procedures;
\- per the rules defined in RFC 5626 [92], the S-SCSF shall not populate the
target set with more than one contact with the same public user identity and
instance-id at a time. If a request for a particular public user identity and
instance-id fails with a 430 response, the S-CSCF shall replace the failed
branch with another target with the same public user identity and instance-id,
but a different reg-id; and
\- if two bindings have the same instance-id and reg-id, it should prefer the
contact that was most recently updated.
b) If no \"loose route\" indication has been received, in the service profile
of the served public user identity, from the HSS during registration, build
the Request-URI with the contents of the target URI determined in the previous
step, otherwise the Request-URI is retained as received;
c) insert a P-Called-Party-ID SIP header field containing the contents of the
Request-URI received in the request unless the Request-URI contains a
temporary GRUU in which case insert the public GRUU in the P-Called-Party-ID;
d) build the Route header field with the Path values from the chosen route and
if \"loose route\" indication has been received, in the service profile of the
served user identity, from the HSS during registration and the selected
contact address was not registered as described in RFC 5626 [92], add the
content of the target URI determined in step a), as last URI of the route. If
the selected contact address was registered as described in RFC 5626 [92], the
target URI determined in step a) is not added to the Route header field; and
e) save the Request-URI and the total number of Record-Route header fields as
part of the dialog request state.
NOTE 14: For each initial dialog request terminated at a served user two
pieces of state are maintained to assist in processing GRUUs: the chosen
contact address to which the request is routed; and the position of an entry
for the S-CSCF in the Record-Route header field that will be responsible for
GRUU translation, if needed (the position is the number of entries in the list
before the entry was added). The entry will be added in step 5) of the below
procedures for handling S-CSCF receipt any 1xx or 2xx response to the initial
request for a dialog. The S-CSCF can record-route multiple times, but only one
of those (the last) will be responsible for gruu translation at the
terminating end.
11) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, CSeq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the S-CSCF is able
to release the session if needed;
12) optionally, apply any privacy required by RFC 3323 [33] and RFC 3325 [34]
to the P-Asserted-Identity header field and privacy required by RFC 4244 [66];
NOTE 15: The optional procedure above is in addition to any procedure for the
application of privacy at the edge of the trust domain specified by RFC 3325
[34].
13) in case of an initial request for a dialog, either:
\- if the request is routed to an AS which is part of the trust domain, the
S-CSCF shall decide, based on operator policy, whether to record-route or not.
The decision is configured in the S-CSCF using any information in the received
request that may otherwise be used for the initial filter criteria. If the
request is record-routed the S-CSCF shall create a Record-Route header field
containing its own SIP URI; or
\- if the request is routed elsewhere, create a Record-Route header field
containing its own SIP URI;
13A) if the request is routed to the P-CSCF remove the P-User-Database header
field and P-Served-User header field if present; and
14) forward the request based on the topmost Route header field.
If the S-CSCF fails to receive a SIP response or receives a 408 (Request
Timeout) response or a 5xx response from the AS, the S-CSCF shall:
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_CONTINUED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or no default
handling is indicated, execute the procedure from step 4; and
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_TERMINATED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], either forward the
received response or, if the request is an initial INVITE request, send a 408
(Request Timeout) response or a 5xx response towards the originating UE as
appropriate (without verifying the matching of filter criteria of lower
priority and without proceeding for further steps).
If the S-CSCF receives any final response from the AS, the S-CSCF shall
forward the response towards the originating UE (without verifying the
matching of filter criteria of lower priority and without proceeding for
further steps).
When the S-CSCF receives any response to the above request and forwards it to
AS, the S-CSCF shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the request, and a type 3
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter in the response. The S-CSCF shall set the
type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
sending network of the response and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is
set to the previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
NOTE 16: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3
IOI. The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the response
was sent.
When the S-CSCF receives, destined for an unregistered user, an initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the S-CSCF
shall:
1) Void.
2) execute the procedures described in 1, 2, 3, 3C, 3D, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13,
13B, 13C and 14 in the above paragraph (when the S-CSCF receives, destined for
the registered served user, an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction).
3) In case that no more AS needs to be contacted, then S-CSCF shall return an
appropriate unsuccessful SIP response. This response may be a 480 (Temporarily
unavailable) and terminate these procedures.
NOTE 17: When the S-CSCF does not have the user profile, before executing the
actions as listed above, it initiates the S-CSCF Registration/deregistration
notification procedure, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]; with the purpose
of downloading the relevant user profile (i.e. for unregistered user) and
informs the HSS that the user is unregistered. The S-CSCF will assess
triggering of services for the unregistered user, as described in 3GPP TS
29.228 [14]. When requesting the user profile the S-CSCF can include the
information in the P-Profile-Key header field in S-CSCF
Registration/deregistration notification.
Prior to performing S-CSCF Registration/Deregistration procedure with the HSS,
the S-CSCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a result of a query to the
Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14] or use the value as received in the P-User-Database header field in the
initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction as
defined in RFC 4457 [82]. The HSS address received in the response to SLF
query can be used to address the HSS of the public user identity with further
queries.
If the HSS indicates to the S-CSCF that there is already another S-CSCF
assigned for the user, the S-CSCF shall return a 305 (Use Proxy) response
containing the SIP URI of the assigned S-CSCF received from the HSS in the
Contact header field.
When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the initial request for a
dialog (whether the user is registered or not), the S-CSCF shall:
1) if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, save the Contact and
Record-Route header field values in the response such that the S-CSCF is able
to release the session if needed;
2) if the response is not forwarded to an AS (i.e. the response is related to
a request that was matched to the first executed initial filter criteria),
insert a type 2 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field of the outgoing response. The type 2 \"term-ioi\" header field is
set to a value that identifies the sending network of the response and the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously received value of
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. Values of \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\"
header field parameters in the received response are removed;
3) in case the served user is not considered a priviledged sender then:
a) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains only a SIP URI and in the
case where the S-CSCF has knowledge that the SIP URI contained in the received
P-Asserted-Identity header field is an alias SIP URI for a tel URI, the S-CSCF
shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field containing this tel URI,
including the display name associated with the tel URI, if available; and
b) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains only a tel URI, the S-CSCF
shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field containing a SIP URI. The
added SIP URI shall contain in the user part a \"+\" followed by the
international public telecommunication number contained in tel URI, and
user\'s home domain name in the hostport part. The added SIP URI shall contain
the same value in the display name as contained in the tel URI. The S-CSCF
shall also add a \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\" to the SIP URI;
4) in case the response is sent towards the originating user, the S-CSCF may
retain the P-Access-Network-Info header field based on local policy rules and
the destination user (Request-URI); and
5) save an indication that GRUU routeing is to be performed for subsequent
requests sent within this same dialog if:
a) there is a record-route position saved as part of the initial dialog
request state;
b) the contact address in the response is a valid GRUU assigned by the S-CSCF
as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.4; and
NOTE 18: There could be several responses returned for a single request, and
the decision to insert or modify the Record-Route needs to be applied to each.
But a response might also return to the S-CSCF multiple times as it is routed
back through AS. The S-CSCF will take this into account when carrying out step
5) to ensure that the information is stored only once.
6) if the response is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network and not to an
AS, insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field populated with values
received from the HSS.
When the S-CSCF receives a response to a request for a standalone transaction
(whether the user is registered or not), then:
1) in case the served user is not considered a priviledged sender then:
a) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains only a SIP URI and in the
case where the S-CSCF has knowledge that the SIP URI contained in the received
P-Asserted-Identity header field is an alias SIP URI for a tel URI, the S-CSCF
shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field containing this tel URI,
including the display name associated with the tel URI, if available; and
b) if the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains only a tel URI, the S-CSCF
shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header field containing a SIP URI. The
added SIP URI shall contain in the user part a \"+\" followed by the
international public telecommunication number contained in tel URI, and
user\'s home domain name in the hostport part. The added SIP URI shall contain
the same value in the display name as contained in the tel URI. The S-CSCF
shall also add a \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\" to the SIP URI;
and
2) in case the response is forwarded to an AS that is located within the trust
domain, the S-CSCF shall retain the access-network-charging-info parameter in
the P-Charging-Vector header field; otherwise, the S-CSCF shall remove the
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field.
When the S-CSCF receives the 200 (OK) response for a standalone transaction
request, the S-CSCF shall:
1) insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field populated with values
received from the HSS if the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home
network, including towards an AS; and
2) if the response is not forwarded to an AS (i.e. the response is related to
a request that was matched to the first executed initial filter criteria),
insert a type 2 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field of the outgoing response. The type 2 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter is set to a value that identifies the sending network of the
response and the type 2 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the
previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
NOTE 19: If the S-CSCF forked the request of a stand alone transaction to
multiple UEs and receives multiple 200 (OK) responses, the S-CSCF will select
and return only one 200 (OK) response. The criteria that the S-CSCF employs
when selecting the 200 (OK) response is based on the operator\'s policy (e.g.
return the first 200 (OK) response that was received).
When the S-CSCF receives, destined for a served user, a target refresh request
for a dialog, prior to forwarding the request, the S-CSCF shall:
0) if the dialog is related to an IMS communication service determine whether
the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header
field) match the IMS communication service as received as the ICSI value in
the P-Asserted-Service header field in the initial request. As an operator
option, if the contents of the request do not match the IMS communication
service the S-CSCF may reject the request by generating a status code
reflecting which added contents are not matching. Otherwise, continue with the
rest of the steps;
1) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the Request-URI is not the GRUU for this dialog, then
return a response of 400 (Bad Request).
2) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the Request-URI contains the GRUU for this dialog then the
S-CSCF shall:
\- perform the procedures for Request Targeting specified in RFC 5627 [93],
using the public user identity and instance ID derived from the Request-URI,
as specified in subclause 5.4.7A;
\- if no contact can be selected, return a response of 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable).
3) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header field;
4) for INVITE dialogs (i.e. dialogs initiated by an INVITE request), save the
Contact and Cseq header field values received in the request such that the
S-CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
5) create a Record-Route header field containing its own SIP URI; and
6) forward the request based on the topmost Route header field.
When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the target refresh request
for a dialog (whether the user is registered or not), the S-CSCF shall:
1) for INVITE dialogs, replace the saved Contact header field values in the
response such that the S-CSCF is able to release the session if needed; and
2) in case the response is forwarded to an AS that is located within the trust
domain, the S-CSCF shall retain the access-network-charging-info parameter in
the P-Charging-Vector header field; otherwise, the S-CSCF shall remove the
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field.
When the S-CSCF receives, destined for the served user, a subsequent request
other than target refresh request for a dialog, prior to forwarding the
request, the S-CSCF shall:
1) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the Request-URI is not the GRUU for this dialog, then
return a response of 400 (Bad Request).
2) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the Request-URI contains the GRUU for this dialog then the
S-CSCF shall:
\- perform the procedures for Request Targeting specified in RFC 5627 [93],
using the public user identity and instance ID derived from the Request-URI,
as specified in subclause 5.4.7A;
\- if no contact can be selected, return a response of 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable).
3) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header field; and
4) forward the request based on the topmost Route header field.
When the S-CSCF receives a response to a a subsequent request other than
target refresh request for a dialog, in case the response is forwarded to an
AS that is located within the trust domain, the S-CSCF shall retain the
access-network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header
field; otherwise, the S-CSCF shall remove the access-network-charging-info
parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the S-CSCF shall not recurse
on 3xx responses.
#### 5.4.3.4 Original dialog identifier
The original dialog identifier is an implementation specific token that the
S-CSCF encodes into the own S-CSCF URI in a Route header field, prior to
forwarding the request to an AS. This is possible because the S-CSCF is the
only entity that creates and consumes the value.
The token may identify the original dialog of the request, so in case an AS
acting as a B2BUA changes the dialog, the S-CSCF is able to identify the
original dialog when the request returns to the S-CSCF. In a case of a
standalone transaction, the token indicates that the request has been sent to
the S-CSCF from an AS in response to a previously sent request. The token can
be encoded in different ways, such as e.g., a character string in the user-
part of the S-CSCF URI, a parameter in the Sâ€‘CSCF URI or port number in the
S-CSCF URI.
The S-CSCF shall ensure that the value chosen is unique so that the S-CSCF may
recognize the value when received in a subsequent message of one or more
dialogs and make the proper association between related dialogs that pass
through an AS.
An original dialog identifier is sent to each AS invoked due to iFC evaluation
such that the S-CSCF can associate requests as part of the same sequence that
trigger iFC evaluation in priority order (and not rely on SIP dialog
information that may change due to B2BUA AS).
NOTE: If the same original dialog identifier is included in more than one
request from a particular AS (based on service logic in the AS), then the
S-CSCF will continue the iFC evaluation sequence. If the AS wants iFC
evaluation to start from the beginning for a request, then AS should not
include an original dialog identifier;
#### 5.4.3.5 Void
#### 5.4.3.6 SIP digest authentication procedures for all SIP request methods
initiated by the UE excluding REGISTER
##### 5.4.3.6.1 General
When the S-CSCF receives from the UE a request (excluding REGISTER), and SIP
digest without TLS or SIP digest with TLS is supported and in use for this UE,
the S-CSCF may perform the following steps if authentication of SIP request
methods initiated by the UE excluding REGISTER is desired:
1) The S-CSCF shall identify the user by the public user identity as received
in the P-Asserted-Identity header field;
2) If the public user identity does not match one of the registered public
user identities, and the public user identity does not match one of the
registered wildcarded public user identities, the S-CSCF may reject the
request with a 400 (Bad Request) response or silently discard the request;
3) If the request does not contain a Proxy-Authorization header field or the
Proxy-Authorization header field does not contain a digest response, the
S-CSCF shall:
a) challenge the user by generating a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required)
response for the received request, including a Proxy-Authenticate header field
as defined in RFC 2617 [21], which includes:
\- a \"realm\" header field parameter;
\- a \"nonce\" header field parameter, with a newly generated value by the
S-CSCF;
\- an \"algorithm\" header field parameter; if the algorithm value is not
provided in the authentication vector, it shall have the value \"MD5\"; and
\- a \"qop\" header field parameter; if the qop value is not provided in the
authentication vector, it shall have the value \"auth\".
The challenge parameters, with the exception of the \"nonce\" header field
parameter, shall be the same as the ones used for the last successfull
registration.
NOTE: The usage of the same parameters for authentication of non-registration
SIP requests requires the storage of these parameters during authentication of
REGISTER requests, as retrieval of authentication vectors is only specified
for REGISTER requests.
b) send the so generated 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response towards
the UE; and,
c) retain the nonce and initialize the corresponding nonce count to a value of
1.
4) If the request contains a Proxy-Authorization header field, the S-CSCF
shall:
a) check whether the Proxy-Authorization header field contains:
\- the private user identity of the user in the \"username\" header field
parameter;
\- an \"algorithm\" header field parameter value which matches the
\"algorithm\" header field parameter in the authentication challenge (i.e.
\"MD5\");
\- a \"response\" header field parameter with the authentication challenge
response;
\- a \"realm\" header field parameter matching the \"realm\" header field
parameter in the authentication challenge;
\- \"nonce\" header field parameter matching the expected nonce from either a
recent authentication challenge or a more recent \"nextnonce\" header field
parameter sent in a Proxy-Authentication-Info header field;
\- a \"uri\" header field parameter matching the SIP Request-URI;
\- a \"cnonce\" header field parameter; and
\- a \"nonce-count\" header field parameter with a value that equals the
nonce-count expected by the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF may choose to accept a nonce-
count which is greater than the expected nonce-count. If the S-CSCF uses this
nonce-count and authentication is successful and the S-CSCF increments it for
any subsequent authentication responses.
If any of the above checks do not succeed, the S-CSCF shall proceed as
described in subclause 5.4.3.6.2, and skip the remainder of this procedure.
b) check whether the received authentication challenge response and the
expected authentication challenge response match. The S-CSCF shall compute the
expected digest response as described in RFC 2617 [21] using the H(A1) value
contained within the authentication vector, and other digest parameters (i.e.
nonce, cnonce, nonce-count, qop).
In the case where the digest response does not match the expected digest
response calculated by the S-CSCF, the S-CSCF shall consider the
authentication attempt as failed and do one of the following:
1) rechallenge the user by issuing a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required)
response including a challenge as per procedures described in this subclause;
or
2) reject the request by issuing a 403 (Forbidden) response; or
3) reject the request without sending a response.
In the case where the digest response matches the expected digest response
calculated by the S-CSCF, the S-CSCF shall consider the identity of the user
verified and the request authenticated and continue with the procedures as
described in subclause 5.4.3.
##### 5.4.3.6.2 Abnormal cases
In the case that SIP digest is used and the request from the UE contains an
invalid \"nonce\" Authorization header field parameter with a valid challenge
response for that nonce (indicating that the client knows the correct
username/password), or when the \"nonce-count\" Authorization header field
parameter value sent by the UE is not the expected value, or when the Proxy-
Authorization header field does not include the correct parameters, the S-CSCF
shall:
\- send a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response to initiate a further
authentication attempt with a fresh nonce and the \"stale\" header field
parameter set to \"true\" in the Proxy-Authenticate header field.
### 5.4.4 Call initiation
#### 5.4.4.1 Initial INVITE
When the S-CSCF receives an INVITE request, either from the served user or
destined to the served user, the S-CSCF may require the periodic refreshment
of the session to avoid hung states in the S-CSCF. If the S-CSCF requires the
session to be refreshed, the S-CSCF shall apply the procedures described in
RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 1: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When the S-CSCF receives an initial INVITE request destined for the served
user, the S-CSCF shall either:
a) examine the SDP offer (the \"c=\" parameter) to detect if it contains an IP
address type that is not supported by the IM CN subsystem; or
b) process the initial INVITE request without examining the SDP.
NOTE 2: If the S-CSCF knows that the terminating UE supports both IPv6 and
IPv4 addressing simultaneously, the S-CSCF will forward the initial INVITE
request to the UE without examining the SDP.
NOTE 3: If the SDP offer contained an IP address type that is not supported by
the IM CN subsystem, the S-CSCF will receive the 488 (Not Acceptable Here)
response with 301 Warning header field indicating \"incompatible network
address format\".
Subsequently, when the S-CSCF detects that the SDP offer contained an IP
address type that is not supported by the IM CN subsystem (i.e., either case
a) or b)), the S-CSCF shall either:
\- return a 305 (Use Proxy) response to the I-CSCF with the Contact field
containing the SIP URI of the IBCF, or
\- forward the initial INVITE request to the IBCF. When forwarding the initial
INVITE request, the S-CSCF shall not insert its SIP URI into the Record-Route
header field.
If overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITE method is supported as a
network option, several INVITE requests with the same Call ID and the same
From header field (including \"tag\" header field parameter) can be received
outside of an existing dialog. Such INVITE requests relate to the same call.
If the S-CSCF receives an INVITE request from the served user outside an
existing dialog with the same Call ID and From header field as a previous
INVITE request during a certain period of time, it shall route the new INVITE
request to the same next hop as the previous INVITE request.
#### 5.4.4.2 Subsequent requests
##### 5.4.4.2.1 UE-originating case
When the S-CSCF receives the request containing the access-network-charging-
info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector, the S-CSCF shall store the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field. The
S-CSCF shall retain access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field when the request is forwarded to an AS. However, the
S-CSCF shall not include the access-network-charging-info parameter in the
P-Charging-Vector header field when the request is forwarded outside the home
network of the S-CSCF.
When the S-CSCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a UE-originated dialog or standalone
transaction, the S-CSCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields before forwarding the
message within the S-CSCF home network, including towards AS.
##### 5.4.4.2.2 UE-terminating case
When the S-CSCF receives 180 (Ringing) or 200 (OK) (to INVITE) responses
containing the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector, the S-CSCF shall store the access-network-charging-info parameter from
the P-Charging-Vector header field. The S-CSCF shall retain the access-
network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field when the
response is forwarded to an AS. However, the S-CSCF shall not include the
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field
when the response is forwarded outside the home network of the S-CSCF.
When the S-CSCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a UE-terminated dialog or standalone
transaction, the S-CSCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields before forwarding the
message within the S-CSCF home network, including towards AS.
When the S-CSCF receives an error response (to INVITE) for an existing early
dialog, and if the S-CSCF does not forward the response immediately (if the
S-CSCF forked the INVITE request it may wait for additional final responses),
the S-CSCF does not have knowledge of having received an 199 (Early Dialog
Terminated) provisional response on the same early dialog, and the assiociated
INVITE request included the \"199\" option-tag in the Supported header field
and the INVITE request did not include the \"100rel\" option tag in the
Require header field,, the S-CSCF shall trigger and send an unrelable 199
(Early Dialog Terminated) provisional response, using the same \"tag\" To
header field parameter value as the error response, as specified in in RFC
6228 [142].
### 5.4.5 Call release
#### 5.4.5.1 S-CSCF-initiated session release
##### 5.4.5.1.1 Cancellation of a session currently being established
Upon receipt of an network internal indication to release a session which is
currently being established, the S-CSCF shall cancel the related dialogs by
sending the CANCEL request according to the procedures described in RFC 3261
[26].
##### 5.4.5.1.2 Release of an existing session
Upon receipt of a network internal indication to release an existing
multimedia session, the S-CSCF shall:
1) if the S-CSCF serves the calling user of the session, generate a BYE
request destined for the called user based on the information saved for the
related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to the stored Contact header field provided by the
called user;
\- a To header field, set to the To header field value as received in the 200
(OK) response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a From header field, set to the From header field value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a Call-ID header field, set to the Call-Id header field value as received
in the initial INVITE request;
\- a CSeq header field, set to the CSeq value that was stored for the
direction from the calling to the called user, incremented by one;
\- a Route header field, set to the routeing information towards the called
user as stored for the dialog;
\- a Reason header field that contains proper SIP response code;
\- further header fields, based on local policy;
\- treat the BYE request as if received directly from the calling user, i.e.
the S-CSCF shall send the BYE request to the internal service control and
based on the outcome further on towards the called user; and
2) if the S-CSCF serves the calling user of the session, generate an
additional BYE request destined for the calling user based on the information
saved for the related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to a contact address obtained from the stored Contact
header field if provided by the calling user. If the stored Contact header
field contained either a public or a temporary GRUU, the S-CSCF shall set the
Request-URI either to:
a) the contact address bound to the respective GRUU, if the stored Contact
header field did not include an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter; or
b) the contact address that the UE used to send the initial INVITE request, if
the stored Contact header field included an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter;
NOTE 1: Since the same public GRUU may be bound to multiple contact addresses
of the UE that were registered as specified in RFC 5626 [92], the S-CSCF
selects the contact address that the UE used to send the initial INVITE
request.
\- a To header field, set to the From header field value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a From header field, set to the To header field value as received in the
200 (OK) response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a Call-ID header field, set to the Call-Id header field value as received
in the initial INVITE request;
\- a CSeq header field, set to the CSeq value that was stored for the
direction from the called to the calling user, incremented by one -- if no
CSeq value was stored for that session the S-CSCF shall generate and apply a
random number within the valid range for CSeqs;
\- a Route header field, set to the routeing information towards the calling
user as stored for the dialog;
\- a Reason header field that contains proper SIP response code;
\- further header fields, based on local policy;
\- send the BYE request directly to the calling user.
3) if the S-CSCF serves the called user of the session, generate a BYE request
destined for the called user based on the information saved for the related
dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to a contact address that the S-CSCF uses to send the
in-dialog requests towards the called UE as defined in RFC 5626 [92] and RFC
5627 [93];
\- a To header, set to the To header value as received in the 200 (OK)
response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a From header, set to the From header value as received in the initial
INVITE request;
\- a Call-ID header, set to the Call-Id header value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a CSeq header, set to the CSeq value that was stored for the direction from
the calling to the called user, incremented by one;
\- a Route header, set to the routeing information towards the called user as
stored for the dialog;
\- a Reason header that contains proper SIP response code;
\- further headers, based on local policy;
\- send the BYE request directly to the called user; and
4) if the S-CSCF serves the called user of the session, generate an additional
BYE request destined for the calling user based on the information saved for
the related dialog, including:
\- a Request-URI, set to the stored Contact header field provided by the
calling user;
\- a To header, set to the From header field value as received in the initial
INVITE request;
\- a From header, set to the To header field value as received in the 200 (OK)
response for the initial INVITE request;
\- a Call-ID header, set to the Call-Id header field value as received in the
initial INVITE request;
\- a CSeq header, set to the CSeq value that was stored for the direction from
the called to the calling user, incremented by one -- if no CSeq value was
stored for that session the BYE shall generate and apply a random number
within the valid range for CSeqs;
\- a Route header field, set to the routeing information towards the calling
user as stored for the dialog;
\- a Reason header field that contains proper SIP response code;
\- further headers, based on local policy;
\- treat the BYE request as if received directly from the called user, i.e.
the S-CSCF shall send the BYE request to the internal service control and
based on the outcome further on towards the calling user..
Upon receipt of the 2xx responses for both BYE requests, the S-CSCF shall
release all information related to the dialog and the related multimedia
session.
##### 5.4.5.1.2A Release of the existing dialogs due to registration
expiration
When:
1) the registration lifetime of the only public user identity currently
registered with its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities (i.e. no other is registered) and bound either to the contact
address of the UE or to the registration flow and the associated contact
address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used) expires;
2) there are still active multimedia sessions that includes either this
user\'s contact address or the registration flow and the associated contact
address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used);
3) the session was initiated by or terminated towards the user using the
public user identity currently registered or with one of the implicitly
registered public used identities bound either to the contact address of the
UE or to the registration flow and the associated contact address (if the
multiple registration mechanism is used);
then the S-CSCF shall:
\- release each of these multimedia sessions by applying the steps listed in
the subclause 5.4.5.1.2. The S-CSCF shall only release dialogs associated with
the multi media sessions originated or terminated towards the registered
user\'s contact address or the registration flow and the associated contact
address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used).
##### 5.4.5.1.3 Abnormal cases
Upon receipt of a request on a dialog for which the S-CSCF initiated session
release, the S-CSCF shall terminate the received request and answer it with a
481 (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) response.
#### 5.4.5.2 Session release initiated by any other entity
Upon receipt of a 2xx response for a BYE request matching an existing dialog,
the S-CSCF shall delete all the stored information related to the dialog.
#### 5.4.5.3 Session expiration
If the S-CSCF requested the session to be refreshed periodically, and the
S-CSCF got the indication that the session will be refreshed, when the session
timer expires, the S-CSCF shall delete all the stored information related to
the dialog.
### 5.4.6 Call-related requests
#### 5.4.6.1 ReINVITE
##### 5.4.6.1.1 Determination of served user
Void.
##### 5.4.6.1.2 UE-originating case
For a reINVITE request or UPDATE request from the UE within the same dialog,
the S-CSCF shall store the updated access-network-charging-info parameter from
P-Charging-Vector header field in the received SIP request. The S-CSCF shall
retain the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header field when the request is forwarded to an AS. However, the S-CSCF shall
not include the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field when the request is forwarded outside the home network of
the S-CSCF.
For a reINVITE request from the UE, if the request is to be forwarded to an AS
that is located within the trust domain, the S-CSCF shall retain the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field;
otherwise, the S-CSCF shall remove the access-network-charging-info parameter
from the P-Charging-Vector header field.
##### 5.4.6.1.3 UE-terminating case
For a reINVITE request or UPDATE request destined towards the UE within the
same dialog, when the S-CSCF receives the 200 (OK) response (to the INVITE
request or UPDATE request), the S-CSCF shall store the updated access-network-
charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field. The S-CSCF
shall retain the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field when the response is forwarded to the AS. However, the
S-CSCF shall not include the access-network-charging-info parameter in the
P-Charging-Vector header field when the 200 (OK) response is forwarded outside
the home network of the S-CSCF.
For any SIP response to an INVITE request, if the response is to be forwarded
to an AS that is located within the trust domain, the S-CSCF shall retain the
access-network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header
field; otherwise, the S-CSCF shall remove the access-network-charging-info
parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field.
### 5.4.7 Void
### 5.4.7A GRUU management
#### 5.4.7A.1 Overview of GRUU operation
The S-CSCF provides a service of assigning and translating GRUUs for use by
registered UEs. This is conducted as specified in RFC 5627 [93] and RFC 5628
[94]. Two kinds of GRUUs are assigned: public GRUUs and temporary GRUUs.
NOTE: If the UE performs the functions of an external attached network (e.g an
enterprise network) the UE could have self allocated its own GRUUs. In this
version of the specification only UE self allocated public GRUUs are
supported. Routing to a specific UE self-allocated public GRUUs requires that
\"loose route\" is provisioned in the service profile of the served public
user identity. Use of UE self-allocated temporary GRUUs is not supported in
this version of the specification and requests addressed to UE self allocated
temporary GRUUs will fail to be routed to the UE.
Each assigned GRUU represents an association between a public user identity
and an instance ID provided by a registering UE. It is used to address a
particular UE that possesses the instance ID and registers with the public
user identity. The GRUU also denotes a contact address registered with a
public user identity when the contact address has a \"+sip.instance\" header
field parameter containing the the GRUU instance ID.
The S-CSCF issues GRUUs as part of the registration process, and also reports
GRUUs as part of notifications for subscriptions to the \"reg\" event package.
The S-CSCF always issues GRUUs in pairs -- a public GRUU and a temporary GRUU.
In case of implicit registration the S-CSCF assigns a unique public GRUU and a
unique temporary GRUU for each public user identity.
#### 5.4.7A.2 Representation of public GRUUs
Each public GRUU shall conform to all requirements specified in RFC 5627 [93].
The S-CSCF constructs a public GRUU by adding a \"gr\" SIP URI parameter to
the canonical form of the SIP URI which contains a public user identity. The
\"gr\" SIP URI parameter serves as an indicator that the URI is in fact a GRUU
and carries a value that encodes the instance ID that is defined in 3GPP TS
23.003 [3].
By default, the value of the \"gr\" SIP URI parameter is a copy of the value
of the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter from a Contact address
registered with the S-CSCF, with escaping of special characters as specified
in RFC3261 [26].
The public GRUU that is returned in the \"pub-gruu\" parameter in the 200 (OK)
response to the REGISTER request is constructed using the canonical form of
the SIP URI of the public user identity from the To header field of the
REGISTER request provided that public user identity is not barred. If the
public user identity from the To header field of the REGISTER request is
barred then the public GRUU that is returned in the \"pub-gruu\" parameter in
the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request is constructed using the
canonical form of the SIP URI of the default public user identity.
NOTE 1: The default public user identity is always provisioned as a SIP URI.
If the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter from the Contact address
contains an IMEI URN, as specified in RFC 7254 [153], then the value of the
\"gr\" SIP URI parameter is generated by the S-CSCF using the name-based UUID
algorithm defined in RFC 4122 [154]. The following applies to the algorithm:
\- the \"name space ID\" shall be a UUID generated for use across the
administrative domain and shall use the algorithm for creating a UUID from
truly random numbers specified in RFC 4122 [154];
NOTE 2: If the generated UUID is changed, then newly created GRUUs will not
match those that were created with the previous UUID. Therefore, the UUID
needs to remain the same in order to create consistent GRUUs. This means that
the namespace UUID needs to be the same for all S-CSCFs within the domain for
which the public GRUU is hosted (it cannot be generated at run time by the
S-CSCF as that would produce different values).
\- SHA-1 shall be used as the hash algorithm; and
\- the \"name\" is made up of a concatenation of the ASCII representation (see
RFC 20 [212]) of the TAC and SNR portions of the IMEI from the
\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter.
The S-CSCF shall store the \"gr\" parameter used in a public GRUU and the
associated value received in a \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter.
The public GRUU for a particular association of public user identity and
instance ID is persistent. The same public GRUU will be returned each time a
registration is performed with a particular pair of public user identity and
instance ID.
#### 5.4.7A.3 Representation of temporary GRUUs
Each temporary GRUU shall conform to all requirements specified in RFC 5627
[93].
Because of the limited lifetime of an temporary GRUU, only the S-CSCF that
created a temporary GRUU is required to understand how to translate that GRUU
to the corresponsing public user identity and instance ID.
The temporary GRUU that is returned in the \"temp-gruu\" parameter in the 200
(OK) response to the REGISTER request is mapped to the public user identity
from the To header field of the REGISTER request provided that public user
identity is not barred. If the public user identity from the To header field
of the REGISTER request is barred then the temporary GRUU that is returned in
the \"temp-gruu\" parameter in the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request
is mapped to the default public user identity.
NOTE 1: The default public user identity is always provisioned as a SIP URI.
The specific representation of a temporary GRUU may be decided by each S-CSCF
implementation. Temporary GRUUs must route to the assigning S-CSCF without
requiring each assigned GRUU to be stored in the HSS.
The S-CSCF may choose a representation of temporary GRUUs that requires no
extra state to be retained, such as that specified in RFC 5627 [93].
Alternatively, the S-CSCF may choose a stateful representation. This is an
implementation choice.
NOTE 2: One possible implementation is for the S-CSCF to have a statically
configured wildcard PSI that routes to it, with each temporary GRUU being
encoded so that it matches the wildcard.
#### 5.4.7A.4 GRUU recognition and validity
The S-CSCF shall recognize those GRUUs it has assigned, verify their validity,
and extract the associated public user identity and instance ID. This is true
for both public GRUUs and temporary GRUUs.
NOTE: The S-CSCF only validates and extracts the associated public user
identity and instance ID for GRUUs that it assigned.
GRUUs are distinguished from other URIs by the presence of a \"gr\" SIP URI
parameter. Public GRUUs are distinguished from temporary GRUUs by the presence
of a value for the \"gr\" SIP URI parameter.
The instance ID is obtained from a public GRUU by using the \"gr\" parameter
to retrieve the stored associated instance ID. The public user identity is
extracted from a public GRUU by removing the \"gr\" SIP URI parameter.
The S-CSCF can recognize a public GRUU as valid if the \"gr\" parameter
contains a value that was stored in the S-CSCF during generation of the public
GRUU, and the derived public user identity compares equal, according to the
comparison rules of RFC3261 [26], to a public user identity active within the
S-CSCF.
The public user identity and instance ID are derived from a temporary GRUU via
implementation specific means consistent with the way temporary GRUUs are
constructed. The S-CSCF shall determine the validity of a temporary GRUU in
conformance with RFC 5627 [93], and using implementation specific means.
### 5.4.8 Emergency service
#### 5.4.8.1 General
S-CSCF shall handle the emergency registration as per the needs of the normal
registration.
NOTE: Emergency specific procedures for the Cx interface are specified in
annex G in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
#### 5.4.8.2 Initial emergency registration or user-initiated emergency
reregistration
When the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request; and the Contact header field
includes a \"sos\" SIP URI parameter that indicates that this is an emergency
registration, the S-CSCF shall perform the actions as specified in subclause
5.4.1.1 with the following additions:
1) when handling unprotected REGISTER request or protected REGISTER request,
the S-CSCF:
a) shall deregister only contacts that were registered as part of emergency
registration; and
b) shall not deregister contacts that were registered as part of non-emergency
registration;
NOTE 1: other conditions triggering contact deregistration are described in
subclause 5.4.1.
2) for the protected REGISTER request, when the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER
request with the \"integrity-protected\" header field parameter in the
Authorization header field set to \"yes\", \"tls-yes\" or \"ip-assoc-yes\",
i.e. for the protected REGISTER request, and the Contact header field includes
a \"sos\" SIP URI parameter that indicates that this is an emergency
registration, the S-CSCF shall identify the user by the public user identity
as received in the To header field and the private user identity as received
in the Authorization header field of the REGISTER request;
3) the S-CSCF shall not include a Service-Route in the 200 (OK) response to
the REGISTER request;
4) the S-CSCF shall not include a temporary GRUU in the 200 (OK) response to
the REGISTER request;
5) the S-CSCF shall include the \"sos\" URI parameter in the URI that was
successfully emergency registered and included in the Contact header field of
the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request;
NOTE 2: In the case where the S-CSCF returns a GRUU in the Contact header
field of the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the \"sos\" URI
parameter is appended to the URI and not included as a Contact header field
parameter. The public GRUU that is returned in the 200 (OK) response includes
the \"sos\" URI parameter as a parameter of the URI included in the \"pub-
gruu\" Contact header field parameter.
6) store the Path header field and the contact information including all
header field parameters contained in the Contact header field;
NOTE 3: The Path header field and contact information used for the emergency
dialogs destined for the UE and obtained during the emergency registration can
be different than the Path header field used for the non-emergency
communication and obtained during the non-emergency registration.
NOTE 4: If the previous emergency registration with different contact
information or emergency Path header field has not expired, the S-CSCF will
not perform the network initiated deregistration procedure for the previous
emergency registration, but will let it expire.
7) the S-CSCF shall not send any third-party REGISTER requests to any AS;
8) determine the duration of the registration by checking the value of the
registration expiration interval value in the received REGISTER request and
based on local policy; and
NOTE 5: The value of the emergency registration time is subject to national
regulation and can be subject to roaming agreements.
9) for any bindings created by the emergency registration, mark those bindings
as created by an emergency registration.
#### 5.4.8.3 User-initiated emergency deregistration
When S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the registration expiration
interval value containing zero and the Contact header field contains a contact
address that has been registered for emergency service (i.e. the \"sos\" SIP
URI parameter that indicates that this is an emergency registration is
included in the Contact header field), the S-CSCF shall reject the REGISTER
request by sending a 501 (Not Implemented) response.
NOTE: The UE cannot deregister its emergency public user identity.
#### 5.4.8.4 Network-initiated emergency deregistration
The S-CSCF shall not perform a network-initiated emergency deregistration.
#### 5.4.8.5 Network-initiated emergency reauthentication
If a given public user identity and the associated contact address have been
registered via emergency registration, the S-CSCF shall not reauthenticate
this public user identity.
#### 5.4.8.6 Subscription to the event providing registration state
If a S-CSCF receives a SUBSCRIBE request addressed to S-CSCF containing the
Event header field with the reg event package with the Contact header field
that contains a contact address that has been registered for emergency
service, the S-CSCF shall reject the SUBSCRIBE request for the reg-event
package by sending a 489 (Bad Event) response.
#### 5.4.8.7 Notification of the registration state
When the user performs an emergency registration or when the emergency
registration expires, the S-CSCF shall not send a NOTIFY request to the
subscribers to the reg event package of the respective user.
The contact address that has been registered for emergency serviceshall not be
included in the NOTIFY requests sent to the subscribers to the reg event
package of the user.
## 5.5 Procedures at the MGCF
### 5.5.1 General
The MGCF, although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its
associated addresses. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer
arrangements within the IM CN subsystem. Therefore table A.4/1 and
dependencies on that major capability shall not apply.
The use of the Path and Service-Route header fields shall not be supported by
the MGCF.
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the MGCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority processing,
routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not defined further
in this document, but is left to national regulation and network
configuration.
When the MGCF sends any request or response related to a dialog, the MGCF may
insert previously saved values into P-Charging-Vector and P-Charging-Function-
Addresses header fields before sending the message.
The MGCF shall use a GRUU referring to itself (as specified in RFC 5627 [93])
when inserting a contact address in a dialog establishing or target refreshing
SIP message. This specification does not define how GRUUs are created by the
MGCF; they can be provisioned by the operator or obtained by any other
mechanism. A GRUU used by the MGCF when establishing a dialog shall remain
valid for the lifetime of the dialog. The GRUU used by the MGCF shall not
reveal calling party related information.
The MGCF shall handle requests addressed to its currently valid GRUUs when
received outside of the dialog in which the GRUU was provided.
EXAMPLE: Upon receipt of an INVITE request addressed to a GRUU assigned to a
dialog it has active, and containing a Replaces header field referencing that
dialog, the MGCF will be able to establish the new call replacing the old one.
The MGCF may support retrieval of NP data, subject to local policy. The
interface used at the MGCF to retrieve the NP data is out of scope of this
specification. Retrieval of NP data is relevant only if the Request-URI
contains an international public telecommunications number. For requests from
the IM CN subsystem network, if the Request-URI contains a tel-URI with an
\"npdi\" tel-URI parameter, as defined in RFC 4694 [112], NP data has been
obtained previously and NP data retrieval is not needed, but still may still
be performed if required by local policy. If NP data is retrieved by the MGCF,
and the request is routed to the IM CN subsystem, the MGCF shall add the tel-
URI NP parameters to the Request-URI as defined in RFC 4694 [112]: an \"npdi\"
tel-URI parameter is added to indicate that NP data retrieval has been
performed, and if the number is ported, an \"rn\" tel-URI parameter is added
to identify the ported-to routeing number.
The MGCF NP procedures also apply when the request contains a Request-URI in
the form of a SIP URI user=phone, where the \"npdi\" and \"rn\" tel-URI
parameters are contained in the userinfo part of the SIP URI.
The MGCF supports as a network option the inclusion of the XML MIME schema for
PSTN. In cases where the XML MIME for PSTN is included the the Content-Type
header field is set to \"application/vnd.etsi.pstn+xml\" and the Content-
Disposition to \"signal\" with the \"handling\" parameter set to \"optional\".
### 5.5.2 Subscription and notification
Void.
### 5.5.3 Call initiation
#### 5.5.3.1 Initial INVITE
##### 5.5.3.1.1 Calls originated from circuit-switched networks
When the MGCF receives an indication of an incoming call from a circuit-
switched network, the MGCF shall:
1) generate an INVITE request:
\- set the Request-URI to the \"tel\" format using an E.164 address or to the
\"sip\" format using an E164 address in the user portion and set user=phone;
NOTE 1: Details how to set the host portion are out of scope of the document.
However, when a SIP URI is used the host portion needs to be part of the
domain name space owned by the I-CSCF
\- include the \"100rel\" option tag in the Supported header field (as defined
in RFC 3262 [27]);
\- include the \"precondition\" option tag in the Supported header field (as
defined in RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64]) if the MGCF supports the
SIP preconditions mechanism;
\- not indicate the requirement for the precondition mechanism by using the
Require header field;
\- include an P-Asserted-Identity header field, including the display name if
available, depending on corresponding information in the circuit-switched
network;
\- create a new, globally unique value for the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector header field; and
\- insert a type 2 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter into the P-Charging-
Vector header field. The MGCF shall set the type 2 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the sending network in which the MGCF
resides and the type 2 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter shall not be
included.
When the MGCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to an initial request for a
dialog, the MGCF shall store the value of the received \"term-ioi\" header
field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field, if present.
NOTE 2: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 2 IOI.
The type 2 IOI identifies the sending network of the response message.
Upon receiving a 199 (Early Dialog Terminated) provisional response to an
established early dialog the MGCF shall release resources specifically related
to that early dialog.
Based upon local policy, the MGCF may support preferred circuit carrier access
(RFC 4694 [112]). If such routeing is applicable for the call, the MGCF shall
perform the interworking of the carrier identification code from the circuit
switched signalling protocol as described in 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B]. The \"cic\"
tel-URI parameter is added in the tel-URI or in the userinfo part of the SIP
URI with user=phone Request-URI in accordance with RFC 4694 [112].
If resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] is required for a
dialog, then the MGCF shall include the Resource-Priority header field in all
requests associated with that dialog.
If overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITE method is supported as a
network option, several INVITE requests with the same Call ID and the same
From header field (including \"tag\" header field parameter) that relate to
the same call can be sent by the MGCF. The MGCF shall route those INVITE
requests to the same next hop.
##### 5.5.3.1.2 Calls terminating in circuit-switched networks
When the MGCF receives an initial INVITE request with Supported header field
indicating \"100rel\", the MGCF shall:
1) store the value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field, if present;
NOTE: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 2 IOI.
The type 2 IOI identifies the sending network of the request message.
2) send a 100 (Trying) response;
3) after a matching codec is found or no codec is required at the MGW, send
183 \"Session Progress\" response:
\- set the Require header field to the value of \"100rel\";
\- store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
\- store the value of the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in
the P-Charging-Vector header field; and
\- insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter, if received in the initial INVITE request and a type 2
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter. The MGCF shall set the type 2 \"term-
ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the network in which
the MGCF resides and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the
previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
If a codec is required and the MGCF does not find an available matching codec
at the MGW for the received initial INVITE request, the MGCF shall:
\- send 503 (Service Unavailable) response if the type of codec was acceptable
but none were available; or
\- send 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response if the type of codec was not
supported, and may include SDP in the message body to indicate the codecs
supported by the MGCF/MGW.
Based upon local policy, the MGCF may support preferred ciruit carrier access
(RFC 4694 [112]), if such routeing is applicable for the call.
NOTE: Interworking of the \"cic\" tel-URI parameter, if present in a tel-URI
or in the userinfo part of a SIP URI with user=phone Request-URI, to the
circuit switched signalling protocol is described in 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B].
The MGCF may support resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] if
required for a dialog. The MGCF shall use compatible namespace and priority
levels to the capabilities supported in the CS network.
#### 5.5.3.2 Subsequent requests
##### 5.5.3.2.1 Calls originating in circuit-switched networks
When the MGCF receives 183 (Session Progress) response to an INVITE request,
the MGCF shall:
\- store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field.
The MGCF shall send an UPDATE request when the following conditions are
fulfilled:
\- conditions as specified in 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B]; and
\- the MGCF receives 200 (OK) response to a PRACK request
##### 5.5.3.2.2 Calls terminating in circuit-switched networks
When the MGCF receives an indication of a ringing for the called party of
outgoing call to a circuit-switched network, the MGCF shall:
\- send 180 (Ringing) response to the UE.
When the MGCF receives an indication of answer for the called party of
outgoing call to a circuit-switched network, the MGCF shall:
\- send 200 (OK) response to the UE. The 200 (OK) response shall include an
P-Asserted-Identity header field if corresponding information is received from
the circuit-switched network.
### 5.5.4 Call release
#### 5.5.4.1 Call release initiated by a circuit-switched network
When the MGCF receives an indication of call release from a circuit-switched
network, the MGCF shall:
\- send a BYE request to the UE.
#### 5.5.4.2 IM CN subsystem initiated call release
NOTE: The release of a call towards the circuit-switched network additionally
requires signalling procedures other than SIP in the MGCF that are outside the
scope of this document.
#### 5.5.4.3 MGW-initiated call release
When the MGCF receives an indication from the MGW that the bearer was lost,
the MGCF shall:
> \- send a BYE request towards the UE; and
\- may include Error-Info header field with a pointer to additional
information indicating that bearer was lost.
### 5.5.5 Call-related requests
#### 5.5.5.1 ReINVITE
##### 5.5.5.1.1 Calls originating from circuit-switched networks
Void.
##### 5.5.5.1.2 Calls terminating in circuit-switched networks
When the MGCF receives a reINVITE request for hold/resume operation, the MGCF
shall:
\- send 100 (Trying) response;
\- after performing interaction with MGW to hold/resume the media flow, send
200 (OK) response.
### 5.5.6 Further initial requests
When the MGCF responds to an OPTIONS request with a 200 (OK) response, the
MGCF may include a message body with an indication of the DTMF capabilities
and supported codecs of the MGCF/MGW.
NOTE: The detailed interface for requesting MGCF/MGW capabilities is not
specified in this version of the document. Other solutions can be used in the
interim.
## 5.6 Procedures at the BGCF
### 5.6.1 General
The use of the Path and Service-Route header fields shall not be supported by
the BGCF.
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the BGCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority processing,
routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not defined further
in this document, but is left to national regulation and network
configuration.
When the BGCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a dialog or standalone transaction,
the BGCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-Vector and
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields before forwarding the message.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the BGCF may recurse on a 3xx
response only when the domain part of the URI contained in the 3xx response is
in the same domain as the BGCF. For the same cases, if the URI is an IP
address, the BGCF shall only recurse if the IP address is known locally to be
a address that represents the same domain as the BGCF.
### 5.6.2 Common BGCF procedures
When determining where to route the received request, the originating BGCF may
use the information obtained from other protocols or any other available
databases.
The BGCF may support retrieval of NP data as part of the procedures to
determine where to route the request. Retrieval of NP data by the BGCF is
subject to local policy. Retrieval of NP data is relevant only if the Request-
URI contains an international public telecommunications number. The interface
used at the BGCF to retrieve the NP data is out of scope of this
specification. If the Request-URI contains a tel-URI with an \"npdi\" tel-URI
parameter, as defined in RFC 4694 [112], NP data has been obtained previously
and NP data retrieval is only performed if required by local policy. If NP
data is retrieved by the BGCF, the BGCF shall add the tel-URI NP parameters to
the Request-URI as defined in RFC 4694 [112]: an \"npdi\" tel-URI parameter is
added to indicate that NP data retrieval has been performed, and if the number
is ported, an \"rn\" tel-URI parameter is added to identify the ported-to
routeing number. The \"rn\" tel-URI parameter may be used by the BGCF for
routeing the request.
The BGCF NP procedures also apply when the request contains a Request-URI in
the form of a SIP URI user=phone, where the \"npdi\" and \"rn\" tel-URI
parameters are contained in the userinfo part of the SIP URI.
When the BGCF receives a request, the BGCF shall forward the request:
\- to an MGCF within its own network; or
\- to another network containing a BGCF, or I-CSCF; or
> \- where the request is for another network, to an IBCF in its own network,
> if local policy requires IBCF capabilities towards another network; or
\- where the Ici interface is used to interconnect two networks and the
destination network is beyond such interface, to an IBCF in its own network..
When forwarding the request to the next hop, the BGCF may leave the received
Request-URI unmodified.
When the BGCF receives a request and the Request-URI contains a tel URI in
local number format or a SIP URI with the user part not starting with a + and
the \"user\" SIP URI parameter equals \"phone\", the BGCF shall not forward
the request to an entity in another network (e.g. BGCF, I-CSCF) unless the
local policy (e.g. routeing of service numbers) requires forwarding the
request outside the network. If local policy does not allow forwarding the
request outside the network and additional routeing capabilities as defined in
Annex I are locally available, the BGCF shall attempt translation of the local
number. If the translation fails, the BGCF shall send an appropriate SIP
response to the originator. If local policy does not allow forwarding the
request outside the network and additional routeing capabilities as defined in
annex I are not locally available, the BGCF shall either:
> \- forward the request to any appropriate entity in its own network where
> additional routeing functionality are available; or
>
> \- send an appropriate SIP response to the originator.
The BGCF need not Record-Route the INVITE and the SUBSCRIBE requests. While
the next entity may be a MGCF acting as a UA, the BGCF shall not apply the
procedures of RFC 3323 [33] relating to privacy. The BGCF shall store the
values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field. The BGCF
shall store the value of the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received in
the P-Charging-Vector header field and retain the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field.
NOTE 1: The means by which the decision is made to forward to an MGCF or to
another network is outside the scope of the present document, but may be by
means of a lookup to an external database, or may be by data held internally
to the BGCF.
If the BGCF supports carrier routeing, then the BGCF shall support the
following procedures, based on local policy:
a) if the BGCF is configured to populate an operator configured preassigned
carrier into a tel-URI contained in the Request-URI, and a preassigned carrier
is required for this call, then the BGCF shall include the \"cic\" tel-URI
parameter in the Request-URI identifying the preassigned carrier (as described
in RFC 4694 [112]); or
b) if the BGCF is configured to populate the freephone carrier ID, and a
freephone carrier is required for this call, then the BGCF shall include the
\"cic\" tel-URI parameter in the Request-URI identifying the freephone carrier
(as described in RFC 4694 [112]).
The BGCF carrier routeing procedures also apply when the Request-URI is in the
form of a SIP URI user=phone, where the \"cic\" tel-URI parameter is contained
in the userinfo part of the SIP URI.
The BGCF shall not add the \"cic\" tel-URI parameter in the Request-URI if the
parameter already exists in the tel-URI.
NOTE 2: Local policy should be able to control the interaction and precedence
between routeing on \"cic\" parameter versus routeing based on \"rn\"
parameter.
NOTE 3: The means to configure the BGCF with the pre-assigned carrier is
outside the scope of this document.
When the BGCF receives an INVITE request, if the BGCF inserts its own Record-
Route header field, the BGCF may require the periodic refreshment of the
session to avoid hung states in the BGCF. If the BGCF requires the session to
be refreshed, the BGCF shall apply the procedures described in RFC 4028 [58]
clause 8.
NOTE 4: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
If overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITE method is supported as a
network option, several INVITE requests with the same Call ID and the same
From header field (including \"tag\" header field parameter) can be received
outside of an existing dialog . Such INVITE requests relate to the same call
and the BGCF shall route such INVITE request received during a certain period
of time to the same next hop.
## 5.7 Procedures at the Application Server (AS)
### 5.7.1 Common Application Server (AS) procedures
#### 5.7.1.1 Notification about registration status
The AS may support the REGISTER method in order to discover the registration
status of the user. If a REGISTER request arrives and the AS supports the
REGISTER method, the AS shall store the registration expiration interval value
from the request and generate a 200 (OK) response or an appropriate failure
response. For the success case, the 200 (OK) response shall contain a
registration expiration interval value equal to the value received in the
REGISTER request. The AS shall store the values received in P-Charging-
Function-Addresses header field. Also, the AS shall store the values of the
\"icid-value\" header field parameter and \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter
if present in the P-Charging-Vector header field from the REGISTER request.
The AS shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the REGISTER request and a type 3
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter in the response to REGISTER. The AS shall
set the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies
the service provider from which the response is sent and the \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter is set to the previously received value of \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter.
Upon receipt of a third-party REGISTER request, with the Content-Type header
field or with a MIME body part\'s Content-Type header field set according to
subclause 7.6 (i.e. \"application/3gpp-ims+xml\"), independent of the value or
presence of the Content-Disposition header field or a MIME body part\'s
Content-Type header field, independent of the value or presence of Content-
Disposition parameters or MIME body part\'s Content-Disposition parameters,
then the following treatment is applied:
\- if the third-party REGISTER request includes an IM CN subsystem XML body
with an \ element, including a version attribute, with the
\ child element or a MIME body part containing an \
element with a \ XML child element as described in subclause
7.6, then the AS may retrieve the service information within the \ XML child element of the \ element.
Upon receipt of a third-party REGISTER request, with the Content-Type header
field or with a body part\'s Content-Type header field set to \"message/sip\"
and including a \"message/sip\" MIME body of the incoming REGISTER request, or
the 200 (OK) response to the incoming REGISTER request then the AS may
retrieve information from the \"message/sip\" MIME body or body part.
Upon receipt of a third-party REGISTER request, the AS may subscribe to the
reg event package for the public user identity registered at the user\'s
registrar (S-CSCF) as described in RFC 3680 [43].
On sending a SUBSCRIBE request, the AS shall populate the header fields as
follows:
a) a Request-URI set to the resource to which the AS wants to be subscribed
to, i.e. to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity of the user that
was received in the To header field of the third-party REGISTER request;
b) a From header field set to the AS\'s SIP URI;
c) a To header field, set to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity
of the user that was received in the To header field of the third-party
REGISTER request;
d) an Event header field set to the \"reg\" event package;
e) a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to the SIP URI of the AS; and
NOTE 1: The S-CSCF expects the SIP URI used in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field to correspond to the SIP URI, which identified this AS in the initial
filter criteria of the user to whose registration state the AS subscribes to.
f) a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 3 \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter. The type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter
identifies the service provider from which the request is sent. The AS shall
not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter.
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request, the AS shall store
the information for the so established dialog and the expiration time as
indicated in the Expires header field of the received response.
Upon receipt of any response, the AS shall store the value of the \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field if
present.
NOTE 2: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 3 term-ioi. The type 3
term-ioi identifies the network operator from which the response was sent.
NOTE 3: Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with all \ element(s)
having their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user
identities are deregistered) and the Subscription-State header field set to
\"terminated\", the AS considers the subscription to the reg event package
terminated, i.e. as if the AS had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires
header field containing a value of zero.
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request, the AS shall store the value of the \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameters if present in the P-Charging-Vector header
field. The AS shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header field in the response to
the NOTIFY rquest containing the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if
received in the NOTIFY request and a type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field. The AS
shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that
identifies the service provider from which the response is sent and the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously received value of
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
#### 5.7.1.2 Extracting charging correlation information
When an AS receives an initial request for a dialog or a request (excluding
ACK requests and CANCEL requests and responses) for a standalone transaction,
the AS shall store the values received in the P-Charging-Vector header field,
e.g. \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if present, and \"icid-value\"
header field parameter, and retain the P-Charging-Vector header field in the
message. The AS shall store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-
Addresses header field and retain the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field in the message.
When an AS sends any request or response related to a dialog or standalone
transaction, the AS may insert previously saved values into the P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields before sending the
message.
#### 5.7.1.3 Access-Network-Info and Visited-Network-ID
The AS may receive in any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) information about the served user access
network. The AS may receive information about the served user core network in
REGISTER requests from S-CSCF. This information can be obtained either from
the P-Access-Network-Info header field and P-Visited-Network-ID header field
in the REGISTER request or can be obtained from those header fields in the
body of the REGISTER request. The AS can use the header fields to provide an
appropriate service to the user.
#### 5.7.1.3A Determination of the served user
##### 5.7.1.3A.1 General
The determination of the served user is different per session:
\- for an originating session, the procedure is described in subclause
5.7.1.3A.2; and
\- for a terminating session the procedure is described in subclause
5.7.1.3A.3.
##### 5.7.1.3A.2 AS serving an originating user
If an AS receives a request on behalf of an originating user:
\- and the AS supports the P-Served-User header field as defined in RFC 5502
[133], the AS shall determine the served user by taking the identity contained
in the P-Served-User header field; or if that is not available by taking the
identity contained in P-Asserted-Identity header field; and
\- otherwise, if the AS supports the History-Info header field as defined in
RFC 4244 [66] the AS shall determine the served user from the content of the
History-Info header field or the P-Asserted-Identity header field.
##### 5.7.1.3A.3 AS serving a terminating user
If an AS receives a request on behalf of a terminating user:
\- and the AS supports the P-Served-User header field as defined in RFC 5502
[133], the AS shall determine the served user by taking the identity contained
in the P-Served-User header field; or if that is not available by taking the
identity contained in the Request-URI; and
\- otherwise, if the AS supports the History-Info header field as defined in
RFC 4244 [66] the AS shall determine the served user from the content of the
History-Info header field or the Request-URI.
#### 5.7.1.4 User identify verification at the AS
The procedures at the AS to accomplish user identity verification are
described with the help of figure 5-1.
NOTE: Different means can be used to represent or transport the credentials.
Such mechanisms are subject to operator policy and can e.g. include the
P-Asserted-Identity header field, the Authorization header field or other
mechanisms not specified by 3GPP TS 24.229.
When the AS receives a SIP initial or standalone request, excluding REGISTER
request, that does not contain credentials, the AS shall:
a) if a Privacy header field is present in the initial or standalone request
and the Privacy header field value is set to \"id\" or \"user\", then the user
and the request are considered as anonymous, and no further actions are
required. The AS shall consider the request as authenticated;
b) if there is no Privacy header field present in the initial or standalone
request, or if the Privacy header field contains a value other than \"id\" or
\"user\", then the AS shall check for the presence of a P-Asserted-Identity
header field in the initial or standalone request. Two cases exist:
i) the initial or standalone request contains a P-Asserted-Identity header
field. This is typically the case when the user is located inside a trusted
domain as defined by subclause 4.4. In this case, the AS is aware of the
identity of the user and no extra actions are needed. The AS shall consider
the request as authenticated.
ii) the initial or standalone request does not contain a P-Asserted-Identity
header field. This is typically the case when the user is located outside a
trusted domain as defined by subclause 4.4. In this case, the AS does not have
a verified identity of the user. The AS shall check the From header field of
the initial or standalone request. If the From header field value in the
initial or standalone request is set to \"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261
[26], then the user and the request are considered as anonymous and no further
actions are required. If the From header field value does not indicate
anonymity, then the AS shall challenge the user by issuing a 401
(Unauthorized) response including a challenge as per procedures described in
RFC 3261 [26].
When the AS receives a SIP initial or standalone request that contains
credentials but it does not contain a P-Asserted-Identity header field the AS
shall check the correctness of the credentials as follows:
a) If the credentials are correct, then the AS shall consider the identity of
the user verified, and the AS shall consider the request as authenticated;
b) If the credentials are not correct, the AS may either rechallenge the user
by issuing a 401 (Unauthorized) response including a challenge as per
procedures described in RFC 3261 [26] (up to a predetermined maximum number of
times predefined in the AS configuration data), or consider the user as
anonymous. If the user is considered anonymous, the AS shall consider the
request as authenticated.
Figure 5-1: User identity verification flow at the AS
#### 5.7.1.5 Request authorization
Once the AS have tried to verify the identity of the user, the AS either has a
verified identity of the user or it considers the user as anonymous.
If the user is considered anonymous, the AS shall check whether the
authorization policy defined for this request allows anonymous requests. If
anonymous requests are allowed, then the AS can proceed with the requested
functionality, otherwise, the AS shall not proceed with the requested
functionality.
If the user is identified by an identity, the AS shall apply the authorization
policy related to the requested functionality to detect whether the particular
user is allowed to request the functionality. The authorization policy may
require a verified identity of a user.
If the request is authorized then the AS shall continue with the procedures as
defined for that request.
If the request is not authorized, the AS shall either:
\- reject the request according to the procedures defined for that request
e.g., by issuing a 403 (Forbidden) response; or
\- send a 2xx final response if the authorization policy requires to deny the
requested functionality, whilst appearing to the **user** as if the request
has been granted.
#### 5.7.1.6 Event notification throttling
If the AS has a local configuration information limiting the rate at which
notification generation is allowed, then the AS shall take that information
into account. Such local configuration information could be e.g. the shortest
time period between issuing consecutive NOTIFY requests.
#### 5.7.1.7 Local numbering
##### 5.7.1.7.1 Interpretation of the numbers in a non-international format
If home operator\'s local policy defines a prefix string(s) to enable
subscribers to differentiate dialling a geo-local number and/or a home-local
number and if the phone number in a non-international format in the Request-
URI includes such a prefix, the AS shall interpret the received number in a
non-international format as a geo-local number or as a home-local number
according to the prefix.
If the phone number in a non-international format in the Request-URI includes
a \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter, the AS shall:
1) if the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter contains access technology
information or the home domain name prefixed by the \"geo-local.\" string,
interpret it as a geo-local number;
2) if the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter contains the home domain name,
interpret it as a home-local number; or
3) if the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter contains any other value, apply
general procedures for translation.
NOTE 1: If business communication services are provided to the calling user,
and the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter contains a value associated with a
private numbers, it is expected that any needed translation of the number
information is handled by the corresponding business communication AS.
If the phone number in a non-international format in the Request-URI includes
both operator defined prefix and a \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter and
those information are contradictory, the AS shall ignore either the prefix or
the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter according to operator policy.
If the phone number in a non-international format in the Request-URI does not
include either a \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter or an operator defined
prefix, the AS shall interpret the phone number in a non-international format
either as a geo-local number or as a home-local number according to operator
policy.
NOTE 2: Operator must ensure that service setting dialling strings do not
reach local numbering AS by setting appropriately the precedences of the
initial filter criteria.
##### 5.7.1.7.2 Translation of the numbersin a non-international format
When an AS receives a request having a geo-local number in a non-international
format in the Request-URI, the AS shall use the \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter to determine the visited access network, if \"phone-context\" tel
URI parameter in the Request-URI is available. If \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter in the Request-URI is not available, the AS may determine the
visited access network based on the available P-Access-Network-Info header
fields containing the access-type field, if it is available in the received
request, or by means outside the scope of this document.
If the visited access network is determined the AS shall attempt to determine
whether the geo-local number is used to access a service in the visited
network or the local addressing plan of the visited network and translate the
received geo-local number to a globally routeable SIP URI or an international
tel URI:
NOTE 1: During the translation the AS can contact an entity in the visited
access network for getting the needed information. The protocol and procedures
for this is outside the scope of this specification.
NOTE 2: The AS can translate the tel URI to a SIP URI by including the
\'telephone-subscriber\' part of the received tel URI to the user part of the
SIP URI and setting the domain name of the SIP URI to indicate the domain name
of the network of the phone number based on the received \"phone-context\" tel
URI parameter.
When an AS receives a request having a home-local number in a non-
international format in the Request-URI, the AS shall determine whether the
home-local number is used to access a service or the local addressing plan and
translate the received home-local number to a globally routeable SIP URI or an
international tel URI:
When an AS receives a request having any other number in a non-international
format in the Request-URI, the AS shall attempt to determine whether it is
used to access a service in the third network or the local addressing plan of
the third network and translate the received number in a non-international
format to a globally routeable SIP URI or an international tel URI:
NOTE 3: The AS can translate the tel URI to a SIP URI by including the
\'telephone-subscriber\' part of the received tel URI to the user part of the
SIP URI and setting the domain name of the SIP URI to indicate the domain name
of the network of the phone number based on the received \"phone-context\" tel
URI parameter;
NOTE 4: If business communication services are provided to the calling user,
and the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter contains a value associated with a
private numbers, it is expected that any needed translation of the number
information is handled by the corresponding business communication AS.
If the translation at the AS fails, the AS shall either send an appropriate
SIP response or route the request based on the topmost Route header field,
based on local policy.
#### 5.7.1.8 GRUU assignment and usage
It is possible for an AS to use a GRUU referring to itself when inserting a
contact address in a dialog establishing or target refreshing SIP message.
When using a GRUU, the AS shall do so in conformance with RFC 5627 [93].
This specification does not define how GRUUs are created by the AS; they can
be provisioned by the operator or obtained by any other mechanism. The GRUU
shall remain valid for the time period in which features addressed to it
remain meaningful.
The AS shall handle requests addressed to its currently valid GRUUs when
received outside of the dialog in which the GRUU was provided.
EXAMPLE: Upon receipt of an INVITE request addressed to a GRUU assigned to a
dialog it has active, and containing a Replaces header field referencing that
dialog, the AS will be able to establish the new call replacing the old one,
if that is appropriate for the features being provided by the AS.
When an AS is acting as a routeing B2BUA (as defined in subclause 5.7.5) it
may provide a contact address that is not a GRUU when the contact address in
the incoming message that is being replaced is not a GRUU. In all other cases
the AS shall use a GRUU.
When an AS acts as UA or Initiating B2BUA it may provide a contact address
that is not a GRUU in cases where it can ascertain that valid requests that
could result from the use of that contact and follow the usage rules of RFC
5627 [93] will reach the element. In all other cases the AS shall use a GRUU.
An AS acting as a UA or an initiating or routeing B2BUA on behalf of a public
user identity can provide a GRUU in the contact address referring to itself as
described above. When the AS provides a GRUU on behalf of a user, subsequent
dialog-initiating requests sent to that GRUU will be routed directly to the
AS, thus bypassing terminating services assigned to the user. If the AS wishes
to have terminating services applied for the user, the AS may generate a new
terminating request addressed to a public GRUU associated with the public user
identity of the user.
NOTE 1: If the AS wishes to have terminating services applied when the public
user identity on whose behalf the AS is acting is unregistered, then the
options available to the AS depend on whether or not the subscriber has ever
previously registered with the IM CN subsystem. In the case where the public
user identity had previously registered with the IM CN subsystem, then the AS
can use the most recently allocated public GRUU if available. In the case
where the user has never registered with the IM CN subsystem, then the AS can
use the public user identity itself.
NOTE 2: Once terminating services have been applied, it is assumed that the
terminating S-CSCF will route the request back to this AS via the initial
filter criteria. In order for this to work, the initial filter criteria of the
target user need to be configured so that the AS is invoked at the appropriate
time relative to other terminating ASs (say, after the required terminating
services have been applied). The mechanism to ensure that the AS is invoked by
the initial filter criteria at the appropriate time is outside the scope of
this specification (e.g. the user's filter criteria could be statically
configured to invoke the AS at the correct time, or the AS could use the
Dynamic Service Activation Information mechanism to activate the appropriate
filter criteria).
When an AS acts as a UA or an initiating or routeing B2BUA, and is originating
or terminating a request on behalf of a public user identity, and privacy is
required, the AS shall ensure that any GRUU provided in the contact address in
the request does not reveal the public user identity of the user.
#### 5.7.1.9 Use of ICSI and IARI values
Based on service logic, an AS can validate an ICSI value received in an
Accept-Contact header field or received in a P-Asserted-Service header field
and reject the request if necessary.
A trusted AS may insert a P-Asserted-Service header field in a request for a
new dialog or standalone transaction. An untrusted AS may insert a
P-Preferred-Service header field in a request for a new dialog or standalone
transaction. If the request is related to an IMS communication service that
requires the use of an ICSI then the AS:
\- shall include the ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2),
for the IMS communication service that is related to the request in either a
P-Asserted-Service header field or a P-Preferred-Service header field
depending whether the AS is trusted or not according to RFC 6050 [121].
When an AS that is acting as a UA or initiating B2BUA or routeing B2BUA sends
an initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the
AS may include an Accept-Contact header field containing:
\- an ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-
ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3841 [56B]; and
\- one or more IARI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2) that are
related to the request in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in
subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3841 [56B];
if the ICSI or IARIs for the IMS communication service and IMS application are
known.
The AS may:
\- include the received ICSI and IARI values;
\- replace or remove received ICSI and IARI values; or
\- include new ICSI and IARI values.
When the AS acting as a UA or initiating B2BUA or routeing B2BUA sends a SIP
request or a SIP response related to an IMS communication service, the AS may
include in the Contact header field:
\- in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 one or
more ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2); and
\- one or more IARI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2) in a
g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag, for the IMS applications, that are related
to the request as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62];
if the ICSI or IARIs for the IMS communication service and IMS application are
known. The AS may:
\- include the received ICSI and IARI values;
\- replace or remove received ICSI values; or
\- include new ICSI and IARI values.
#### 5.7.1.10 Carrier selection
An AS may play a role in support of carrier selection as defined in RFC 4694
[112].
NOTE 1: In general, ASs do not need to support carrier selection, Rather a
specific AS or a few ASs in a network will be used for carrier selection,
When an AS that supports carrier selection receives an initial request with a
Request-URI in the form of a tel-URI that contains a \"cic\" tel-URI parameter
inserted by the UE, and if configured per operator policy, the AS may validate
the value of the \"cic\" parameter. If an AS that supports carrier selection
determines the \"cic\" parameter received in the initial request to be valid,
as configured per operator policy, the AS shall process the request
accordingly. If an AS supports carrier selecton and determines the \"cic\"
parameter received in the initial request to be invalid, then the AS shall
remove the \"cic\" parameter and process the request as if no \"cic\" had been
received from the UE.
When an AS that support carrier selection receives an initial request with a
Request-URI in the form of a tel-URI, the AS may, based on operator policy,
insert an appropriate value for the \"cic\" tel-URI parameters as defined in
RFC 4694 [112].
NOTE 2: For example, the AS that supports preferred carrier could insert a
\"cic\" tel-URI parameter that identifies the originating user\'s preassigned
carrier, or the carrier assigned to a called freephone number.
When an AS that support carrier selection receives an initial request with a
Request-URI in the form of a SIP URI user=dialstring (see RFC 4967 [103]), the
AS may translate the SIP URI to a valid tel-URI or a valid SIP URI user=phone
comprising a userinfo part containing the tel-URI and a domain matching the
domain of the original SIP URI user=dialstring. If the received SIP URI
user=dialstring is successfully converted, then the AS shall replace the
Request-URI with the newly created tel-URI or SIP URI user=phone. The AS shall
then process the request as if it had arrived from the UE containing this tel-
URI or SIP URI user=phone in the Request-URI.
NOTE 3: This specification does not make any assumptions regarding how these
procedures are mapped to ASs; whether all procedures are supported by a single
AS or spread across multiple ASs. However, this specification does assume that
the responsibility for ensuring that the UE complies with the carrier
selection procedures defined in RFC 4694 [112] will be performed by a single
AS (e.g. validate \"cic\"), and the filter criteria will be configured so that
this AS is invoked before other ASs that have carrier selection
responsibilities.
The AS carrier selection procedures also apply when the request contains a
Request-URI in the form of a SIP URI user=phone, where the \"cic\" tel-URI
parameter is contained in the userinfo part of the SIP URI.
#### 5.7.1.11 Void
#### 5.7.1.12 Delivery of original destination identity
If the service the AS provides needs to deliver the original destination
identity to the UE, the AS shall insert a new hi-entry to the last hi-entry of
the History-Info header field including \"mp\" header field parameter as
specified in subclause 7.2A.16.
NOTE: If the \"mp\" header field parameter is present in the hi-entries within
the History-Info header field, the information of the original destination
number or URI, e.g. the service number for freephone, will be found in the hi-
entry whose index-val matches the value of the first hi-entry with \"mp\"
header field parameter.
#### 5.7.1.13 CPC and OLI
The AS may populate the \"cpc\" and \"oli\" URI parameters in each initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction in the tel URI
or SIP URI representation of telephone numbers in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field based on their origin source.
### 5.7.2 Application Server (AS) acting as terminating UA, or redirect server
When acting as a terminating UA the AS shall behave as defined for a UE in
subclause 5.1.4, with the exceptions identified in this subclause.
The AS, although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its
associated addresses. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer
arrangements within the IM CN subsystem.
If the AS requires knowledge of the served user it shall determine the served
user according to the applicable procedure in subclause 5.7.1.3A.
An AS acting as redirect server shall propagate any received IM CN subsystem
XML message body in the redirected message.
When an AS acting as a terminating UA generates a subsequent request that does
not relate to an INVITE dialog, the AS shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header
field with the \"icid-value\" header field parameter populated as specified in
3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
When the AS acting as terminating UA receives an initial request for a dialog
or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall store the value of the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameters received in the P-Charging-Vector header
field if present.
NOTE: Any received orig-ioi parameter will be any type of orig-ioi. The orig-
ioi identifies the network operator from which the request was sent.
When the AS acting as terminating UA generates a response to an initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall
insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter, if received in the request and a type 3 \"term-ioi\" header
field parameter. The AS shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the service provider from which the
response is sent and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the
previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
If resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] is required for a
dialog, then the AS shall include the Resource-Priority header field in all
requests associated with that dialog.
### 5.7.3 Application Server (AS) acting as originating UA
In order to support an AS acting as an originating UA, the AS has to be within
the same trust domain as the S-CSCF to which requests will be sent.
When acting as an originating UA the AS shall behave as defined for a UE in
subclause 5.1.3, with the exceptions identified in this subclause.
The AS, although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its
associated addresses and does not participate in any authentication procedures
defined for a UE. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer arrangements
within the IM CN subsystem.
When an AS acting as an originating UA generates an initial request for a
dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall insert a
P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field parameter
populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter. The AS shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the service provider from which the
request is sent. The AS shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter.
NOTE 1: The AS can retrieve CDF and/or ODF addresses from HSS on Sh interface.
When the AS acting as an originating UA receives any response to an initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall
store the value of the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field if present.
NOTE 2: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the network operator from which the response was
sent.
When an AS acting as an originating UA generates a subsequent request that
does not relate to an INVITE dialog, the AS shall insert a P-Charging-Vector
header field with the \"icid-value\" header field parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
The AS shall extract charging function addresses from any P-Charging-Function-
Addresses header field that is received in any 1xx or 2xx responses to the
requests.
The AS may also indicate that the proxies should not fork the request by
including a \"no-fork\" directive within the Request-Disposition header field
in the request as described in RFC 3841 [56B].
When sending any initial request, an identity is needed that will correlate
with the service profile to be used at the S-CSCF. If the identity for that
service profile corresponds to the value to be used to identify the caller to
the destination user, include the identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field. If the identity for that service profile does not correspond to the
value to be used to identify the caller to the destination user, and the
P-Served-User header field is supported by the S-CSCF, include the identity in
the P-Served-User header field. This leaves the P-Asserted-Identity header
field for the identity to be used to identify the caller to the destination
user.
When sending an initial request on behalf of a PSI that is hosted by the AS,
the AS shall:
\- insert a Request-URI as determined by the service logic;
\- insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field and possibly a P-Served-User
header field containing the PSI as indicated earlier in this subclause;
\- if the AS is not able to resolve the next hop address by itself or the
operator policy does not allow it, insert a Route header field pointing either
to the S-CSCF where the PSI is hosted, or to the entry point of the home
network of the PSI or to the transit function. The AS shall append the
\"orig\" parameter to the URI in the topmost Route header field; and
NOTE 3: The address of the S-CSCF hosting the PSI can be obtained by querying
the HSS on the Sh interface.
NOTE 4: AS can only send the initial request to the entry point of the home
network of the PSI only if the AS can assume (e.g. based on local
configuration) that the receiving entry point will be able to process the
request as an originating request.
\- if the AS is able to resolve the next hop address by itself and the
operator policy allows it, forward the originating request directly to the
destination without involving any Sâ€‘CSCF in the originating IM CN subsystem.
When sending an initial request on behalf of a public user identity, the AS
shall:
\- insert a Request-URI as determined by the service logic;
\- insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field and possibly a P-Served-User
header field containing the public user identity as indicated earlier in this
subclause;
\- if the AS intends to send the originating request to the home network of
the public user identity or the operator policy requires it, insert a Route
header field pointing to the S-CSCF where the public user identity on whose
behalf the request is generated is registered or hosted (unregistered case) or
to the entry point of the public user identity\'s network. The AS shall append
the \"orig\" parameter to the URI in the topmost Route header field; and
NOTE 5: The address of the S-CSCF can be obtained either by querying the HSS
on the Sh interface or during third-party registration.
NOTE 6: AS can send the initial request to the entry point of the public user
identity\'s network or to the entry point of the home network of the PSI only
if the AS can assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving
entry point will be able to process the request as an originating request.
\- if the AS intends to send the originating request directly to the
terminating network and the operator policy allows it, forward the originating
request directly to the destination without involving any Sâ€‘CSCF in the
originating IM CN subsystem.
When sending an initial request to a served public user identity, the AS shall
insert:
\- a Request-URI containing the served public user identity;
\- a P-Asserted-Identity as determined by the service logic (e.g. the URI of
the AS or the URI of the entity that triggered the SIP request, if the sending
of the initial request is triggered by a non-SIP request); and
\- a Route header field pointing to the S-CSCF where the public user identity
to whom the request is generated is registered or hosted (unregistered case)
or to the entry point of the public user identity\'s network. The AS shall not
append the \"orig\" parameter to the URI in the topmost Route header field.
NOTE 7: The address of the S-CSCF can be obtained either by querying the HSS
on the Sh interface or during third-party registration.
The AS can indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity in accordance with RFC
3323 [33], and the additional requirements contained within RFC 3325 [34].
Where privacy is required, in any initial request for a dialog or request for
a standalone transaction, the AS shall set the From header field to
\"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 8: The contents of the From header field cannot be relied upon to be
modified by the network based on any privacy specified by the user either
within the AS indication of privacy or by network subscription or network
policy. Therefore the AS includes the value \"Anonymous\" whenever privacy is
explicitly required.
If resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] is required for a
dialog, then the AS shall include the Resource-Priority header field in all
requests associated with that dialog.
### 5.7.4 Application Server (AS) acting as a SIP proxy
When the AS acting as a SIP proxy receives a request from the S-CSCF, prior to
forwarding the request, the AS shall:
\- remove its own URI from the topmost Route header field; and
\- after executing the required services, route the request based on the
topmost Route header field.
The AS may modify the SIP requests based on service logic, prior to forwarding
the request back to the S-CSCF.
The AS shall not fork the request if the fork-directive in the Request-
Disposition header field is set to \"no-fork\" as described in RFC 3841 [56B].
If the AS requires knowledge of the served user it shall determine the served
user according to the applicable procedure in subclause 5.7.1.3A.
An AS acting as a SIP proxy shall propagate any received IM CN subsystem XML
message body in the forwarded message.
When the AS acting as a SIP proxy receives an initial request for a dialog or
a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall store the value of the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header
field if present. The AS shall remove the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter
from the forwarded request and insert a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter. The AS shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to
a value that identifies the service provider from which the request is sent.
The AS shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter.
NOTE: Any received orig-ioi parameter will bea Type 3 IOI. The orig-ioi
identifies the network operator from which the request was sent.
When the AS acting as a SIP proxy forwards a response to an initial request
for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall remove
any received \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\" header field parameters, and insert
a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the previously stored \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter, if received in the request and a type 3 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter. The AS shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the service provider from which the
response is sent and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the
previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. Any values
of \"orig-ioi\" or \"term-ioi\" header field parameters received in any
response that is being forwarded are not used.
### 5.7.5 Application Server (AS) performing 3rd party call control
#### 5.7.5.1 General
The AS performing 3rd party call control acts as a B2BUA. There are two kinds
of 3rd party call control:
\- Routeing B2BUA: an AS receives a request, terminates it and generates a new
request, which is based on the received request.
\- Initiating B2BUA: an AS initiates two requests, which are logically
connected together at the AS, or an AS receives a request and initiates a new
request that is logically connected but unrelated to the incoming request from
the originating user (e.g. the P-Asserted-Identity of the incoming request is
changed by the AS). AS can initiate additional requests and associate them
with a related incoming request.
If the AS requires knowledge of the served user the AS shall determine the
served user according to the applicable procedure in subclause 5.7.1.3A.
When the AS receives a terminated call and generates a new call, and dependent
on whether the service allows the AS to change the P-Asserted-Identity for
outgoing requests compared with the incoming request, the AS will select
appropriate kind of 3rd party call control.
The B2BUA AS will internally map the message header fields between the two
dialogs that it manages. It is responsible for correlating the dialog
identifiers and will decide when to simply translate a message from one dialog
to the other, or when to perform other functions. These decisions are specific
to each AS and are outside the scope of the present document.
The AS, although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its
associated addresses. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer
arrangements within the IM CN subsystem.
For standalone transactions, when the AS is acting as a Routeing B2BUA, the AS
shall copy the remaining Route header field(s) unchanged from the received
request for a standalone transation to the new request for a standalone
transaction.
When the AS receives a Replaces header field within an initial request for a
dialog, the AS should check, whether the AS acts as a routeing B2BUA for the
dialog identified in the Replaces header field. The AS should:
\- if the AS acts as routeing B2BUA for the dialog indicated in the Replaces
header field, include in the forwarded request a Replaces header field,
indicating the the dialog on the outgoing side that corresponds to the dialog
identified in the received Replaces header field; or
\- if the AS does not act as a routeing B2BUA for the dialog indicated in the
Replaces header field, include in the forwarded request the Replaces header
field as received in the incoming request.
When the AS acting as a routeing B2BUA receives an initial request for a
dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall:
\- store the value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field if present; and
\- remove the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter from the forwarded request.
NOTE: Any received orig-ioi parameter will be any type of orig-ioi. The orig-
ioi identifies the network operator from which the request was sent.
When the AS acting as a routeing B2BUA generates a response to an initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the AS shall
insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header
field parameter, if received in the request and a type 3 \"term-ioi\" header
field parameter. The AS shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the service provider from which the
response is sent and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the
previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. Any values
of \"orig-ioi\" or \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in any
response that is being forwarded are not used.
The AS shall transparently pass supported and unsupported signalling elements
(e.g. SIP headers, SIP messages bodies), except signalling elements that are
modified or deleted as part of the hosted service logic, or based on service
provider policy.
If resource priority in accordance with RFC 4412 [116] is required for a
dialog, then the AS shall include the Resource-Priority header field in all
requests associated with that dialog.
#### 5.7.5.2 Call initiation
##### 5.7.5.2.1 Initial INVITE
When the AS acting as a Routeing B2BUA receives an initial INVITE request, the
AS shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field of the received
INVITE request;
2) perform the AS specific functions. See 3GPP TS 23.218 [5];
3) if successful, generate and send a new INVITE request to establish a new
dialog;
4) copy the remaining Route header field(s) unchanged from the received INVITE
request to the new INVITE request;
5) copy the P-Asserted-Identity to the outgoing request;
6) if a Route header field is present, route the new INVITE request based on
the topmost Route header field; and
NOTE 1: The topmost Route header field of the received INVITE request will
contain the AS\'s SIP URI. The following Route header field will contain the
SIP URI of the S-CSCF.
7) if no Route header field is present (e.g. the AS may be acting on behalf of
a PSI):
a) insert a Route header field pointing either to the S-CSCF where the PSI is
hosted or to the entry point of the home network of the PSI or to the transit
function, if the AS is not able to resolve the next hop address by itself or
the operator policy requires it; or
b) forward the originating request directly to the destination without
involving any Sâ€‘CSCF in the originating IM CN subsystem, if the AS is able to
resolve the next hop address by itself, and the operator policy allows it.
NOTE 2: The address of the S-CSCF hosting the PSI can be obtained by querying
the HSS on the Sh interface.
When the AS is acting as an Initiating B2BUA, the AS shall apply the
procedures described in subclause 5.7.3 for any outgoing requests. The AS
shall either set the \"icid-value\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field to be the same as received or different. The AS can
include original dialog identifier in the Route header field for the S-CSCF
that it learned from an incoming request, per service logic needs.
NOTE 3: The AS can retrieve CDF and/or ODF adresses from HSS on Sh interface.
##### 5.7.5.2.2 Subsequent requests
Void.
#### 5.7.5.3 Call release
#### 5.7.5.4 Call-related requests
An AS may initiate a call release. See 3GPP TS 23.218 [5] for possible
reasons. The AS shall simultaneously send the BYE request for both dialogs
managed by the B2BUA.
#### 5.7.5.5 Further initial requests
When the AS is acting as an Initiating B2BUA the AS shall apply the procedures
described in subclause 5.7.3 for the requests. The AS shall either set the
\"icid-value\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field to
be the same as received or different. The AS may initiate any number of
requests, per service logic needs.
#### 5.7.5.6 Transcoding services invocation using third-party call control
An AS may invoke transcoding at an MRFC by the use of RFC 4117 [166], if the
MRFC supports acting as the transcoding server described in RFC 4117 [166].
During the call setup, an AS may decide proactively to invoke transcoding when
receiving an INVITE request, or reactively when the callee rejects the call
setup using a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response. To invoke transcoding using
RFC 4117 [166], the AS shall act as a B2BUA between caller and callee and
establish a third SIP dialogue towards the MRFC offering the codecs supported
by the caller and the codecs to be offered towards the callee, and the IP
address and port information received from caller, in seperate media lines.
When receiving an answer from the MRFC, the AS shall forward the received
selected codecs and IP address and port information in the calleeÂ´s media
line(s) as an offer towards the callee. When the callee answers with selected
codecs and IP address and port information, the AS shall forward this
information within a new offer to the MRFC. When receiving the corresponding
answer from the MRFC, the AS shall forward the address and port information
within the callerÂ´s media line(s) as an answer towards the caller.
The SIP messages relating to the dialogue between AS and MRFC are sent either
via the S-CSCF over the ISC and Mr interfaces,or directly over the Mr\'
interface.
### 5.7.6 Void
## 5.8 Procedures at the MRFC
### 5.8.1 General
Although the MRFC is acting as a UA, it is outside the scope of this
specification how the MRFC associated addresses are made known to other
entities.
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the MRFC shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE: This special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
When the MRFC sends any request or response (excluding ACK requests and CANCEL
requests and responses) related to a dialog or standalone transaction, the
MRFC may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-Vector and P-Charging-
Function-Addresses header fields before sending the message.
The MRFC shall use a GRUU referring to itself (as specified in RFC 5627 [93])
when inserting a contact address in a dialog establishing or target refreshing
SIP message. This specification does not define how GRUUs are created by the
MRFC; they can be provisioned by the operator or obtained by any other
mechanism. A GRUU used by the MRFC when establishing a dialog shall remain
valid for the lifetime of the dialog.
The MRFC shall handle requests addressed to its currently valid GRUUs when
received outside of the dialog in which the GRUU was provided.
EXAMPLE: Upon receipt of an INVITE request addressed to a GRUU assigned to a
dialog it has active, and containing a Replaces header field referencing that
dialog, the MRFC will be able to establish the new call replacing the old one.
### 5.8.2 Call initiation
#### 5.8.2.1 Initial INVITE
##### 5.8.2.1.1 MRFC-terminating case
###### 5.8.2.1.1.1 Introduction
The MRFC shall provide a P-Asserted-Identity header field in a response to the
initial request for a dialog, or any response for a standalone transaction. It
is a matter of network policy whether the MRFC expresses privacy according to
RFC 3323 [33] with such responses.
When the MRFC receives an initial INVITE request, the MRFC shall store the
values received in the P-Charging-Vector header field, e.g. \"icid-value\"
header field parameter. The MRFC shall store the values received in the
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field.
##### 5.8.2.1.1.2 Tones and announcements {#tones-and-announcements .H6}
The MRFC can receive INVITE requests to set up a session to play tones and
announcements. The MRFC acts as terminating UA in this case.

shall:
\- send 100 (Trying) response.
##### 5.8.2.1.1.3 Ad-hoc conferences {#ad-hoc-conferences .H6}
The MRFC can receive INVITE requests to set up an ad-hoc conferencing session
(for example a multiparty call) or to add parties to the conference. The MRFC
acts as terminating UA in this case.
When the MRFC receives an INVITE request for ad hoc conferencing, the MRFC
shall:
\- send 100 (Trying) response; and
\- after the MRFP indicates that the conference resources are available, send
200 (OK) response. The MRFC may choose to send a 183 (Session Progress)
response prior to the 200 (OK) response.
When the MRFC receives an INVITE request to add a party to an existing ad hoc
conference (i.e. MRFC conference identifier), the MRFC shall:
\- send 100 (Trying) response; and
\- after the MRFP indicates that the conferencing request is granted, send 200
OK response. The MRFC may choose to send a 183 Session Progress response prior
to the 200 (OK) response.
##### 5.8.2.1.1.4 Transcoding {#transcoding .H6}
The MRFC may receive INVITE requests to set up transcoding between endpoints
with incompatible codecs. The MRFC acts as terminating UA in this case.
When the MRFC receives an INVITE request for transcoding and a codec is
supplied in SDP, the MRFC shall:
\- send 100 (Trying) response; and
\- after the MRFP indicates that the transcoding request is granted, send 200
(OK) response.
When the MRFC receives an INVITE request with an indicator for transcoding but
no SDP, the MRFC shall:
\- send 183 (Session Progress) response with list of codecs supported by the
MRFC/MRFP.
##### 5.8.2.1.2 MRFC-originating case
The MRFC shall provide a P-Asserted-Identity header field in an initial
request for a dialog, or any request for a standalone transaction. It is a
matter of network policy whether the MRFC expresses privacy according to RFC
3323 [33] with such requests.
When an MRFC generates an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction, the MRFC shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header field
with the \"icid-value\" header field parameter populated as specified in 3GPP
TS 32.260 [17].
#### 5.8.2.2 Subsequent requests
##### 5.8.2.2.1 Tones and announcements
When the MRFC receives an ACK request for a session, this may be considered as
an event to direct the MRFP to start the playing of a tone or announcement.
##### 5.8.2.2.2 Transcoding
When the MRFC receives a PRACK request (in response to the 183 (Session
Progress) response with an indicator for transcoding and codec supplied in
SDP, the MRFC shall:
\- after the MRFP indicates that the transcoding request is granted, send 200
(OK) response.
### 5.8.3 Call release
#### 5.8.3.1 S-CSCF-initiated call release
##### 5.8.3.1.1 Tones and announcements

The MRFC can receive reINVITE requests to modify an ad-hoc conferencing
session (for example a multiparty call) for purposes of floor control and for
parties to leave and rejoin the conference.
When the MRFC receives a reINVITE request, the MRFC shall:
\- send 100 (Trying) response; and
\- after the MRFP indicates that the conferencing request is granted, send 200
(OK) response. The MRFC may choose to send a 183 (Session Progress) response
prior to the 200 (OK) response.

When the MRFC responds to an OPTIONS request with a 200 (OK) response, the
MRFC may include a message body with an indication of the supported
tones/announcement packages, DTMF capabilities, supported codecs and
conferencing options of the MRFC/MRFP.
NOTE: As specified in RFC 6230 [146] an MRFC supporting the use of the control
channel framework shall support the SYNC command to indicate the media control
packages supported. Additionally each media control package should define an
audit command for discovery of package capabilities (for example supported
codecs and options).
## 5.9 Void
### 5.9.1 Void
## 5.10 Procedures at the IBCF
### 5.10.1 General
As specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7] border control functions may be applied
between two IM CN subsystems or between an IM CN subsystem and other SIP-based
multimedia networks based on operator preference. The IBCF may act both as an
entry point and as an exit point for a network. If it processes a SIP request
received from other network it functions as an entry point (see subclause
5.10.3) and it acts as an exit point whenever it processes a SIP request sent
to other network (see subclause 5.10.2).
The functionalities of the IBCF include:
\- network configuration hiding (see subclause 5.10.4);
\- application level gateway (see subclause 5.10.5);
\- transport plane control, i.e. QoS control (see subclause 5.10.5);
\- screening of SIP signalling (see subclause 5.10.6);
\- inclusion of an IWF if appropriate; and
\- media transcoding control (see suclause 5.10.7).
NOTE 1: The functionalities performed by the IBCF are configured by the
operator, and it is network specific.
When an IBCF acting as an exit or an entry point receives a SIP request, the
IBCF may reject the SIP request based on local policy by sending an
appropriate SIP 4xx response.
NOTE 2: The local policy can take bilateral agreements between operators into
consideration.
NOTE 3: Some SIP requests can be rejected by an AS instead of the IBCF
according to local policy.
The IBCF, acting as B2BUA, which is located between visited network and home
network shall preserve the dialog identifier, i.e. shall not change the Call-
Id header field value, the \"tag\" header field parameter value of the From
header field in any SIP INVITE request and any SIP response to the SIP INVITE
request, and shall preserve the \"tag\" header field parameter value of the To
header field, in any SIP response to the SIP INVITE request.
NOTE 4: The IBCF can identify whether it is located between visited network
and home network based on local configuration.
### 5.10.2 IBCF as an exit point
#### 5.10.2.1 Registration
When IBCF receives a REGISTER request, the IBCF shall:
1) void;
2) if network topology hiding is required or IBCF is configured to perform
application level gateway and/or transport plane control functionalities, then
the IBCF shall add its own routeable SIP URI to the top of the Path header
field; and
NOTE 1: The IBCF can include in the inserted SIP URI an indicator that
identifies the direction of subsequent requests received by the IBCF i.e.,
from the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF, to identify the UE-terminating case. The
IBCF can encode this indicator in different ways, such as, e.g., a unique
parameter in the URI, a character string in the username part of the URI, or a
dedicated port number in the URI.
NOTE 2: Any subsequent request that includes the direction indicator (in the
Route header field) or arrives at the dedicated port number, indicates that
the request was sent by the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF.
3) select an entry point of the home network and forward the request to that
entry point.
> If the selected entry point:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
IBCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
> the IBCF shall select a new entry point and forward the REGISTER request to
> that entry point.
NOTE 3: The list of the entry points can be either obtained as specified in
RFC 3263 [27A] or provisioned in the IBCF. The entry point can be an IBCF or
an I-CSCF.
> If the IBCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any entry point, the
> IBCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the P-CSCF, in
> accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].
#### 5.10.2.1A General
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the IBCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority processing,
routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not defined further
in this document, but is left to national regulation and network
configuration.
#### 5.10.2.2 Initial requests
Upon receipt of:
\- an initial request for a dialog;
\- a request for a standalone transaction, except the REGISTER method; or
\- a request for an unknown method that does not relate to an existing dialog;
the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is an INVITE request and the IBCF is configured to perform
application level gateway and/or transport plane control functionalities, save
the Contact, CSeq and Record-Route header field values received in the request
such that the IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
2A) If the request is a SUBSCRIBE and the IBCF does not need to act as B2BUA,
based on operator policy, the IBCF shall determine whether or not to retain,
for the related subscription, the SIP dialog state information and the
duration information;
NOTE 1: The event package name can be taken into account to decide whether or
not the SIP dialog state and the subscription duration information needs to be
retained.
NOTE 2: The IBCF needs to insert its own URI in Record-Route of SUBSCRIBE if
it decides to retain the SIP dialog state information.
2B) if the request is an initial request for a dialog and local policy
requires the application of IBCF capabilities in subsequent requests, perform
record route procedures as specified in RFC 3261 [26];
3) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in subclause 5.10.4;
4) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.6;
5) void;
5A) if the recipient of the request is understood from configured information
to always send and receive private network traffic from this source, remove
the P-Private-Network-Indication header field containing the domain name
associated with that saved information;
6) store the values from the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field, if
present;
7) remove some of the parameters from the P-Charging-Vector header field or
the header field itself, depending on operator policy, if present; and
8) remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields, if present, prior
to forwarding the message;
and forwards the request according to RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 3: If IBCF processes a request without a pre-defined route (e.g. the
subscription to reg event package originated by the P-CSCF), the next-hop
address can be either obtained as specified in RFC 3263 [27A] or be
provisioned in the IBCF.
When the IBCF receives an INVITE request, the IBCF may require the periodic
refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the IBCF. If the IBCF
requires the session to be refreshed, the IBCF shall apply the procedures
described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 4: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When the IBCF receives a response to the initial request and network topology
hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as described in
subclause 5.10.4.
When the IBCF receives a response to the initial request and screening of SIP
signalling is applied, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as described
in subclause 5.10.6.
#### 5.10.2.3 Subsequent requests
Upon receipt of a subsequent request, the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
1A) if the request is a NOTIFY request with the Subscription-State header
field set to \"terminated\"and the IBCF has retained the SIP dialog state
information for the associated subscription, once the NOTIFY transaction is
terminated, the IBCF can remove all the stored information related to the
associated subscription;
2) if the request is a target refresh request and the IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control
functionalities, save the Contact and CSeq header field values received in the
request such that the IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
3) if the subsequent request is other than a target refresh request (including
requests relating to an existing dialog where the method is unknown) and the
IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport plane
control functionalities, save the Contact and CSeq header field values
received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the session if
needed;
4) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in subclause 5.10.4; and
5) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.6;
and forwards the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and network
topology hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4.
When the IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and screening of
SIP signalling is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.6.
#### 5.10.2.4 IBCF-initiated call release
If the IBCF provides transport plane control functionality and receives an
indication of a transport plane related error the IBCF may:
1) generate a BYE request for the terminating side based on information saved
for the related dialog; and
2) generate a BYE request for the originating side based on the information
saved for the related dialog.
NOTE: Transport plane related errors can be indicated from e.g. TrGW, or PCRF.
The protocol for indicating transport plane related errors to the IBCF is out
of scope of this specification.
Upon receipt of the 2xx responses for both BYE requests, the IBCF shall
release all information related to the dialog and the related multimedia
session.
### 5.10.3 IBCF as an entry point
#### 5.10.3.1 Registration
When IBCF receives a REGISTER request, the IBCF shall:
1) verify if it arrived from a trusted domain or not. If the request arrived
from an untrusted domain, respond with 403 (Forbidden) response;
NOTE 1: The IBCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
2) if network topology hiding, or screening of SIP signalling, is required or
IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport plane
control functionalities, add its own routeable SIP URI to the top of the Path
header field; and
NOTE 2: The IBCF can include in the inserted SIP URI an indicator that
identifies the direction of subsequent requests received by the IBCF i.e.,
from the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF, to identify the UE-terminating case. The
IBCF can encode this indicator in different ways, such as, e.g., a unique
parameter in the URI, a character string in the username part of the URI, or a
dedicated port number in the URI.
NOTE 3: Any subsequent request that includes the direction indicator (in the
Route header field) or arrives at the dedicated port number, indicates that
the request was sent by the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF.
3) If IBCF is colocated with an I-CSCF, or it has a preconfigured I-CSCF to be
contacted, forward the request to that I-CSCF. Otherwise select an I-CSCF and
forward the request to that I-CSCF.
NOTE 4: The selection of an I-CSCF can lead to additional delays.
If the selected I-CSCF:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
IBCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
the IBCF shall select a new I-CSCF and forward the REGISTER request to that
I-CSCF.
NOTE 5: The list of the I-CSCFs can be either obtained as specified in RFC
3263 [27A] or provisioned in the IBCF.
If the IBCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any I-CSCF, the IBCF
shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response towards the P-CSCF, in
accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].
#### 5.10.3.1A General
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the IBCF shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows
special treatment of such transactions or dialogs.
NOTE: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority processing,
routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not defined further
in this document, but is left to national regulation and network
configuration.
#### 5.10.3.2 Initial requests
Upon receipt of:
\- an initial request for a dialog;
\- a request for a standalone transaction except the REGISTER request; or
\- a request for an unknown method that does not relate to an existing dialog;
the IBCF shall verify whether the request is arrived from a trusted domain or
not. If the request arrived from an untrusted domain, then the IBCF shall:
\- if the topmost Route header field of the request contains the \"orig\"
parameter, respond with 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise,
\- remove all P-Charging-Vector header fields and all P-Charging-Function-
Addresses header fields the request may contain.
Upon receipt of:
\- an initial request for a dialog;
\- a request for a standalone transaction except the REGISTER request; or
\- a request for an unknown method that does not relate to an existing dialog;
the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, then respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
1A) if a P-Private-Network-Indication header field is included in the request,
check whether the configured information allows the receipt of private network
traffic from this source. If private network traffic is allowed, the IBCF
shall check whether the received domain name in any included P-Private-
Network-Indication header field in the request is the same as the domain name
associated with that configured information. If private network traffic is not
allowed, or the received domain name does not match, then the IBCF shall
remove the P-Private-Network-Indication header field;
1B) if the initiator of the request is understood from configured information
to always send and receive private network traffic from this source, insert a
P-Private-Network-Indication header field containing the domain name
associated with that configured information;
2) if the request is an INVITE request and the IBCF is configured to perform
application level gateway and/or transport plane control functionalities, then
the IBCF shall save the Contact, CSeq and Record-Route header field values
received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the session if
needed;
2A) If the request is a SUBSCRIBE and the IBCF does not need to act as B2BUA,
based on operator policy, the IBCF shall determine whether or not to retain,
for the related subscription, the SIP dialog state information and the
duration information;
NOTE 1: The event package name can be taken into account to decide whether or
not the SIP dialog state and the subscription duration information needs to be
retained.
NOTE 2: The IBCF needs to insert its own URI in Record-Route of SUBSCRIBE if
it decides to retain the SIP dialog state information.
2B) if the request is an initial request for a dialog and local policy
requires the application of IBCF capabilities in subsequent requests, perform
record route procedures as specified in RFC 3261 [26];
3) if network topology hiding is required, then apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4; and
4) If IBCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction,
that contains a single Route header field pointing to itself, and it is co-
located with an I-CSCF, or it has a preconfigured I-CSCF to be contacted, then
forward the request to that I-CSCF. Otherwise select an I-CSCF and forward the
request to that I-CSCF. If the single Route header field of the request
contains the \"orig\" parameter, the IBCF shall insert the \"orig\" parameter
to the URI of the I-CSCF;
NOTE 3: The selection of an I-CSCF can lead to additional delays.
When the IBCF receives an INVITE request, the IBCF may require the periodic
refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the IBCF. If the IBCF
requires the session to be refreshed, the IBCF shall apply the procedures
described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 4: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When the IBCF receives a response to an initial request (e.g. 183 or 2xx), the
IBCF shall:
1) store the values from the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field, if
present;
2) remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field prior to forwarding
the message; and
3) if network topology hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the
procedures as described in subclause 5.10.4.
#### 5.10.3.3 Subsequent requests
Upon receipt of a subsequent request, the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, then respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
1A) if the request is a NOTIFY request with the Subscription-State header
field set to \"terminated\"and the IBCF has retained the SIP dialog state
information for the associated subscription, once the NOTIFY transaction is
terminated, the IBCF can remove all the stored information related to the
associated subscription;
2) if the request is a target refresh request and the IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control
functionalities, then the IBCF shall save the Contact and CSeq header field
values received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the
session if needed;
3) if the subsequent request is other than a target refresh request (including
requests relating to an existing dialog where the method is unknown) and the
IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport plane
control functionalities, then the IBCF shall save the Contact and CSeq header
field values received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the
session if needed; and
4) if network topology hiding is required, then apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4;
and forwards the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and network
topology hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4.
#### 5.10.3.4 IBCF-initiated call release
If the IBCF provides transport plane control functionality and receives an
indication of a transport plane related error the IBCF may:
1) generate a BYE request for the terminating side based on information saved
for the related dialog; and
2) generate a BYE request for the originating side based on the information
saved for the related dialog.
NOTE: Transport plane related errors can be indicated from e.g. TrGW or PCRF.
The protocol for indicating transport plane related errors to the IBCF is out
of scope of this specification.
Upon receipt of the 2xx responses for both BYE requests, the IBCF shall
release all information related to the dialog and the related multimedia
session.
### 5.10.4 THIG functionality in the IBCF
#### 5.10.4.1 General
NOTE 1: THIG functionality is performed in I-CSCF in Release-5 and Release-6
and is compatible with the procedures specified in this subclause.
The following procedures shall only be applied if network topology hiding is
required by the network. The network requiring network topology hiding is
called the hiding network.
NOTE 2: Requests and responses are handled independently therefore no state
information is needed for that purpose within an IBCF.
The IBCF shall apply network topology hiding to all header fields which reveal
topology information, such as Via, Route, and Record-Route.
NOTE 3: If the P-CSCF is located in the visited network and in order to allow
the subscription initiated by the P-CSCF to the user\'s registration-state
event package, the IBCF cannot apply network topology hiding on the Path
header field contained in the REGISTER request.
NOTE 4: In order to allow the roaming UE to perform restoration procedures
when the S-CSCF rejects the served user initiated request, the IBCF cannot
apply network topology hiding on the Service-Route header field contained in a
200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request.
Upon receiving an incoming REGISTER request for which network topology hiding
has to be applied and which includes a Path header field, the IBCF shall add
the routeable SIP URI of the IBCF to the top of the Path header field. The
IBCF may include in the inserted SIP URI an indicator that identifies the
direction of subsequent requests received by the IBCF i.e., from the S-CSCF
towards the P-CSCF, to identify the UE-terminating case. The IBCF may encode
this indicator in different ways, such as, e.g., a unique parameter in the
URI, a character string in the username part of the URI, or a dedicated port
number in the URI.
NOTE 5: Any subsequent request that includes the direction indicator (in the
Route header field) or arrives at the dedicated port number, indicates that
the request was sent by the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF.
Upon receiving an incoming initial request for which network topology hiding
has to be applied and which includes a Record-Route header field, the IBCF
shall add its own routeable SIP URI to the top of the Record-Route header
field.
#### 5.10.4.2 Encryption for network topology hiding
Upon receiving an outgoing request/response from the hiding network the IBCF
shall perform the encryption for network topology hiding purposes, i.e. the
IBCF shall:
1) use the whole header field values which were added by one or more specific
entity of the hiding network as input to encryption, besides the UE entry;
2) not change the order of the header fields subject to encryption when
performing encryption;
3) use for one encrypted string all received consecutive header field entries
subject to encryption, regardless if they appear in separate consecutive
header fields or if they are consecutive entries in a comma separated list in
one header field;
4) construct a hostname that is the encrypted string;
5) append a \"tokenized-by\" header field parameter and set it to the value of
the encrypting network\'s name, after the constructed hostname;
6) form one valid entry for the specific header field out of the resulting
NAI, e.g. prepend \"SIP/2.0/UDP\" for Via header fields or \"sip:\" for Route
and Record-Route header fields;
7) if the IBCF encrypted an entry in the Route header field, then it also
inserts its own URI before the topmost encrypted entry; and
8) if the IBCF encrypted an entry in the Via header field, then it also
inserts its own URI before the topmost encrypted entry.
NOTE 1: Even if consecutive entries of the same network in a specific header
field are encrypted, they will result in only one encrypted header field
entry. For example:
> Via: SIP/2.0/UDP ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP Token( SIP/2.0/UDP scscf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP pcscf1.home1.net;lr);
>
> tokenized-by=home1.net,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP [5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]
NOTE 2: If multiple entries of the same network are within the same type of
header fields, but they are not consecutive, then these entries will be
tokenized to different strings. For example:
> Record-Route: sip:ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> sip:Token(sip:scscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net,
>
> sip:as1.foreign.net;lr,
>
> sip:Token(sip:scscf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> sip:pcscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net
NOTE 3: If request will return to the hiding network (e.g. after visiting an
AS), then the URI of IBCF is inserted. For example:
> Route: sip:as1.foreign.net;lr,
>
> sip:ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> sip:Token(sip:scscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net
#### 5.10.4.3 Decryption for network topology hiding
Upon receiving and incoming requests/response to the hiding network the IBCF
shall perform the decryption for network topology hiding purposes, i.e. the
IBCF shall:
1) identify hostnames encrypted by the network this IBCF belongs to within all
header fields of the incoming message;
2) use those hostnames that carry the identification of the hiding network
within the value of the \"tokenized-by\" header field parameter as input to
decryption;
3) use as encrypted string the hostname which follows the sent-protocol (for
Via header fields, e.g. \"SIP/2.0/UDP\") or the URI scheme (for Route and
Record-Route header fields, e.g. \"sip:\");
4) replace all content of the received header field which carries encrypted
information with the entries resulting from decryption.
EXAMPLE: An encrypted entry to a Via header field that looks like:
> Via: SIP/2.0/UDP Token(SIP/2.0/UDP scscf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP pcscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net
>
> will be replaced with the following entries:
>
> Via: SIP/2.0/UDP scscf1.home1.net;lr, SIP/2.0/UDP pcscf1.home1.net;lr
NOTE: Motivations for these decryption procedures are e.g. to allow the
correct routeing of a response through the hiding network, to enable loop
avoidance within the hiding network, or to allow the entities of the hiding
network to change their entries within e.g. the Record-Route header field.
### 5.10.5 IMS-ALG functionality in the IBCF
The IBCF shall only apply the following procedures if application level
gateway functionality is required by the network.
The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs IMS-ALG functionality. As an IMS-
ALG, the IBCF will internally map the message header fields between the two
dialogs that it manages. It is responsible for correlating the dialog
identifiers and will decide when to simply translate a message from one dialog
to the other, or when to perform other functions. The IBCF, although acting as
a UA, does not initiate any registration of its associated addresses. These
are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer arrangements within the IM CN
subsystem.
When the IBCF receives an initial INVITE request from another SIP network,
i.e. the IBCF acts as an entry point, the IBCF shall generate a new initial
INVITE request and forward it to the I-CSCF. In case the initial INVITE
request is received from own network, i.e. the IBCF acts as an exit point, the
IBCF shall generate a new initial INVITE request and forward it to the entry
point of the other network.
An IBCF may replace a contact address with a URI of its own when the contact
address in the incoming message is not a GRUU (e.g when the contact address is
an IP address).
The IBCF shall transparently forward a received Contact header field when the
Contact header field contains a GRUU or a media feature tag is included
indicating a capability for which the Contact URI can be used by the remote
party. When transparently forwarding a received Contact header field of a
dialog-forming request, the IBCF shall include its own URI in a Record-Route
header field in order to ensure that it is included on the route of subsequent
requests.
NOTE: One example of such a media feature tag is the isfocus media feature tag
used by conference services to transport the temporary conference identity
that can be used when rejoining an ongoing conference.
The internal function of the IBCF as an IMS-ALG is defined in 3GPP TS 29.162
[11A].
### 5.10.6 Screening of SIP signalling
#### 5.10.6.1 General
The IBCF may act as a B2BUA when it performs screening of SIP signalling
functionality. In this case the B2BUA behaviour of the IBCF shall comply with
the description given in subclause 5.10.5 for the IMS-ALG functionality.
NOTE: Many header fields are intended for end-to-end operation; removal of
such header fields will impact the intended end-to-end operation between the
end users. Additionally the IM CN subsystem does not preclude security
mechanisms covering SIP header fields; any such removal can prevent validation
of all header fields covered by the security mechanism.
#### 5.10.6.2 IBCF procedures for SIP header fields
If specified by local policy rules, the IBCF may omit or modify any received
SIP header fields prior to forwarding SIP messages, with the following
exceptions.
As a result of any screening policy adopted, the IBCF should not modify at
least the following header fields which would cause misoperation of the IM CN
subsystem:
\- Authorization; and
\- WWW-Authenticate.
Where the IBCF appears in the path between the UE and the S-CSCF, some header
fields are involved in the registration and authentication of the user. As a
result of any screening policy adopted as part of normal operation, e.g. where
the request or response is forwarded on, the IBCF should not modify as part of
the registration procedure at least the following header fields:
\- Path; and
\- Service-Route.
NOTE 1: If the IBCF modifies SIP information elements (SIP header fields, SIP
message bodies) other than as specified by SIP procedures (e.g., RFC 3261
[26]) caution needs to be taken that SIP functionality (e.g., routeing using
Route, Record-Route and Via) is not impacted in a way that could create
interoperability problems with networks that assume that this information is
not modified.
NOTE 2: Where operator requirements can be achieved by configuration hiding,
then these procedures can be used in preference to screening.
The IBCF may add, remove, or modify, the P-Early-Media header field within
forwarded SIP requests and responses according to procedures in RFC 5009
[109].
NOTE 3: The IBCF can use the P-Early-Media header field for the gate control
procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D]. In the presence of early
media for multiple dialogs due to forking, if the IBCF is able to identify the
media associated with a dialog, (i.e., if symmetric RTP is used by the UE and
and the IBCF can use the remote SDP information to determine the source of the
media) the IBCF can selectively open the gate corresponding to an authorized
early media flow for the selected media.
The IBCF may add, or omit any P-Asserted-Identity header fields prior to
forwarding SIP messages according to local policy.
> NOTE 4: The IBCF can use the P-Asserted-Identy header field to trigger
> identity specific procedures in subsequent entities, e.g. for malicious call
> identification. As an example, a P-Asserted-Identity header field will be
> deleted and a new P-Asserted-Identity header field with operator specific
> content will be added to the outgoing request, if the request was received
> from a network which cannot support the deletion of INFO request which is
> needed for the support of the malicious call identification service.
When the IBCF, located in the home network, receives a SIP request from
another entity within the same trust domain, the IBCF may police the ICSI
value contained in the P-Asserted-Service header field.
#### 5.10.6.3 IBCF procedures for SIP message bodies
If IP address translation (NA(P)T or IP version interworking) occurs on the
user plane, the IBCF shall modify SDP according to the annex F and G as
appropriate;
Additionally, the IBCF may take the followings action upon SIP message bodies:
1) examine the length of a SIP message body and if required by local policy,
take an appropriate action (e.g. forward the message body transparently,
reject the request, remove the body);
2) examine the characteristics of the SIP message body MIMEs (i.e. check the
values of any Content-Type, Content-Disposition, and Content-Language header
fields), take an appropriate action defined by local policy (e.g. forward the
body unchanged, remove the SIP message body MIME, reject the call); and
3) examine the content of SIP message body MIMEs, and take appropriate action
defined by local policy (e.g. forward the body unchanged, remove the SIP
message body MIME, reject the call).
When the intended action of an IBCF, based on local policy, is to remove a
message body MIME from a SIP message body, and a Content-Disposition header
field with a \"handling\" parameter set to \"required\" is associated with the
MIME, the IBCF shall reject the SIP request with the 415 (Unsupported Media
Type) response code as specified in RFC 5621 [150].
### 5.10.7 Media transcoding control
#### 5.10.7.1 General
The IBCF may perform the media transcoding control in order to allow
establishing communication between IM CN subsystems using different media
codecs based on the interworking agreement and session information. When
performing media transcoding control the IBCF acts as a special case of an
IMS-ALG compliant with the description given in subclause 5.10.5.
#### 5.10.7.2 Media transcoding control procedures
Upon receipt of any request containing an SDP offer, based on local policy and
signalling inspection (e.g ICSI values, SDP), the IBCF may perform media
transcoding control. Based on the local configuration determines the media
which requires transcoding in the SDP offer.
Before forwarding the request to the answerer, the IBCF may add to the
selected media one or more codecs at the end of the codec list contained in
the SDP in order to give priority to the codecs inserted by the offerer over
the codecs inserted by the IBCF. The codecs added to the offer are based on
local policy.
NOTE 1: There is no mechanism to indicate to the terminating UE which codecs
have been inserted by the network. However, RFC 4566 [39] recommends to list
codecs in priority order, so by adding network inserted codecs to the end of
the codec list will give higher priority to previous codecs that might have
been inserted by the originating UE.
Upon receipt of any response containing an SDP answer, the IBCF shall inspect
the list of the returned codecs and proceed as follows:
\- if the list contains at least one of the codecs belonging to the original
offer, the IBCF shall not invoke the transcoding function; and
\- if the list contains none of the codecs belonging to the original offer,
the IBCF shall select one of the returned codecs introduced in the answer and
invoke the transcoding function. In order to perform the transcoding the IBCF
shall select one of the codecs originally offered and set to a non-zero port
value the related media stream in the answer sent to the offerer.
NOTE 2: The protocol used between IBCF and TrGW to allow the transport plane
media trascoding control is out of scope of this specification. The codec
selected by the answerer and the one selected by the IBCF and sent to the
offerer can be used to instruct the TrGW for the transcoding purposes.
The IBCF shall remove from the SDP the codecs added to the original offer
before forwarding the response to the offerer.
NOTE 3: In accordance with normal SDP procedure the transcoding IBCF informs
the answerer of the properties of the chosen codecs (IP-address and ports).
## 5.11 Procedures at the E-CSCF
### 5.11.1 General
The PSAP may either be directly connected to the IM CN subsystem or via the
PSTN.
The E-CSCF can receive URIs for a domain for which the operator running the
E-CSCF is not responsible. Where RFC 3261 [26] specifies a requirement that
the SIP entity has to be responsible for the domain for particular
functionality to occur, the E-CSCF may ignore this restriction.
NOTE 1: The E-CSCF would normally implement this override if the P-CSCF is
configured to pass on URIs (e.g. Request-URI) that are outside the responsible
domain of the E-CSCF, otherwise emergency calls may not be routed to a PSAP.
If the P-CSCF does not do this, then the override need not be applied.
The E-CSCF retrieves a PSAP URI, based on the location of the UE and the
requested type of emergency service. The PSAP URI can be retrieved from LRF
(see subclause 5.11.3) or from local configuration. The PSAP address will
either point to a PSAP connected to the IM CN subsystem or to a PSAP connected
to the PSTN.
If operator policy determines that the E-CSCF selects the PSAP and if, based
on the location information contained in the INVITE request, the E-CSCF fails
to select the PSAP, the E-CSCF can interrogate an external server in order to
retrieve location information.
NOTE 2: The protocol used between an E-CSCF and an external server is not
specified in this version of the specification.
When the E-CSCF receives an emergency request for a dialog requesting privacy
or a standalone emergency transaction requesting privacy or any request or
response related to a UE-originated emergency dialog requesting privacy, and
if operator policy (e.g. determined by national regulatory requirements
applicable to emergency services) allows requests for suppression of public
user identifiers and location information per 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A], the E-CSCF:
\- shall provide the privacy service role according to RFC 3323 [33] and RFC
3325 [34];
NOTE 3: The procedure above is in addition to any procedure for the
application of privacy at the edge of the trust domain specified by RFC 3325
[34] and subclause 4.4.
\- shall remove any location object from the message's body with Content-Type
header field containing the content type application/pidf+xml. If only one
message body remains in the message's body then the E-CSCF sets the Content-
Type header field to the content type specified for the body; and
\- shall remove the Geolocation header field (if present) and the Geolocation-
Routing header field (if present);
prior to forwarding any such request to a PSAP.
NOTE 4: If the routeing functions are supported by an LRF, this information is
not removed before the request is sent to the LRF.
### 5.11.2 UE originating case
The E-CSCF may either forward an emergency request to a PSAP in the IP network
or forward the request to a PSAP in the PSTN. In the latter case the request
will pass a BGCF and a MGCF before entering the PSTN.
Upon receipt of an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction,
or an unknown method including a Request-URI with an emergency service URN,
i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in
RFC 5031 [69], or an emergency number the E-CSCF shall:
1) if:
a) the topmost Route header field of the received SIP INVITE request contains
an E-CSCF URI inserted by a P-CSCF;
NOTE 1: The E-CSCF is identified by two URIs, one preconfigured in the P-CSCF
and one used to receive the request from EATF.
b) the Contact header field includes an instance-id feature tag containing an
IMEI URN as specified in RFC 7254 [153]; and
c) required by the operator policy;
then:
a0) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field;
a) insert URI of the EATF to be contacted into the Route header field as the
topmost entry followed by own URI to be used to receive the request from EATF;
b) insert a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field. The E-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the request. The
E-CSCF shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter;
c) if required by national regulatory requirements applicable to emergency
services, include:
\- a CPC with value \"emergency\"; and optionally
\- an OLI set to a value corresponding to the characteristics of the access
used when the emergency request was initiated by the UE, i.e., an OLI that
corresponds to a wireless access; and
d) route the request based on SIP routeing procedures and do not continue with
the rest of the steps;
1A) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header field;
1B) if operator policy determines that an LRF is to be used, forward the
request to the LRF as indicated in subclause 5.11.3;
2) if the PSAP is the next hop, store the value of the \"icid-value\" header
field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field and remove the
received information in the P-Charging-Vector header field, else keep the
P-Charging-Vector if the next hop is an exit IBCF or a BGCF;
3) if the PSAP is the next hop remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
fields, if present, else keep the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields
if the next hop is an exit IBCFor an BGCF;
4) if an IBCF or a BGCF is the next hop, delete any received \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter, and insert a type 2 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter into the P-Charging-Vector header field. The E-CSCF shall set the
type 2 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
sending network. The E-CSCF shall not include the \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter;
5) get location information as:
\- geographical location information received in a PIDF location object [90],
with the content type application/pidf+xml, as described RFC 6442 [89]; and
\- location identifier as derived from the P-Access-Network-Info header field,
if available.
NOTE 2: As an alternative to retrieve location information from the LRF the
E-CSCF can also request location information from an external server. The
address to the external server can be received in the Geolocation header field
as specified in RFC 6442 [89]. The protocol used to retrieve the location
information from the external server is not specified in this version of the
specification.
5A) if the location is retrieved using information from the Geolocation header
field, and if:
\- the Geolocation-Routing header field is present, and includes a value not
allowing routing of the request based on user location information;
\- the Geolocation-Routing header field is present, and includes a value
unknown to the E-CSCF; or
\- the Geolocation-Routing header field is not present.
not use the location retrieved from the Geolocation header field when deciding
where to forward the request.
6) select, based on location information and optionally type of emergency
service:
a) a PSAP connected to the IM CN subsystem and add the PSAP URI to the topmost
Route header field; or
NOTE 3: If the user did not request privacy or if national regulator policy
applicable to emergency services does not require the user be allowed to
request privacy, the E-CSCF conveys the P-Access-Network-Info header field
containing the location identifier, if defined for the access type as
specified in subclause 7.2A.4, to the PSAP.
b) a PSAP in the PSTN, add the BGCF URI to the topmost Route header field, add
a PSAP URI in tel URI format to the Request-URI with an entry used in the
PSTN/CS domain to address the PSAP and set the handling header field parameter
value of the Content-Disposition header field associated with the
application/pidf+xml message body (if present) to \"optional\";
NOTE 4: If the user did not request privacy or if national regulator policy
applicable to emergency services does not require the user be allowed to
request privacy, the E-CSCF conveys the P-Access-Network-Info header field
containing the location identifier, if defined for the access type as
specified in subclause 7.2A.4, towards the MGCF. The MGCF can translate the
location information if included in INVITE (i.e. both the geographical
location information in PIDF-LO and the location identifier in the P-Access-
Network-Info header field) into ISUP signalling, see 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B].
NOTE 5: The way the E-CSCF determines the next hop address when the PSAP
address is a tel URI is implementation dependent.
7) void;
8) if due to local policy or if the PSAP requires interconnect functionalities
(e.g. PSAP address is of an IP address type other than the IP address type
used in the IM CN subsystem), put the address of the IBCF to the topmost Route
header field, in order to forward the request to the PSAP via an IBCF in the
same network;
9) create a Record-Route header field containing its own SIP URI;
10) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, Cseq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the E-CSCF is able
to release the session if needed; and
11) if no P-Asserted-Identity header field is present and if required by
operator policy governing the indication to PSAPs that a UE does not have
sufficient credentials (e.g. determined by national regulatory requirements
applicable to emergency services), insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field
set to a non-dialable callback number (see ANSI/J-STD-036-B [176]);
NOTE 6: A P-Asserted-Identity header field that is present may contain a
reference number used in the communication between the PSAP and LRF according
to procedures in subclause 5.11.3. Such a P-Asserted-Identity header field
would not be replaced with a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to a non-
dialable callback number.
12) if required by national regulatory requirements applicable to emergency
services, include:
\- a CPC with value \"emergency\"; and optionally
\- an OLI set to a value corresponding to the characteristics of the access
used when the emergency request was initiated by the UE, i.e., an OLI that
corresponds to a wireless access; and
13) route the request based on SIP routeing procedures.
NOTE 7: Depending on local operator policy, the E-CSCF has the capability to
reject requests relating to specific methods in accordance with RFC 3261 [26],
as an alternative to the functionality described above.
Upon receipt of an initial request for a dialog, a standalone transaction, or
an unknown method, that does not include a Request-URI with an emergency
service URN or an emergency number, the E-CSCF shall reject the request by
sending a 403 (Forbidden) response.
When the E-CSCF receives the request containing the access-network-charging-
info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector, the E-CSCF shall store the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field. The
E-CSCF shall retain access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field.
When the E-CSCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a UE-originated dialog or standalone
transaction, the E-CSCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses header fields before forwarding the
message.
When the E-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response related to a UE-originated
dialog or standalone transaction, the E-CSCF shall remove any P-Preferred-
Identity header field, and insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field with the
digits that can be recognized as a valid emergency number if dialled as a tel
URI representing the number, before forwarding the message.
NOTE 8: Numbers that can be recognized as valid emergency numbers if dialled
by the user are specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A]. The emergency numbers 112
and 911 are stored on the ME, in accordance with 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A].
When the E-CSCF receives any response related to a UE-originated dialog or
standalone transaction containing a \"term-ioi\" header field parameter, the
E-CSCF shall store the value of the received \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field, if present, and
remove all received \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\" header field parameters.
NOTE 9: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 2 IOI.
The IOI identifies the sending network of the response message.
When the E-CSCF receives an INVITE request from the UE, the E-CSCF may require
the periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the E-CSCF. If
the E-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, the E-CSCF shall apply the
procedures described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 10: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
the UE or the PSAP or MGCF. This functionality cannot automatically be
granted, i.e. at least one of the involved UAs needs to support it in order to
make it work.
### 5.11.3 Use of an LRF
Where the network operator determines that an LRF is to be used, the E-CSCF
shall route initial requests for a dialog and standalone requests that contain
a an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type
of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69], or an emergency number, to the LRF
in accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 1: The E-CSCF is by definition responsible for emergency service URNs and
is therefore allowed to change the Request-URI of requests containing
emergency service URNs when a 3xx or 416 response is received.
For the outgoing request, the E-CSCF shall:
1) insert a type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector header field. The E-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the request. The
E-CSCF shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter.
When the E-CSCF receives any 3xx response to such a request, the E-CSCF shall
select a Contact header field URI from the 3xx response according to RFC 3261
[26] and continue processing the steps given in subclause 5.11.2 with the
following additions:
a) at step 6), if item a) applies, place the URI received in the selected
Contact header field URI in the 3xx response in the topmost entry in the Route
header field;
b) at step 6), if item b) applies, replace the original Request-URI with the
URI received in the selected Contact header field URI in the 3xx response; and
c) if the user did not request privacy or if national regulator policy
applicable to emergency services does not require the user be allowed to
request privacy, then if the selected Contact header field URI contains a
P-Asserted-Identity header field encoded as a header field of the URI, replace
all P-Asserted-Identity header fields in the original request with this value.
NOTE 2: Such a P-Asserted-Identiy header field contains a reference number
which is used in the communication between the PSAP and LRF.
If no 1xx or 2xx response to the request is received from the addressed PSAP
within an operator settable timeout, or a 4xx -- 5xx response is received, and
additional URI values were included in the Contact header field of the
response, the E-CSCF shall use these values according to RFC 3261 [26] in new
requests that are otherwise generated according to the rules specified above.
If no 1xx or 2xx response to the request is received from the addressed PSAP
within an operator settable timeout, or a 4xx -- 5xx response is received, and
all URI values included in the Contact header field of the 3xx response have
been attempted, the E-CSCF shall use a default URI value configured in the
E-CSCF in a new request that is otherwise generated according to the rules
specified above.
If a 6xx response to the request is received, the E-CSCF acts in accordance
with RFC 3261 [26].
When the E-CSCF receives any response related to the above request containing
a \"term-ioi\" header field parameter, the E-CSCF shall store the value of the
received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header field, if present, and remove all received \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-
ioi\" header field parameters from the forwarded response.
NOTE 3: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The IOI identifies the sending network of the response message.
If no 3xx response to the request is received from the LRF within an operator
settable timeout, the E-CSCF shall use a default URI value configured in the
E-CSCF in a request that is otherwise generated according to the rules
specified above.
### 5.11.4 Subscriptions to E-CSCF events
#### 5.11.4.1 Subscription to the event providing dialog state
When an incoming SUBSCRIBE request addressed to the E-CSCF arrives containing
the Event header field with the dialog event package, the E-CSCF shall:
1) based on the local policy, check if the request was generated by a
subscriber who is authorised to subscribe to the registration state of this
particular user. The authorized subscribers include:
\- all the LRFs that belong to the same network operator.
If the requester is not authorised, the E-CSCF shall reject the request with
an appropriate 4xx -- 6xx response;
2) store the value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field if present; and
NOTE: Any received \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the request was
sent.
3) generate a 2xx response acknowledging the SUBSCRIBE request and indicating
that the authorised subscription was successful as described in RFC 4235
[171]. The E-CSCF shall populate the header fields as follows:
\- an Expires header field, set to either the same or a decreased value as the
Expires header field in the SUBSCRIBE request; and
\- a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter, if received in the SUBSCRIBE request, and a type 3 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter. The E-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header
field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the response
and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously received
value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
The E-CSCF may set the Contact header field to an identifier uniquely
associated to the SUBSCRIBE request and generated within the E-CSCF, that may
help the E-CSCF to correlate refreshes for the SUBSCRIBE.
Afterwards the E-CSCF shall perform the procedures for notification about
dialog state as described in subclause 5.11.4.2.
When the E-CSCF receives a subscription refresh request for a dialog that was
established by the UE subscribing to the dialog event package, the E-CSCF
shall accept the request.
#### 5.11.4.2 Notification about dialog state
The E-CSCF shall send a NOTIFY request when an event pertaining to the dialog
or dialogs occurs, as specified in RFC 3265 [28].
When generating NOTIFY requests, the E-CSCF shall not preclude any valid
dialog event package parameters in accordance with RFC 4235 [171].Where RFC
4235 [171] expresses an option or only a recommendation as to the generation
of a NOTIFY request, it is a matter of operator policy as to whether such
requests are generated.
For each NOTIFY request triggered by an event and on all dialogs which have
been established due to subscription to the dialog event package, and in
addition to the requirements specified in RFC 4235 [171], the E-CSCF shall:
1) set the P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17], and a type 3 \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter. The E-CSCF shall set the type 3 \"orig-ioi\"
header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the
request. The E-CSCF shall not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter.
2) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include one \ XML element for
each dialog to be reported in accordance with the subscription; and
3) for each \ XML element:
\- if the subscription is for all dialogs, rather than a specific dialog, then
include the call-id attribute.
If the subscription is to a specific dialog (or to a specific set of dialogs),
when sending a final NOTIFY request with all dialogs set to a state of
\"terminated\", the E-CSCF shall also terminate the subscription to the dialog
event package by setting the Subscription-State header field to the value of
\"terminated\".
When the E-CSCF receives any response to the NOTIFY request, the E-CSCF shall
store the value of the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter received in the
P-Charging-Vector header field, if present.
NOTE: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will be a type 3 IOI.
The type 3 IOI identifies the service provider from which the response was
sent.
## 5.12 Location Retrieval Function (LRF)
### 5.12.1 General
The LRF can receive URIs for a domain for which the operator running the LRF
is not responsible. Where RFC 3261 [26] specifies a requirement that the SIP
entity has to be responsible for the domain for particular functionality to
occur, the LRF may ignore this restriction.
NOTE: The LRF would normally implement this override if the P-CSCF is
configured to pass on URIs (e.g. Request-URI) that are outside the responsible
domain of the LRF, otherwise emergency calls may not be routed to a PSAP. If
the P-CSCF does not do this, then the override need not be applied.
### 5.12.2 Treatment of incoming initial requests for a dialog and standalone
requests
The LRF shall respond to all received initial requests for a dialog, and to
all standalone requests, as a redirect server as defined in subclause 8.3 of
RFC 3261 [26] with the following additions:
1) the LRF shall generate a 300 (Multiple Choices) response to all such
requests;
2) the LRF shall set the Contact header field of the response to a list (one
or more) address(es) of PSAP(s), selected according to network operator
policy;
NOTE 1: The mechanisms for selection of PSAP addresses are outside the scope
of this specification, but can be based on a variety of input information
including the value of the URN included in the Request-URI of the request, the
value of the Geolocation header field and the Geolocation-Routing header field
received in the request, the value of the P-Access-Network-Info header field
received in the request, any location known at the LRF for the requesting user
as identified by the P-Access-Network-Info header field.
2A) if the location is retrieved using information from the Geolocation header
field, and if:
\- the Geolocation-Routing header field is present, and includes a value not
allowing routing of the request based on user location information;
\- the Geolocation-Routing header field is present, and includes a value
unknown to the LRF; or
\- the Geolocation-Routing header field is not present.
the LRF shall not use the location retrieved from the Geolocation header field
when selecting PSAP(s).
3) the LRF shall insert a P-Charging-Vector header field containing the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the request and a type 3
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter. The LRF shall set the type 3 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter to a value that identifies the service provider from
which the response is sent and the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set
to the previously received value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter; and
4) optionally, generate a reference identifier and set the P-Asserted-Identity
header field encoded as a header field of the URI in the Contact header field
to this value in each included Contact header field URI associated with a
PSAP. The LRF shall maintain state for any generated reference identifier. If
the LRF uses a SIP URI (or any other permitted URI scheme other than tel URI)
as the reference identifier, the the LRF has the responsibility of ensuring
(e.g. by configuration) that the emergency request is being routed to an IP
connected PSAP. Subclause 5.12.3.1 defines a means of maintaining the state of
the reference identifier. If required by operator policy governing the
indication to PSAPs that a UE does not have sufficient credentials (e.g.
determined by national regulatory requirements applicable to emergency
services), the reference identifier shall not be equal to a non-dialable
callback number used to indicate the UE does not have credentials.
NOTE 2: The reference identifier is used to correlate information requested
over the Le interface (see 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B]) and is not needed if the Le
interface is not used. The protocol at the Le interface is not defined in this
release.
NOTE 3: The reference identifier is managed by the RDF and the LRF obtains the
appropriate identifier from the RDF. In some regional systems, this reference
identifier is the ESQK.
### 5.12.3 Subscription and notification
#### 5.12.3.1 Notification about dialog state
Based on operator policy, the LRF can either subscribe to all dialog
information on an E-CSCF or individually subscribe to each dialog as it
receives the requests.
NOTE 1: Subscription to dialog information is dependent on the use of Le
interface as described in subclause 5.12.2.
In the case that the LRF is subscribing to all dialogs at the E-CSCF, the LRF
shall generate a SUBSCRIBE request to the dialog state event package in
accordance with RFC 3265 [28] and RFC 4235 [171]. The LRF shall include the
following additional information in the SUBSCRIBE request:
a) the Request-URI set to an E-CSCF address;
NOTE 2: In this case, it is expected that the LRF will be configured with a
set of E-CSCF addresses, and the LRF will subscribe to all of them.
b) no header field parameters in the Event header field;
c) an Expires header field set to 600 000 seconds; and
d) a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 3 \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter. The type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter
identifies the service provider from which the request is sent. The LRF shall
not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter.
Upon generation of a 300 response to an incoming dialog forming request that
contains a reference identifier, and in the case that the LRF is subscribing
to individual dialogs at the E-CSCF, the LRF shall generate a SUBSCRIBE
request to the dialog state event package in accordance with RFC 3265 [28] and
RFC 4235 [171]. The LRF shall include the following additional information in
the SUBSCRIBE request:
a) the Request-URI set to the value of the P-Asserted-Identity in the original
request to which the response was generated;
b) a Route header field that addresses the request to the E-CSCF. How such a
value is determined depends on deployment;
NOTE 3: A number of mechanisms exist for identifying the required E-CSCF,
however all suffer some restrictions. It is therefore a matter of
configuration at deployment time to identify the solution that works for that
particular deployment. Mechanisms that exist include:
i) if there is only one E-CSCF in the network, using the address of that
E-CSCF preconfigured into the system;
ii) using the last entry in the Via header field of the original request to
which the 3xx response was generated. If the deployment however includes some
intermediate SIP proxy or B2BUA not otherwise included in the emergency call
architecture this will not provide the desired result; or
iii) using the IP address from which the original request was received to
which the 3xx response was generated. The request is sent to the same port
number and IP address as the 3xx response was generated. If the deployment
however includes some intermediate SIP proxy or B2BUA not otherwise included
in the emergency call architecture this will not provide the desired result,
and additionally, if the system is set up to use port numbers in a
unidirectional manner, i.e. one port number for requests and another port
number for responses, it will also not operate correctly.
c) the \"call-id\" and \"to-tag\" header field parameters in the Event header
field set to the values in the original request to which the 3xx response was
generated. No \"from-tag\" header field parameter can be included as it is not
known by the LRF;
d) an Expires header field set to 86400 seconds; and
e) a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 3 \"orig-
ioi\" header field parameter. The type 3 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter
identifies the service provider from which the request is sent. The LRF shall
not include the type 3 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter.
In the case that the LRF is subscribing to individual dialogs at the E-CSCF,
and a NOTIFY request is received indicating a state of \"terminated\", the LRF
shall end the subscription to the dialog event package.
NOTE 4: Such NOTIFY requests will normally be accompanied by the Subscription-
State header field set to the value of \"terminated\".
When, as a result of successful subscription to the dialog event package, the
LRF receives a notification containing dialog updates, the LRF shall update
its record for each dialog included in the event package information.
# 6 Application usage of SDP
## 6.1 Procedures at the UE
### 6.1.1 General
The \"integration of resource management and SIP\" extension is hereafter in
this subclause referred to as \"the precondition mechanism\" and is defined in
RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64].
In order to authorize the media streams, the P-CSCF and S-CSCF have to be able
to inspect the SDP payloads. Hence, the UE shall not encrypt the SDP payloads.
During the session establishment procedure, and during session modification
procedures, SIP messages shall only contain SDP payload if that is intended to
modify the session description, or when the SDP payload is included in the
message because of SIP rules described in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 1: A codec can have multiple payload type numbers associated with it.
In order to support accurate bandwidth calculations, the UE may include the
\"a=ptime\" attribute for all \"audio\" media lines as described in RFC 4566
[39]. If a UE receives an \"audio\" media line with \"a=ptime\" specified, the
UE should transmit at the specified packetization rate. If a UE receives an
\"audio\" media line which does not have \"a=ptime\" specified or the UE does
not support the \"a=ptime\" attribute, the UE should transmit at the default
codec packetization rate as defined in RFC 3551 [55A]. The UE will transmit
consistent with the resources available from the network.
For \"video\" and \"audio\" media types that utilize the RTP/RTCP, the UE
shall specify the proposed bandwidth for each media stream utilizing the
\"b=\" media descriptor and the \"AS\" bandwidth modifier in the SDP.
For \"video\" and \"audio\" media types that utilize the RTP/RTCP, in addition
to the \"b=AS\" parameter, the UE may specify the \"b=TIAS\", and
\"a=maxprate\" parameters in accordance with RFC 3890 [152]. The value of the
parameter shall be determined as described in RFC 3890 [152]. The value or
absence of the \"b=\" parameter(s) may affect the assigned QoS which is
defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [13C].
If a UE receives a media line which contains both a=ptime and a=maxprate, the
UE should use the a=maxprate value, if this attribute is supported.
If multiple codecs are specified on the media line, \"a=maxprate\" (or
\"a=ptime\" if \"a=maxprate\" is not available or not supported) should be
used to derive the packetization time used for all codecs specified on the
media line. Given that not all codecs support identical ranges of
packetization, the UE should ensure that the packetization derived by
\"a=maxprate\" (or \"a=ptime\" if \"a=maxprate\" is not available or not
supported) is a valid packetization time for each codec specified in the list.
If the media line in the SDP indicates the usage of RTP/RTCP, and if the UE is
configured to request an RTCP bandwidth level for the session is different
than the default RTCP bandwidth as specified in RFC 3556 [56], then in
addition to the \"AS\" bandwidth modifier in the media-level \"b=\" line, the
UE shall include two media-level \"b=\" lines, one with the \"RS\" bandwidth
modifier and the other with the \"RR\" bandwidth modifier as described in RFC
3556 [56] to specify the required bandwidth allocation for RTCP. The
bandwidth-value in the b=RS: and b=RR: lines may include transport overhead as
described in subclause 6.1 of RFC 3890 [152].
For other media streams the \"b=\" media descriptor may be included. The value
or absence of the \"b=\" parameter will affect the assigned QoS which is
defined in or 3GPP 29.213 [13C].
NOTE 2: In a two-party session where both participants are active, the RTCP
receiver reports are not sent, therefore, the RR bandwidth modifier will
typically get the value of zero.
If an in-band DTMF codec is supported by the application associated with an
audio media stream, then the UE shall include, in addition to the payload
types associated with the audio codecs for the media stream, for each clock
rate associated with the audio codecs for the media stream, the MIME subtype
\"telephone-event\" in the SDP \"m=\" media descriptor associated with the
media stream, to indicate support of in-band DTMF as described in RFC 4733
[23].
The UE shall inspect the SDP contained in any SIP request or response, looking
for possible indications of grouping of media streams according to RFC 3524
[54] and perform the appropriate actions for IP-CAN bearer establishment for
media according to IP-CAN specific procedures (see subclause B.2.2.5 for IP-
CAN implemented using GPRS).
In case of UE initiated resource reservation and if the UE determines resource
reservation is needed, the UE shall start reserving its local resources
whenever it has sufficient information about the media streams, media
authorization and used codecs available.
NOTE 3: Based on this resource reservation can, in certain cases, be initiated
immediately after the sending or receiving of the initial SDP offer.
In order to fulfil the QoS requirements of one or more media streams, the UE
may re-use previously reserved resources. In this case the UE shall indicate
as met the local preconditions related to the media stream, for which
resources are re-used.
If the SDP is affected due to a rejected IP-CAN bearer or a modified IP-CAN
bearer then the UE shall:
1) update the session according to RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3311 [29];
2) release the session according to RFC 3261 [26];
3) cancel the session setup or the session modification according to RFC 3261
[26]; or
4) reject the session setup or the session modification according to RFC 3261
[26].
NOTE 4: The UE can use one IP address for signalling (and specify it in the
Contact header field) and different IP address(es) for media (and specify it
in the \"c=\" parameter of the SDP).
If the UE wants to transport media streams with TCP and there are no specific
alternative negotiation mechanisms defined for that particular application,
then the UE shall support the procedures and the SDP rules specified in RFC
4145 [83].
### 6.1.2 Handling of SDP at the originating UE
An INVITE request generated by a UE shall contain a SDP offer and at least one
media description. The SDP offer shall reflect the calling user\'s terminal
capabilities and user preferences for the session.
If the desired QoS resources for one or more media streams have not been
reserved at the UE when constructing the SDP offer, the UE:
\- shall indicate the related local preconditions for QoS as not met, using
the segmented status type, as defined in RFC 3312 [30] and RFC 4032 [64], as
well as the strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for the local segment and the
strength-tag value \"optional\" for the remote segment, if the UE supports the
precondition mechanism (see subclause 5.1.3.1);
\- shall set the related media streams to inactive, by including an
\"a=inactive\" line, according to the procedures described in RFC 4566 [39],
unless the UE knows that the precondition mechanism is supported by the remote
UE; and
NOTE 1: When setting the media streams to the inactive mode, the UE can
include in the first SDP offer the proper values for the RS and RR modifiers
and associate bandwidths to prevent the receiving of the RTCP packets, and not
send any RTCP packets.
\- if the UE supports the precondition mechanism (see subclause 5.1.3.1),
shall not request confirmation for the result of the resource reservation (as
defined in RFC 3312 [30]) at the terminating UE.
If the UE supports the precondition mechanism (see subclause 5.1.3.1), and the
desired QoS resources for one or more media streams are available at the UE
when the SDP offer is sent, the UE shall indicate the related local
preconditions as met, using the segmented status type, as defined in RFC 3312
[30] and RFC 4032 [64], as well as the strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for
the local segment and the strength-tag value \"optional\" for the remote
segment and shall not request confirmation for the result of the resource
reservation (as defined in RFC 3312 [30]) at the terminating UE.
NOTE 2: If the originating UE does not support the precondition mechanism it
will not include any precondition information in SDP.
If the UE indicated support for end-to-access-edge security during
registration, and the P-CSCF indicated support for end-to-access-edge security
during registration, then upon generating an SDP offer for media plane
security containing an SDES crypto attribute as defined in RFC 4568 [168], the
UE shall include the SDES crypto attribute according to the profile defined in
3GPP TS 33.328 [19C] and an SDP attribute \"a=3ge2ae:requested\" for all media
with the following exceptions:
a) media transported by a protocol with no supported media security mechanism;
and
NOTE 3: This release of this document supports only media security mechanisms
for RTP based media.
b) media for which the UE requests an end-to-end security mechanism.
If the P-CSCF did not indicate support for end-to-access-edge security during
registration, the UE shall not include an attribute \"a=3ge2ae:requested\" in
any SDP offer.
When the UE detects that an emergency call is being made, the UE shall not
include end-to-end media security on any media in the SDP offer.
Upon generating the SDP offer for an INVITE request generated after receiving
a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response, as described in subclause 5.1.3.1, the
UE shall include SDP payload containing a subset of the allowed media types,
codecs and other parameters from the SDP payload of all 488 (Not Acceptable
Here) responses related to the same session establishment attempt (i.e. a set
of INVITE requests used for the same session establishment). For each media
line, the UE shall order the codecs in the SDP payload according to the order
of the codecs in the SDP payload of the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) responses.
NOTE 4: The UE can attempt a session establishment through multiple networks
with different policies and potentially can need to send multiple INVITE
requests and receive multiple 488 (Not Acceptable Here) responses from
different CSCF nodes. The UE therefore takes into account the SDP contents of
all the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) responses received related to the same
session establishment when building a new INVITE request.
Upon confirming successful local resource reservation, the UE shall create an
SDP offer in which:
\- the related local preconditions are set to met, using the segmented status
type, as defined in RFC 3312 [30] and RFC 4032 [64]; and
\- the media streams previously set to inactive mode are set to active
(sendrecv, sendonly or recvonly) mode.
Upon receiving an SDP answer, which includes more than one codec per media
stream, excluding the in-band DTMF codec, as described in subclause 6.1.1, the
UE shall send an SDP offer at the first possible time, selecting only one
codec per media stream.
If the UE sends an initial INVITE request that includes only an IPv6 address
in the SDP offer, and receives an error response (e.g., 488 (Not Acceptable
Here) with 301 Warning header field) indicating \"incompatible network address
format\", the UE shall send an ACK as per standard SIP procedures.
Subsequently, the UE may acquire an IPv4 address or use an existing IPv4
address, and send a new initial INVITE request to the same destination
containing only the IPv4 address in the SDP offer.
### 6.1.3 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE
Upon receipt of an initial SDP offer in which no precondition information is
available, the terminating UE shall in the SDP answer:
\- if, prior to sending the SDP answer the desired QoS resources have been
reserved at the terminating UE, set the related media streams in the SDP
answer to:
\- active mode, if the offered media streams were not listed as inactive; or
\- inactive mode, if the offered media streams were listed as inactive.
If the terminating UE had previously set one or more media streams to inactive
mode and the QoS resources for those media streams are now ready, the UE shall
set the media streams to active mode by applying the procedures described in
RFC 4566 [39] with respect to setting the direction of media streams.
Upon sending a SDP answer to an SDP offer (which included one or more media
lines which was offered with several codecs) the terminating UE shall select
exactly one codec per media line and indicate only the selected codec for the
related media stream. In addition, the UE may indicate support of the in-band
DTMF codec, as described in subclause 6.1.1.
Upon sending a SDP answer to an SDP offer, with the SDP answer including one
or more media streams for which the originating side did indicate its local
preconditions as not met, if the precondition mechanism is supported by the
terminating UE, the terminating UE shall indicate its local preconditions and
request the confirmation for the result of the resource reservation at the
originating end point.
NOTE 1: If the terminating UE does not support the precondition mechanism it
will ignore any precondition information received from the originating UE.
Upon receiving an initial INVITE request, that includes the SDP offer
containing an IP address type (in the \"c=\" parameter) that is not supported
by the UE, the UE shall respond with the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
with 301 Warning header field indicating \"incompatible network address
format\".
NOTE 2: Upon receiving an initial INVITE request that does not include an SDP
offer, the UE can accept the request and include an SDP offer in the first
reliable response. The SDP offer will reflect the called user\'s terminal
capabilities and user preferences for the session.
If the UE receives an SDP offer that specifies different IP address type for
media (i.e. specify it in the \"c=\" parameter of the SDP offer) that the UE
is using for signalling, and if the UE supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
simultaneously, the UE shall accept the received SDP offer. Subsequently, the
UE shall either acquire an IP address type or use an existing IP address type
as specified in the SDP offer, and include it in the \"c=\" parameter in the
SDP answer.
NOTE 3: Upon receiving an initial INVITE request, that includes an SDP offer
containing connection addresses (in the \"c=\" parameter) equal to zero, the
UE will select the media streams that is willing to accept for the session,
reserve the QoS resources for accepted media streams, and include its valid
connection address in the SDP answer.
Upon receiving an initial INVITE request, that includes an SDP offer
containing an SDES crypto attribute as defined in RFC 4568 [168] and
indicating that the P-CSCF has applied e2ae-security to the media plane (i.e.
\"a=3ge2ae:applied\") the UE shall:
1) proceed with the session setup as described in this subclause and
indicating media plane security using SDES as defined in RFC 4568 [168],
implementing the SDES crypto attribute according to the profile defined in
3GPP TS 33.328 [19C]; or
2) act based on local policy (local policy can e.g. cause the UE to reject the
incoming call, or to trigger user interaction).
## 6.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
When the P-CSCF receives any SIP request containing an SDP offer, the P-CSCF
shall examine the media parameters in the received SDP. If the P-CSCF finds
any media parameters which are not allowed on the network by local policy or
if available by bandwidth authorisation limitation information coming from the
IP-CAN (e.g. via PCRF), the P-CSCF shall return a 488 (Not Acceptable Here)
response containing SDP payload. This SDP payload contains either all the
media types, codecs and other SDP parameters which are allowed according to
the local policy, or, based on configuration by the operator of the P-CSCF, a
subset of these allowed parameters. This subset may depend on the content of
the received SIP request. The P-CSCF shall build the SDP payload in the 488
(Not Acceptable Here) response in the same manner as a UAS builds the SDP in a
488 (Not Acceptable Here) response as specifed in RFC 3261 [26]. For each
media line, the P-CSCF shall order the codecs with the most preferred codec
listed first. If the SDP offer is encrypted, the P-CSCF may reject the
request.
When the P-CSCF receives a SIP response different from 200 (OK) response
containing SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall not examine the media parameters in the
received SDP offer, but the P-CSCF shall rather check the succeeding request
containing the SDP answer for this offer, and if necessary (i.e. the SDP
answer reduced by the UE still breaches local policy, or if available by
bandwidth authorisation limitation information coming from the IP-CAN, e.g.
via PCRF), the P-CSCF shall return a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
containing the local policy allowed SDP payload. If the SDP answer is
encrypted, the P-CSCF may reject the succeeding request.
When the P-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response containing SDP offer, the P-CSCF
shall examine the media parameters in the received SDP. If the P-CSCF finds
any media parameters which are not allowed on the network by local policy or
if available by bandwidth authorisation limitation information coming from the
IP-CAN (e.g. via PCRF), the P-CSCF shall forward the SDP offer and on the
receipt of the ACK request containing the SDP answer, the P-CSCF shall
immediately terminate the session as described in subclause 5.2.8.1.2. If the
SDP offer is encrypted, the P-CSCF shall forward the SDP offer and on the
receipt of the ACK request containing the SDP answer, it may immediately
terminate the session as described in subclause 5.2.8.1.2.
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT controlled by the P-CSCF, or by a hosted NAT, the
P-CSCF may need to modify the media connection data in SDP bodies according to
the procedures described in annex F and/or annex G.
The P-CSCF shall apply and maintain the same policy within the SDP from the
initial request or response containing SDP and throughout the complete SIP
session.
The P-CSCF may inspect, if present, the \"b=RS\" and \"b=RR\" lines in order
to find out the bandwidth allocation requirements for RTCP.
Additional procedures where the P-CSCF acts as an IMS-ALG are given in
subclause 6.7.2.
## 6.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
When the S-CSCF receives any SIP request containing an SDP offer, the S-CSCF
shall examine the media parameters in the received SDP. If the S-CSCF finds
any media parameters which are not allowed based on local policy or
subscription (i.e. the information in the instances of the Core Network
Service Authorization class in the service profile, described in 3GPP TS
29.228 [14]), the S-CSCF shall return a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
containing SDP payload. This SDP payload contains either all the media types,
codecs and other SDP parameters which are allowed according to the local
policy and users subscription or, based on configuration by the operator of
the S-CSCF, a subset of these allowed parameters. This subset may depend on
the content of the received SIP request. The S-CSCF shall build the SDP
payload in the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response in the same manner as a UAS
builds the SDP in a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response as specified in RFC
3261 [26]. If the SDP offer is encrypted, the S-CSCF may reject the request.
When the S-CSCF receives a SIP response different from 200 (OK) response
containing SDP offer, the S-CSCF shall not examine the media parameters in the
received SDP offer, but the S-CSCFshall rather check the succeeding request
containing the SDP answer for this offer, and if necessary (i.e. the SDP
answer reduced by the UE still breaches local policy), the S-CSCF shall return
a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response containing the local policy allowed SDP
payload. If the SDP answer is encrypted, the S-CSCF may reject the succeeding
request.
When the S-CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response containing SDP offer, the S-CSCF
shall examine the media parameters in the received SDP. If the S-CSCF finds
any media parameters which are not allowed based on local policy or
subscription (i.e. the information in the instances of the Core Network
Service Authorization class in the service profile, described in 3GPP TS
29.228 [14]), the S-CSCF shall forward the SDP offer and on the receipt of the
ACK request containing the SDP answer, the S-CSCF shall immediately terminate
the session as described in subclause 5.4.5.1.2. If the SDP offer is
encrypted, the S-CSCF shall forward the SDP offer and on the receipt of the
ACK request containing the SDP answer, it may immediately terminate the
session as described in subclause 5.4.5.1.2.
## 6.4 Procedures at the MGCF
### 6.4.1 Calls originating from circuit-switched networks
The usage of SDP by the MGCF is the same as its usage by the UE, as defined in
the subclause 6.1 and A.3.2, with the following exceptions:
> \- in an initial SDP offer the MGCF shall not use the \"inactive\" attribute
> when the local preconditions are met;
\- if local preconditions are not met at the MGCF and local configuration
indicates that the MGCF is serving users not supporting SIP preconditions,
then the MGCF shall set the inactive mode (by including an attribute
\"a=inactive\") in an initial SDP offer, (otherwise all served users support
the SIP precondtions and the inactive indication is not needed);
\- in an initial INVITE request generated by a MGCF, the MGCF shall indicate
the current status of the local precondition; and
\- end-to-access edge security is not applicable to the MGCF.
When sending an SDP, the MGCF shall not include the \"i=\", \"u=\", \"e=\",
\"p=\", \"r=\", and \"z=\" descriptors in the SDP, and the MGCF shall ignore
them when received in the SDP.
When the MGCF generates and sends an INVITE request for a call originating in
a circuit-switched network, the MGCF shall:
\- populate the SDP with the codecs supported by the associated MGW; and
\- in order to support DTMF, populate the SDP with MIME subtype \"telephone-
event\" as described in RFC 4733 [23].
When the MGCF receives 183 (Session Progress) response to an INVITE request,
the MGCF shall:
\- check that a supported codec has been indicated in the SDP.
### 6.4.2 Calls terminating in circuit-switched networks
The usage of SDP by the MGCF is the same as its usage by the UE, as defined in
the subclause 6.1 and A.3.2, with the following exceptions:
a) when the MGCF sends a 183 (Session Progress) response with SDP payload, the
MGCF shall only request confirmation for the result of the resource
reservation (as defined in RFC 3312 [30]) at the originating end point if all
of the following conditions are true:
there are any remaining unfulfilled preconditions at the originating end
point;
\- the received initial INVITE request indicates support of SIP preconditions;
and
\- local configuration indicates support of SIP preconditions; and
b) end-to-access edge security is not applicable to the MGCF.
When sending an SDP, the MGCF shall not include the \"i=\", \"u=\", \"e=\",
\"p=\", \"r=\", and \"z=\" descriptors in the SDP, and the MGCF shall ignore
them when received in the SDP.
When the MGCF receives an initial INVITE request, the MGCF shall:
\- check for a codec that matches the requested SDP, which may include the
MIME subtype \"telephone-event\" as described in RFC 4733 [23].
When the MGCF generates and sends a 183 (Session Progress) response to an
initial INVITE request, the MGCF shall:
\- set SDP indicating the selected codec, which may include the MIME subtype
\"telephone-event\" as described in RFC 4733 [23].
## 6.5 Procedures at the MRFC
Void.
## 6.6 Procedures at the AS
Since an AS may provide a wide range of different services, procedures for the
SDP usage for an AS acting as originating UA, terminating UA or third-party
call control role are dependent on the service provided to the UA and on the
capabilities on the remote UA. There is no special requirements regarding the
usage of the SDP, except the requirements for the SDP capabilities described
in the following paragraphs and clause A.3:
1) Providing that an INVITE request generated by an AS contains SDP payload,
the AS has the capability of reflecting the originating AS\'s capabilities,
desired QoS and precondition requirements for the session in the SDP payload.
2) When the AS sends a 183 (Session Progress) response with SDP payload
including one or more \"m=\" media types, it has the capability of requesting
confirmation for the result of the resource reservation at the originating
endpoint.
## 6.7 Procedures at the IMS-ALG functionality
### 6.7.1 IMS-ALG in IBCF
When the IBCF acts as an IMS-ALG, it makes procedures as for an originating UA
and terminating UA. The IMS-ALG acts as a B2BUA. The treatment of the SDP
information between originating UA and terminating UA is described in 3GPP TS
29.162 [11A].
### 6.7.2 IMS-ALG in P-CSCF for media plane security
When the P-CSCF acts as an IMS-ALG, it acts as a B2BUA and modifies the SDP as
described as described in 3GPP TS 23.334 [7F].
When the P-CSCF on the originating side indicated support for media plane end-
to-access-edge security, and the P-CSCF receives an SDP offer containing an
SDES crypto attribute as defined in RFC 4568 [168], it shall examine the
received SDP attributes. If the received offer contains an
\"a=3ge2ae:requested\" SDP attribute then the P-CSCF shall act as an IMS-ALG.
The P-CSCF will act as defined in 3GPP TS 23.334 [7F] as far as SDP and SRTP
is concerned. In addition, the P-CSCF shall strip the \"a=3ge2ae:requested\"
SDP attribute and the SDES crypto attribute from the received SDP offer.
When the P-CSCF on the terminating side supporting media plane end-to-access-
edge security receives an SDP offer not containing SRTP as transport, it may
invoke IMS-ALG procedures related to SDP and SRTP as defined in 3GPP TS 23.334
[7F] based on local policy.
NOTE 1: A possible local policy is that the IMS-ALG invokes procedures related
to SDP and SRTP for Fixed-broadband IP-CAN, but not for cellular IP-CAN.
If the served UE indicated support for end-to-access-edge security, as defined
in 3GPP TS 33.328 [19C], during registration and the P-CSCF indicated support
for e2ae-security during registration, then upon generating an SDP offer for
media plane security containing an SDES crypto attribute as defined in RFC
4568 [168], the P-CSCF shall include a SDES crypto attribute according to the
profile defined in 3GPP TS 33.328 [19C] and a \"a=3ge2ae:applied\" SDP
attribute for all media, with the following exceptions:
a) media transported by a protocol with no supported end-to-access-edge media
security mechanism; and
NOTE 2: This release of this document supports only media security mechanisms
for RTP based media.
b) media for which the result of the SDP offer / answer exchange results in
the application of an end-to-end security mechanism.

### 7.2A Extensions to SIP header fields defined within the present document
#### 7.2A.1 Extension to WWW-Authenticate header field
##### 7.2A.1.1 Introduction
This extension defines a new authentication parameter (auth-param) for the
WWW-Authenticate header field used in a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the
REGISTER request. For more information, see RFC 2617 [21] subclause 3.2.1.
##### 7.2A.1.2 Syntax
The syntax for for auth-param is specified in table 7.4.
Table 7.4: Syntax of auth-param
auth-param = 1#( integrity-key / cipher-key )
integrity-key = \"ik\" EQUAL ik-value
cipher-key = \"ck\" EQUAL ck-value
ik-value = LDQUOT *(HEXDIG) RDQUOT
ck-value = LDQUOT *(HEXDIG) RDQUOT
##### 7.2A.1.3 Operation
This authentication parameter will be used in a 401 (Unauthorized) response in
the WWW-Authenticate header field during UE authentication procedure as
specified in subclause 5.4.1.
The S-CSCF appends the integrity-key parameter (directive) to the
WWW.-Authenticate header field in a 401 (Unauthorized) response. The P-CSCF
stores the integrity-key value and removes the integrity-key parameter from
the header field prior to forwarding the response to the UE.
The S-CSCF appends the cipher-key parameter (directive) to the WWW-
Authenticate header field in a 401 (Unauthorized) response. The P-CSCF removes
the cipher-key parameter from the header field prior to forwarding the
response to the UE. In the case ciphering is used, the P-CSCF stores the
cipher-key value.
### 7.2A.2 Extension to Authorization header field
#### 7.2A.2.1 Introduction
This extension defines a new auth-param for the Authorization header field
used in REGISTER requests. For more information, see RFC 2617 [21] subclause
3.2.2.
#### 7.2A.2.2 Syntax
The syntax of auth-param for the Authorization header field is specified in
table 7.5.
Table 7.5: Syntax of auth-param for Authorization header field
auth-param = \"integrity-protected\" EQUAL (\"yes\" / \"no\" / \"tls-pending\"
/ \"tls-yes\" / \"ip-assoc-pending\" / \"ip-assoc-yes\") / \"auth-done\"
#### 7.2A.2.3 Operation
This authentication parameter is inserted in the Authorization header field of
all the REGISTER requests. The value of the \"integrity-protected\" header
field parameter in the auth-param parameter is set as specified in subclause
5.2.2. This information is used by S-CSCF to decide whether to challenge the
REGISTER request or not, as specified in subclause 5.4.1.
The values in the \"integrity-protected\" header field field are defined as
follows:
\"yes\": indicates that a REGISTER request received in the P-CSCF is protected
using an IPsec security association and IMS AKA is used as authentication
scheme.
\"no\": indicates that a REGISTER request received in the P-CSCF is not
protected using an IPsec security association and IMS AKA is used as
authentication scheme, i.e. this is an initial REGISTER request with the
Authorization header field not containing a challenge response.
\"tls-yes\": indicates that a REGISTER request is received in the P-CSCF
protected over a TLS connection and the Session ID, IP address and port for
the TLS connection are already bound to a private user identity. The S-CSCF
will decide whether or not to challenge such a REGISTER request based on its
policy. This is used in case of SIP digest with TLS.
\"tls-pending\": indicates that a REGISTER request is received in the P-CSCF
protected over a TLS connection and the Session ID, IP address and port for
the TLS connection are not yet bound to a private user identity. The S-CSCF
shall challenge such a REGISTER request if it does not contain an
Authorization header field with a challenge response or if the verification of
the challenge response fails. This is used in case of SIP digest with TLS.
\"ip-assoc-yes\": indicates that a REGISTER request received in the P-CSCF
does map to an existing IP association in case SIP digest without TLS is used.
\"ip-assoc-pending\": indicates that a REGISTER request received in the P-CSCF
does not map to an existing IP association, and does contain a challenge
response in case SIP digest without TLS is used.
\"auth-done\": indicates that a REGISTER request is sent from an entity that
is trusted and has authenticated the identities used in the REGISTER request.
An example for such an entity is the MSC server enhanced for IMS centralized
services. The S-CSCF shall skip authentication.
NOTE 1: In case of SIP digest with TLS is used, but the REGISTER request was
not received over TLS, the P-CSCF does not include an \"integrity-protected\"
header field parameter in the auth-param to indicate that an initial REGISTER
request was not received over an existing TLS session. The S-CSCF will always
challenge such a REGISTER request.
NOTE 2: In case of SIP digest without TLS is used, but the REGISTER request
was not received over TLS, the P-CSCF does not include an \"integrity-
protected\" header field parameter in the auth-param to indicate that the
REGISTER request does not map to an existing IP association, and does not
contain a challenge response. The S-CSCF will always challenge such a REGISTER
request.
NOTE 3: The value \"yes\" is also used when an initial REGISTER request
contains an Authorization header field with a challenge response as in this
case the IPsec association is already in use, and its use by the UE implicitly
authenticates the UE. This is a difference to TLS case where the use of TLS
alone does not yet implicitly authenticates the UE. Hence in the TLS case, for
an initial REGISTER request containing an Authorization header field with a
challenge response the value \"tls-pending\" and not \"tls-yes\" is used.
### 7.2A.3 Tokenized-by header field parameter definition (various header
fields)
#### 7.2A.3.1 Introduction
The \"tokenized-by\" header field parameter is an extension parameter appended
to encrypted entries in various SIP header fields as defined in subclause
5.10.4.
#### 7.2A.3.2 Syntax
The syntax for the \"tokenized-by\" header field parameter is specified in
table 7.6:
Table 7.6: Syntax of tokenized-by-param
rr-param = tokenized-by-param / generic-param
via-params = via-ttl / via-maddr
/ via-received / via-branch
/ tokenized-by-param / via-extension
tokenized-by-param = \"tokenized-by\" EQUAL hostname
The BNF for rr-param and via-params is taken from IETF RFC 3261 [26] and
modified accordingly.
#### 7.2A.3.3 Operation
The \"tokenized-by\" header field parameter is appended by IBCF (THIG) after
all encrypted strings within SIP header fields when network configuration
hiding is active. The value of the header field parameter is the domain name
of the network which encrypts the information.
### 7.2A.4 P-Access-Network-Info header field
#### 7.2A.4.1 Introduction
The P-Access-Network-Info header field is extended to include specific
information relating to particular access technologies.
#### 7.2A.4.2 Syntax
The syntax of the P-Access-Network-Info header field is described in RFC 3455
[52]. There are additional coding rules for this header field depending on the
type of IP-CAN, according to access technology specific descriptions.
Table 7.6A describes the 3GPP-specific extended syntax of the P-Access-
Network-Info header field defined in RFC 3455 [52].

The presence of the \"np\" parameter indicates a P-Access-Network-Info header
field is provided by the P-CSCF. The content can differ from a P-Access-
Network-Info header field without this parameter which is provided by the UE.
The \"np\" parameter can be used with both \"access-type\" and \"access-
class\" constructs. The \"access-type\" construct is provided for use where
the value is not known to be specific to a particular \"access-class\" value,
e.g. in the case of some values delivered from the PCRF.
#### 7.2A.4.3 Additional coding rules for P-Access-Network-Info header field
The P-Access-Network-Info header field is populated with the following
contents:
1) the access-type field set to one of \"3GPP-GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\",
\"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\",
\"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"3GPP2-UMB\", \"3GPP2-1X-Femto\", \"IEEE-802.11\",
\"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\", \"IEEE-802.11g\", \"IEEE-802.11n\",
\"ADSL\", \"ADSL2\", \"ADSL2+\", \"RADSL\", \"SDSL\", \"HDSL\", \"HDSL2\",
\"G.SHDSL\", \"VDSL\", \"IDSL\", or \"DOCSIS\", \"IEEE-802.3\",
\"IEEE-802.3a\", \"IEEE-802.3e\", \"IEEE-802.3i\", \"IEEE-802.3j\",
\"IEEE-802.3u\", or \"IEEE-802.3ab\", \"IEEE-802.3ae\", IEEE-802.3ak\",
IEEE-802.3aq\", IEEE-802.3an\", \"IEEE-802.3y\" or \"IEEE-802.3z\" as
appropriate to the access technology in use.
2) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP-GERAN\", a cgi-3gpp parameter set
to the Cell Global Identity obtained from lower layers of the UE. The Cell
Global Identity is a concatenation of MCC, MNC, LAC and CI (as described in
3GPP TS 23.003 [3]). The value of \"cgi-3gpp\" parameter is therefore coded as
a text string as follows:
> Starting with the most significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3 digits
> depending on MCC value), LAC (fixed length code of 16 bits using full
> hexadecimal representation) and CI (fixed length code of 16 bits using a
> full hexadecimal representation);
3) if the access type field is equal to \"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", or \"3GPP-UTRAN-
TDD\", a \"utran-cell-id-3gpp\" parameter set to a concatenation of the MCC,
MNC, LAC (as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3]) and the UMTS Cell Identity (as
described in 3GPP TS 25.331 [9A]), obtained from lower layers of the UE, and
is coded as a text string as follows:
> Starting with the most significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3 digits
> depending on MCC value), LAC (fixed length code of 16 bits using full
> hexadecimal representation) and UMTS Cell Identity (fixed length code of 28
> bits using a full hexadecimal representation);
4) if the access-class field is set, the \"np\" access-info parameter is the
only access-info parameter inserted. This release of this specification does
not define values for use in this parameter. The access-class field can be set
only by the P-CSCF;
5) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP2-1X\", a ci-3gpp2 parameter set
to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of the string obtained by
the concatenation of SID (16 bits), NID (16 bits), PZID (8 bits) and BASE_ID
(16 bits) (see 3GPP2 C.S0005-D [85]) in the specified order. The length of the
ci-3gpp2 parameter shall be 14 hexadecimal characters. The hexadecimal
characters (A through F) shall be coded using the uppercase ASCII characters.
If the UE does not know the values for any of the above parameters, the UE
shall use the value of 0 for that parameter. For example, if the SID is
unknown, the UE shall represent the SID as 0x0000;
NOTE 1: The SID value is represented using 16 bits as supposed to 15 bits as
specified in 3GPP2 C.S0005-D [85].
EXAMPLE: If SID = 0x1234, NID = 0x5678, PZID = 0x12, BASE_ID = 0xFFFF, the
ci-3gpp2 value is set to the string \"1234567812FFFF\".
6) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", a ci-3gpp2 parameter
set to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of the string
obtained by the concatenation of Sector ID (128 bits) and Subnet length (8
bits) (see 3GPP2 C.S0024-A [86]) and Carrier-ID, if available, (see 3GPP2
X.S0060 [86B])in the specified order. The length of the ci-3gpp2 parameter
shall be 34 or 40 hexadecimal characters depending on whether the Carrier-ID
is included. The hexadecimal characters (A through F) shall be coded using the
uppercase ASCII characters;
EXAMPLE: If the Sector ID = 0x12341234123412341234123412341234, Subnet length
= 0x11, and the Carrier-ID=0x555444, the ci-3gpp2 value is set to the string
\"1234123412341234123412341234123411555444\".
7) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP2-UMB\" 3GPP2 C.S0084-000 [86A], a
ci-3gpp2 parameter is set to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value
of the Sector ID (128 bits) defined in 3GPP2 C.S0084-000 [86A]. The length of
the ci-3gpp2 parameter shall be 32 hexadecimal characters. The hexadecimal
characters (A through F) shall be coded using the uppercase ASCII characters;
EXAMPLE: If the Sector ID = 0x12341234123412341234123412341234, the ci-3gpp2
value is set to the string \"12341234123412341234123412341234\".
8) if the access-type field set to one of \"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\",
\"IEEE-802.11b\" or \"IEEE-802.11g\", or \"IEEE-802.11n\", an \"i-wlan-node-
id\" parameter is set to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of
the AP\'s MAC address without any delimiting characters;
EXAMPLE: If the AP\'s MAC address = 00-0C-F1-12-60-28, then i-wlan-node-id is
set to the string \"000cf1126028\".
9) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP2-1X-Femto\", a ci-3gpp2-femto
parameter set to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of the
string obtained by the concatenation of femto MSCID (24 bit), femto CellID (16
bit), FEID (64bit), macro MSCID (24 bits) and macro CellID (16 bits) (3GPP2
X.P0059-200 [86E]) in the specified order. The length of the ci-3gpp2-femto
parameter is 36 hexadecimal characters. The hexadecimal characters (A through
F) are coded using the uppercase ASCII characters.
10) if the access-type field is set to one of \"ADSL\", \"ADSL2\", \"ADSL2+\",
\"RADSL\", \"SDSL\", \"HDSL\", \"HDSL2\", \"G.SHDSL\", \"VDSL\", \"IDSL\", the
access-info field shall contain a dsl-location parameter obtained from the CLF
(see NASS functional architecture);
11) if the access-type field set to \"DOCSIS\", the access info parameter is
not inserted. This release of this specification does not define values for
use in this parameter;
12) if the access type field is equal to \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\" or \"3GPP-E-
UTRAN-TDD\", a \"utran-cell-id-3gpp\" parameter set to a concatenation of the

described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [7B]), obtained from lower layers of the UE, and
is coded as a text string as follows:
> Starting with the most significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3 digits
> depending on MCC value), TAC (fixed length code of 16 bits using full
> hexadecimal representation) and Cell Identity (fixed length code of 28 bits
> using a full hexadecimal representation); and
13) if the access-type field is set to one of \"IEEE-802.3\", \"IEEE-802.3a\",
\"IEEE-802.3e\", \"IEEE-802.3i\", \"IEEE-802.3j\", \"IEEE-802.3u\",
\"IEEE-802.3ab\", \"IEEE-802.3ae\", IEEE-802.3ak\", IEEE-802.3aq\",

The P-Charging-Vector header field is extended to include specific charging
correlation information needed for IM CN subsystem functional entities.
#### 7.2A.5.2 Syntax
##### 7.2A.5.2.1 General
The syntax of the P-Charging-Vector header field is described in RFC 3455
[52]. There may be additional coding rules for this header field depending on
the type of IP-CAN, according to access technology specific descriptions.
Table 7.6B describes 3GPP-specific extensions to the P-Charging-Vector header

NOTE: The syntax above is not aligned with the rules for defining new
P-Charging-Vector header field parameters as defined in RFC 3455 [52].
Entities that perform syntax check (even if they are not interested in
specific header field parameter values) of the header field need to follow the
explicit syntax above, as using the rules in RFC 3455 [52] would trigger a
parser error.
The access-network-charging-info parameter is an instance of generic-param
from the current charge-params component of P-Charging-Vector header field.
The access-network-charging-info parameter includes alternative definitions
for different types access networks. The description of these parameters are
given in the subsequent subclauses.
The \"access-network-charging-info\" header field parameter is not included in
the P-Charging-Vector for SIP signalling that is not associated with a
session.
When the \"access-network-charging-info\" is included in the P-Charging-Vector
and necessary information isnot available from the IP-CAN (e.g. via Gx/Rx
interface) reference points then null or zero values are included.
For type 1 and type 3 IOIs, the generating SIP entity shall express the
\"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\" header field parameters in the format of a
quoted string as specified in RFC 3455 [52] with a specific string prefix
being \"Type 1\" and \"Type 3\" respectively to indicate the type of IOI. For
the type 2 IOI, no string prefix is used. The receiving SIP entity does not
perform syntactic checking of the contents of the IOI parameter (the IOI
parameter is passed unmodified to charging entities).
##### 7.2A.5.2.2 GPRS as IP-CAN
GPRS is a supported access network (gprs-charging-info parameter). For GPRS
there are the following components to track: GGSN address (ggsn parameter),
media authorization token (auth token parameter), and a pdp-info parameter
that contains the information for one or more PDP contexts. In this release
the media authorization token is set to zero. The pdp-info contains one or
more pdp-item values followed by a collection of parameters (pdp-sig, gcid,
and flow-id). The value of the pdp-item is a unique number that identifies
each of the PDP-related charging information within the P-Charging-Vector
header field. Each PDP context has an indicator if it is an IM CN subsystem
signalling PDP context (pdp-sig parameter), an associated GPRS Charging
Identifier (gcid parameter), and a identifier (flow-id parameter). The flow-id
parameter contains a sequence of curly bracket delimited flow identifier
tuples that identify associated m-lines and relative order of port numbers in
an m-line within the SDP from the SIP signalling to which the PDP context
charging information applies. For a complete description of the semantics of
the flow-id parameter see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] Annex B. The gcid, ggsn address
and flow-id parameters are transferred from the GGSN to the P-CSCF via the
PCRF over the Rx interface (see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] and Gx interface (see
3GPP TS 29.212 [13B]).
The gcid value is received in binary format at the P-CSCF (see 3GPP TS 29.214
[13D]). The P-CSCF shall encode it in hexadecimal format before include it
into the gcid parameter. On receipt of this header field, a node receiving a
gcid shall decode from hexadecimal into binary format.
The \"access-network-charging-info\" is not included in the P-Charging-Vector
for SIP signalling that is not associated with a multimedia session. The
access network charging information may be unavailable for sessions that use a
general purpose PDP context (for both SIP signalling and media) or that do not
require media authorisation.
##### 7.2A.5.2.3 I-WLAN as IP-CAN
The access-network-charging-info parameter is an instance of generic-param
from the current charge-params component of P-Charging-Vector header field.
This version of the specification defines the use of \"pdg\" for inclusion in
the P-Charging-Vector header field. No other extensions are defined for use in
I-WLAN in this version of the specification.
##### 7.2A.5.2.4 xDSL as IP-CAN
The access-network-charging-info parameter is an instance of generic-param
from the current charge-params component of P-Charging-Vector header field.
The access-network-charging-info parameter includes alternative definitions
for different types of access networks. This subclause defines the components
of the xDSL instance of the access-network-charging-info.
For xDSL, there are the following components to track: BRAS address (bras
parameter), media authorization token (auth-token parameter), and a set of
dsl-bearer-info parameters that contains the information for one or more xDSL
bearers.
The dsl-bearer-info contains one or more dsl-bearer-item values followed by a
collection of parameters (dsl-bearer-sig, dslcid, and flow-id). The value of
the dsl-bearer-item is a unique number that identifies each of the dsl-bearer-
related charging information within the P-Charging-Vector header field. Each
dsl-bearer-info has an indicator if it is an IM CN subsystem signalling dsl-
bearer (dsl-bearer-sig parameter), an associated DSL Charging Identifier
(dslcid parameter), and a identifier (flow-id parameter). The flow-id
parameter contains a sequence of curly bracket delimited flow identifier
tuples that identify associated m-lines and relative order of port numbers in
an m-line within the SDP from the SIP signalling to which the dsl-bearer
charging information applies. For a complete description of the semantics of
the flow-id parameter see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
The format of the dslcid parameter is identical to that of ggsn parameter. On
receipt of this header field, a node receiving a dslcid shall decode from
hexadecimal into binary format.
For a dedicated dsl-bearer for SIP signalling, i.e. no media stream requested
for a session, then there is no authorisation activity or information exchange
over the Rx and Gx interfaces. Since there are no dslcid, media authorization
token or flow identifiers in this case, the dslcid and media authorization
token are set to zero and no flow identifier parameters are constructed by the
PCRF.
##### 7.2A.5.2.5 DOCSIS as IP-CAN
The access-network-charging-info parameter is an instance of generic-param
from the current charge-params component of P-Charging-Vector header field.
The access-network-charging-info parameter includes alternative definitions
for different types of access networks. This subclause defines the components
of the cable instance of the access-network-charging-info. Cable access is
based upon the architecture defined by Data Over Cable Service Interface
Specification (DOCSIS).
The billing correlation identifier (bcid) uniquely identifies the PacketCable
DOCSIS bearer resources associated with the session within the cable
operator\'s network for the purposes of billing correlation. To facilitate the
correlation of session and bearer accounting events, a correlation ID that
uniquely identifies the resources associated with a session is needed. This is
accomplished through the use of the bcid as generated by the PacketCable
Multimedia network. This bcid is returned to the P-CSCF within the response to
a successful resource request.
The bcid is specified in RFC 3603 [74A]. This identifier is chosen to be
globally unique within the system for a window of several months. Consistent
with RFC 3603 [74A], the BCID must be encoded as a hexadecimal string of up to
48 characters. Leading zeroes may be suppressed.
If the bcid value is received in binary format by the P-CSCF from the IP-CAN,
the P-CSCF shall encode it in hexadecimal format before including it into the
bcid parameter. On receipt of this header field, a node using a bcid will
normally decode from hexadecimal into binary format.
##### 7.2A.5.2.6 cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem as IP-CAN
The specific extensions to the P-Charging-Vector header field defined in RFC
3455 [52] when the access network is cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem are:
the icn-charging-info parameter contains one icn-bcp child parameter and one
or more child itid parameters. The icn-bcp parameter, identifies the point of
attachment where UE has attached itself to the the cdma2000^Â®^ packet data
subsystem. The icn-bcp parameter is conveyed to the P-CSCF by the cdma2000^Â®^
packet data subsystem. Each itid child parameter within icn-charging-info
corresponds to one IP-CAN bearer that was established by the cdma2000^Â®^
packet data subsystem for the UE. Each itid parameter contains an indicator if
it is an IP-CAN subsystem signalling IP-CAN bearer (itc-sig parameter), an
associated IP-CAN charging identifier (itc-id parameter), and one or more flow
identifiers (flow-id parameter) that identify associated m-lines within the
SDP from the SIP signalling. These parameters are transferred from the
cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem to the P-CSCF over the respective interface.
For an IP-CAN bearer that is only used for SIP signalling, i.e. no media
stream requested for a session, then there is no authorisation activity or
information exchange with the P-CSCF over the respective cdma2000^Â®^
interfaces. Since there is no itc-id, or flow identifiers in this case, the
itc-id is set to zero and no flow identifier parameters are constructed by the
P-CSCF.
##### 7.2A.5.2.7 EPS as IP-CAN
For EPS there are the following components to track: P-GW address (pdngw
parameter), and a eps-info parameter that contains the information for one or
more EPS bearers. The eps-info contains one or more eps-item values followed
by a collection of parameters (eps-sig, ecid, and flow-id). The value of the
eps-item is a unique number that identifies each of the EPS-bearer-related
charging information within the P-Charging-Vector header field. Each EPS
bearer context has an associated QCI indicating if it is an IM CN subsystem
signalling EPs bearer context (eps-sig parameter), an associated EPS Charging
Identifier (ecid parameter), and a identifier (flow-id parameter). The flow-id
parameter contains a sequence of curly bracket delimited flow identifier
tuples that identify associated m-lines and relative order of port numbers in
an m-line within the SDP from the SIP signalling to which the EPS bearer
charging information applies. For a complete description of the semantics of
the flow-id parameter see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] Annex B. The ecid, pdngw
address and flow-id parameters are transferred from the P-GW to the P-CSCF via
the PCRF over the Rx interface (see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] and Gx interface (see
3GPP TS 29.212 [13B]).
The ecid value is received in binary format at the P-CSCF (see 3GPP TS 29.214
[13D]). The P-CSCF shall encode it in hexadecimal format before include it
into the ecid parameter. On receipt of this header field, a node receiving a
gcid shall decode from hexadecimal into binary format.
The \"access-network-charging-info\" header field parameter is not included in
the P-Charging-Vector for SIP signalling that is not associated with a
multimedia session. The access network charging information may be unavailable
for sessions that use a general purpose EPS bearer context (for both SIP
signalling and media).
##### 7.2A.5.2.8 Ethernet as IP-CAN
The access-network-charging-info parameter is an instance of generic-param
from the current charge-params component of P-Charging-Vector header field.
For Ethernet accesses, the IP Edge Node address (ip-edge parameter) is
tracked. The IP Edge Node is defined in ETSI ES 282 001 [138].
#### 7.2A.5.3 Operation
The operation of this header field is described in subclauses 5.2, 5.3, 5.4,
5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8.
### 7.2A.6 Orig parameter definition
#### 7.2A.6.1 Introduction
The \"orig\" parameter is a uri-parameter intended to:
\- tell the S-CSCF that it has to perform the originating services instead of
terminating services;
\- tell the I-CSCF that it has to perform originating procedures.
#### 7.2A.6.2 Syntax
The syntax for the orig parameter is specified in table 7.7:
Table 7.7: Syntax of orig parameter
uri-parameter = transport-param / user-param / method-param / ttl-param /
maddr-param / lr-param / orig / other-param
orig = \"orig\"
The BNF for uri-parameter is taken from IETF RFC 3261 [26] and modified
accordingly.
#### 7.2A.6.3 Operation
The orig parameter is appended to the address of the S-CSCF, I-CSCF or IBCF by
the ASs, when those initiate requests on behalf of the user. The S-CSCF will
run originating services whenever the orig parameter is present next to its
address. The I-CSCF will run originating procedures whenever the orig
parameter is present next to its address. The IBCF will preserve the \"orig\"
parameter in the topmost Route header field.
### 7.2A.7 Extension to Security-Client, Security-Server and Security-Verify
header fields
#### 7.2A.7.1 Introduction
This extension defines new parameters for the Security-Client, Security-Server
and Security-Verify header fields.
This subclause defines the \"mediasec\" header field parameter that labels any
of the Security-Client:, Security-Server:, or Security-Verify: header fields
as applicable to the media plane and not the signalling plane.
#### 7.2A.7.2 Syntax
##### 7.2A.7.2.1 General
The syntax for the Security-Client, Security-Server and Security-Verify header
fields is defined in IETF RFC 3329 [48]. The additional syntax is defined in
Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
This specification reuses Security-Client, Security-Server and Security-Verify
defined in RFC 3329 [48] and defines the mechanisms listed in table
7.2A.7.2.2-2 and the header field parameter \"mediasec\".
Security mechanisms that apply to the media plane only shall not have the same
name as any signalling plane mechanism. If a signalling plane security
mechanism name is re-used for the media plane and distinguished only by the
\"mediasec\" parameter, then implementations that do not recognize the
\"mediasec\" parameter may incorrectly use that security mechanism for the
signalling plane.
##### 7.2A.7.2.2 \"mediasec\" header field parameter
The \"mediasec\" header field parameter may be used in the Security- Client,
Security-Server, or Security-Verify header fields defined in RFC 3329 [48] to
indicate that a header field applies to the media plane. Any one of the media
plane security mechanisms supported by both client and server, if any, may be
applied when a media stream is started. Or, a media stream may be set up
without security.
Values in the Security-Client, Security-Server, or Security-Verify header
fields labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter are specific to
the media plane and specific to the secure media transport protocol used on
the media plane.
EXAMPLE: Security-Client: sdes-srtp;mediasec
Usage of the \"mediasec\" header field parameter in mech-parameters rule of
RFC 3329 [48] and the syntax of the \"mediasec\" header field parameter is
shown in table 7.2A.7.2.2-1.
Table 7.2A.7.2.2-1
mech-parameters =/ mediasec-param
mediasec-param = \"mediasec\"
The security mechanisms which can be labelled by the \"mediasec\" header field
parameter are listed in the table 7.2A.7.2.2-2, where each line (other than
the first line) indicates a token and a media security mechanism for which the
token indicates support.
Table 7.2A.7.2.2-2
mechanism-name =/ ( sdes-srtp-name / token )
sdes-srtp-name = \"sdes-srtp\" ; End-to-access-edge media security using SDES.
#### 7.2A.7.3 Operation
The operation of the additional parameters for the Security-Client, Security-
Server and Security-Verify header fields is defined in Annex H of 3GPP TS
33.203 [19].
Any one of the mechanisms listed in table 7.2A.7.2.2-2 and labelled with the
\"mediasec\" header field parameter can be applied on-the-fly as a media
stream is started, unlike mechanisms for signalling one of which is chosen and
then applied throughout a session.
Media plane security can be supported independently of any signalling plane
security defined in RFC 3329 [4], but in order to protect any cryptographic
key carried in SDP signalling plane security as defined in RFC 3329 [4] SHOULD
be used.
The message flow is identical to the flow in RFC 3329 [48], but it is not
mandatory for the user agent to apply media plane security immediately after
it receives the list of supported media plane mechanisms from the server, or
any timer after that, nor will the lack of a mutually supported media plane
security mechanism prevent SIP session setup.

#### 7.2A.9.1 Introduction
The IARI is defined to fulfil the requirements as stated in 3GPP TS 23.228
[7].
#### 7.2A.9.2 Coding of the IARI
This parameter is coded as a URN. The IARI URN may be included as a tag-value
within the g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and
RFC 3840 [62], in which case those characters of the URN that are not part of
the tag-value definition in RFC 3840 [62] shall be represented in the percent
encoding as defined in RFC 3986 [124].

### 7.2A.10 \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
#### 7.2A.10.1 Introduction
The \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter indicates that the UE uses local
service number or that the UE has included information according to a local
dialling plan in the Request-URI.
In the former case, the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is included in a
Tel-URI or a corresponding SIP URI with a \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to
\"phone\".
In the latter case, the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is included in the
user part of a SIP URI with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to
\"dialstring\" (see RFC 4967 [103]).
#### 7.2A.10.2 Syntax
The syntax of the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is described in RFC 3966
[22]. There are additional coding rules for this parameter depending on the
type of IP-CAN, according to access technology specific descriptions.
#### 7.2A.10.3 Additional coding rules for \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
In case the current IP-CAN is indicated in the \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter, the entities inserting the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
shall populate the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter with the following
contents:
1) if the IP-CAN is GPRS, then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is a
domain name. It is constructed from the MCC, the MNC and the home network
domain name by concatenating the MCC, MNC, and the string \"gprs\" as domain
labels before the home network domain name;
EXAMPLE: If MCC = 216, MNC = 01, then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter
is set to \'216.01.gprs.home1.net\'.
2) if the IP-CAN is I-WLAN, then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is a
domain name. It is constructed from the SSID, AP\'s MAC address, and the home
network domain name by concatenating the SSID, AP\'s MAC address, and the
string \"i-wlan\" as domain labels before the home network domain name;
EXAMPLE: If SSID = BU-Airport, AP\'s MAC = 00-0C-F1-12-60-28, and home network
domain name is \"home1.net\", then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is
set to the string \"bu-airport.000cf1126028.i-wlan.home1.net\".
3) if the IP-CAN is xDSL, then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is a
domain name. It is constructed from the dsl-location (see subclause 7.2A.4)
and the home network domain name by concatenating the dsl-location and the
string \"xdsl\" as domain labels before the home network domain name;
4) if the IP-CAN is DOCSIS, then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is
based on data configured locally in the UE;
5) if the IP-CAN is EPS, then the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is a
domain name. It is constructed from the MCC, the MNC and the home network
domain name by concatenating the MCC, MNC, and the string \"eps\" as domain
labels before the home network domain name;
6) if the IP-CAN is Ethernet, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is a domain
name. It is constructed from the eth-location (see subclause 7.2A.4) and the
home network domain name by concatenating the eth-location and the string
\"ethernet\" as domain labels before the home network domain name;
7) if the IP-CAN is cdma2000Â®, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is a
domain name. It is constructed from the subnet id and the home network domain
name by concatenating the subnet id as the domain label before the home
network domain name; and
8) if the access network information is not available in the UE, then the
\"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is set to the home network domain name
preceded by the string \"geo-local.\".
In case the home domain is indicated in the \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter, the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter is set to the home network
domain name (as it is used to address the SIP REGISTER request, see subclause
5.1.1.1A or subclause 5.1.1.1B).
In case the \"phone-context\" tel URI parameter indicates a network other than
the home network or the visited access network, the \"phone-context\" tel URI
parameter is set according to RFC 3966 [22].

#### 7.2A.11.2 Void
#### 7.2A.11.3 Void
### 7.2A.12 CPC and OLI tel URI parameter definition
#### 7.2A.12.1 Introduction
The use of the \"cpc\" and \"oli\" URI parameters for use in the P-Asserted-
Identity in SIP requests is defined.
#### 7.2A.12.2 Syntax
The Calling Party\'s Category and Originating Line Information are represented
as URI parameters for the tel URI scheme and SIP URI representation of
telephone numbers. The ABNF syntax is as follows and extends the formal syntax
for the tel URI as specified in RFC 3966 [22]:
par =/ cpc / oli
cpc = cpc-tag \"=\" cpc-value
oli = oli-tag \"=\" oli-value
cpc-tag = \"cpc\"
oli-tag = \"oli\"
cpc-value
= \"ordinary\" / \"test\" / \"operator\" /
\"payphone\" / \"unknown\" / \"mobile-hplmn\" / \"mobile-vplmn\" /
\"emergency\" /
genvalue
oli-value = 2DIGIT
genvalue = 1*(alphanum / \"-\" / \".\" )
The Accept-Language header field shall be used to express the language of the
operator.
The semantics of these Calling Party\'s Category values are described below:
**ordinary:** The caller has been identified, and has no special features.
**test:** This is a test call that has been originated as part of a
maintenance procedure.
**operator:** The call was generated by an operator position.
**payphone:** The calling station is a payphone.
**unknown:** The CPC could not be ascertained.
**mobile-hplmn:** The call was generated by a mobile device in its home PLMN.
**mobile-vplmn:** The call was generated by a mobile device in a vistited
PLMN.
**emergency:** The call is an emergency service call.
NOTE 1: The choice of CPC and OLI values and their use are up to the Service
Provider. CPC and OLI values can be exchanged across networks if specified in
a bilateral agreement between the service providers.
NOTE 2: Additional national/regional CPC values can exist.
The two digit OLI values are decimal codes assigned and administered by North
American Numbering Plan Administration.
#### 7.2A.12.3 Operation
The \"cpc\" and \"oli\" URI parameters may be supported by IM CN subsystem
entities that provide the UA role and by IM CN subsystem entities that provide
the proxy role.
The \"cpc\" and \"oli\" URI parameters shall not be populated at the
originating UE.
Unless otherwise specified in this document, \"cpc\" and \"oli\" URI
parameters are only passed on by IM CN subsystem entities (subject to trust
domain considerations as specified in subclause 4.4.12).
### 7.2A.13 \"sos\" SIP URI parameter
#### 7.2A.13.1 Introduction
The \"sos\" SIP URI parameter is intended to:
\- indicate to the S-CSCF that a REGISTER request that includes the \"sos\"
SIP URI parameter is for emergency registration purposes;
\- tell the S-CSCF to not apply barring of the public user identity being
registered; and
\- tell the S-CSCF to not apply initial filter criteria to requests destined
for an emergency registered contact.
#### 7.2A.13.2 Syntax
The syntax for the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter is specified in table 7.8.
Table 7.8: Syntax of sos SIP URI parameter
uri-parameter =/ sos-param
sos-param = \"sos\"
The BNF for uri-parameter is taken from IETF RFC 3261 [26] and modified
accordingly.
#### 7.2A.13.3 Operation
When a UE includes the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter in the URI included in the
Contact header field of REGISTER request, the REGISTER request is intended for
emergency registration.
When a S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request for emergency registration that
includes the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter, the S-CSCF is required to preserve the
previously registered contact address. This differs to the registrar operation
as defined in RFC 3261 [26] in that the rules for URI comparison for the
Contact header field shall not apply and thus, if the URI in the Contact
header field matches a previously received URI, then the old contact address
shall not be overwritten.
### 7.2A.14 Void
### 7.2A.15 Void
### 7.2A.16 Extension to History-Info header field
#### 7.2A.16.1 Introduction
This extension defines a new hi-target-param (mp-param) for the History-Info
header field. The mp-param indicates the Targeted-to-URI is another user
mapped form Request-URI in the incoming request that was retargeted.
#### 7.2A.16.2 Syntax
The syntax of the History-Info header field is described in RFC 4244 [66]. The
additional syntax for \"mp-param\" is specified in table 7.2A.16.
Table 7.2A.16: Syntax of \"mp-param\"
hi-param = hi-target-param
hi-target-param = mp-param
mp-param = \"mp\" EQUAL index-val
index-val = number *(\".\" number)
number = [ %x31-39 *DIGIT ] DIGIT
#### 7.2A.16.3 Operation
The \"mp\" header field parameter indicates that the hi-targeted-to-URI
represents a user other than the target user associated with the Request-URI
in the incoming request that was retargeted. This occurs when a request is
statically or dynamically retargeted to another user represented by an AOR
unassociated with the AOR of the original target user. The \"mp\" header field
parameter contains the value of the hi-index in the hi-entry with a hi-
targeted-to-uri that reflects the Request-URI that was retargeted, thus
identifying the \"mapped from\" target.
If the service the AS provides needs to deliver the original destination
identity to the UE, the AS shall either:
1) if the History-Info header field is present in the incoming request, insert
a new hi-entry to the History-Info header field, including an \"mp\" header
field parameter; or
2) if the History-Info header field is not present in the incoming request:
a) insert a History-Info header field with the first hi-entry including the
received Request-URI; and
b) insert the second hi-entry including the target URI with an \"mp\" header
field parameter containing the value of hi-index in the first entry.

### 7.5.1 General
This subclause contains definitions for SDP parameters that are specific to
SDP usage in the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem and therefore are not described in an
RFC.
### 7.5.2 End-to-access-edge media plane security
#### 7.5.2.1 General
The end-to-access-edge security-indicator is used to indicate that a UE
requests a P-CSCF to apply media plane security or to indicate that a P-CSCF
has applied end-to-access-edge security as defined in 3GPP TS 33.328 [19C].
#### 7.5.2.2 Syntax
3GPP end-to-access-edge security indicator is a value attribute which is
encoded as a media-level SDP attribute with the ABNF syntax defined in table
7.1. ABNF is defined in RFC 2234 [20G].
Table 7.1: ABNF syntax of 3ge2ae attribute
3ge2ae-attribute = \"a=3ge2ae:\" indicator
indicator = \"requested\" / \"applied\" / token
\"requested\": the sender indicates its wish that end-to-access-edge security
is applied.
\"applied\": the sender indicates that it has applied end-to-access-edge
security.
This version of the specification only defines usage of the \"requested\" and
\"applied\" attribute values. Other values shall be ignored.
The \"3ge2ae\" attribute is charset-independent.

Table 7.7B: Syntax of the \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter
m-parameter =/ (\"sv\" / \"schemaversion\") EQUAL LDQUOT [ sv-value-list ]
RDQUOT
sv-value-list = sv-value-range *( \",\" sv-value )
sv-value-range = sv-value [ \"-\" sv-value ]
sv-value = number / token
number = 1*DIGIT [ \".\" 1*DIGIT ]
The BNF for m-parameter is taken from IETF RFC 3261 [26] and modified
accordingly.
#### 7.6.4.3 Operation
The encoding considerations for \"application/3gpp-ims+xml\" are identical to
those of \"application/xml\" as described in RFC 3023 [132].
The \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter's value is used to indicate:
\- the versions of the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML schema that can be used to
validate the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body (if the MIME type and parameter are
present in the Content-Type header field); or
\- the accepted versions of the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML body (if the MIME
type and parameter are present in the Accept header field).
If the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameter are absent, it shall be assumed
that version 1 of the XML Schema for the IM CN subsystem XML body is
supported.
### 7.6.5 IANA Registration
NOTE: RFC 4288 [xy], section 9, states the process that applies in case of
changes to the registry of media types. Any future changes to the format or to
subclause 7.6.5 would invoke this procedure.
MIME media type name:
application
MIME subtype name:
3gpp-ims+xml
Required parameters:
None
Optional parameters:
\"charset\" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of
the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in RFC 3023 [132].
\"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" the parameter's value is used to indicate:
\- the versions of the 3GPP IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem XML
schema that can be used to validate the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body (if the
MIME type and parameter are present in the Content-Type header field); or
\- the accepted versions of the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML body (if the MIME
type and parameter are present in the Accept header field).
If the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameter are absent, it shall be assumed
that version 1 of the XML Schema for the IM CN subsystem XML body is
supported.
Encoding considerations:
Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as specified in RFC 3023
[132]
Security considerations:
Same as general security considerations for application/xml as specified in
section 10 of RFC 3023 [132].
In addition, this content type provides a format for exchanging information in
SIP, so the security considerations from RFC 3261 [26] apply.
Interoperability considerations:
Same as Interoperability considerations as specified in section 3.1 of RFC
3023 [132].
If both \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" are specified, then the value of
\"schemaversion\" is ignored

## 7.7 SIP timers
The timers defined in RFC 3261 [26] need modification in some cases to
accommodate the delays introduced by the air interface processing and
transmission delays. Table 7.8 shows recommended values for IM CN subsystem.
Table 7.8 lists in the first column, titled \"SIP Timer\" the timer names as
defined in RFC 3261 [26].
The second column, titled \"value to be applied between IM CN subsystem
elements\" lists the values recommended for network elements e.g. P-CSCF,
S-CSCF, MGCF, when communicating with each other i.e. when no air interface
leg is included. These values are identical to those recommended by RFC 3261
[26].
The third column, titled \"value to be applied at the UE\" lists the values
recommended for the UE, when in normal operation the UE generates requests or
responses containing a P-Access-Network-Info header field which included a
value of \"3GPP-GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP-E-
UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\",
\"3GPP2-UMB\", \"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\", or
\"IEEE-802.11g\", or \"IEEE-802.11n\". These are modified when compared to RFC
3261 [26] to accommodate the air interface delays. In all other cases, the UE
should use the values specified in RFC 3261 [26] as indicated in the second
column of table 7.8.
The fourth column, titled \"value to be applied at the P-CSCF toward a UE\"
lists the values recommended for the P-CSCF when an air interface leg is
traversed, and which are used on all SIP transactions on a specific security
association where the security association was established using a REGISTER
request containing a P-Access-Network-Info header field provided by the UE
which included a value of \"3GPP-GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-
TDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\",
\"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"3GPP2-UMB\", \"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\" or
\"IEEE-802.11b\", or \"IEEE-802.11g\", or \"IEEE-802.11n\". These are modified
when compared to RFC 3261 [26]. In all other cases, the P-CSCF should use the
values specified in RFC 3261 [26] as indicated in the second column of table
7.8.
The final column reflects the timer meaning as defined in RFC 3261 [26].

## 7.10 Reg-event package extensions defined within the current document
### 7.10.1 General
This subclause describes the reg-event package extensions that are applicable
for the IM CN subsystem.
### 7.10.2 Reg-Event package extension to transport wildcarded public user
identities
#### 7.10.2.1 Structure and data semantics
This subclause defines an extension to the event registration package (RFC
3680 [43]) to transport policy to transport wildcarded public user identities
that are encoded using regular expression.
In order to include a wildcared public user identity in the event registration
package, the notifier shall
1\. if the registration set of the identity whose registration status is
notified contains a wildcarded public user identity, add a
\ sub-element defined in subclause 7.10.2.2 of this
document to the \ element of the wildcarded identiy;
2\. for the \ element containing a \ sub-
element:
a) set the aor attribute to any public user identity that is represented by
the wildcarded identity; and
b) set the \ sub-element inside of the \
element to the wildcarded identity as received via the Cx interface.
NOTE: The public user identity that is put into the aor attribute does not
have any extra priviledges over any other public user identity that is
represented by a wildcarded public user identity.
#### 7.10.2.2 XML Schema
Table 7.10.1 in this subclause defines the XML Schema describing the extension
to transport wildcarded public user identities which can be included in the
reg event package sent from the S-CSCF in NOTIFY requests.
Editor's note: [IMS_Corp CR#3799] The XML namespace needs to be registered
once the work on the current release is complete.

NOTE: Multiple wildcarded elements can be included in one registration
element.
## 7.11 Void
## 7.12 Info package definitions and associated MIME type definitions
### 7.12.1 DTMF info package and session-info MIME type
#### 7.12.1.1 DTMF info package
##### 7.12.1.1.1 General
This subclause contains the information required for the IANA registration of
an info package.
The digit message body and associated MIME type can also be used as defined in
other specifications in a legacy manner as defined by RFC 6086 [25].
##### 7.12.1.1.2 Overall description
DTMF tones are normally sent when a user presses a button on the terminal.
Each tone, identified by a unique frequency, represents a number (0-9) or a
special character. The DTMF info package is used to transport that value. In-
order delivery of the DTMF digits is not controlled by the DTMF info package,
this would be controlled either by queuing in the sender or by separate
interaction with the human user; such mechanisms are out of scope of this
registration.
The DTMF info package can be used to transport a single DTMF tone, or a series
of tones. If a series of tones is transported in a single SIP INFO request, it
is not possible to indicate the duration between each tone in the series.
The DTMF info package is not defined for a specific application. Any
application, where sending of DTMF tones using the SIP INFO method is
required, can used the DTMF info package.
##### 7.12.1.1.3 Applicability
The info package mechanism for transporting DTMF tones has been chosen because
it allows SIP entities that do not have access to the user plane (where DTMF
tones can also be transported) to send and receive tones. The mechanism also
allows the tones to be sent inside an existing dialog, using the same
signalling path as other SIP messages within the dialog, rather than having to
establish a separate dialog (DTMF tones can also be transported using
subscription event packages).
##### 7.12.1.1.4 Info package name
The name of the DTMF info package is: infoDtmf
##### 7.12.1.1.5 Info package parameters
No parameters are defined for the DTMF info package.
##### 7.12.1.1.6 SIP option tags
No SIP option tags are defined for the DTMF info package.
##### 7.12.1.1.7 INFO message body parts
The DTMF digits are carried in the Overlap digit message body, defined in
subclause 7.12.1.2.
The MIME type value for the message body is \"application/session-info\",
defined in subclause 7.12.1.2.
The Content Disposition value for the message body, when associated with the
DTMF info package, is \"info-package\" (see RFC 6086 [25]).
##### 7.12.1.1.8 Info package usage restrictions
No usage restrictions are defined for the DTMF info package.
If SIP entities support multiple mechanisms for sending DTMF tones they need
to ensure, using negotiation mechanisms, that each entity is aware of which
mechanism is used.
##### 7.12.1.1.9 Rate of INFO requests
No maximum rate or minimum rate is defined for sending INFO requests
associated with the DTMF info package.
When DTMF tones are triggered by user interaction, the DTMF tones are normally
generated when the user pushes a button. Specific applications can decide upon
which rate DTMF tones are generated. However, the DTMF info package does not
provide a feedback mechanism to indicate to the sender that the rate of DTMF
tones is too slow or fast.
##### 7.12.1.1.10 Info package security considerations
No additional security mechanism is defined for the DTMF info package.
The security of the DTMF info package is based on the generic security
mechanism provided for the underlying SIP signalling.
The mechanism should not be used for transferring any data that requires a
greater level of security than the underlying SIP signalling.
#### 7.12.1.2 Overlap digit message body
##### 7.12.1.2.1 Scope
This section defines a message body that shall be used for sending additional
digits, which have not previously been sent, in SIP INFO messages (\"legacy\"
mode of usage of the INFO method as defined in RFC 6086 [25]) when the in-
dialog method is used for overlap dialling.
The same message body can also be used for transporting Dual Tone Multi
Frequency (DTMF) tones using SIP INFO requests, using the DTMF info package
(see RFC 6086 [25]) defined in subclause 7.12.1.1.
The support of this message body is a network option.
##### 7.12.1.2.2 MIME type
The message body defined in the present Annex is registered at IANA as
\"application/session-info\" MIME type.
If the message body is embedded in SIP INFO messages, the Content-Type header
shall be set to \"application/session-info\" and the Content-Disposition
header shall be set to \"signal\" with the handling parameter set to
\"optional\".
##### 7.12.1.2.3 ABNF
session-info = SubsequentDigit
SubsequentDigit = \"SubsequentDigit\" HCOLON phonedigits
phonedigits = 1*(HEXDIG / \"*\" / \"#\")
HEXDIG = DIGIT / \"A\" / \"B\" / \"C\" / \"D\" / \"E\" / \"F\"
##### 7.12.1.2.4 IANA registration template
Within the present subclause, information required for an IANA registration at
http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/mediatypes.pl is provided.
1\. Media Type Name
Application
2\. Subtype name
\"session-info\" (Standards Tree)
3\. Required parameters
none
4\. Optional parameters
none
5\. Encoding considerations
binary
6\. Security considerations
Modifications of the MIME body by a man-in-the-middle can have severe
consequences:
The overlap digits that can be transported with this MIME body influence the
routeing of the SIP session that is being setup.
Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) tones that can also be transported with this
MIME body will be interpreted by the application of the end points of the
communication for various purposes.
However, this MIME body is used only attached to SIP INFO messages, and
modifications of other parts of the SIP signalling will lead to comparable
consequences. Protection of the SIP signalling will also protect the present
MIME body.
The information transported in this MIME media type does not include active or
executable content.
Mechanisms for privacy and intregrity protection of protocol parameters exist.
Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security mechanisms are
described in 3GPP TS 24.229.
7\. Interoperability considerations
none
8\. Published specification
3GPP TS 24.229: \"IP multimedia call control protocol based on Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP), stage 3\".
9\. Applications which use this media type
This MIME type is used as a message body within SIP INFO messages.
It is either used for sending additional digits of the calleeÂ´s number, which
have not previously been sent, in SIP INFO messages (\"legacy\" mode of usage
of the INFO method as defined in RFC 6086 [25]) when the in-dialog method is
used for overlap dialling.
The same message body can also be used for transporting Dual Tone Multi
Frequency (DTMF) tones using SIP INFO requests, using the DTMF info package
(see RFC 6086 [25]) defined in subclause 7.12.1.1.

# 8 SIP compression
## 8.1 SIP compression procedures at the UE
### 8.1.1 SIP compression
If in normal operation the UE generates requests or responses containing a
P-Access-Network-Info header field which included a value of \"3GPP-
GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"3GPP2-UMB\",
\"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\" or \"IEEE-802.11g\", or
\"IEEE-802.11n\", then the UE shall support:
\- SigComp as specified in RFC 3320 [32] and as updated by RFC 4896 [118]; and
\- the additional requirements specified in RFC 5049 [79], with the exception
that the UE shall take a State Memory Size of at least 4096 bytes as a minimum
value.
If in normal operation the UE generates requests or responses containing a
P-Access-Network-Info header field which included a value of \"3GPP-
GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"3GPP2-UMB\",
\"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\" or \"IEEE-802.11g\", or
\"IEEE-802.11n\", then the UE may support:
\- the negative acknowledgement mechanism specified in RFC 4077 [65A].
When using SigComp the UE shall send compressed SIP messages in accordance
with RFC 3486 [55]. When the UE will create the compartment is implementation
specific, but the compartment shall not be created until a set of security
associations or a TLS session is set up if signalling security is in use. The
UE shall finish the compartment when the UE is deregistered. The UE shall alow
state creations and announcements only for messages received in a security
association.
NOTE: Exchange of bytecodes during registration will prevent unnecessary
delays during session setup.
If the UE supports SigComp:
\- the UE shall support the SIP dictionary specified in RFC 3485 [42] and as
updated by RFC 4896 [118]. If compression is enabled, the UE shall use the
dictionary to compress the first message; and
\- if the UE supports the presence user agent or watcher roles as specified in
table A.3A/2 and table A.3A/4, the UE may support the presence specific
dictionary specified in RFC 5112 [119].
### 8.1.2 Compression of SIP requests and responses transmitted to the P-CSCF
If in normal operation the UE generates requests or responses containing a
P-Access-Network-Info header field which included a value of \"3GPP-
GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"3GPP2-UMB\",
\"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\" or IEEE-802.11g\", or
\"IEEE-802.11n\", then the UE should compress the requests and responses
transmitted to the P-CSCF according to subclause 8.1.1. In other cases where
SigComp is supported, it need not.
NOTE 1: Compression of SIP messages is an implementation option. However,
compression is strongly recommended.
NOTE 2: In an IP-CAN where compression support is mandatory, the UE may send
even the first message compressed. Sigcomp provides mechanisms to allow the UE
to know if state has been created in the P-CSCF or not.
### 8.1.3 Decompression of SIP requests and responses received from the P-CSCF
If the UE supports SigComp, then theUE shall decompress the compressed
requests and responses received from the P-CSCF according to subclause 8.1.1.
If the UE detects a decompression failure at the P-CSCF, the recovery
mechanism is implementation specific.
## 8.2 SIP compression procedures at the P-CSCF
### 8.2.1 SIP compression
The P-CSCF shall support:
\- SigComp as specified in RFC 3320 [32] and as updated by RFC 4896 [118]; and
\- the additional requirements specified in RFC 5049 [79], with the exception
that the P-CSCF shall take a State Memory Size of at least 4096 bytes as a
minimum value.
The P-CSCF may support:
\- the negative acknowledgement mechanism specified in RFC 4077 [65A].
When using SigComp the P-CSCF shall send compressed SIP messages in accordance
with RFC 3486 [55]. When the P-CSCF will create the compartment is
implementation specific, but the compartment shall not be created until a set
of security associations are set up. The P-CSCF shall finish the compartment
when the UE is deregistered. The P-CSCF shall allow state creations and
announcements only for messages received in a security association.
The P-CSCF:
\- shall support the SIP dictionary specified in RFC 3485 [42] and as updated
by RFC 4896 [118]. If compression is enabled, the P-CSCF shall use the
dictionary to compress the first message; and
\- may support the presence specific dictionary specified in RFC 5112 [119].
NOTE: Exchange of bytecodes during registration will prevent unnecessary
delays during session setup.
### 8.2.2 Compression of SIP requests and responses transmitted to the UE
The P-CSCF should compress the requests and responses transmitted to the UE
according to subclause 8.2.1.
For all SIP transactions on a specific security association where the security
association was established using a REGISTER request from the UE containing a
P-Access-Network-Info header field which included a value of \"3GPP-
GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
E-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2-1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"3GPP2-UMB\",
\"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\" or \"IEEE-802.11g\", or
\"IEEE-802.11n\", then the P-CSCF should compress the requests and responses
transmitted to the UE according to subclause 8.2.1. In other cases where
SigComp is supported, it need not.
NOTE: Compression of SIP messages is an implementation option. However,
compression is strongly recommended.
### 8.2.3 Decompression of SIP requests and responses received from the UE
The P-CSCF shall decompress the compressed requests and responses received
from the UE according to subclause 8.2.1.
If the P-CSCF detects a decompression failure at the UE, the recovery
mechanism is implementation specific.
# 9 IP-Connectivity Access Network aspects when connected to the IM CN
subsystem
## 9.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem and the IM CN subsystem itself utilises the
services supported by the IP-CAN to provide packet-mode communication between
the UE and the IM CN subsystem. General requirements for the UE on the use of
these packet-mode services are specified in this clause.
Possible aspects particular to each IP-CAN is described separately for each
IP-CAN.
## 9.2 Procedures at the UE

Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:
a) establish a connection with the IP-CAN;
b) obtain an IP address using either the standard IETF protocols (e.g., DHCP
or IPCP) or a protocol that is particular to the IP-CAN technology that the UE
is utilising. The UE shall fix the obtained IP address throughout the period
the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem, i.e. from the initial registration
and at least until the last deregistration; and
c) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).
The UE may acquire an IP address via means other than the DHCP. In this case,
upon acquiring an IP address, the UE shall request the configuration
information (that includes the DNS and P-CSCF addresses) from the DHCP server
through a single request and reply exchanged with the DHCP server.
The methods for acquiring a P-CSCF address(es) are:
I. Employ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 RFC 2131 [40A] or [
]{.underline} for IPv6 (DHCPv6) RFC 3315 [40]. Employ the DHCP options for SIP
servers RFC 3319 [41] or, for IPv6, RFC 3361 [35A]. Employ the DHCP options
for Domain Name Servers (DNS) RFC 3646 [56C].
The UE shall either:
\- in the DHCP query, request a list of SIP server domain names of P-CSCF(s)
and the list of Domain Name Servers (DNS); or
\- request a list of SIP server IP addresses of P-CSCF(s).
II. Obtain the P-CSCF address(es) by employing a procedure that the IP-CAN
technology supports. (e.g. GPRS).
III. The UE may use pre-configured P-CSCF address(es) (IP address or domain
name). For example:
a. The UE selects a P-CSCF from the list stored in ISIM or IMC;
b. The UE selects a P-CSCF from the list in IMS management object.
NOTE: Access-specific annexes provide additional guidance on the method to be
used by the UE to acquire P-CSCF address(es).
When acquiring a P-CSCF address(es), the UE can freely select either method I
or II or III.
The UE may also request a DNS Server IP address(es) as specified in RFC 3315
[40] and RFC 3646 [56C] or RFC 2131 [40A].
### 9.2.2 Handling of the IP-CAN
The means to ensure that appropriate resources are available for the media
flow(s) on the IP-CAN(s) related to a SIP session is dependant on the
characteristics for each IP-CAN, and is described separately for each IP-CAN
in question.
GPRS is described in annex B. I-WLAN is described in annex D. xDSL is
described in annex E. DOCSIS is described in Annex H. EPS is described in
annex L. cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem is described in Annex M. EPC via
cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD is described in annex O. cdma2000^Â®^ Femtocell network is
described in annex Q. If a particular handling of the IP-CAN is needed for
emergency calls, this is described in the annex for each access technology.
### 9.2.2A P-CSCF restoration procedure
The UE may support P-CSCF restoration procedures.
An IP-CAN may provide means for detecting a P-CSCF failure.
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure should either use the keep-
alive procedures described in RFC 6223 [143] or the procedure provided by a
IP-CAN for monitoring the P-CSCF status.
NOTE 1: The UE can use other means to monitor the P-CSCF status, e.g. ICMP
echo request/response. However, those other means are out of scope of this
document.
NOTE 2: A UE registered through the procedures described in RFC 5626 [92] can
use the keep-alive mechanism to monitor the status of the P-CSCF.
### 9.2.3 Special requirements applying to forked responses
Since the UE does not know that forking has occurred until a second
provisional response arrives, the UE will request the radio/bearer resources
as required by the first provisional response. For each subsequent provisional
response that may be received, different alternative actions may be performed
depending on the requirements in the SDP answer:
\- the UE has sufficient radio/bearer resources to handle the media specified
in the SDP of the subsequent provisional response, or
\- the UE must request additional radio/bearer resources to accommodate the
media specified in the SDP of the subsequent provisional response.
NOTE 1: When several forked responses are received, the resources requested by
the UE is the \"logical OR\" of the resources indicated in the multiple
responses to avoid allocation of unnecessary resources. The UE does not
request more resources than proposed in the original INVITE request.
NOTE 2: When service-based local policy is applied, the UE receives the same
authorization token for all forked requests/responses related to the same SIP
session.
When an 199 (Early Dialog Terminated) response for the INVITE request is
received for an early dialogue, the UE shall release reserved radio/bearer
resources associated with that early dialogue.
When the first final 200 (OK) response for the INVITE request is received for
one of the early dialogues, the UE proceeds to set up the SIP session using
the radio/bearer resources required for this session. Upon the reception of
the first final 200 (OK) response for the INVITE request, the UE shall release
all unneeded radio/bearer resources.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Profiles of IETF RFCs for 3GPP usage
# A.1 Profiles
## A.1.1 Relationship to other specifications
This annex contains a profile to the IETF specifications which are referenced
by this specification, and the PICS proformas underlying profiles do not add
requirements to the specifications they are proformas for.
This annex provides a profile specification according to both the current IETF
specifications for SIP, SDP and other protocols (as indicated by the \"RFC
status\" column in the tables in this annex) which are referenced by this
specification and to the 3GPP specifications using SIP (as indicated by the
\"Profile status\" column in the tables in this annex.
In the \"RFC status\" column the contents of the referenced specification
takes precedence over the contents of the entry in the column.
In the \"Profile status\" column, there are a number of differences from the
\"RFC status\" column. Where these differences occur, these differences take
precedence over any requirements of the IETF specifications. Where
specification concerning these requirements exists in the main body of the
present document, the main body of the present document takes precedence.
Where differences occur in the \"Profile status\" column, the \"Profile
status\" normally gives more strength to a \"RFC status\" and is not in
contradiction with the \"RFC status\", e.g. it may change an optional \"RFC
status\" to a mandatory \"Profile status\". If the \"Profile status\" weakens
the strength of a \"RFC status\" then additionally this will be indicated by
further textual description in the present document.
For all IETF specifications that are not referenced by this document or that
are not mentioned within the 3GPP profile of SIP and SDP, the generic rules as
defined by RFC 3261 [26] and in addition the rules in clauses 5 and 6 of this
specification apply, e.g..
\- a proxy which is built in accordance to this specification passes on any
unknown method, unknown header field or unknown header field parameter after
applying procedures such as filtering, insertion of P-Asserted-Identity header
field, etc.;
\- an UA which is built in accordance to this specification will
\- handle received unknown methods in accordance to the procedures defined in
RFC 3261 [26], e.g. respond with a 501 (Not Implemented) response; and
\- handle unknown header fields and unknown header field parameters in
accordance to the procedures defined in RFC 3261 [26], e.g. respond with a 420
(Bad Extension) if an extension identified by an option-tag in the Require
header field of the received request is not supported by the UA.
## A.1.2 Introduction to methodology within this profile
This subclause does not reflect dynamic conformance requirements but static
ones. In particular, a condition for support of a PDU parameter does not
reflect requirements about the syntax of the PDU (i.e. the presence of a
parameter) but the capability of the implementation to support the parameter.
In the sending direction, the support of a parameter means that the
implementation is able to send this parameter (but it does not mean that the
implementation always sends it).
In the receiving direction, it means that the implementation supports the
whole semantic of the parameter that is described in the main part of this
specification.
As a consequence, PDU parameter tables in this subclause are not the same as
the tables describing the syntax of a PDU in the reference specification, e.g.
RFC 3261 [26] tables 2 and 3. It is not rare to see a parameter which is
optional in the syntax but mandatory in subclause below.
The various statii used in this subclause are in accordance with the rules in
table A.1.
Table A.1: Key to status codes
* * *
Status code Status name Meaning m mandatory the capability shall be supported.
It is a static view of the fact that the conformance requirements related to
the capability in the reference specification are mandatory requirements. This
does not mean that a given behaviour shall always be observed (this would be a
dynamic view), but that it shall be observed when the implementation is placed
in conditions where the conformance requirements from the reference
specification compel it to do so. For instance, if the support for a parameter
in a sent PDU is mandatory, it does not mean that it shall always be present,
but that it shall be present according to the description of the behaviour in
the reference specification (dynamic conformance requirement). o optional the
capability may or may not be supported. It is an implementation choice. n/a
not applicable it is impossible to use the capability. No answer in the
support column is required. x prohibited (excluded) It is not allowed to use
the capability. This is more common for a profile. c \ conditional
the requirement on the capability (\"m\", \"o\", \"n/a\" or \"x\") depends on
the support of other optional or conditional items. \ is the
identifier of the conditional expression. o.\ qualified optional for
mutually exclusive or selectable options from a set. \ is the
identifier of the group of options, and the logic of selection of the options.
i irrelevant capability outside the scope of the given specification.
Normally, this notation should be used in a base specification ICS proforma
only for transparent parameters in received PDUs. However, it may be useful in
other cases, when the base specification is in fact based on another standard.
* * *
In the context of this specification the \"i\" status code mandates that the
implementation does not change the content of the parameter. It is an
implementation option if the implementation acts upon the content of the
parameter (e.g. by setting filter criteria to known or unknown parts of
parameters in order to find out the route a message has to take).
It must be understood, that this 3GPP SIP profile does not list all parameters
which an implementation will treat as indicated by the status code
\"irrelevant\". In general an implementation will pass on all unknown
messages, header fields and header field parameters, as long as it can perform
its normal behaviour.
The following additional comments apply to the interpretation of the tables in
this Annex.
NOTE 1: The tables are constructed according to the conventional rules for ICS
proformas and profile tables.
NOTE 2: The notation (either directly or as part of a conditional) of \"m\"
for the sending of a parameter and \"i\" for the receipt of the same
parameter, may be taken as indicating that the parameter is passed on
transparently, i.e. without modification. Where a conditional applies, this
behaviour only applies when the conditional is met.
As an example, the profile for the MGCF is found by first referring to clause
4.1, which states \"The MGCF shall provide the UA role\". Profiles are divided
at the top level into the two roles in table A.2, user agent and proxy. The UA
role is defined in subclause A.2.1 and the proxy role is defined in subclause
A.2.2. More specific roles are listed in table A.3, table A.3A, table A.3B and
table A.3C. The MGCF role is item 6 in table A.3 (the MGCF role is not found
in table A.3A or table A.3B). Therefore, all profile entries for the MGCF are
found by searching for A.3/6 in subclause A.2.1.
As a further example, to look up support of the Reason header field, table A.4
item 38 lists the Resaon header field as a major capability that is optional
for the user agent role. A subsequent search for A.4/38 in subclause A.2.1
shows that the Reason header field is optional for a user agent role to send
and receive for ACK, BYE, CANCEL, INVITE, MESSAGE, NOTIFY, OPTIONS, PRACK,
PUBLISH, REFER, REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, and UPDATE requests. Also, table A.162
item 48 lists the Reason header field as a major capability that is optional
for the proxy role. A subsequent search for A.162/48 in subclause A.2.2 shows
that, if supported, the Reason header field is mandatory to send and
irrelevant to receive for ACK, BYE, CANCEL, INVITE, MESSAGE, NOTIFY, OPTIONS,
PRACK, PUBLISH, REFER, REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, and UPDATE requests.

Item Roles Reference RFC status Profile status 1 User agent [26] o.1 o.1 2

NOTE: For the purposes of the present document it has been chosen to keep the
specification simple by the tables specifying only one role at a time. This
does not preclude implementations providing two roles, but an entirely
separate assessment of the tables shall be made for each role.

###### ## Annex B (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using GPRS to access IM CN subsystem
# B.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS). The GPRS IP-CAN has a GPRS core network which can be supported by
GERAN and UTRAN radio access networks. The present annex also defines
procedures for invoking CS domain services.
# B.2 GPRS aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
## B.2.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself, utilise
the services provided by GPRS to provide packet-mode communication between the
UE and the IM CN subsystem.
Requirements for the UE on the use of these packet-mode services are specified
in this clause. Requirements for the GGSN in support of this communication are
specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11], 3GPP TS 29.207 [12] and 3GPP TS 29.212
[13B].
When using the GPRS, each IP-CAN bearer is provided by a PDP context.
## B.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### B.2.2.1 PDP context activation and P-CSCF discovery
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:
a) if not attached for GPRS services yet, perform a GPRS attach procedure as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8];
b) ensure that a PDP context used for SIP signalling according to the APN and
GGSN selection criteria described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] and 3GPP TS 27.060
[10A] is available. This PDP context shall remain active throughout the period
the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem, i.e. from the initial registration
and at least until the deregistration. As a result, the PDP context provides
the UE with information that makes the UE able to construct an IPv4 or an IPv6
address;
NOTE 1: During the PDP context activation procedure, the UE and network
negotiate whether the UE or the GPRS IP-CAN is responsible for the resource
reservation applicable to all PDP contexts within the activated PDP
address/APN pair, as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
When the bearer establishment is controlled by the UE, the UE shall choose one
of the following options when performing establishment of this PDP context:
I. A dedicated PDP context for SIP signalling:
The UE shall indicate to the GGSN that this is a PDP context intended to carry
IM CN subsystem-related signalling only by setting the IM CN Subsystem
Signalling Flag. The UE may also use this PDP context for DNS and DHCP
signalling according to the static packet filters as described in 3GPP TS
29.061 [11]. The UE can also set the Signalling Indication attribute within
the QoS information element;
II. A general-purpose PDP context:
The UE may decide to use a general-purpose PDP Context to carry IM CN
subsystem-related signalling. The UE shall indicate to the GGSN that this is a
general-purpose PDP context by not setting the IM CN Subsystem Signalling
Flag. The UE may carry both signalling and media on the general-purpose PDP
context. The UE can also set the Signalling Indication attribute within the
QoS information element.
NOTE 2: When the bearer establishment is controlled by the GPRS IP-CAN, the
GGSN follows the procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] in order to
establish a dedicated PDP context for SIP signalling.
The UE indicates the IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag to the GGSN within the
Protocol Configuration Options information element of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message. Upon
successful signalling PDP context establishment the UE receives an indication
from GGSN in the form of IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag within the Protocol
Configuration Options information element. If the flag is not received, the UE
shall consider the PDP context as a general-purpose PDP context.
The encoding of the IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag within the Protocol
Configuration Options information element is described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
The UE can indicate a request for prioritised handling over the radio
interface by setting the Signalling Indication attribute (see 3GPP TS 23.107
[4A]). The general QoS negotiation mechanism and the encoding of the
Signalling Indication attribute within the QoS information element are
described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
NOTE 3: A general-purpose PDP Context can carry both IM CN subsystem
signalling and media, in case the media does not need to be authorized by
Policy and Charging control mechanisms as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [13C] and
Service Based Local Policy mechanisms defined in 3GPP TS 29.207 [12] and the
media stream is not mandated by the P-CSCF to be carried in a separate PDP
Context.
c) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).
The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:
I. When using IPv4, employ the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) RFC
2132 [20F], the DHCPv4 options for SIP servers RFC 3361 [35A], and RFC 3263
[27A] as described in subclause 9.2.1. When using IPv6, employ Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) RFC 3315 [40], the DHCPv6 options for
SIP servers RFC 3319 [41] and DHCPv6 options for Domain Name Servers (DNS) RFC
3646 [56C] as described in subclause 9.2.1.
II. Transfer P-CSCF address(es) within the PDP context activation procedure.
The UE shall indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the GGSN within the
Protocol Configuration Options information element of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.
If the GGSN provides the UE with a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in
the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
ACCEPT message, the UE shall assume that the list is prioritised with the
first address within the Protocol Configuration Options information element as
the P-CSCF address with the highest priority.
III. The UE selects a P-CSCF from the list (see 3GPP TS 31.103 [15B]) stored
in the ISIM.
IV. The UE selects a P-CSCF from the list in IMS management object.
The UE shall use method IV to select a P-CSCF, if:
\- a P-CSCF is to be discovered in the home network;
\- the UE is roaming; and
\- the IMS management object contains the P-CSCF list.
The UE shall use method III to select the P-CSCF, if:
\- a P-CSCF is to be discovered in the home network;
\- the UE is roaming;
\- either the UE does not contain the IMS management object, or the UE
contains the IMS management object, but the IMS management object does not
contain the P-CSCF list; and
\- the ISIM residing in the UICC supports the P-CSCF list.
The UE can freely select method I or II for P-CSCF discovery, if:
\- the UE is in the home network; or
\- the UE is roaming and the P-CSCF is to be discovered in the visited network
.
In case method I is selected and several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs are
provided to the UE, the selection of P-CSCF address or FQDN shall be performed
as indicated in RFC 3361 [35A] when using IPv4 or RFC 3319 [41] when using
IPv6. If sufficient information for P-CSCF address selection is not available,
selection of the P-CSCF address by the UE is implementation specific.
NOTE 4: The UE decides whether the P-CSCF is to be discovered in the serving
network or in the home network based on local configuration, e.g. whether the
application on the UE is permitted to use local breakout.
If the UE is designed to use I above, but receives P-CSCF address(es)
according to II, then the UE shall either ignore the received address(es), or
use the address(es) in accordance with II, and not proceed with the DHCP
request according to I.
When using IPv4, the UE may request a DNS Server IPv4 address(es) via RFC 2132
[20F] or by the Protocol Configuration Options information element when
activating a PDP context according to 3GPP TS 27.060 [10A].
When using IPv6, the UE may request a DNS Server IPv6 address(es) via RFC 3315
[40] and RFC 3646 [56C] or by the Protocol Configuration Options information
element when activating a PDP context according to 3GPP TS 27.060 [10A].
The encoding of the request and response for IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) for DNS
server(s) and list of P-CSCF address(es) within the Protocol Configuration
Options information element is described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
### B.2.2.1A Modification of a PDP context used for SIP signalling
The PDP context shall not be modified from a dedicated PDP context for SIP
signalling to a general-purpose PDP context or vice versa. The IM CN Subsystem
Signalling Flag shall not be set in the Protocol Configuration Options
information element of the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.
The UE shall not indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the GGSN within
the Protocol Configuration Options information element of the MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message. The UE shall ignore P-CSCF address(es) if received
from the GGSN in the Protocol Configuration Options information element of the
MODIFY PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message.
### B.2.2.1B Re-establishment of the PDP context for SIP signalling
If the UE registered a public user identity with an IP address allocated for
the APN of the PDP context used for SIP signalling, the PDP context used for
SIP signalling is deactivated as result of signalling from the network (e.g.
lost as a result of a successful GPRS routeing area update procedure) and:
i) if the signalling from the network results in requiring the UE to initiate
activation of the PDP context used for SIP signalling; or
ii) if the UE needs to continue having a public user identity registered with
an IP address allocated for the APN;
the UE shall:
A) if the non-access stratum is performing the PDP context activation
procedure for the APN triggered as result of the signalling from the network,
wait until the PDP context activation procedure for the APN finishes; and
B) perform the procedures in subclause B.2.2.1, bullets a), b) and c).
If:
\- none of the bullets i) and ii) of this subclause evaluate to true;
\- the procedures in bullet B) of this subclause were unable to ensure that
the PDP context used for SIP signalling is available; or
\- the procedures in bullet B) of this subclause were unable to acquire any
P-CSCF address(es);
and if the PDP context used for SIP signalling was a dedicated PDP context for
SIP signalling as described in subclause B.2.2.1, the UE shall deactivate all
PDP contexts established as a result of SIP signalling according to the 3GPP
TS 24.008 [8].
If all PDP contexts for the APN were deactivated at the start of this
subclause and the procedures in bullet B) of this subclause ensured that the
PDP context used for SIP signalling is available and acquired the P-CSCF
address(es), the UE shall perform a new initial registration according to
subclause 5.1.1.2.
### B.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses one of the following
methods to detect that a P-CSCF is not working any longer:
A. if the UE used the Protocol Configuration Options to discover the P-CSCF
address at the PDP context actication and if the UE receives an MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message containing a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
that does not include the address of the currently used P-CSCF, then the UE
shall acquire the highest priority P-CSCF address in the list of P-CSCF IPv4
or IPv6 addresses in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message. The UE shall
assume that the list is prioritised with the first address within the Protocol
Configuration Options information element as the P-CSCF address with the
highest priority; and
B. if the UE monitors the P-CSCF status by means of the procedures provided by
RFC 6223 [143] and if the P-CSCF fails to respond to a keep-alive request,
then the UE shall acquire a new P-CSCF address using one of the methods I, III
and IV for P-CSCF discovery described in the subclause B.2.2.1.
When a new P-CSCF address is acquired the UE shall perform an initial
registration as specified in subclause 5.1.
### B.2.2.2 Session management procedures
The existing procedures for session management as described in 3GPP TS 24.008
[8] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### B.2.2.3 Mobility management procedures
The existing procedures for mobility management as described in 3GPP TS 24.008
[8] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### B.2.2.4 Cell selection and lack of coverage
The existing mechanisms and criteria for cell selection as described in 3GPP
TS 25.304 [9] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [20] shall apply while the UE is connected to
the IM CN subsystem.
### B.2.2.5 PDP contexts for media
#### B.2.2.5.1 General requirements
The UE can establish media streams that belong to different SIP sessions on
the same PDP context.
During establishment of a session, the UE establishes data streams(s) for
media related to the session. Such data stream(s) may result in activation of
additional PDP context(s). Such additional PDP context(s) shall be established
as secondary PDP contexts associated to the PDP context used for signalling.
Such secondary PDP contexts for media can be established either by the UE or
the GGSN.
If the bearer establishment is controlled by the UE, the UE starts reserving
its local resources whenever it has sufficient information about the media
streams, media authorization and used codecs available as specified in 3GPP TS
24.008 [8].
NOTE 1: If the bearer establishment is controlled by the GPRS IP CAN, the
resource reservation requests are initiated by the GGSN after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
NOTE 2: When the UE has to allocate bandwidth for RTP and RTCP in a PDP
context, the UE uses the rules as those outlined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [13C].
#### B.2.2.5.1A Activation or modification of PDP contexts for media by the UE
If the UE is configured not to initiate resource allocation for media
according to 3GPP TS 24.167 [8G] and both UE and network are allowed to
establish the secondary PDP contents, then the UE shall refrain from
establishing the secondary PDP context(s) for media and from modifying
existing PDP contexts for media until the UE considers that the network did
not initiate resource allocation for the media.
If the UE receives indication within the SDP according to RFC 3524 [54] that
media stream(s) belong to group(s), the media stream(s) shall be set up on
separate PDP contexts according to the indication of grouping of media
streams. The UE may freely group media streams to PDP context(s) in case no
indication of grouping of media streams is received from the P-CSCF.
If the capabilities of the originating UE prevents it from establishment of
additional PDP contexts according to the media grouping attributes given by
the P-CSCF in accordance with RFC 3524 [54], the UE will not establish such
grouping of media streams. Instead, the originating UE shall negotiate media
parameters for the session according to RFC 3264 [27B].
If the capabilities of the terminating UE prevents it from establishment of
additional PDP contexts according to the media grouping attributes given by
the P-CSCF in accordance with RFC 3524 [54], the UE will not establish such
grouping of media streams. Instead, the terminating UE shall the UE shall
handle such SDP offers in accordance with RFC 3388 [53].
The UE can receive a media authorization token in the P-Media-Authorization
header field from the P-CSCF according to RFC 3313 [31]. If a media
authorization token is received in the P-Media-Authorization header field when
a SIP session is initiated, the UE shall:
\- either use existing PDP context(s) where another media authorization token
is already in use and no indication of grouping of media streams is required;
or
\- establish separate PDP context(s) for the media; or
\- use an existing PDP context where media authorization token is not in use
and no indication of grouping of media streams is required.
When a UE modifies a PDP context to indicate a new media authorization token:
\- either as a result of establishment of an additional SIP session; or
\- modification of media streams for an ongoing SIP session;
the UE shall include all media authorization tokens and all flow identifiers
for all ongoing SIP sessions that use this particular PDP context.
If a media authorization token is received in subsequent messages for the same
SIP session, the UE shall:
\- use the existing PDP context(s) for media;
\- modify the existing PDP context(s) for media; or
\- establish additional PDP context(s) for media.
If either background or interactive QoS class is needed for the media, then
the UE does not need to use the authorization token even if it receives one.
In this case the UE may reuse an existing PDP context and it does not need to
request PDP context modification unless it needs to modify the QoS.
If existing PDP context(s) where another media authorization token is already
in use is re-used for the media, or separate PDP context(s) is established for
the media, the UE shall proceed as follows:
\- when a SIP session is terminated, the media authorization token is no
longer valid and the UE shall not include it in future GPRS session management
messages. The UE shall send a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message updating the
binding information by deleting the media authorization token and the
corresponding flow identifiers that are no longer valid. If a SIP session is
terminated and no other SIP sessions are using the PDP context, the UE shall
either update the binding information as described above or deactivate the PDP
context;
\- the UE shall transparently pass the media authorization token received from
the P-CSCF in a response to an INVITE request at originating setup or in the
INVITE request at terminating setup to the GGSN. The UE shall signal it by
inserting it within the Traffic Flow Template information element in the
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message or the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message;
\- to identify to the GGSN which flow(s) (identified by m-lines within the
SDP) that are transferred within a particular PDP context, the UE shall set
the flow identifier(s) within the Traffic Flow Template information element in
the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message or the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message. Detailed description of how the flow identifiers are
constructed is provided in 3GPP TS 29.207 [12];
\- if the UE receives several media authorization tokens from the P-CSCF
within the same SIP request or response, the first instance of the media
authorization token shall be sent to the GGSN, and subsequent instances are
discarded by the UE; and
\- the UE shall not include the IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag when a PDP
context for media is established or modified.
The encoding of the media authorization token and the flow identifiers within
the Traffic Flow Template information element is described in 3GPP TS 24.008
[8].
#### B.2.2.5.1B Activation or modification of PDP contexts for media by the
GGSN
If the UE receives an activation request from the GGSN for a PDP context which
is associated with the PDP context used for signalling, the UE shall, based on
the information contained in the Traffic Flow Template information element,
correlate the media PDP context with a currently ongoing SIP session
establishment or SIP session modification.
If the UE receives a modification request from the GGSN for a PDP context that
is used for one or more media streams in an ongoing SIP session, the UE shall:
1) modify the related PDP context in accordance with the request received from
the GGSN.
#### B.2.2.5.2 Special requirements applying to forked responses
Since the UE does not know that forking has occurred until a second,
provisional response arrives, the UE sets up the PDP context(s) as required by
the initial response received. If a subsequent provisional response is
received, different alternative actions may be performed depending on the
requirements in the SDP answer:
1) **the bearer requirements of the subsequent SDP can be accommodated by the
existing PDP context(s).** The UE performs no activation or modification of
PDP contexts.
2) **the subsequent SDP introduces different QoS requirements or additional IP
flows.** The UE modifies the existing PDP context(s), if necessary, according
to subclause B.2.2.5.1A.
3) **the subsequent SDP introduces one or more additional IP flows.** The UE
establishes additional PDP context(s) according to subclause B.2.2.5.1A.
NOTE 1: When several forked responses are received, the resources requested by
the UE is are the \"logical OR\" of the resources indicated in the multiple
responses to avoid allocation of unnecessary resources. The UE does not
request more resources than proposed in the original INVITE request.
NOTE 2: When service-based local policy is applied, the UE receives the same
authorization token for all forked requests/responses related to the same SIP
session.
When a final answer is received for one of the early dialogues, the UE
proceeds to set up the SIP session. The UE shall release all the unneeded
radio/bearer resources. Therefore, upon the reception of the first final 200
(OK) response for the INVITE request (in addition to the procedures defined in
RFC 3261 [26] subclause 13.2.2.4), the UE shall:
1) in case PDP context(s) were established or modified as a consequence of the
INVITE request and forked provisional responses that are not related to the
accepted 200 (OK) response, delete the PDP context(s) or modify the delete the
PDP context(s) back to their original state.
#### B.2.2.5.3 Unsuccessful situations
One of the Go, Gq, Rx and Gx interface related error codes can be received by
the UE in the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message or the MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REJECT message. If the UE receives a Go, Gq, Rx and Gx interface
related error code, the UE shall either handle the resource reservation
failure as described in subclause 6.1.1 or retransmit the message up to three
times. The Go, Gq, Rx and Gx interface related error codes are further
specified in 3GPP TS 29.207 [12], 3GPP TS 29.209 [13A], 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D]
and 3GPP TS 29.212 [13C].
### B.2.2.6 Emergency service
Emergency bearers are defined for use in emergency calls in GPRS and core
network support of these bearers is indicated to the UE in NAS signalling.
Where the UE recognises that a call request is an emergency call and the core
network supports emergency bearers, the UE shall use these bearers for both
signalling and media on emergency calls made using the IM CN subsystem.
Some jurisdictions allow emergency calls to be made when the UE does not
contain an ISIM or USIM, or where the credentials are not accepted.
Additionally where the UE is in state GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE and GMM-
REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, a normal ATTACH has been attempted and it can also be
assumed that a registration in the IM CN subsystem will also fail. In such
cases, the procedures for emergency calls without registration apply, as
defined in subclause 5.1.6.8.2.
When activating a PDP context to perform emergency registration, the UE shall
request a PDP context for emergency bearer services as defined in 3GPP TS
24.008 [8]. The procedures for PDP context activation and P-CSCF discovery, as
described in subclause B.2.2.1 of this specification apply accordingly.
In order to find out whether the UE is attached to the home PLMN or to the
visited PLMN, the UE shall compare the MCC and MNC values derived from its
IMSI with the MCC and MNC of the PLMN the UE is attached to. If the MCC and
MNC of the PLMN the UE is attached to do not match with the MCC and MNC
derived from the IMSI, then for the purpose of emergency calls in the IM CN
subsystem the UE shall consider to be attached to a VPLMN.
NOTE 1: In this respect an equivalent HPLMN, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [4C]
will be considered as a visited network.
The type of emergency service for an emergency number is derived from the
settings of the emergency service category value (bits 1 to 5 of the emergency
service category value as specified in subclause 10.5.4.33 of 3GPP TS 24.008
[8]). Table B.2.2.6.1 below specifies mappings between a type of emergency
service and an emergency service URN. The UE shall use the mapping to match an
emergency service URN and a type of emergency service. If a dialled number is
an emergency number but does not map to a type of emergency service the
service URN shall be \"urn:service:sos\".
Table B.2.2.6.1: Mapping between type of emergency service and emergency
service URN
* * *
Type of emergency service Emergency service URN Police urn:service:sos.police
Ambulance urn:service:sos.ambulance Fire Brigade urn:service:sos.fire Marine
Guard urn:service:sos.marine Mountain Rescue urn:service:sos.mountain
* * *
If the IP-CAN did not provide a local emergency number that matches the
dialled number (see subclause 5.1.6.1) and multiple types of emergency service
can be derived for a dialled number from the information configured on the
USIM then:
\- if the UE is in the HPLMN, the UE shall map any one of these types of
emergency service to an emergency service URN as specified in table B.2.2.6.1;
and
\- if the UE is in the VPLMN, the UE shall select \"urn:service:sos\".
If the IP-CAN provided a local emergency number that matches the dialled
number (see subclause 5.1.6.1), and:
\- if the UE can derive one or more types of emergency service from the
information received from the IP-CAN for the dialled number and the UE cannot
derive types of emergency service from the information configured on the USIM
for the dialled number; or
\- if the UE is able to derive identical types of emergency service from both
the information received from the IP-CAN for the dialled number and from the
information configured on the USIM for the dialled number,
then the UE shall map any one of these emergency service types to an emergency
service URN as specified in table B.2.2.6.1.
NOTE 2: How the UE resolves clashes where an emergency number is associated
with one or more different types of emergency service configured in the USIM
and in information received from the access network, is implementation
dependent.
Upon reception of a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an INVITE request as
defined in subclause 5.1.3.1, if:
\- the 380 (Alternate Service) response contains a Contact header field;
\- the value of the Contact header field is a service URN; and
\- the service URN has a top-level service type of \"sos\";
then the UE determines that \"emergency service information is included\" as
described 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B], else the UE determines that \"emergency service
information\" as described 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] is not included.
If the \"emergency service information is included\" as described 3GPP TS
23.167 [4B]:
1) if the URN in the Contact header field matches an emergency service URN in
table B.2.2.6.1, then the type of emergency service is the value corresponding
to the matching entry in table B.2.2.6.1; and
2) if the URN in the Contact header field does not match any emergency service
URN in table B.2.2.6.1, then the type of emergency service is not identified.
NOTE 3: In bullet 2), the URN in the Contact header field either contains \"no
emergency subservice type\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] triggering an
emergency call, or contains an \"emergency subservice type that does not map
into an emergency service category for the CS domain\" as described in 3GPP TS
23.167 [4B] triggering a normal call when the dialled number is available or
triggering an emergency call when the dialled number is not available.
# B.2A Usage of SDP
## B.2A.0 General
NOTE: The UE constructs SDP based on the restrictions indicated in the IMSVoPS
indicator, if received in the \"Network feature support\" Information Element
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]). Regardless whether the IMSVoPS indicator indicating
voice is supported or not, m-lines can be set to \"audio\" and exclude voice
codecs from the SDP answer or SDP offer.
## B.2A.1 Impact on SDP offer / answer of activation or modification of PDP
contexts for media by the network
If due to the activation of PDP context from the network the related SDP media
description needs to be changed the UE shall update the related SDP
information by sending a new SDP offer within a SIP request, which is sent
over the existing SIP dialog,
If the UE receives a modification request from the network for a PDP context
that is used for one or more media streams in an ongoing SIP session, the UE
shall:
1) if, due to the modification of the PDP context, the related SDP media
description need to be changed, update the related SDP information by sending
a new SDP offer within a SIP request, that is sent over the existing SIP
dialog, and respond to the PDP context modification request.
NOTE: The UE can decide to indicate additional media streams as well as
additional or different codecs in the SDP offer than those used in the already
ongoing session.
## B.2A.2 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE when originating UE has
resources available and IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation
for terminating UE
If the UE receives an SDP offer where the SDP offer includes all media streams
for which the originating side indicated its local preconditions as met, if
the precondition mechanism is supported by the terminating UE and the IP-CAN
performs network-initiated resource reservation for the terminating UE and the
available resources are not sufficient for the received offer the terminating
UE shall indicate its local preconditions and provide the SDP answer to the
originating side without waiting for resource reservation.
NOTE 1: If the resource reservation is controlled by the GPRS IP-CAN, the
resource reservation request is initiated by the GGSN after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
NOTE 2: During the PDP context activation procedure the UE and network
negotiate whether the UE or the GPRS IP-CAN is responsible for the resource
reservation applicable to all PDP contexts within the activated PDP
address/APN pair as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
# B.3 Application usage of SIP
## B.3.1 Procedures at the UE
### B.3.1.1 P-Access-Network-Info header field
The UE shall always include the P-Access-Network-Info header field where
indicated in subclause 5.1.
### B.3.1.2 Availability for calls
The UE indicates to the non-access stratum the status of being available for
voice over PS when:
1) the UE is capable of receiving any (but not necessarily all) of the media
types which the CS domain supports, such that the media type can also be used
when accessing the IM CN subsystem using the current IP-CAN;
2) if the media type of item 1 is an \"audio\" media type, and the UE supports
codecs suitable for (conversational) speech; and
3) the UE determines a contact has been bound to a public user identity using
the IP-CAN, such that this contact is expected to be used for the delivery of
incoming requests in the IM CN subsystem relating to such media.
The UE indicates to the non-access stratum the status of being not available
for voice over PS when these conditions are no longer met.
## B.3.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### B.3.2.1 Determining network to which the originating user is attached
In order to determine from which network the request was originated the P-CSCF
shall check the MCC and MNC fields received in the P-Access-Network-Info
header field.
NOTE: The above check can be against more than one MNC code stored in the
P-CSCF.
### B.3.2.2 Location information handling
Void.
### B.3.2.3 Prohibited usage of PDN connection for emergency bearer services
If the P-CSCF detects that a UE uses a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services for a non-emergency REGISTER request, the P-CSCF shall reject that
request by a 403 (Forbidden) response.
## B.3.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
### B.3.3.1 Notification of AS about registration status
Not applicable
# B.4 3GPP specific encoding for SIP header field extensions
## B.4.1 Void
# B.5 Use of circuit-switched domain
When an emergency call is to be set up over the CS domain, the UE shall
attempt it according to the procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
###### ## Annex C (normative): UICC and USIM Aspects for access to the IM CN
subsystem
# C.1 Scope
This clause describes the UICC and USIM aspects for access to the IM CN
subsystem. Additional requirements related to UICC usage for access to the IM
CN subsystem are described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
# C.2 Derivation of IMS parameters from USIM
In case the UE is loaded with a UICC that contains a USIM but does not contain
an ISIM, the UE shall:
\- generate a private user identity;
\- generate a temporary public user identity; and
\- generate a home network domain name to address the SIP REGISTER request to.
All these three parameters are derived from the IMSI parameter in the USIM,
according to the procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3]. Also in this
case, the UE shall derive new values every time the UICC is changed, and shall
discard existing values if the UICC is removed.
NOTE: If there is an ISIM and a USIM on a UICC, the ISIM is used for
authentication to the IM CN subsystem, as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
See also subclause 5.1.1.1A.
# C.3 ISIM Location in 3GPP Systems
For 3GPP systems, if ISIM is present, it is contained in UICC.
# C.4 Update of IMS parameters on the UICC
3GPP TS 31.102 [15C] and 3GPP TS 31.103 [15B] specify the file structure and
contents for the preconfigured parameters stored on the USIM and ISIM,
respectively, necessary to initiate the registration to the IM CN subsystem.
Any of these parameters can be updated via Data Download or a USAT
application, as described in 3GPP TS 31.111 [15D]. If one ore more EFs are
changed and a REFRESH command is issued by the UICC, then the UE reads the
updated parameters from the UICC as specified for the REFRESH command in 3GPP
TS 31.111 [15D].
In case of changes to EFs, the UE is not required to perform deregistration
but it shall wait for the network-initated deregistration procedures to occur
as described in subclause 5.4.1.5 unless the user initiates deregistration
procedures as described in subclause 5.1.1.6. From this point onwards the
normal initial registration procedures can occur.
###### ## Annex D (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using I-WLAN to access IM CN subsystem
# D.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is Wireless LAN Interworking
(I-WLAN).
# D.2 I-WLAN aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
## D.2.1 Introduction
A WLAN UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself,
utilise the services provided by I-WLAN to provide packet-mode communication
between the WLAN UE and the IM CN subsystem.
Requirements for the WLAN UE on the use of these packet-mode services are
specified in this clause. Requirements for the PDG in support of this
communication are specified in 3GPP TS 29.161 [11C]. When using the I-WLAN,
the IP-CAN bearer is provided by an I-WLAN tunnel.
## D.2.2 Procedures at the WLAN UE
### D.2.2.1 I-WLAN tunnel activation and P-CSCF discovery
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the WLAN UE shall:
a) Perform I-WLAN network selection i.e. gaining 3GPP Direct access as
described in 3GPP TS 24.234 [8C] in the access dependent case;
b) Establish an IKE security association and an IPsec ESP security association
(I-WLAN tunnel with the PDG according to the W-APN and PDG selection criteria

Not applicable.
### D.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses the keep-alive
procedures described in RFC 6223 [143] for monitoring the P-CSCF status.
If the P-CSCF fails to respond to keep-alive requests the UE shall acquire a
new P-CSCF address using any of the methods described in the subclause D.2.2.1

### D.2.2.5 I-WLAN tunnel procedures for media
#### D.2.2.5.1 General requirements
The WLAN UE can establish media streams that belong to different SIP sessions
on the same I-WLAN tunnel.
During establishment of a session, the WLAN UE establishes data streams(s) for
media related to the session. Such data stream(s) may result in activation of
additional IPsec ESP security associations (I-WLAN tunnels).
If the WLAN UE receives indication within the SDP according to RFC 3524 [54]
that media stream(s) belong to group(s), the media stream(s) shall be set up
on separate IPSEC ESP security associations (I-WLAN tunnels) according to the
indication of grouping of media streams. The WLAN UE may freely group media
streams to IPsec ESP security association (I-WLAN tunnel(s)) in case no
indication of grouping of media streams is received from the P-CSCF.
If the capabilities of the originating WLAN UE, or operator policy at the PDG
prevents the originating WLAN UE from establishment of additional IPsec ESP
security associations (I-WLAN tunnels) according to the media grouping
attributes given by the P-CSCF in accordance with RFC 3524 [54], the WLAN UE
will not establish such grouping of media streams. Instead, the originating
WLAN UE shall negotiate media parameters for the session according to RFC 3264
[27B].
If the capabilities of the terminating WLAN UE or operator policy at the PDG
prevents the originating WLAN UE from establishment of additional IPsec ESP
security associations (I-WLAN tunnels) according to the media grouping
attributes given by the P-CSCF in accordance with RFC 3524 [54], the WLAN UE
will not establish such grouping of media streams. Instead, the terminating
WLAN UE shall handle such SDP offers in accordance with RFC 3388 [53].
The UE can receive a media authorization token in the P-Media-Authorization
header field from the P-CSCF according to RFC 3313 [31]. If a media
authorization token is received in the P-Media-Authorization header field when
a SIP session is initiated, the UE shall reuse the existing I-WLAN tunnel and
ignore the media authorization token.

###### ## Annex E (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using xDSL or Ethernet to access IM CN subsystem
# E.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is xDSL or Ethernet.
> NOTE: Fixed-broadband access in this Annex refers to xDSL and Ethernet
> accesses.
# E.2 Fixed broadband aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
## E.2.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself, utilise
the services provided by the fixed-broadband access network to provide packet-
mode communication between the UE and the IM CN subsystem.
Requirements for the IP Edge node, defined in ETSI ES 282 001 [138]in support
of this communication are outside the scope of this document and specified
elsewhere.
From the UEs perspective, it is assumed that one or more IP-CAN bearer(s) are
provided, in the form of connection(s) managed by the layer 2 (e.g. DSL modem
supporting the UE).
In the first instance, it is assumed that the IP-CAN bearer(s) is (are)
statically provisioned between the UE and the IP Edge node, defined in ETSI ES
282 001 [138], according to the user\'s subscription.
It is out of the scope of the current Release to specify whether a single IP-
CAN bearer is used to convey both signalling and media flows, or whether
several PVC connections are used to isolate various types of IP flows
(signalling flows, conversational media, non conversational media...).
The end-to-end characteristics of the fixed-broadband IP-CAN bearer depend on
the type of access network, and on network configuration. The description of
the network PVC termination (e.g., located in the DSLAM, in the BRAS...) is
out of the scope of this annex.
## E.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### E.2.2.1 Activation and P-CSCF discovery
Fixed-broadband bearer(s) is (are) statically provisioned in the current
Release.
Unless a static IP address is allocated to the UE, prior to communication with
the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall perform a Network Attachment procedure
depending on the used fixed-broadband access type. When using a fixed-
broadband access, both IPv4 and IPv6 UEs may access the IM CN subsystem. The
UE may request a DNS Server IPv4 address(es) via RFC 2132 [20F] or a DNS
Server IPv6 address(es) via RFC 3315 [40].
When using IPv4, the UE may acquires a P-CSCF address(es) by using the DHCP
(see RFC 2132 [20F]), the DHCPv4 options for SIP servers (see RFC 3361 [35A]),
and RFC 3263 [27A].
In case the DHCP server provides several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs to the UE,
the UE shall select the P-CSCF address or FQDN as indicated in RFC 3361 [35A].
If sufficient information for P-CSCF address selection is not available,
selection of the P-CSCF address by the UE is implementation specific.
When using IPv6, the UE may acquires a P-CSCF address(es) by using the DHCPv6
(see RFC 3315 [40] and RFC 3646 [56C]), the DHCPv6 options for SIP servers
(see RFC 3319 [41]), and RFC 3263 [27H].
In case the DHCP server provides several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs to the UE,
the UE shall select the P-CSCF address or FQDN as indicated in RFC 3319 [41].
If sufficient information for P-CSCF address selection is not available,
selection of the P-CSCF address by the UE is implementation specific.
### E.2.2.1A Modification of a fixed-broadband connection used for SIP
signalling
Not applicable.
### E.2.2.1B Re-establishment of a fixed-broadband connection used for SIP
signalling
Not applicable.
### E.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses the keep-alive
procedures described in RFC 6223 [143] for monitoring the P-CSCF status.
If the P-CSCF fails to respond to keep-alive requests the UE shall acquire a
new P-CSCF address using any of the methods described in the subclause E.2.2.1
and perform an initial registartion as specified in subclause 5.1.
### E.2.2.2 Void
### E.2.2.3 Void
### E.2.2.4 Void
### E.2.2.5 Fixed-broadband bearer(s) for media
#### E.2.2.5.1 General requirements
The UE can establish media streams that belong to different SIP sessions on
the same fixed-broadband bearer.
#### E.2.2.5.1A Activation or modification of fixed-broadband bearers for
media by the UE
If the UE receives indication within the SDP according to RFC 3524 [54] that
media stream(s) belong to group(s), and if several fixed-broadband bearers are
available to the UE for the session, the media stream(s) may be sent on
separate fixed-broadband bearers according to the indication of grouping. The
UE may freely group media streams to fixed-broadband bearers in case no
indication of grouping is received from the P-CSCF.
If the UE receives media grouping attributes in accordance with RFC 3524 [54]
that it cannot provide within the available fixed-broadband bearer(s), then
the UE shall handle such SDP offers in accordance with RFC 3388 [53].
The UE can receive a media authorization token in the P-Media-Authorization
header field from the P-CSCF according to RFC 3313 [31]. If a media
authorization token is received in the P-Media-Authorization header field when
a SIP session is initiated, the UE shall reuse the existing fixed-broadband
bearer(s) and ignore the media authorization token.
#### E.2.2.5.1B Activation or modification of fixed-broadband bearers for
media by the network
Not applicable.
#### E.2.2.5.2 Special requirements applying to forked responses
Since the UE is unable to perform bearer modification, forked responses place
no special requirements on the UE.
#### E.2.2.5.3 Unsuccessful situations
Not applicable.
### E.2.2.6 Emergency service
If attached to network via fixed-broadband access technology, the UE shall
always consider being attached to its home operator\'s network for the purpose
of emergency calls.
NOTE: In fixed-broadband the UE is unable to receive any indication from the
network, that would allow the UE to determine, whether it is currently
attached to its home operator\'s network or to a different network, so the UE
assumes itself always attached to the home operator\'s network when connected
via fixed-broadband access technology.
## E.2A Usage of SDP
## E.2A.0 General
Not applicable.
### E.2A.1 Impact on SDP offer / answer of activation or modification of xDSL
bearer for media by the network
Not applicable.
### E.2A.2 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE when originating UE has
resources available and IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation
for terminating UE
Not applicable.
# E.3 Application usage of SIP
## E.3.1 Procedures at the UE
### E.3.1.1 P-Access-Network-Info header field
The UE may, but need not, include the P-Access-Network-Info header field where
indicated in subclause 5.1.
### E.3.1.2 Availability for calls
Not applicable.
## E.3.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### E.3.2.1 Determining network to which the originating user is attached
In order to determine from which network the request was originated the P-CSCF
shall check if the location information received in the network provided
and/or UE provided \"dsl-location\" parameter in the P-Access-Network-Info
header field(s) belongs to a location in the same country.
NOTE 1: If local policy does not require the insertion of P-Access-Network-
Info header field in the P-CSCF even if it is missing in the received initial
request, the P-CSCF can assume that the request is initiated by fixed
broadband UE in the same country.
NOTE 2: If the location information in the network provided and UE provided
\"dsl-location\" parameters (in a request that includes two P-Access-Network-
Info header fields) is contradictory, or the two P-Access-Network-Info header
fields indicate different access types the P-CSCF ignores either the network
provided or the UE provided information according to operator policy.
### E.3.2.2 Location information handling
Upon receipt of an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction or
an unknown method, the P-CSCF based on local policy may include a P-Access-
Network-Info header field.The value of the dsl-location parameter shall be the
value as received in the Location-Information header in the User-Data Answer
command as specified in ETSI ES 283 035 [98].
NOTE: The way the P-CSCF deduce that the request comes from a UE connected
through xDSL access is implementation dependent.
## E.3.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
### E.3.3.1 Notification of AS about registration status
Not applicable
# E.4 3GPP specific encoding for SIP header field extensions
Void.
# E.5 Use of circuit-switched domain
There is CS domain in this access technology.
###### ## Annex F (normative): Additional procedures in support for hosted NAT
NOTE: This subclause describes the mechanism for support of the hosted NAT
scenario. This does not preclude other mechanisms but they are out of the
scope of this annex.
# F.1 Scope
This annex describes the UE and P-CSCF procedures in support of hosted NAT. In
this scenario, both the media flows and the SIP signalling both traverse a
NA(P)T device located in the customer premises domain. The term \"hosted NAT\"
is used to address this function.
When receiving an initial SIP REGISTER request without integrity protection,
the P-CSCF can, determine whether to perform the hosted NAT procedures for the
user identified by the REGISTER request by comparing the address information
in the top-most SIP Via header field with the IP level address information
from where the request was received. The P-CSCF will use the hosted NAT
procedure only when the address information do not match.
NOTE: There is no need for the P-CSCF to resolve a domain name in the Via
header field when UDP encapsulated tunnel mode for IPsec is used. The
resolution of a domain name in the Via header field is not required by RFC
3261 [26].
In order to provide hosted NAT traversal for SIP REGISTER requests without
integrity protection and the associated responses, the P-CSCF makes use of the
\"received\" and \"rport\" header field parameters as described in RFC 3261
[26] and RFC 3581 [56A]. The hosted NAT traversal for protected SIP messages
is provided by applying UDP encapsulation to IPSec packets in accordance with
RFC 3948 [63A].
Alternativly to the procedures defined in subclause F.2 which are employed to
support the hosted NAT scenario where the security solution is based on UDP
encapsulated IPSec as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], subclause F.4 provides
procedures for NAT traversal for security solutions that are not defined in
3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. Use of such security solutions is outside the scope of
this document.
# F.2 Application usage of SIP
## F.2.1 UE usage of SIP
### F.2.1.1 General
This subclause describes the UE SIP procedures for supporting hosted NAT
scenarios. The description enhances the procedures specified in subclause 5.1.
The UE shall support the symmetric response routeing mechanism according to
RFC 3581 [56A].
### F.2.1.2 Registration and authentication
#### F.2.1.2.1 General
The text in subclause 5.1.1.1 applies without changes
#### F.2.1.2.1A Parameters contained in the ISIM
The text in subclause 5.1.1.1A applies without changes
#### F.2.1.2.1B Parameters provisioned to a UE without ISIM or USIM
The text in subclause 5.1.1.1B applies without changes.
#### F.2.1.2.2 Initial registration
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.2.1 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
NOTE 1: In accordance with the definitions given in subclause 3.1 the IP
address acquired initially by the UE in a hosted NAT scenario is the **UE
private IP address**.
On sending a REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
indicated in subclause 5.1.1.2.1 with the exceptions of subitems c) and d)
which are modified as follows
The UE shall populate:
c) a Contact header field according to the following rules: if the REGISTER
request is sent without integrity protection, the Contact header field shall
be set to include SIP URI(s) containing the private IP address of the UE in
the hostport parameter or FQDN. If the UE supports GRUU, the UE shall include
a \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter containing the instance ID. If the
REGISTER request is integrity protected, the UE shall include the public IP
address or FQDNin the hostport parameter. The UE shall only use a FQDN in a
protected REGISTER request, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to the
public IP address of the NAT. If the UE supports GRUU, the UE shall include a
\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter containing the instance ID. The UE
shall include all supported ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause
7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2
and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS communication services it intends to use, and
IARI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), for the IMS
applications it intends to use in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as
defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3840 [62];
NOTE 2: The UE will learn its public IP address from the \"received\" header
field parameter in the topmost Via header field in the 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the unprotected REGISTER request.
d) a Via header field according to the following rules: if the REGISTER
request is sent without integrity protection, the Via header field shall be
set to include the private IP address or FQDN of the UE in the sent-by field.
If the REGISTER request is integrity protected, the UE shall include the
public IP address or FQDN in the sent-by field. The UE shall only use a FQDN
in a protected REGISTER request, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to
the public IP address of the NAT. Unless the UE has been configured to not
send keep-alives, it shall include a \"keep\" header field parameter with no
value in the Via header field, in order to indicate support of sending keep-
alives associated with, the registration, as described in RFC 6223 [143];
NOTE 3: If the UE specifies a FQDN in the host parameter in the Contact header
field and in the sent-by field in the Via header field of an unprotected
REGISTER request, this FQDN will not be subject to any processing by the
P-CSCF or other entities within the IM CN subsystem. The means to ensure that
the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT are outside of the scope
of this specification. One option for resolving this is local configuration.
If IMS AKA is used as a security mechanism, on sending a REGISTER request, as
defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall additionally populate the header
fields as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.2, with the exceptions of subitems c),
and d) which are modified as follows:
d) the Security-Client header field set to specify the security mechanisms the
UE supports, the IPsec layer algorithms the UE supports and the parameters
needed for the security association setup. The UE shall support the setup of
two pairs of security associations as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The
syntax of the parameters needed for the security association setup is
specified in Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE shall support the
\"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The UE shall
support the IPSec layer algorithms for integrity protection and for encryption
as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], and shall announce support for them
according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329 [48]. In addition to transport
mode the UE shall support UDP encapsulated tunnel mode as per RFC 3948 [63A]
and shall announce support for both modes as described in TS 33.203 [19];
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received and this response
is received without integrity protection, the procedures described in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1 apply with the following additions:
The UE shall compare the values in the \"received\" header field parameter and
\"rport\" header field parameter with the corresponding values in the sent-by
parameter in the topmost Via header field to detect if the UE is behind a NAT.
If the comparison indicates that the respective values are the same, the UE
concludes that it is not behind a NAT.
\- If the UE is not behind a NAT, the UE shall proceed with the procedures
described in subclause 5.1 of the main body of this specification;
\- If the UE is behind a NAT, the UE shall verify using the Security-Server
header field that mode \"UDP-enc-tun\" is selected. If the verification
succeeds the UE shall store the IP address contained in the \"received\"
header field parameter as the UE public IP address. If the verification does
not succeed the UE shall abort the registration.
In addition, when a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received
(with or without integrity protection) the UE shall behave as described in
subclause F.2.1.2.5.
When the UE, that is behind a NAT, receives a 400 (Bad Request) response with
301 Warning header field indicating \"incompatible network address format\" to
the unprotected REGISTER request, the UE shall randomly select new values for
the protected server port and the protected client port, and perform new
initiate registration procedure by sending an unprotected REGISTER request
containing the new values in the Security-Client header field.
#### F.2.1.2.3 Initial subscription to the registration-state event package
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.3 apply with the additional
procedures described in subclause F.2.1.4.1.
#### F.2.1.2.4 User-initiated re-registration
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.4.1 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
On sending a REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response, the
UE shall populate the header fields as indicated in subclause 5.1.1.4.1 with
the exception of subitems c) and d) which are modified as follows.
The UE shall populate:
c) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI(s) that contain(s) in the
hostport parameter the public IP address of the UE or FQDN, and containing the
instance ID of the UE in the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter, if the
UE supports GRUU. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN
resolves to the public IP address of the NAT. The UE shall include all
supported ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840
[62] for the IMS communication services it intends to use, and IARI values
(coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), for the IMS applications it
intends to use in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause
7.9.3 and RFC 3840 [62];
d) a Via header field set to include the public IP address or FQDN of the UE
in the sent-by field. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the
FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT. For the TCP, the response
is received on the TCP connection on which the request was sent. If the UE
previously has previously negotiated sending of keep-alives associated with
the registration, it shall include a \"keep\" header field parameter with no
value in the Via header field, in order to indicate continous support to send
keep-alives, as described in RFC 6223 [143];
NOTE 1: The means to ensure that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of
the NAT are outside of the scope of this specification. One option for
resolving this is local configuration.
When the UE, that is behind a NAT, receives a 400 (Bad Request) response with
301 Warning header field indicating \"incompatible network address format\" to
the REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response, the UE shall
randomly select a new value for the protected client port, and send the
REGISTER request containing the new values in the Security-Client header
field.
NOTE 2: The protected server port stays fixed for a UE until all public user
identities of the UE have been de-registered.
#### F.2.1.2.5 Authentication
##### F.2.1.2.5.1 IMS AKA - general
The procedures of subclause 5.1.1.5.1 apply with with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request and the
response is deemed to be valid, the UE shall behave as of subclause 5.1.1.5.1
with the exception of subitem 3) which is modified as follows.
The UE shall:
3) send another REGISTER request using the temporary set of security
associations to protect the message. The header fields are populated as
defined for the initial request (see subclause F.2.1.2.2), with the addition
that the UE shall include an Authorization header field containing the private
user identity and the authentication challenge response calculated by the UE
using RES and other parameters, as described in RFC 3310 [49]. The UE shall
also insert the Security-Client header field that is identical to the
Security-Client header field that was included in the previous REGISTER
request (i.e. the REGISTER request that was challenged with the received 401
(Unauthorized) response). The UE shall also insert the Security-Verify header
field into the request, by mirroring in it the content of the Security-Server
header field received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response. The UE shall set the
Call-ID of the integrity protected REGISTER request which carries the
authentication challenge response to the same value as the Call-ID of the 401
(Unauthorized) response which carried the challenge.
Whenever the 200 (OK) response is not received before the temporary SIP level
lifetime of the temporary set of security associations expires or a 403
(Forbidden) response is received, the UE shall consider the registration to
have failed. The UE shall delete the temporary set of security associations it
was trying to establish, and use the old set of security associations. The UE
should send an unprotected REGISTER request according to the procedure
specified in subclause F.2.1.2.2 if the UE considers the old set of security
associations to be no longer active at the P-CSCF.

are modified as follows.
The UE shall populate:
c) a Contact header field set to either the value of \"*\" or SIP URI(s) that
contain(s) in the hostport parameter the IP address of the UE or FQDN; and
containing the instance ID of the UE in the \"+sip.instance\" header field
parameter, if the UE supports GRUU. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is
ensured that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT;
d) a Via header field set to include the IP address or FQDN of the UE in the
sent-by field. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN
resolves to the public IP address of the NAT;
NOTE 1: In case of hosted NAT traversal only the UE public IP addresses are
bound to security associations.
NOTE 2: The means to ensure that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of
the NAT are outside of the scope of this specification. One option for
resolving this is local configuration.
#### F.2.1.2.7 Network-initiated deregistration
The procedures of subclause 5.1.1.7 apply with with the additional procedures
described in the present subclause.
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package as described in subclause 5.1.1.3,
including one or more \ element(s) which were registered by this
UE with:
\- the state attribute set to \"terminated\" and the event attribute set to
\"rejected\" or \"deactivated\"; or
\- the state attribute set to \"active\" and the state attribute within the
\ element belonging to this UE set to \"terminated\", and associated
event attribute element to \"rejected\" or \"deactivated\";
the UE shall remove all registration details relating to these public user
identities. In case of a \"deactivated\" event attribute, the UE shall start
the initial registration procedure as described in subclause F.2.1.2.2. In
case of a \"rejected\" event attribute, the UE shall release all dialogs
related to those public user identities.
### F.2.1.3 Subscription and notification
The text in subclause 5.1.2 applies without changes.
### F.2.1.4 Generic procedures applicable to all methods excluding the
REGISTER method
#### F.2.1.4.1 UE originating case
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.2A.1 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the UE sends any request, the requirements in subclause 5.1.2A.1 are
replaced by the following requirements. The UE shall include:
\- a Via header field set to include the public IP address of the UE or FQDN
and the protected server port in the sent-by field. The UE shall only use a
FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the
NAT; and if this is a request for a new dialog, and the request includes a
Contact header field, then the UE should populate the Contact header field as
follows:
1) if a public GRUU value (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) has been saved
associated with the public user identity to be used for this request, and the
UE does not indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then insert the
public GRUU (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) value in the Contact header
field as specified in RFC 5627 [93]; or
2) if a temporary GRUU value (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter) has been
saved associated with the public user identity to be used for this request,
and the UE does indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then insert the
temporary GRUU (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter) value in the Contact
header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93].
If this is a request within an existing dialog, and the request includes a
Contact header field, and the contact address previously used in the dialog
was a GRUU, then the UE should insert the previously used GRUU value in the
Contact header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93].
If the UE did not insert a GRUU in the Contact header field, then the UE shall
include the public IP address of the UE or FQDN and the protected server port
in the hostport parameter in any Contact header field that is otherwise
included. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN
resolves to the public IP address of the NAT.
NOTE: The means to ensure that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of
the NAT are outside of the scope of this specification. One option for
resolving this is local configuration.
The UE shall discard any SIP response that is not integrity protected and is
received from the P-CSCF outside of the registration and authentication
procedures. The requirements on the UE within the registration and
authentication procedures are defined in subclause F.2.1.2.4.
When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H expires at
the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described in subclause
F.2.1.2.3.
#### F.2.1.4.2 UE terminating case
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.2A.2 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the UE sends any response, the requirements in subclause 5.1.2A.1 are
replaced by the following requirement.
If the response includes a Contact header field, and the response is not sent
within an existing dialog, then the UE should populate the Contact header
field as follows:
1) if a public GRUU value (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) has been saved
associated with the public user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID header
field, and the UE does not indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then
insert the public GRUU (\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter) value in the
Contact header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93]; and
2) if a temporary GRUU value (\"temp-gruu\" header field parameter) has been
saved associated with the public user identity from the P-Called-Party-ID
header field, and the UE does indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity,
then the UE should insert the temporary GRUU (\"temp-gruu\" header field
parameter) value in the Contact header field as specified in RFC 5627 [93].
If the UE did not insert a GRUU in the Contact header field, then the UE
shall:
\- include the public IP address of the UE or FQDN and the protected server
port in the hostport parameter in any Contact header field that is otherwise
included. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN
resolves to the public IP address of the NAT.
NOTE: The means to ensure that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of
the NAT are outside of the scope of this specification. One option for
resolving this is local configuration.
The UE shall discard any SIP request that is not integrity protected and is
received from the P-CSCF outside of the registration and authentication
procedures. The requirements on the UE within the registration and
authentication procedures are defined in subclause F.2.1.2.
## F.2.2 P-CSCF usage of SIP
### F.2.2.1 Introduction
This subclause describes the SIP procedures for supporting hosted NAT
scenarios.
The description enhances the procedures specified in subclause 5.2.
The P-CSCF shall support the symmetric response routeing mechanism according
to RFC 3581 [56A].
NOTE: Symmetric response routeing is used to support hosted NAT and applicable
only to initial, unprotected REGISTER requests and corresponding responses.
### F.2.2.2 Registration
The procedures described in subclause 5.2.2 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, the P-CSCF shall
behave as of subclause 5.2.2.1.
If IMS AKA is the security mechanism, when the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER
request from the UE, the P-CSCF shall perform the procedures of subclause
5.2.2.2 with the following exception to items 2) and 3):
2) in case the REGISTER request was received without integrity protection,
then:
a) check the existence of the Security-Client header field. If the Security-
Client header field is not present, then the P-CSCF shall return a suitable
4xx response. If the Security-Client header field is present the P-CSCF shall:
\- in case the UE indicated support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" then remove and store
it.
\- in case the UE does not indicate support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" then:
\- if the host portion of the sent-by field in the topmost Via header field
contains an IP address that differs from the source address of the IP packet,
silently drop the REGISTER;
\- otherwise continue with procedures as of subclause 5.2.2.
NOTE 1: If the UE does not indicate support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" and the P-CSCF
detects that the UE is located behind a NAT device, then the P-CSCF can just
drop the REGISTER to avoid unnecessary signalling traffic.
b) if the host portion of the sent-by field in the topmost Via header field
contains a FQDN, or if it contains an IP address that differs from the source
address of the IP packet, the P-CSCF shall:
\- add a \"received\" header field parameter in accordance with the procedure
defined in RFC 3581 [**56A**]. The P-CSCF shall also set the value of the
\"rport\" header field parameter to the source port of the requestin
accordance with the procedure defined in RFC 3581 [56A]; and
\- check that no any previously registered UE has either the same public IP
address (allocated by the NAT and indicated in the Via header field) and the
protected server port (specified in the Security-Client header field) or the
same public IP address and the protected client port (specified in the
Security-Client header field). If there is such UE, the P-CSCF shall return a
400 (Bad Request) response with 301 Warning header field indicating
\"incompatible network address format\" to the unprotected REGISTER request.
Otherwise, the P-CSCF shall forward the REGISTER request.
NOTE 2: If two UEs are behind the same NAT, the NAT may assign to them the
same public IP address (but different NAT\'s port). Hence, the two respective
UE must have different protected server port numbers, and different protected
client port numbers.
3) in case the REGISTER request was received integrity protected, then the
P-CSCF shall:
a) check the security association which protected the request. If the security
association is a temporary one, the P-CSCF shall:
\- in case the host parameter in the Contact address is in the form of a FQDN,
ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the
IP address bound to the security association;
\- in case the P-CSCF has detected earlier that the UE is located behind a
NAT, retrieve port_Uenc from the encapsulating UDP header of the packet
received and complete configuration of the temporary set of security
associations by configuring port_Uenc in each of the temporary security
associations;
\- check whether the request contains a Security-Verify header field in
addition to a Security-Client header field. If there are no such header
fields, then the P-CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx response. If there are
such header fields, then the P-CSCF shall compare the content of the Security-
Verify header field with the content of the Security-Server header field sent
earlier and the content of the Security-Client header field with the content
of the Security-Client header field received in the challenged REGISTER. If
those do not match, then there is a potential man-in-the-middle attack. The
request should be rejected by sending a suitable 4xx response. If the contents
match, the P-CSCF shall remove the Security-Verify and the Security-Client
header field;
b) if the security association the REGISTER request was received on, is an
already established one, then the P-CSCF shall:
\- remove the Security-Verify header field if it is present;
\- check if the Security-Client header field containing new parameter values
is present, and:
\- if this header field or any required parameter is missing, then the P-CSCF
shall return a suitable 4xx response.
\- if this header field and the required parameters are present, then the
P-CSCF shall check that no any previously registered UE has the same public IP
address and the protected client port (specified in the Security-Client header
field). If there is such UE, the P-CSCF shall return a 400 (Bad Request)
response with 301 Warning header field indicating \"incompatible network
address format\" to the REGISTER request. Otherwise, the P-CSCF shall remove
and store the Security-Client header field before forwarding the request to
the S-CSCF;
NOTE 3: When sending the protected REGISTER request to the P-CSCF, the UE will
not modify the protected server port value, since the protected server port
value stays fixed for a UE until all public user identities of the UE have
been de-registered.
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to an unprotected
REGISTER request and this response contains a \"received\" header field
parameter and \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header field
associated with the UE and the UE indicated support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" IPsec
mode, the P-CSCF shall:
1) delete any temporary set of security associations established towards the
UE;
2) remove the \"ck\" and \"ik\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameters
contained in the 401 (Unauthorized) response and bind the values to the proper
private user identity and to the temporary set of security associations which
will be setup as a result of this challenge. The P-CSCF shall forward the 401
(Unauthorized) response to the UE if and only if the \"ck\" and \"ik\" header
field parameters have been removed;
3) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF security list and the parameters needed for the security association
setup, as specified in Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall
support the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48].
The P-CSCF shall support the IPSec layer algorithms for integrity protection
and for encryption as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall
indicate \"UDP-enc-tun\" as the only IPsec mode;
4) set up the temporary set of security associations with a temporary SIP
level lifetime between the UE and the P-CSCF for the user identified with the
private user identity. The P-CSCF shall select UDP encapsulated tunnel mode
and shall leave the value for port-Uenc unspecified in each of the temporary
security associations. For further details see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC
3329 [48]. The P-CSCF shall set the temporary SIP level lifetime for the
temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;
and
5) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response unprotected to the UE using the
mechanisms described in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3581 [56A], i.e. in case UDP is
used as transport protocol the P-CSCF shall send the response to the IP
address indicated in the \"received\" header field parameter and to the port
indicated in the \"rport\" header field parameter of the Via header field
associated with the UE. In case UDP is used as transport protocol, the P-CSCF
shall use the IP address and the port on which the REGISTER request was
received as source IP address and the source port when sending the response
back to the UE.
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a protected REGISTER
request and that REGISTER request was protected by an old set of security
associations that use UDP encapsulated tunnel mode, the P-CSCF shall:
1) delete any temporary set of security associations established towards the
UE;
2) remove the \"ck\" and \"ik\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameters
contained in the 401 (Unauthorized) response and bind the values to the proper
private user identity and to the temporary set of security associations which
will be setup as a result of this challenge. The P-CSCF shall forward the 401
(Unauthorized) response to the UE if and only if the \"ck\" and \"ik\" header
field parameters have been removed;
3) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF security list and the parameters needed for the security association
setup, as specified in Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall
support the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48].
The P-CSCF shall support the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity protection
and encryption as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall indicate
\"UDP-enc-tun\" as the IPsec mode;
4) set up the temporary set of security associations with a temporary SIP
level lifetime between the UE and the P-CSCF for the user identified with the
private user identity. The P-CSCF shall select UDP encapsulated tunnel mode
and shall specify the same port_Uenc that was used in the old set of security
associations. The P-CSCF shall set the temporary SIP level lifetime for the
temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;
and
5) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE using the old set of
security associations.
Otherwise, when the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to an
unprotected REGISTER request and this response does not contain a \"received\"
header field parameter and \"rport\" header field parameter or when the P-CSCF
receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a protected REGISTER request and
that REGISTER request was protected by an old set of security associations
that do not use UDP encapsulated tunnel mode, the P-CSCF shall proceed as
described in subclause 5.2.2.2.
## F.2.3 S-CSCF usage of SIP
### F.2.3.1 S-CSCF usage of SIP
#### F.2.3.1.1 Protected REGISTER with IMS AKA as a security mechanism
The procedures at the S-CSCF described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2 apply.
NOTE: When two UEs that are behind the same NAT register their contact
addresses, the NAT may assign to them the same public IP address (but
different NAT\'s ports). If these two UEs select the same protected server
port number, and register via different P-CSCFs, then they will have the same
contact addresses (i.e. same IP address and protected server port). However,
any request targeted to either UE will be sent to the respective P-CSCF, hence
not causing any ambiguity at the P-CSCF when forwarding the request via NAT.
# F.3 Application usage of SDP
## F.3.1 UE usage of SDP
The procedures as of subclause 6.1 apply.
# F.3.2 P-CSCF usage of SDP
## F.3.2.1 Introduction
Subclause F.3.2 describes the SDP related procedures performed by the P-CSCF
in support of hosted NAT.
### F.3.2.2 Receipt of an SDP offer
When the P-CSCF receives an SDP offer during session establishment, if this
offer comes from a UE located behind a hosted NAT, the P-CSCF shall modify the
SDP offer by replacing the IP address(es) and port number previously set in
the SDP offer by the IP address(es) and port number(s) received from the IMS
access gateway over the Iq interface.
### F.3.2.3 Receipt of an SDP answer
When the P-CSCF receives any SDP answer to an SDP offer described in subclause
F.3.2.2, if this answer comes from a UE located behind a hosted NAT, the
P-CSCF shall modify the SDP answer by replacing the IP address(es) and port
number previously set in the SDP answer by the IP address(es) and port
number(s) received from the IMS access gateway over the Iq interface.
### F.3.2.4 Change of media connection data
After the session is established, it is possible for both ends of the session
to change the media connection data for the session. When the P-CSCF receives
a SDP offer/answer coming from a UE located behind a hosted NAT with port
number(s) or IP address(es) included, there are three different possibilities:
\- IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been added. In this case, the
P-CSCF shall apply the procedures as described in subclause F.3.2.2 and
subclause F.3.2.3 as appropriate for those additional IP address(es) or/and
port number(s);
\- IP address(es) and port number(s) have been reassigned to the end points.
In this case, the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures as described in subclause
F.3.2.2 and subclause F.3.2.3 as appropriate for those reassigned IP
address(es) and port number(s);
NOTE: If necessary, the P-CSCF or IBCF will cause the IMS access gateway to
release the resources related to the previously assigned IP address(es) and
port number(s).
\- no change has been made to the IP address(es) and port number(s). The
P-CSCF shall apply procedures described in subclause F.3.2.2 using the
previously stored IP address(es) and port number(s).
# F.4 P-CSCF usage of SIP in case UDP encapsulated IPsec is not employed
## F.4.1 Introduction
The subclause F.4 describes the SIP procedures for supporting hosted NAT
scenarios in case UDP encapsulated IPsec is not employed. In these scenarios
the procedures for NAT traversal must take into account that all SIP requests
and responses are not protected by an IPsec security association. This
subclause also assumes that the UE transmits the SIP messages from the same IP
address and port on which the UE expects to receive SIP messages. In addition,
the procedures described in the present clause apply when the registration
procedure as described in RFC 5626 [92] is not employed.
## F.4.2 Registration
The procedures described in subclause 5.2.2 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present clause.
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, the P-CSCF shall add
the \"received\" header field parameter to the Via header field set to the
source IP address of the packet header in accordance with the procedure
defined in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3581 [56A]. The P-CSCF shall also set the
value of the \"rport\" header field parameter to the source port of the
request, in accordance with the procedure defined in RFC 3581 [56A].
When the P-CSCF detects that the UE is behind a NAT, and the UE has indicated
support of the keep-alive mechanism defined in RFC 6223 [143], the P-CSCF
shall indicate to the UE that it supports the keep-alive mechanism.
If, upon receiving a REGISTER request from an unregistered user and the P-CSCF
discovers that the UE is behind a NAT, the P-CSCF performs the following
actions on the Contact header field depending on its content:
\- if the Contact header field contains a contact address in the form of an IP
address (NOTE), the P-CSCF shall save (for the duration of the registration)
this IP address (i.e. the private IP address of the UE) and associated port
number (i.e. the private port of the UE) and bind them to the source IP
address (i.e. the public IP address of the NAT) and the source port number
(i.e. the port number of the NAT) of the IP packet that contained the REGISTER
request and forward the REGISTER request;
\- if the Contact header field contains more than one contact addresses in the
form of an IP address, the P-CSCF shall apply the above procedure to one of
those contact addresses by choosing the one with the highest qvalue parameter)
and delete any other contact addresses containing an IP address. If the P-CSCF
was unable to choose a contact address based on the qvalue, the P-CSCF shall
choose one based on local policy and delete any other contact addresses
containing an IP address.
NOTE: When the host parameter in the Contact address is in the form of a FQDN,
the P-CSCF will resolve the given FQDN (by DNS lookup) to the IP address of
the UE. When including the FQDN in the Contact header field the UE insures
that the FQDN resolves to the IP address that the UE uses to send the REGISTER
request.
When the P-CSCF received a response to the above request, the P-CSCF shall
forward the response to the UE using the mechanisms described in RFC 3581
[56A]. In case UDP is used, the P-CSCF shall send the response to the IP
address indicated in the \"received\" header field parameter and to the port
indicated in the \"rport\" header field parameter of the Via header field in
the response. If the REGISTER request received from the UE was received over a
TCP connection, the P-CSCF shall send the response to the UE over the same TCP
connection over which the request was received. The P-CSCF shall transmit the
IP packet (containing the response) from the same IP address and port on which
the REGISTER request was received.
## F.4.3 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method
### F.4.3.1 Introduction
The procedures described in subclause 5.2.6 apply with the additional
procedures described in subclause F.4.3.
### F.4.3.2 Request initiated by the UE
When the P-CSCF receives, from the UE that is behind a NAT, an initial request
for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the P-CSCF shall:
a) set the value of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header
field to the source port of the received IP packet that contained the request,
and insert the \"received\" header field parameter in the Via header field
containing the source IP address of the received IP packet (that contained the
request), as defined in RFC-3581 [56A];
b) if the request is a dialog-forming request that was received over UDP, bind
the source IP address (i.e. the public IP address of the NAT) and associated
source port number (i.e. the port number of the NAT) of the received IP packet
(that contained the initial dialog-forming request) to:
\- the IP address (i.e. the private IP address of the UE) and associated port
number (i.e. the private port of the UE) contained in the Contact header field
of the received dialog-forming request, if the Contact header field contained
an IP address and associated port number, and save the binding; or
\- the saved IP address (i.e. the private IP address of the UE) and associated
port number (i.e. the private port of the UE) contained in the Contact header
field of the REGISTER request, if the Contact header field of the received
dialog-forming request contained a GRUU, and save the binding; and
c) if the dialog-forming request was received over TCP connection, keep this
TCP connection up during the entire duration of the dialog;
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the P-CSCF receives a response to the above request, the P-CSCF shall
forward the response to the UE using the mechanisms described in RFC 3581
[56A]. In case UDP is used, the P-CSCF shall send the response to the IP
address indicated in the \"received\" header field parameter and to the port
indicated in the \"rport\" header field parameter of the Via header field of
the response. If the dialog-forming request received from the UE was received
over the TCP connection, the P-CSCF shall send the response to the UE over the
same TCP connection over which the dialog-forming request was received. The
P-CSCF shall transmit the IP packet (containing the response) from the same IP
address and port on which the initial dialog-forming request was received.
For all subsequent requests belonging to the dialog, received from the UE, the
P-CSCF shall insert the \"received\" header field parameter and set the value
of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header field as defined in
RFC 3581 [56A] and forward the request as described in RFC 3261 [26]. For all
subsequent responses belonging to the dialog, destined or the UE, the P-CSCF
shall forward the responses using the \"received\" header field parameter and
set the value of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header field
of the response as defined in RFC 3581 [56A].
For all subsequent requests belonging to the dialog and destined for the UE
(that contains the private IP address and associated private port number in
the Request-URI), the P-CSCF shall send the requests to the UE either:
\- over the TCP connection that was established when the initial INVITE
request was received; or
\- use UDP. When sending the request using UDP, the P-CSCF shall insert the
request in an IP packet, and send the IP packet to the saved IP address (i.e.
the public IP address of the NAT) and associated port number (i.e. the port
number of the NAT). The P-CSCF shall transmit the IP packet (containing the
request) from the same IP address and port on which the REGISTER request was
received.
NOTE: When inserting its SIP URI in the Record-Route header field of the
dialog-forming request received from the UE, the P-CSCF may include a pointer
in the user part of its SIP URI that points to the saved binding used to route
the in-dialog requests to the UE. The Route header field of the in-dialog
requests will contain the respective pointer in the user part of the P-CSCF's
SIP URI.
### F.4.3.3 Request terminated by the UE
When the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction destined for the UE (it contains the private IP address
and associated private port number in the Request-URI), the P-CSCF shall send
the requests to the UE either:
\- over the TCP connection, if available (e.g. TCP connection was established
during the registration procedure); or
\- use UDP. When sending the request using UDP, the P-CSCF shall insert the
request in an IP packet, and send the IP packet to the saved IP address (i.e.
the public IP address of the NAT) and associated port number (i.e. the port
number of the NAT) that is bound to the private IP address and associated
private port number indicated in the Request-URI and save during the
registration procedure. The P-CSCF shall transmit the IP packet (containing
the request) from the same IP address and port on which the REGISTER request
was received.
For all subsequent requests belonging to the dialog that are received from the
UE, the P-CSCF shall insert the \"received\" header field parameter and set
the value of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via header field as
defined in RFC 3581 [56A] and forward the request as described in RFC 3261
[26]. For all subsequent responses belonging to the dialog, destined or the
UE, the P-CSCF shall forward the responses using the \"received\" header field
parameter and set the value of the \"rport\" header field parameter in the Via
header field of the response as defined in RFC 3581 [56A].
For all subsequent requests belonging to the dialog and destined for the UE
(that contains the private IP address and associated private port number in
the Request-URI), the P-CSCF shall send the requests to the UE either:
\- over the TCP connection, if available; or
\- use UDP. When sending the request using UDP, the P-CSCF shall insert the
request in an IP packet, and send the IP packet to the saved IP address (i.e.
the public IP address of the NAT) and associated port number (i.e. the port
number of the NAT). The P-CSCF shall transmit the IP packet (containing the
request) from the same IP address and port on which the REGISTER request was
received.
NOTE: When inserting its SIP URI in the Record-Route header field in a
response to the dialog-forming request received from the UE, the P-CSCF may
include a pointer in the user part of its SIP URI that points to the saved
binding used to route the in-dialog requests to the UE. The Route header field
of the in-dialog requests will contain the respective pointer in the user part
of the P-CSCF's SIP URI.
# F.5 NAT traversal for media flows
To allow the IMS access gateway to perform address latching, for a given UDP-
based media stream, the UE shall use the same port number for sending and
receiving packets.
To allow early media flows, the UE shall send keepalive messages for each UDP-
based media stream as soon as an SDP offer or answer is received in order to
allow the IMS access gateway to perform address latching before the call is
established.
To keep NAT bindings and firewall pinholes open for the UDP-based media
streams, and enable the IMS access gateway to perform address latching, the UE
shall send keepalive messages for each media stream as defined in subclause
K.5.2.1.
###### ## Annex G (normative): Additional procedures in support of NA(P)T and
NA(P)T-PT controlled by the P-CSCF
NOTE: This subclause describes the mechanism for support of NA(P)T and
NA(P)T-PT controlled by the P-CSCF scenario defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7].
This does not preclude other mechanisms but they are out of the scope of this
annex.
# G.1 Scope
This annex describes the P-CSCF procedures for supporting the scenario where
IP address and/or port conversions occur at the IMS access gateway level in
the media path between the UE and the backbone. Two types of address
conversions are covered:
IP version interworking (NA(P)T-PT); and;
IP address/port translation (NA(P)T).
The annex assumes that signalling procedure take place over the Iq interface
to enable the P-CSCF to request and retrieve the address bindings reserved in
the transport plane.
# G.2 P-CSCF usage of SDP
## G.2.1 Introduction
The subclause G.2 describes the P-CSCF procedures for supporting IP address
and/or port conversions in SDP that occur in the media path between the UE and
the backbone.
NOTE: In the particular case of RTP flows, port conversions also apply to the
associated RTCP flows.
## G.2.2 Receipt of an SDP offer
When the P-CSCF receives any SDP offer during session establishment, the
P-CSCF shall modify the SDP offer by replacing the IP address(es) and port
number previously set in the SDP offer by the IP address(es) and port
number(s) received from the IMS access gateway over the Iq interface.
## G.2.3 Receipt of an SDP answer
When the P-CSCF receives any SDP answer to an SDP offer described in subclause
G.2.3, the P-CSCF shall modify the SDP answer by replacing the IP address(es)
and port number previously set in the SDP answer by the IP address(es) and
port number(s) received from the IMS access gateway over the Iq interface.
The P-CSCF may receive multiple provisional responses with an SDP answer due
to forking of a request before the first final answer is received. For each
SDP answer received in such subsequent provisional responses, the P-CSCF shall
apply the procedure in this subclause.
## G.2.4 Change of media connection data
After the session is established, it is possible for both ends of the session
to change the media connection data for the session. When the P-CSCF receives
a SDP offer/answer where port number(s) or IP address(es) is/are included,
there are three different possibilities:
IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been added. In this case, the P-CSCF
shall apply the procedures as described in subclause G.2.2 or subclause G.2.3
as appropriate for those additional IP address(es) or/and port number(s); or
IP address(es) and port number(s) have been reassigned to the end points. In
this case, the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures as described in subclause
G.2.2 or subclause G.2.3 as appropriate for those reassigned IP address(es)
and port number(s); or
NOTE: If necessary, the P-CSCF or IBCF will cause the IMS access gateway to
release the resources related to the previously assigned IP address(es) and
port number(s).
no change has been made to the IP address(es) and port number(s). The P-CSCF
shall apply procedures described in subclause G.2.2 using the previously
stored IP address(es) and port number(s).
###### ## Annex H (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using DOCSIS to access IM CN subsystem
# H.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is a DOCSIS cable access network.
DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a term referring
to the ITU-T Recommendation J112 [87] Annex B standard for cable modem
systems.
# H.2 DOCSIS aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
## H.2.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself, utilise
the services provided by the DOCSIS cable access network to provide packet-
mode communication between the UE and the IM CN subsystem.
From the perspective of the UE, the necessary IP-CAN bearer for signalling is
transparently available to the UE.
The UE is not directly involved in requests for IP-CAN bearer(s) for media
flow(s). The IM CN interacts with the PCRF in the DOCSIS IP-CAN to establish
IP-CAN bearer(s) for media flow(s), on behalf of the UE.
## H.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### H.2.2.1 Activation and P-CSCF discovery
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall perform a
Network Attachment procedure as defined in the CableLabs PacketCable
specifications PKT-TR-ARCH-FRM [88]. When using DOCSIS, both IPv4 and IPv6 UEs
may access the IM CN subsystem. The procedures for P-CSCF discovery defined in
subclause 9.2.1 of this document apply.
### H.2.2.1A Modification of IP-CAN used for SIP signalling
Not applicable.
### H.2.2.1B Re-establishment of the IP-CAN used for SIP signalling
Not applicable.
### H.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses the keep-alive
procedures described in RFC 6223 [143] for monitoring the P-CSCF status.
If the P-CSCF fails to respond to the keep-alive request the UE shall acquire
a new P-CSCF address using any of the methods described in the subclause
H.2.2.1 and perform an initial registartion as specified in subclause 5.1.
### H.2.2.2 Void
### H.2.2.3 Void
### H.2.2.4 Void
### H.2.2.5 Handling of the IP-CAN for media
#### H.2.2.5.1 General requirements
The UE does not directly request resources for media flow(s).
#### H.2.2.5.1A Activation or modification of IP-CAN for media by the UE
Not applicable.
#### H.2.2.5.1B Activation or modification of IP-CAN for media by the network
Not applicable.
#### H.2.2.5.2 Special requirements applying to forked responses
The UE does not directly request resources for media flow(s). As a result
there are no special UE requirements applying to forked responses.
#### H.2.2.5.3 Unsuccessful situations
Not applicable.
### H.2.2.6 Emergency service
If attached to network via DOCSIS access technology, the UE shall always
consider being attached to its home operator\'s network for the purpose of
emergency calls.
NOTE: In DOCSIS the UE is unable to receive any indication from the network,
that would allow the UE to determine, whether it is currently attached to its
home operator\'s network or to a different network, so the UE assumes itself
always attached to the home operator\'s network when connected via DOCSIS
access technology.
## H.2A Usage of SDP
## H.2A.0 General
Not applicable.
### H.2A.1 Impact on SDP offer / answer of activation or modification of IP-
CAN for media by the network
Not applicable.
### H.2A.2 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE when originating UE has
resources available and IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation
for terminating UE
Not applicable.
# H.3 Application usage of SIP
## H.3.1 Procedures at the UE
### H.3.1.1 P-Access-Network-Info header field
If the UE is aware of the access technology, the UE shall include the
P-Access-Network-Info header field where indicated in subclause 5.1.
### H.3.1.2 Availability for calls
Not applicable.
## H.3.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### H.3.2.1 Determining network to which the originating user is attached
If access type field in the P-Access-Network-Info header field indicated
DOCSIS access the P-CSCF shall assume that the initial request for a dialog or
standalone transaction or an unknown method destined for a PSAP is initiated
in the same country.
NOTE 1: If local policy does not require the insertion of P-Access-Network-
Info header field in the P-CSCF even if it is missing in the received initial
request, the P-CSCF can assume that the request is initiated by fixed
broadband UE in the same country.
NOTE 2: If the network provided and UE provided P-Access-Network-Info header
fields indicate different access types the P-CSCF ignores the information in
either the network provided or the UE provided P-Access-Network-Info header
field according to operator policy.
### H.3.2.2 Location information handling
Upon receipt of an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction or
an unknown method, the P-CSCF based on local policy may include a P-Access-
Network-Info header field.
NOTE: The way the P-CSCF deduces that the request comes from a UE connected
through DOCSIS access is implementation dependent.
## H.3.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
### H.3.3.1 Notification of AS about registration status
Not applicable.
# H.4 3GPP specific encoding for SIP header field extensions
Void.
# H.5 Use of circuit-switched domain
There is CS domain in this access technologyVoid.
###### ## Annex I (normative): Additional routeing capabilities in support of
transit and interconnection traffics in IM CN subsystem
# I.1 Scope
Additional routeing functionality is necessary for support of transit traffic
as operators may use the IM CN subsystem as a transit network to provide
transit functionality for their own CS networks, enterprise networks, or other
network operators. Additional routeing functionality is also necessary to
support other traffics such as roaming traffic and incoming traffic destined
to CSI UEs (Combining Circuit Switched (CS) and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)
services) traffics.
As specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7] additional routeing functions might reside
in a stand-alone entity or might be collocated with the functionality of an
MGCF, a BGCF, an I-CSCF, an S-CSCF, or an IBCF.
When colocated with an I-CSCF, the additional routeing capabilities may be
performed in advance of I-CSCF proecedures as specificed in subclause 5.3, or
after I-CSCF procedures have failed to identify an S-CSCF supporting the user
identified by the Request-URI.
When colocated with an MGCF, the generated requests can be routed to an I-CSCF
or to possible targets of the routeing procedures defined in subclause I.2.
The BGCF procedures specified in subclause 5.6 are a subset of the more
general routeing procedures provided in this annex.
NOTE: Depending on the host entity for the additional routeing functions, the
functionality can be accessed as:
a) the last set of functions on the host before forwarding a request (e.g., on
an MGCF, an S-CSCF or an IBCF);
b) the first set of functions performed by the host entity when receiving a
request at the host entity\'s entry point (e.g., on a BGCF, I-CSCF or IBCF);
c) a specified point in the logic of the host (e.g., on the I-CSCF at failure
to identify an S-CSCF for the Request-URI); or
d) a set of functions associated with a separate entry point (e.g., at a
separate entry point associated with a BGCF, I-CSCF, IBCF or separate
function).
# I.2 Procedures
The additional routeing functionality, or associated functional entity,
performing these additional routeing procedures should analyse the destination
address, and determine whether to route to another network, directly, or via
the IBCF, or to the BGCF, or the I-CSCF in its own network. This analysis may
use public (e.g., DNS, ENUM) and/or private database lookups, and/or locally
configured data and need not modify the Request-URI.
In addition, and based upon local policy, the analysis may include the carrier
identified by the \"cic\" tel-URI parameter of the Request-URI other
signalling information from the incoming request as part of the route
determination. Examples of other signalling information are: the content of
the P-Access-Network-Info header field, the value of the \"cpc\" tel URI
parameter of the P-Asserted-Identity header field, the value of the \"phone-
context\" Tel URI parameter of the Request-URI, the SDP content, the ICSI
values in the Contact header field and the content of the P-Asserted-Service
header field.
For all SIP transactions identified:
\- if priority is supported, as containing an authorised Resource-Priority
header field, or, if such an option is supported, relating to a dialog which
previously contained an authorised Resource-Priority header field;
the additional routeing functionality shall give priority over other
transactions or dialogs. This allows special treatment of such transactions or
dialogs.
NOTE 1: The special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
When provided as a separate function, the network element performing these
functions need not Record-Route the INVITE request.
If the additional routeing functionality inserts its own Record-Route header
field, then the additional routeing functionality may require the periodic
refreshment of the session to avoid hung states. If the network element
requires the session to be refreshed, the additional routeing functionality
shall apply the procedures described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 2: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When provided as a separate function, the network element performing these
functions shall not apply the procedures of RFC 3323 [33] relating to privacy.
If overlap signalling using the multiple-INVITE method is supported as a
network option, several INVITE requests with the same Call ID and same From
header field (including \"tag\" header field parameter) can be received
outside of an existing dialog. Such INVITE requests relate to the same call
and the additional routeing function shall route such INVITE request received
during a certain period of timeto the same next hop.
###### ## Annex J (normative): Void
###### ## Annex K (normative): Additional procedures in support of UE managed
NAT traversal
# K.1 Scope
This annex describes the UE, P-CSCF, and S-CSCF procedures in support of UE
managed NAT traversal. For ICE, the IBCF procedures are also described. In
this scenario, both the media flows and the SIP signalling both traverse a
NA(P)T device located in the customer premises domain. The term \"hosted NAT\"
is used to address this function. This annex does not consider the case where
the NAT is behind the P-CSCF as different NAT traversal procedures are
necessary for this architectural scenario.
The procedures described in this subclause of this annex rely on the UE to
manage the NAT traversal process. As part of the UE management process, the UE
can learn whether it is behind a NAT or not, and choose whether the
proceedures in this annex are applied or not.
The protection of SIP messages is provided by applying either UDP
encapsulation to IPSec packets in accordance with RFC 3948 [63A] and as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] or by utilizing TLS as defined in 3GPP TS
33.203 [19].
NOTE 1: This annex describes the mechanism for support of UE managed NAT
traversal scenario defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7]. This does not preclude other
mechanisms but they are out of the scope of this annex.
NOTE 2: It is recognized that outbound can be useful for capabilities beyond
NAT traversal (e.g. multiple registrations) however this annex does not
consider such capabilities at this time. Such capabilites can require
additional information elements in the REGISTER request so that the P-CSCF and
S-CSCF can distinguish whether to apply procedures as of annex F or annex K.
# K.2 Application usage of SIP
## K.2.1 Procedures at the UE
### K.2.1.1 General
This subclause describes the UE SIP procedures for supporting a UE managed
hosted NAT traversal approach. The description enhances the procedures
specified in subclause 5.1.
### K.2.1.2 Registration and authentication
#### K.2.1.2.1 General
The text in subclause 5.1.1.1 applies without changes.
#### K.2.1.2.1A Parameters contained in the ISIM
The text in subclause 5.1.1.1A applies without changes.
#### K.2.1.2.1B Parameters provisioned to a UE without ISIM or USIM
The text in subclause 5.1.1.1B applies without changes.
#### K.2.1.2.2 Initial registration
##### K.2.1.2.2.1 General
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.2.1 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
NOTE 1: In accordance with the definitions given in subclause 3.1 the IP
address acquired initially by the UE in a hosted NAT scenario is the UE
private IP address.
On sending a REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
indicated in subitems a) through j) of subclause 5.1.1.2 with the exceptions
of subitems c) and d) which are modified as follows.
The UE shall populate:
c) a Contact header field according to the following rules: the Contact header
field shall be set to include SIP URI(s) containing the private IP address or
FQDN of the UE in the hostport parameter. The UE shall also include an
instance ID (\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter) and \"reg-id\" header
field parameter as described in RFC 5626 [92]. The UE shall include all
supported ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840
[62] for the IMS communication services it intends to use, and IARI values
(coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), for theIMS applications it intends
to use in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3
and RFC 3840 [62];
d) a Via header field set to include the private IP address or FQDN of the UE
in the sent-by field. For TCP, the response is received on the TCP connection
on which the request was sent. For UDP, the UE shall include the \"rport\"
header field parameter as defined in RFC 3581 [56A].
NOTE 2: The UE will learn its public IP address from the \"received\" header
field parameter in the topmost Via header field in the 401 (Unauthorized)
response to the unprotected REGISTER request.
NOTE 3: If the UE specifies a FQDN in the hostport parameter in the Contact
header field and in the sent-by field in the Via header field of an
unprotected REGISTER request, this FQDN will not be subject to any processing
by the P-CSCF or other IMS entities.
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request is received with
integrity protection the UE shall behave as described in subclause K.2.1.2.5.
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request is received and this
response is received without integrity protection, the procedures described in
subclause 5.1.1.2 apply with the following additions:
The UE shall compare the values in the \"received\" header field parameter and
\"rport\" header field parameter with the corresponding values in the sent-by
parameter in the topmost Via header field to detect if the UE is behind a NAT.
If the comparison indicates that the respective values are the same, the UE
concludes that it is not behind a NAT.
\- if the UE is not behind a NAT the UE shall proceed with the procedures
described in subclause 5.1;
\- if the UE is behind a NAT the UE shall verify using the Security-Server
header field that either the mechanism-name \"tls\" or \"ipsec-3gpp\" and the
mode \"UDP-enc-tun\" is selected. If the verification succeeds the UE shall
behave as described in subclause K.2.1.2.5 and store the IP address contained
in the \"received\" header field parameter as the UE\'s public IP address. If
the verification does not succeed the UE shall abort the registration.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the procedures
described in subclause 5.1.1.2 apply with the following additions:
The UE shall determine the P-CSCFs ability to support the keep-alive
procedures as described in RFC 5626 [92] by checking whether the \"outbound\"
option-tag is present in the Require header field:
\- if no \"outbound\" option-tag is present, the UE may use some other
explicit indication in order to find out whether the P-CSCF supports the
outbound edge proxy functionality. Such indication may be acomplished either
through UE local configuration means or the UE can examine the 200 (OK)
response to its REGISTER request for Path header fields, and if such are
present check whether the bottommost Path header field contains the \"ob\" SIP
URI parameter. If the UE determines that the P-CSCF supports the outbound edge
proxy functionality, the UE can use the keep-alive techniques defined in
subclause K.2.1.5 and RFC 5626 [92] towards the P-CSCF; or
\- if an \"outbound\" option-tag is present, the UE shall initiate keep-alive
mechanisms as defined in subclause K.2.1.5 and RFC 5626 [92] towards the
P-CSCF.
NOTE 4: Presence of the \"outbound\" option-tag in the Require header field
indicates that both the P-CSCF and S-CSCF fully support the outbound
procedures. The number of subsequent outbound registrations for the same
private user identity but with a different reg-id value is based on operator
policy.
##### K.2.1.2.2.2 Initial registration using IMS AKA
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.2.2 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
On sending a REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
indicated in subclause 5.1.1.2.2 with the exceptions of the subitems which are
modified as follows:
c) additionally for the Via header field, for UDP, if the REGISTER request is
protected by a security association, include the public IP address or FQDN and
the protected server port value in the sent-by field. For TCP, if the REGISTER
request is protected by a security association, the UE shall include the
public IP address or FQDN;
d) the Security-Client header field set to specify the security mechanisms the
UE supports, the IPsec layer algorithms the UE supports and the parameters
needed for the security association setup. The UE shall support the setup of
two pairs of security associations as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The
syntax of the parameters needed for the security association setup is
specified in annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE shall support the
\"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The UE shall
support the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and confidentiality
protection as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], and shall announce support for
them according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329 [48]. In addition to
transport mode, the UE shall support UDP encapsulated tunnel mode as per RFC
3948 [73A] and shall announce support for both modes as described in 3GPP TS
33.203 [19];
##### K.2.1.2.2.3 Initial registration using SIP digest without TLS
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.2.3 apply without modification.
##### K.2.1.2.2.4 Initial registration using SIP digest with TLS
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.2.4 apply without modification.
##### K.2.1.2.2.5 Initial registration using NASS-IMS bundled authentication
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.2.5 apply without modification.
#### K.2.1.2.3 Initial subscription to the registration-state event package
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.3 apply with the additional
procedures described in subclause K.2.1.4.1.
#### K.2.1.2.4 User-initiated re-registration
##### K.2.1.2.4.1 General
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.4 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
On sending a REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response, the
UE shall populate the header fields as indicated in subclause 5.1.1.4.1 with
the exception of subitems c) and d) which are modified as follows.
The UE shall populate:
c) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI(s) that contain(s) in the
hostport parameter the private IP address of the UE or FQDN, its instance ID
(\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter) along with the same \"reg-id\"
header field parameter used for the initial, successful, registration for the
given P-CSCF public identity combination as described in RFC 5626 [92]. The UE
shall include all supported ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause
7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2
and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS communication services it intends to use, and
IARI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), for the IMS
applications it intends to use in a g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as
defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3840 [62]; and
d) a Via header field according to the following rules:
\- For UDP, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN in the sent-by
field. The UE shall also include the \"rport\" header field parameter as
defined in RFC 3581 [56A]. The UE shall only use an FQDN, if it is ensured
that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT; or
\- For TCP, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN of the UE in
the sent-by field. The UE shall only use an FQDN, if it is ensured that the
FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT;
When the timer F expires at the UE, the UE shall:
1) stop processing of all ongoing dialogs and transactions associated with
that, if any (i.e. no further SIP signalling will be sent by the UE on behalf
of these transactions or dialogs); and
2) after releasing all IP-CAN bearers used for the transport of media
according to the procedures in subclause 9.2.2, the UE shall follow the
procedures in RFC 5626 [92] to form a new flow to replace the failed one. When
registering to create a new flow to replace the failed one, procedures in
subclause 5.1.1.2 apply.
NOTE: These actions may also be triggered as a result of the failure of a STUN
keep-alive. It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means than expiration of timer F, e.g., based on ICMP
messages.
If failed registration attempts occur in the process of creating a new flow,
the flow recovery procedures defined in RFC 5626 [92] shall apply.
##### K.2.1.2.4.2 IMS AKA as a security mechanism
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.4.2 apply without modification.
##### K.2.1.2.4.3 SIP Digest without TLS as a security mechanism
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.4.3 apply without modification.
##### K.2.1.2.4.4 SIP Digest with TLS as a security mechanism
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.4.4 apply without modification.
##### K.2.1.2.4.5 NASS-IMS bundled authentication as a security mechanism
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.4.5 apply without modification.
#### K.2.1.2.5 Authentication
##### K.2.1.2.5.1 IMS AKA -- general
The procedures of subclause 5.1.1.5.1 apply with the additional procedures
described in the present subclause.
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request and the
response is deemed to be valid and signalling security is to be used, the UE
shall behave as of subclause 5.1.1.5.1 with the exception of subitem 3) which
is modified as follows.
The UE shall:
3) send another REGISTER request using the temporary set of security
associations to protect the message. The header fields are populated as
defined for the initial registration (see subclause K.2.1.2.2), with the
addition that the UE shall include an Authorization header field containing
the private user identity and if the \"algorithm\" header field parameter is
\"AKAv1-MD5\", the authentication challenge response shall be calculated by
the UE using RES and other parameters, as described in RFC 3310 [49]. If the
\"algorithm\" header field parameter is \"MD5\", the UE shall calculate SIP
digest-response parameters as indicated in RFC 2617 [21] and shall build an
Authorization header field based on these parameters. The UE shall also insert
the Security-Client header field that is identical to the Security-Client
header field that was included in the previous REGISTER request (i.e. the
REGISTER request that was challenged with the received 401 (Unauthorized)
response). The UE shall also insert the Security-Verify header field into the
request, by mirroring in it the content of the Security-Server header field
received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response. The UE shall set the Call-ID of
the integrity-protected REGISTER request which carries the authentication
challenge response to the same value as the Call-ID of the 401 (Unauthorized)
response which carried the challenge.
For IPsec, if the 200 (OK) response is not received before the temporary SIP
level lifetime of the temporary set of security associations expires or a 403
(Forbidden) response is received, the UE shall consider the registration to
have failed. The UE shall delete the temporary set of security associations it
was trying to establish, and use the old set of security associations. The UE
should send an unprotected REGISTER request according to the procedure
specified in subclause K.2.1.2.2 if the UE considers the old set of security

On sending a REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
indicated in subclause 5.1.1.6.1 with the exception of subitems c) and d)
which are modified as follows.
The UE shall populate:
c) a Contact header field set to either the value of \"*\" or SIP URI(s) that
contain(s) in the hostport parameter the IP address of the UE or FQDN, its
instance ID (\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter) along with the same
\"reg-id\" header field parameter used for the initial, successful,
registration for the given P-CSCF public identity combination as described in
RFC 5626 [92];. The UE shall only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN
resolves to the public IP address of the NAT;
d) a Via header field according to the following rules:
\- For UDP, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN. The UE shall
also include the \"rport\" header field parameter as defined in RFC 3581
[56A]. The UE shall only use an FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves
to the public IP address of the NAT; or
\- For TCP, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN of the UE in
the sent-by field. The UE shall only use an FQDN, if it is ensured that the
FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT;
NOTE: In case of hosted NAT traversal only the UE public IP addresses are
bound to security associations or TLS session.

\"rejected\" or \"deactivated\"; or
\- the state attribute set to \"active\" and the state attribute within the
\ element belonging to this UE set to \"terminated\", and associated
event attribute element to \"rejected\" or \"deactivated\";
The UE shall remove all registration details relating to these public user
identities. In case of a \"deactivated\" event attribute, the UE shall start
the initial registration procedure as described in subclause K.2.1.2.2. In
case of a \"rejected\" event attribute, the UE shall release all dialogs
related to those public user identities.
### K.2.1.3 Subscription and notification

### K.2.1.4 Generic procedures applicable to all methods excluding the
REGISTER method
#### K.2.1.4.1 UE-originating case
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.2A.1 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the UE sends any request, the requirements in subclause 5.1.2A.1 are
extended by the following requirements. The UE shall include:
\- a Via header field according to the following rules:
\- For UDP, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN and the
protected server port value in the sent-by field. The UE shall also include
the \"rport\" header field parameter as defined in RFC 3581 [56A]. The UE
shall only use an FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to the public
IP address of the NAT; or
\- For TCP, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN of the UE in
the sent-by field. The UE shall only use an FQDN, if it is ensured that the
FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT; and
\- if the request contains a Contact header field, include a Contact header
field according to the following rules:
\- if this is a request for a new or existing dialog, and the UE did insert a
GRUU in the Contact header field, then the UE shall also include its instance
ID (\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter), and an \"ob\" SIP URI parameter
as described in RFC 5626 [92]; or
\- if this is a request for a new or existing dialog, and the UE did not
insert a GRUU in the Contact header field, then the UE shall include the
public IP address of the UE or FQDN and the protected server port value bound
to the security association or TLS session in the hostport parameter along
with its instance ID (\"+sip.instance\" header field parameter), and an \"ob\"
SIP URI parameter as described in RFC 5626 [92]. The UE shall only use a FQDN,
if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of the NAT.
NOTE: The means to ensure that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address of
the NAT are outside of the scope of this specification. One option for
resolving this is local configuration.
Where a security association or TLS session exists, the UE shall discard any
SIP response that is not protected by the security association or TLS session
and is received from the P-CSCF outside of the registration and authentication
procedures. The requirements on the UE within the registration and
authentication procedures are defined in subclause K.2.1.2.
When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H expires at
the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described in subclause
K.2.1.2.4.
#### K.2.1.4.2 UE-terminating case
The procedures described in subclause 5.1.2A.2 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the UE sends any response, the requirements in subclause 5.1.2A.2 are
extended by the following requirement. If the UE did not include a GRUU in the
Contact header field, then the UE shall:
\- include the public IP address of the UE or FQDN and the protected server
port value bound to the security association or TLS session in the hostport
parameter in any Contact header field that is otherwise included. The UE shall
only use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to the public IP
address of the NAT.
The UE shall discard any SIP request that is not integrity protected and is
received from the P-CSCF outside of the registration and authentication
procedures. The requirements on the UE within the registration and
authentication procedures are defined in subclause K.2.1.2.
### K.2.1.5 Maintaining flows and detecting flow failures
STUN Binding Requests are used by the UE as a keep-alive mechanism to maintain
NAT bindings for signalling flows over connectionless transport (for dialogs
outside a registration as well as within a registration) as well as to
determine whether a flow (as described in RFC 5626 [92]) is still valid (e.g.
a NAT reboot could cause the transport parameters to change). As such, the UE
acts as a STUN client and shall follow the requirements defined by RFC 5389
[100]. Further, when using UDP encapsulated IPsec, the keep-alive capabilities
defined within should not be used.
CRLF as defined in RFC 5626 [92] is used by the UE as a keep-alive mechanism
to maintain NAT bindings for signalling flows over connection oriented
transports (for dialogs outside a registration as well as within a
registration) as well as to determine whether a flow (as described in RFC 5626
[92]) is still valid (e.g. a NAT reboot could cause the transport parameters
to change). As such, the UE shall follow the requirements defined by RFC 5626
[92].
If the UE determines that the flow to a given P-CSCF is no longer valid (the
UE does not receive a STUN reply (or CRLF) or the reply indicates a new public
IP Address) the UE shall consider the flow and any associated security
associations invalid and perform the initial registration procedures defined
in subclause K.2.1.2.2.
When a NAT is not present, it may not be desirable to send keep-alive requests
(i.e. given battery considerations for wireless UEs). As such, if a UE can
reliably determine that a NAT is not present (i.e. by comparing the
\"received\" and \"rport\" header field parameters in the Via header field in
the response to the initial un-protected REGISTER request with the locally
assigned IP Address and Port) then the UE may not perform the keep-alive
procedures.
### K.2.1.6 Emergency services
#### K.2.1.6.1 General
In addition to the procedures in subclause 5.1.6.1, the following additional
procedures apply. When receiving and sending requests unprotected, the UE
shall transmit and receive all SIP messages using the same IP port.
#### K.2.1.6.2 Initial emergency registration

## K.2.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### K.2.2.1 Introduction
This subclause describes the SIP procedures for supporting hosted NAT
scenarios.
The description enhances the procedures specified in subclause 5.2.
### K.2.2.2 Registration
#### K.2.2.2.1 General
The procedures described in subclause 5.2.2.1 apply without changes.
#### K.2.2.2.2 IMS AKA as a security mechanism
The procedures described in subclause 5.2.2.2 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, the P-CSCF shall
behave as in subclause 5.2.2.2 with the exception of subitems 2) and 3) which
are is modified as follows.
2) in case the REGISTER request was received without protection, then:
a) check the existence of the Security-Client header field. If the Security-
Client header field is not present and signalling security is used, then the
P-CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx response. If the Security-Client header
field is present the P-CSCF shall:
\- in case the UE indicated support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" then remove and store
it; or
\- in case the UE does not indicate support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" then:
\- if the host portion of the sent-by field in the topmost Via header field
contains an IP address that differs from the source address of the IP packet,
silently drop the REGISTER request;
\- otherwise continue with procedures as of subclause 5.2.2.2;
NOTE 2: If the UE does not indicate support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" and the P-CSCF
detects that the UE is located behind a NAT device, then the P-CSCF can just
drop the REGISTER request to avoid unnecessary signalling traffic.
3) in case the REGISTER request was received integrity protected, then the
P-CSCF shall:
a) check the security association which protected the request. If IPsec is
used and the security association is a temporary one the P-CSCF shall:
\- in case the hostport parameter in the Contact address is in the form of a
FQDN, ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to
the IP address bound to the security association;
\- in case the P-CSCF has detected earlier that the UE is located behind a NAT
and IPsec is being used, retrieve port_Uenc from the encapsulating UDP header
of the packet received and complete configuration of the temporary set of
security associations by configuring port_Uenc in each of the temporary
security associations;
\- check whether the request contains a Security-Verify header field in
addition to a Security-Client header field. If there are no such header
fields, then the P-CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx response. If there are
such header fields, then the P-CSCF shall compare the content of the Security-
Verify header field with the content of the Security-Server header field sent
earlier and the content of the Security-Client header field with the content
of the Security-Client header field received in the challenged REGISTER
request. If those do not match, then there is a potential man-in-the-middle
attack. The request should be rejected by sending a suitable 4xx response. If
the contents match, the P-CSCF shall remove the Security-Verify and the
Security-Client header field;
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to an unprotected
REGISTER request and the P-CSCF previously determined that the UE is behind a
NAT and the UE indicated support for \"UDP-enc-tun\" IPsec mode, the P-CSCF
shall:
1) delete any temporary set of security associations established towards the
UE;
2) for IPsec, remove the \"ck\" and \"ik\" WWW-Authenticate header field
parameters contained in the 401 (Unauthorized) response and bind the values to
the proper private user identity and to the temporary set of security
associations which will be setup as a result of this challenge. The P-CSCF
shall forward the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE if and only if the
\"ck\" and \"ik\" header field parameters have been removed;
3) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF security list and the parameters needed.The P-CSCF shall support the
setup of two pairs of security associations, as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203
[19]. The syntax of the parameters needed of the IPsec security association
setup is specified in annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall support
the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The
P-CSCF shall support the IPSec layer algorithms for integrity protection and
for encryption as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall indicate
\"UDP-enc-tun\" as the only IPsec mode.
4) set up the temporary set of security associations with a temporary SIP
level lifetime between the UE and the P-CSCF for the user identified with the
private user identity. The P-CSCF shall select UDP encapsulated tunnel mode
and shall leave the value for port-Uenc unspecified in each of the temporary
security associations. For further details see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC
3329 [48]. The P-CSCF shall set the temporary SIP level lifetime for the
temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;
and
5) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response unprotected to the UE using the
mechanisms described in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3581 [56A], i.e. the P-CSCF
shall send the response to the IP address indicated in the \"received\" header
field parameter and, in case UDP is used, to the port indicated in the
\"rport\" header field parameter (if present) of the Via header field
associated with the UE. In case TCP is used as transport protocol, the P-CSCF
shall use the port on which the REGISTER request was received as client port
for sending the response back to the UE.
When the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a protected REGISTER
request and the P-CSCF previously determined that the UE is behind a NAT and
that REGISTER request was protected by an old set of security associations
that use UDP encapsulated tunnel mode, the P-CSCF shall:
1) delete any temporary set of security associations established towards the
UE;
2) remove the \"ck\" and \"ik\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameters
contained in the 401 (Unauthorized) response and bind the values to the proper
private user identity and to the temporary set of security associations which
will be setup as a result of this challenge. The P-CSCF shall forward the 401
(Unauthorized) response to the UE if and only if the \"ck\" and \"ik\" header
field parameters have been removed;
3) insert a Security-Server header field in the response, containing the
P-CSCF security list and the parameters needed for the security association
setup, as specified in Annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall
support the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48].
The P-CSCF shall support the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity protection
and encryption as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P-CSCF shall indicate
\"UDP-enc-tun\" as the IPsec mode;
4) set up the temporary set of security associations with a temporary SIP
level lifetime between the UE and the P-CSCF for the user identified with the
private user identity. The P-CSCF shall select UDP encapsulated tunnel mode
and shall specify the same port_Uenc that was used in the old set of security
associations. The P-CSCF shall set the temporary SIP level lifetime for the
temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;
and
5) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE using the old set of
security associations and using the rules for sending responses as described
in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3581 [56A], i.e. the P-CSCF shall send the response
to the IP address indicated in the \"received\" header field parameter and to
the port indicated in the \"rport\" header field parameter (if present) of the
Via header field associated with the UE. Otherwise, when the P-CSCF receives a
401 (Unauthorized) response to an unprotected REGISTER request and this
response does not contain a \"received\" header field parameter and \"rport\"
header field parameter or when the P-CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized)
response to a protected REGISTER request and that REGISTER request was
protected by an old set of security associations that do not use UDP
encapsulated tunnel mode, the P-CSCF shall proceed as described in subclause
5.2.2.2 of the main body of this specification.
#### K.2.2.2.3 SIP digest without TLS as a security mechanism

When the P-CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog or a
request for a standalone transaction, the requirements are extended by the
following requirements.
Before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26], the P-CSCF shall ensure that
all signalling during the lifetime of the dialogue is sent over the same IMS
flow set as the dialogue initiating request.
NOTE: The suggested way to ensure all signalling is sent over the same IMS
flow set is to form an IMS flow token in the same way that a P-CSCF would form
this for the Path header field and insert this IMS flow token in the user
portion of the URI used in the record route header field value.

subclause 5.2.6.3.3, subclause 5.2.6.3.7, subclause 5.2.6.3.11, subclause
5.2.7.2 and subclause K.2.2.3.1, as appropriate. An additional sub-service
type can be added if information on the type of emergency service is known.
The entry in the Request-URI that the P-CSCF includes may either be:
\- as received from the UE in the Request-URI in accordance with RFC 5031
[69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE.
#### K.2.2.5.4 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method -- non-emergency registration
The procedures described in subclause 5.2.10.4 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause.
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog, or a
standalone transaction, or an unknown method, the following requirements are
extended:
1) include in the Request-URI an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN
with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69], if
necessary, and execute the procedure described in step 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, in
subclause 5.2.6.3.3, subclause 5.2.6.3.7, subclause 5.2.6.3.11 subclause
5.2.7.2 and subclause K.2.2.3.1, as appropriate. An additional sub-service
type can be added if information on the type of emergency service is known.
The entry in the Request-URI that the P-CSCF includes may either be:
\- as received from the UE in the Request-URI in accordance with RFC 5031
[69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE; and
#### K.2.2.5.5 Abnormal cases
The text in subclause 5.2.10.5 applies without changes.
## K.2.3 Void
## K.2.4 Void
# K.3 Application usage of SDP
## K.3.1 UE usage of SDP
The procedures as of subclause 6.1 apply.
## K.3.2 P-CSCF usage of SDP
### K.3.2.1 Introduction
Subclauses K.3.2.2 through K.3.2.4 describe the SDP related procedures
performed by the P-CSCF in support of hosted NAT.
### K.3.2.2 Receipt of an SDP offer
When the P-CSCF receives an SDP offer during session establishment, if this
offer comes from a UE which does not support the procedures defined in
subclause K.5.2.1 and is located behind a hosted NAT, the P-CSCF shall modify
the SDP offer by replacing the IP Address(es) and port number(s) received in
the SDP offer by the IP address(es) and port number(s) received from the IMS
access gateway over the Iq interface.
NOTE: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE supports the ICE procedures covered
in section K.5.2.1 by the presence of a=candidate attributes in the SDP.
When the P-CSCF receives an SDP offer during session establishment, if this
offer comes from a UE which does support the procedures defined in subclause
K.5.2.1 and is located behind a hosted NAT, the P-CSCF may choose to modify
the SDP offer by replacing the IP Address(es) and port number(s) received in
the SDP offer by the IP address(es) and port number(s) received from the IMS
access gateway over the Iq interface.
### K.3.2.3 Receipt of an SDP answer
When the P-CSCF receives any SDP answer to an SDP offer described in subclause
K.5.2.1, if this answer comes from a UE which does not support the procedures
defined in subclause K.5.2.2 and is located behind a hosted NAT, the P-CSCF
shall modify the SDP answer by replacing the IP address(es) and port number(s)
received in the SDP answer by the IP address(es) and port number(s) received
from the IMS access gateway over the Iq interface.
NOTE: The P-CSCF can determine if the UE supports the ICE procedures covered
in subclause K.5.2.1 by the presence of a=candidate attributes in the SDP.
When the P-CSCF receives any SDP answer to an SDP offer described in subclause
K.5.2.1, if this answer comes from a UE which does support the procedures
defined in subclause K.5.2.2 and is located behind a hosted NAT, the P-CSCF
may choose to modify the SDP answer by replacing the IP address(es) and port
number(s) received in the SDP answer by the IP address(es) and port number(s)
received from the IMS access gateway over the Iq interface.
### K.3.2.4 Change of media connection data
After the session is established, it is possible for both ends of the session
to change the media connection data for the session. When the P-CSCF receives
a SDP offer/answer coming from a UE located behind a hosted NAT with port
number(s) or IP address(es) included, there are three different possibilities:
\- IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been added. In this case, the
P-CSCF shall apply the procedures as described in subclause K.3.2.2 and
subclause K.3.2.3 as appropriate for those additional IP address(es) or/and
port number(s);
\- IP address(es) and port number(s) have been reassigned to the end points.
In this case, the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures as described in subclause
K.3.2.2 and subclause K.3.2.3 as appropriate for those reassigned IP
address(es) and port number(s);
NOTE: If necessary, the P-CSCF or IBCF will cause the IMS access gateway to
release the resources related to the previously assigned IP address(es) and
port number(s).
\- no change has been made to the IP address(es) and port number(s). The
P-CSCF shall apply procedures described in subclause K.3.2.2 using the
previously stored IP address(es) and port number(s).
# K.4 Void
# K.5 Application usage of ICE
## K.5.1 Introduction
The following subclauses describe the usage of the Interactive Connectivity
Establishment (ICE) procedures as documented in RFC 5245 [99]
## K.5.2 UE usage of ICE
### K.5.2.1 General
NAT bindings also need to be kept alive for media. RFC 5245 [99] provides
requirements for STUN based keepalive mechanisms. UEs that do not implement
the ICE procedures as defined in RFC 5245 [99] should implement the keepalive
procedures defined in RFC 5245 [99]. In the case where keepalives are required
and the other end does not support ICE (such that STUN cannot be used for a
keepalive) or the UE can not discover STUN or TURN servers to gather
candidates, the UE shall send an empty (no payload) RTP packet with a payload
type of 20 as a keepalive as long as the other end has not negotiated the use
of this value. If this value has already been negotiated, then some other
unused static payload type from table 5 of RFC 3551 [55A] shall be used. When
sending an empty RTP packet, the UE shall continue using the sequence number
(SSRC) and timestamp as the negotiated RTP steam.
### K.5.2.2 Call initiation -- UE-origination case
The UE should support the agent requirements for ICE as defined by RFC 5245
[99] when sending the initial INVITE request. RFC 5245 [99] provides
procedures for:
1) Gathering candidate addresses for RTP and RTCP prior to sending the INVITE;
2) Encoding the candidate addresses in the SDP that is included with the
INVITE;
3) Acting as a STUN server to receive binding requests from the remote client
when it does connectivity checks;
4) Performing connectivity checks on received candidate addresses for RTP and
RTCP;
5) Determining and possibly selecting a better active address based on the
requirements in RFC 5245 [99];
6) Subsequent offer/answer exchanges; and
7) Sending media.
When supporting the ICE procedures, the UE shall also support the STUN agent
requirements as described in RFC 5389 [100] in order to gather STUN addresses,
the TURN client requirements as described in RFC 5766 [101] in order to gather
TURN Server addresses and the STUN Server requirements defined in RFC 5245
[99] as well as the requirements for STUN Servers defined in RFC 5389 [100]
for responding to connectivity checks.
RFC 5245 [99] provides an algorithm for determining the priority of a
particular candidate. The following additional requirements are provided to
the UE:
1) The type preference assigned for each type of candidate from least to
highest should be: Relayed Transport Address, STUN address, local address; and
2) If the UE has a dual IPv4/IPv6 stack, IPv6 addresses may be assigned a
higher local preference than IPv4 addresses based on the operator\'s policy.
RFC 5245 [99] provides guidance on choosing the in-use candidate and
recommends that a UE choose relayed candidates as the in-use address. The
following additional requirements are provided to the UE:
1) If a TURN server is available, the Relayed Transport Address should be used
as the initial active transport address (i.e. as advertised in the m/c lines
of the SDP); and
2) If a TURN server is not available, an address obtained via STUN should be
used as the initial active transport address.
Regardless of whether the UE supports the above procedures, the UE shall, upon
receipt of an SDP answer with candidate addresses, perform connectivity checks
on the candidate addresses as described in RFC 5245 [99]. In order to perform
connectivity checks, the UE shall act as a STUN client as defined in RFC 5389
[100]. Further, the UE shall also follow the procedures in RFC 5245 [99] when
sending media.
### K.5.2.3 Call termination -- UE-termination case
The UE should support agent requirements for ICE as defined by RFC 5245 [99]
when receiving an initial INVITE request. RFC 5245 [99] provides procedures
for:
1) Gathering candidate addresses for RTP and RTCP prior to sending the answer
as described in RFC 5245 [99];
2) Encoding the candidate addresses in the SDP answer as described in RFC 5245
[99];
3) Acting as a STUN server to receive binding requests from the remote client
when it does connectivity checks;
4) Performing connectivity checks on received candidate addresses for RTP and
RTCP;
5) Determining and possibly selecting a better active address based on the
requirements in RFC 5245 [99];
6) Subsequent offer/answer exchanges; and
7) Sending media.
When supporting the ICE procedures, the UE shall also support the STUN agent
requirements as described in RFC 5389 [100] in order to gather STUN addresses,
the TURN client requirements as described in RFC 5766 [101] in order to gather
TURN Server addresses and the STUN Server requirements defined in RFC 5245
[99] as well as the requirements for STUN Servers defined in RFC 5389 [100]
for responding to connectivity checks.
RFC 5245 [99] provides an algorithm for determining the priority of a given
candidate. The additional requirements for the UE:
1) The priority of candidate addresses from least to highest should be:
Relayed Transport Address, STUN address, local address; and
2) If the UE has a dual IPv4/IPv6 stack, IPv6 addresses MAY be placed at a
higher priority than IPV4 addresses based on the operator\'s policy.
RFC 5245 [99] provides guidance on choosing the in-use candidate and
recommends that a UE choose relayed candidates as the in-use address. The
following additional requirements are provided to the UE:
1) If a TURN server is available, the Relayed Transport Address should be used
as the initial active transport address (i.e. as advertised in the m/c lines
of the SDP); and
2) If a TURN server is not available, an address obtained via STUN should be
used as the initial active transport address.
Regardless of whether the UE supports the above procedures, the UE shall, upon
receipt of an SDP offer with candidate addresses, perform connectivity checks
on the candidate addresses as described in RFC 5245 [99]. In order to perform
connectivity checks, the UE shall act as a STUN client as defined in RFC 5389
[100]. Further, the UE shall also follow the procedures in RFC 5245 [99] when
sending media.
When receiving an SDP offer which does not indicate support for ICE, the UE
aborts the ICE procedures and reverts to RFC 3264 [27B] offer/answer
procedures; per RFC 5245 [99]. However, if the terminating UE is behind a
NA(P)T device this may result in the inability to pass media for the session
as the terminating UE will respond with its locally assigned IP address which
is unreachable. In order to ensure successful media exchange, the terminating
UE shall provide either a STUN derived IP address and port or a TURN provided
IP address and port in the m/c lines of the SDP answer. If the provided
address and port is a TURN address and port, the policy charging and control
framework will be unable to establish proper filter criteria as the address is
that of the TURN server and not that of the UE or NAT in front of the UE; see
RFC 5245 [99] subclause B.3 for further details. To rectify this issue, the
terminating UE shall also include a candidate attribute as described in RFC
5245 [99] identifying the server reflexive IP address and port (i.e. the IP
address and port on the public side of the NAT) used when a TURN provided
address and port is provided in the m/c line of the SDP answer.
## K.5.3 P-CSCF support of ICE
### K.5.3.1 General
This subclause describes procedures of a P-CSCF to support ICE RFC 5245 [99].
If no IMS access gateway is inserted, a P-CSCF may transparently pass ICE
related SDP attibutes to support ICE. The remaining procedures in subclause
K.5.3 are only applicable if the P-CSCF is inserting an IMS access gateway on
the media plane.
When the P-CSCFwith attached IMS access gateway receives SDP candidate
information from the offerer the P-CSCF shall not forward the candidate
information towards the answerer. When the P-CSCF receives SDP candidate
information from the answerer the P-CSCF shall not forward the candidate
information towards the offerer. The remaining procedures in subclause K.5.3.1
are optional.
NOTE 1: An P-CSCF that removes and/or does not provide ICE related SDP
attributes (e.g. a=candidate) in the offer/answer exchange will cause the ICE
procedures to be aborted and the address and port information in the m and c
lines of the SDP offer will be used. If this address and port information
contains the relayed candidate address of a STUN Relay server, as recommended
by ICE, then an extra media relay server will be used for the session which is
not necessary nor desirable.
The P-CSCF with attached IMS access gateway performs separate ICE procedures
towards the offerer and the answerer. The usage of ICE is negotiated
separately with the offerer and answerer, and ICE may be applied independently
at either side. Furthermore, the P-CSCF may be configured to apply ICE
procedures only towards one network side, e.g. towards the IM CN subsystem it
belongs to.
NOTE 2: Since the P-CSCF is inserting an IMS access gateway, it can choose to
provide the NAT traversal mechanism defined in Annex F towards the UE. In such
case the P-CSCF will not provide ICE support towards the UE, but the P-CSCF
can still provide ICE support towards the core network in scenarios where ICE
is used in the core network, e.g. to support NAT traversal for other access
networks with no deploied IMS access gateways.
Since the P-CSCF is not located behind a NAT, it does not request the IMS
access gateway to generate keep-alive messages even when acting as a full ICE
entity. The P-CSCF only requests the IMS access gateway to terminate and
generate STUN messages used for the candidate selection procedures.
Since the P-CSCF is not located behind a NAT the P-CSCF shall only include
host candidates in SDP offers and answers generated by the P-CSCF.
### K.5.3.2 P-CSCF full ICE procedures for UDP based streams
#### K.5.3.2.1 General
This subclause describes the P-CSCF full ICE procedures for UDP based streams.
#### K.5.3.2.2 P-CSCF receiving SDP offer
When the P-CSCF receives an SDP offer including ICE candidate information, the
P-CSCF shall send the candidate information for each UDP based stream received
in the SDP offer towards the IMS access gateway. The P-CSCF shall request the
IMS access gateway to reserve media- and STUN resources towards the offerer,
based on the candidate information, in order to allow the IMS access gateway
to perform the necessary connectivity checks per the ICE procedures.
If the offerer is acting as an ICE controller entity the P-CSCF shall act as
an ICE controlled entity in the direction towards the offerer. If the offerer
is acting as an ICE controlled entity the P-CSCF shall act as an ICE
controller entity in the direction towards the offerer.
#### K.5.3.2.3 P-CSCF sending SDP offer
Prior to sending an SDP offer, the P-CSCF may choose to apply related ICE
procedues, e.g. if it expects to interact with terminals applying procedures
as described in subclause K.5.2, and if both the P-CSCF and IMS access gateway
also support ICE procedures. To invoking these ICE procedures, the P-CSCF
shall request the IMS access gateway to reserve media- and STUN resources
towards the answerer for each UDP based media stream and include a host
candidate attribute for each UDP based stream in the SDP offer, providing the
reserved address and port at the IMS access gateway as destination.
The P-CSCF shall always act as an ICE controller entity towards the answerer.
NOTE: The host candidate address included by the P-CSCF in the generated SDP
offer matches the c- and m line information for the associcated UDP stream in
the SDP offer.
#### K.5.3.2.4 P-CSCF receiving SDP answer
When the P-CSCF receives an SDP answer including ICE candidate information,
the P-CSCF shall send the candidate information for each UDP based stream
received in the SDP answer towards the IMS access gateway.
The P-CSCF shall request the IMS access gateway to perform ICE candidate
selection procedures towards the answerer. The P-CSCF shall request the IMS
access gateway to inform the P-CSCF, for each UDP stream, which candidate pair
has been selected towards the answerer, once the candidate selection procedure
towards the answerer has finished.
If the IMS access gateway indicates to the P-CSCF that, for at least one UDP
stream, the selected candidate pair does not match the c- and m- line address
information for the associated UDP stream, exchanged between the P-CSCF and
the answerer, and the P-CSCF acts an ICE controller entity towards the
answerer, the P-CSCF shall send a new offer towards the answerer in order to
allign the c- and m- lines address information with the chosen candidate pair
for the associated UDP stream.
#### K.5.3.2.5 P-CSCF sending SDP answer
When the P-CSCF generates an SDP answer for an offer that included ICE
candidate information, the P-CSCF shall request the IMS access gateway to
reserve media- and STUN resources towards the offerer for each UDP based media
stream and include an SDP host candidate attribute for each UDP based stream
in the SDP answer, providing the reserved address and port at the IMS access
gateway as destination.
The P-CSCF shall in the generated SDP answer include host candidate
information which matches the c- and m line information for the associated UDP
stream in the SDP answer.
The P-CSCF shall request the IMS access gateway to perform ICE candidate
selection procedures towards the offerer. The P-CSCF shall request the IMS
access gateway to inform the P-CSCF, for each UDP stream, which candidate pair
has been selected towards the offerer, once the candidate selection procedure
towards the answerer has finished.
If the IMS access gateway indicates to the P-CSCF that the selected candidate
pair towards the offerer does not match the c- and m- line address information
for the associated UDP stream, exchanged between the P-CSCF and the offerer,
and the P-CSCF acts an ICE controller entity towards the offerer, the P-CSCF
shall send an offer towards the offerer (which will now act as an answerer) in
order to allign the c- and m- line address information with the chosen
candidate pair for the associated UDP stream.
### K.5.3.3 P-CSCF ICE lite procedures for UDP based streams
When the P-CSCF is using ICE lite procedures for UDP based streams, the P-CSCF
procedures are identical as described in subclause K.5.3.2, with the following
exceptions:
\- The P-CSCF always acts as an ICE controlled entity towards the offerer and
towards the answerer; and
\- The P-CSCF requests the IMS access gateway to perform ICE lite candidate
selection procedures, as defined in RFC 5245 [99].
### K.5.3.4 ICE procedures for TCP based streams
#### K.5.3.4.1 General
The P-CSCF shall terminate ICE procedures for TCP based streams. Instead the
P-CSCF will use the mechanism defined in RFC 4145 [83] for establishing TCP
based streams, as defined in RFC 6544 [131].
An entity that supports ICE continues the ICE procedures for UDP based
streams, even if no candidates are provided for TCP based streams.
NOTE: The P-CSCF ICE procedures for TCP based streams are identical no matter
whether the P-CSCF uses full ICE or ICE lite procedures for UDP based streams.
#### K.5.3.4.2 P-CSCF receiving SDP offer
When the P-CSCF receives an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall ignore the candidate
attributes for TCP based streams. The P-CSCF shall not send the candidate
information for TCP based streams towards the IMS access gateway.
#### K.5.3.4.3 P-CSCF sending SDP offer
When the P-CSCF generates an SDP offer the P-CSCF shall include an \"actpass\"
setup attribute, as defined in RFC 4145 [83], for each TCP based stream, which
will cause the answerer to initiate the TCP connections towards the IMS access
gateway. The P-CSCF shall not include any candidate attributes for TCP based
streams in the SDP offer.
##### K.5.3.4.4 P-CSCF receiving SDP answer
Since the P-CSCF does not include candidates in the SDP offer towards the
answerer, there are no ICE specific procedures when the P-CSCF receives an SDP
answer.
NOTE: If the SDP answer contains candidate attributes for TCP based streams,
the P-CSCF simply discards the candidate attributes.
#### K.5.3.4.5 P-CSCF sending SDP answer
When the P-CSCF generates an SDP answer the P-CSCF shall include a \"passive\"
setup attribute, as defined in RFC 4145 [83], for each TCP based stream, which
will cause the offerer to initiate the TCP connections towards the IMS access
gateway. The P-CSCF shall not include any candidate attributes for TCP based
streams in the SDP answer.
## K.5.4 ICE functionality in the IBCF
### K.5.4.1 General
This subclause describes procedures of an IBCF to support ICE (RFC 5245 [99]).
If no TrGW is inserted, an IBCF may transparently pass ICE related SDP
attibutes to support ICE. The remaining procedures in subclause K.5.4 are only
applicable if the IBCF is inserting a TrGW on the media plane.
When the IBCF with attached TrGW receives SDP candidate information from the
offerer the IBCF shall not forward the candidate information towards the
answerer. When the IBCF receives SDP candidate information from the answerer
the IBCF shall not forward the candidate information towards the offerer. The
remaining procedures in subclause K.5.4.1 are optional.
NOTE: An IBCF that removes and/or does not provide ICE related SDP attributes
(e.g. a=candidate) in the offer/answer exchange will cause the ICE procedures
to be aborted and the address and port information in the m and c lines of the
SDP offer will be used. If this address and port information contains the
relayed candidate address of a STUN Relay server, as recommended by ICE, then
an extra media relay server will be used for the session which is not
necessary nor desirable.
The IBCF with attached TrGW performs separate ICE procedures towards the
offerer and the answerer. The usage of ICE is negotiated separately with the
offerer and answerer, and ICE may be applied independently at either side.
Furthermore, the IBCF may be configured to apply ICE procedures only towards
one network side, e.g. towards the IM CN subsystem it belongs to.
Since the IBCF is not located behind a NAT, it does not request the TrGW to
generate keep-alive messages even when acting as a full ICE entity. The IBCF
only requests the TrGW to terminate and generate STUN messages used for the
candidate selection procedures.
Since the IBCF is not located behind a NAT the IBCF shall only include host
candidates in SDP offers and answers generated by the IBCF.
### K.5.4.2 IBCF full ICE procedures for UDP based streams
#### K.5.4.2.1 General
This subclause describes the IBCF full ICE procedures for UDP based streams.
#### K.5.4.2.2 IBCF receiving SDP offer
When the IBCF receives an SDP offer including ICE candidate information, the
IBCF shall send the candidate information for each UDP based stream received
in the SDP offer towards the TrGW. The IBCF shall request the TrGW to reserve
media- and STUN resources towards the offerer, based on the candidate
information, in order to allow the TrGW to perform the necessary connectivity
checks per the ICE procedures.
If the offerer is acting as an ICE controller entity the IBCF shall act as an
ICE controlled entity in the direction towards the offerer. If the offerer is
acting as an ICE controlled entity the IBCF shall act as an ICE controller
entity in the direction towards the offerer.
#### K.5.4.2.3 IBCF sending SDP offer
Prior to sending an SDP offer, the IBCF may choose to apply related ICE
procedues, e.g. if it expects to interact with terminals applying procedures
as described in subclause K.5.2, and if both the IBCF and TrGW also support
ICE procedures. To invoking these ICE procedures, the IBCF shall request the
TrGW to reserve media- and STUN resources towards the answerer for each UDP
based media stream and include a host candidate attribute for each UDP based
stream in the SDP offer, providing the reserved address and port at the TrGW
as destination.
The IBCF shall always act as an ICE controller entity towards the answerer.
NOTE: The host candidate address included by the IBCF in the generated SDP
offer matches the c- and m line information for the associcated UDP stream in
the SDP offer.
#### K.5.4.2.4 IBCF receiving SDP answer
When the IBCF receives an SDP answer including ICE candidate information, the
IBCF shall send the candidate information for each UDP based stream received
in the SDP answer towards the TrGW.
The IBCF shall request the TrGW to perform ICE candidate selection procedures
towards the answerer. The IBCF shall request the TrGW to inform the IBCF, for
each UDP stream, which candidate pair has been selected towards the answerer,
once the candidate selection procedure towards the answerer has finished.
If the TrGW indicates to the IBCF that, for at least one UDP stream, the
selected candidate pair does not match the c- and m- line address information
for the associated UDP stream, exchanged between the IBCF and the answerer,
and the IBCF acts an ICE controller entity towards the answerer, the IBCF
shall send a new offer towards the answerer in order to allign the c- and m-
lines address information with the chosen candidate pair for the associated
UDP stream.
#### K.5.4.2.5 IBCF sending SDP answer
When the IBCF generates an SDP answer for an offer that included ICE candidate
information, the IBCF shall request the TrGW to reserve media- and STUN
resources towards the offerer for each UDP based media stream and include an
SDP host candidate attribute for each UDP based stream in the SDP answer,
providing the reserved address and port at the TrGW as destination.
The IBCF shall in the generated SDP answer include host candidate information
which matches the c- and m line information for the associated UDP stream in
the SDP answer.
The IBCF shall request the TrGW to perform ICE candidate selection procedures
towards the offerer. The IBCF shall request the TrGW to inform the IBCF, for
each UDP stream, which candidate pair has been selected towards the offerer,
once the candidate selection procedure towards the answerer has finished.
If the TrGW indicates to the IBCF that the selected candidate pair towards the
offerer does not match the c- and m- line address information for the
associated UDP stream, exchanged between the IBCF and the offerer, and the
IBCF acts an ICE controller entity towards the offerer, the IBCF shall send an
offer towards the offerer (which will now act as an answerer) in order to
allign the c- and m- line address information with the chosen candidate pair
for the associated UDP stream.
### K.5.4.3 IBCF ICE lite procedures for UDP based streams
When the IBCF is using ICE lite procedures for UDP based streams, the IBCF
procedures are identical as described in subclause K.5.4.2, with the following
exceptions:
\- The IBCF always acts as an ICE controlled entity towards the offerer and
towards the answerer, and;
\- The IBCF requests the TrGW to perform ICE lite candidate selection
procedures, as defined in ICE
### K.5.4.4 ICE procedures for TCP based streams
#### K.5.4.4.1 General
The IBCF shall terminate ICE procedures for TCP based streams. Instead the
IBCF will use the mechanism defined in RFC 4145 [83] for establishing TCP
based streams, as defined in RFC 6544 [131].
An entity that supports ICE continues the ICE procedures for UDP based
streams, even if no candidates are provided for TCP based streams.
NOTE: The IBCF ICE procedures for TCP based streams are identical no matter
whether the IBCF uses full ICE- or ICE lite- procedures for UDP based streams.
#### K.5.4.4.2 IBCF receiving SDP offer
When the IBCF receives an SDP offer, the IBCF shall ignore the candidate
attributes for TCP based streams. The IBCF shall not send the candidate
information for TCP based streams towards the TrGW.
#### K.5.4.4.3 IBCF sending SDP offer
When the IBCF generates an SDP offer the IBCF shall include an \"actpass\"
setup attribute, as defined in RFC 4145 [83], for each TCP based stream, which
will cause the answerer to initiate the TCP connections towards the TrGW. The
IBCF shall not include any candidate attributes for TCP based streams in the
SDP offer.
#### K.5.4.4.4 IBCF receiving SDP answer
Since the IBCF does not include candidates in the SDP offer towards the
answerer, there are no ICE specific procedures when the IBCF receives an SDP
answer.
NOTE: If the SDP answer contains candidate attributes for TCP based streams,
the IBCF simply discards the candidate attributes.
#### K.5.4.4.5 IBCF sending SDP answer
When the IBCF generates an SDP answer the IBCF shall include a \"passive\"
setup attribute, as defined in RFC 4145 [83], for each TCP based stream, which
will cause the offerer to initiate the TCP connections towards the TrGW. The
IBCF shall not include any candidate attributes for TCP based streams in the
SDP answer.
###### ## Annex L (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using EPS to access IM CN subsystem
# L.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is Evolved Packet System (EPS).
The EPS IP-CAN has an EPS core network which can be supported by an E-UTRAN
radio access network.
# L.2 EPS aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem via E-UTRAN
## L.2.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself, utilise
the services provided by EPS to provide packet-mode communication between the
UE and the IM CN subsystem.
Requirements for the UE on the use of these packet-mode services are specified
in this clause. Requirements for the P-GW in support of this communication are
specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11], and 3GPP TS 29.212 [13B].
When using the EPS, each IP-CAN bearer is provided by an EPS bearer.
## L.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### L.2.2.1 EPS bearer context activation and P-CSCF discovery
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:
a) if not attached for EPS services yet, perform a EPS attach procedure as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J];
b) ensure that a EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling according to the
APN and P-GW selection criteria described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [7B], is
available. This EPS bearer context shall remain active throughout the period
the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem, i.e. from the initial registration
and at least until the deregistration. As a result, the EPS bearer context
provides the UE with information that makes the UE able to construct an IPv4
or an IPv6 address;
NOTE 3: The default EPS bearer context can also be used for SIP signalling as
well as any other EPS bearer context.
When the EPS bearer context establishment procedure for the SIP signalling is
initiated by the UE:
I. if a default EPS bearer context is not available with the selected P-GW,
the UE shall indicate to the network in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST that the
request is for SIP signalling. If the request is authorized, the network
establishes a bearer with the appropriate QCI as described in 3GPP TS 24.301
[8J]. The UE may also use this EPS bearer context for DNS and DHCP signalling;
II. if the default EPS bearer context is available with the selected P-GW, and
is to be used for SIP signalling no additional steps are needed;
III. if the default EPS bearer context is available with the selected P-GW and
an EPS bearer for SIP signalling with the correct QCI and TFT is to be
established, the UE shall indicate to the network, by setting the IM CN
Subsystem Signalling Flag in the Protocol Configuration Options information
element in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message, that the request is
for SIP signalling. If the request is authorized, the network either
establishes a new dedicated bearer or modifies an exisiting bearer with the
appropriate QCI and TFT as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J]. The general QoS
negotiation mechanism is described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J].
NOTE 2: An EPS bearer with a QCI value other than the one for signalling can
carry both IM CN subsystem signalling and media, in case the media does not
need to be authorized by Policy and Charging control mechanisms as defined in
3GPP TS 29.212 [13B] and the media stream is not mandated by the P-CSCF to be
carried in a separate EPS bearer.
c) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).
The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:
I. When using IPv4, employ the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) RFC
2132 [20F], the DHCPv4 options for SIP servers RFC 3361 [35A], and RFC 3263
[27A] as described in subclause 9.2.1. When using IPv6, employ Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) RFC 3315 [40], the DHCPv6 options for
SIP servers RFC 3319 [41] and DHCPv6 options for Domain Name Servers (DNS) RFC
3646 [56C] as described in subclause 9.2.1.
II. Transfer P-CSCF address(es) within the EPS bearer context activation
procedure.
The UE shall indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the network within
the Protocol Configuration Options information element of the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message.
If the network provides the UE with a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in
the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message or ACTIVATE DEDICATED
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall assume that the list is
prioritised with the first address within the Protocol Configuration Options
information element as the P-CSCF address with the highest priority.
III. The UE selects a P-CSCF from the list (see 3GPP TS 31.103 [15B]) stored
in the ISIM.
IV. The UE selects a P-CSCF from the list in IMS management object.
The UE shall use method IV to select a P-CSCF, if
\- a P-CSCF is to be discovered in the home network;
\- the UE is roaming; and
\- the IMS management object contains the P-CSCF list.
The UE shall use method III to select the P-CSCF, if:
\- a P-CSCF is to be discovered in the home network;
\- the UE is roaming;
\- either the UE does not contain the IMS management object, or the UE
contains the IMS management object but the IMS management object does not
contain the P-CSCF list; and
\- the ISIM residing in the UICC supports the P-CSCF list.
The UE can freely select method I or II for P-CSCF discovery, if:
\- the UE is in the home network; or
\- the UE is roaming and the P-CSCF is to be discovered in the visited
network.
In case method I is selected and several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs are
provided to the UE, the selection of P-CSCF address or FQDN shall be performed
as indicated in RFC 3361 [35A] when using IPv4 or RFC 3319 [41] when using
IPv6. If sufficient information for P-CSCF address selection is not available,
selection of the P-CSCF address by the UE is implementation specific.
NOTE 3: The UE decides whether the P-CSCF is to be discovered in the serving
network or in the home network based on local configuration, e.g. whether the
application on the UE is permitted to use local breakout.
If the UE is designed to use I above, but receives P-CSCF address(es)
according to II, then the UE shall either ignore the received address(es), or
use the address(es) in accordance with II, and not proceed with the DHCP
request according to I.
When using IPv4, the UE may request a DNS Server IPv4 address(es) via RFC 2132
[20F] or by the Protocol Configuration Options information element when
activating a EPS bearer context according to 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J].
When using IPv6, the UE may request a DNS Server IPv6 address(es) via RFC 3315
[40] and RFC 3646 [56C] or by the Protocol Configuration Options information
element when activating a EPS bearer context according to 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J].
The encoding of the request and response for IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) for DNS
server(s) and list of P-CSCF address(es) within the Protocol Configuration
Options information element is described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J].
### L.2.2.1A Modification of a EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling
The EPS bearer context shall not be modified from being used exclusively for
SIP signalling to a general purpose EPS bearer. After the establishment of an
EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling, the UE shall not set the IM CN
Subsystem Signalling Flag in the Protocol Configuration Options information
element of any subsequent BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message for
that APN. The UE shall ignore the IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag if received
from the network in the Protocol Configuration Options information element.
After the establishment of a EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling, the
UE shall not indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the network within
the Protocol Configuration Options information element of any subsequent
BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message for that APN. The UE shall ignore
P-CSCF address(es) if received from the network in the Protocol Configuration
Options information element.
### L.2.2.1B Re-establishment of the EPS bearer context for SIP signalling
If the UE registered a public user identity with an IP address allocated for
the APN of the EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling, the EPS bearer
context used for SIP signalling is deactivated as result of signalling from
the network and:
i) if the UE is required to perform an initial registration according to
subclause L.3.1.2;
ii) if the signalling from the network results in requiring the UE to initiate
activation of the PDN connection of the EPS bearer context used for SIP
signalling; or
iii) if the UE needs to continue having a public user identity registered with
an IP address allocated for the APN;
the UE shall:
A) if the non-access stratum is performing the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure and the EPS bearer context activation procedure(s) for the APN
triggered as result of the signalling from the network, wait until the UE
requested PDN connectivity procedure and the EPS bearer context activation
procedure(s) for the APN finish; and
B) perform the procedures in subclause L.2.2.1, bullets a), b) and c).
If none of the bullets i), ii) and iii) of this subclause evaluate to true, or
the procedures in bullet B) of this subclause were unable to ensure that the
EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling is available or were unable to
acquire any P-CSCF address(es):
1) if the SIP signalling was carried over a dedicated EPS bearer context, the
UE shall release all resources established as a result of SIP signalling by
sending to the network either:
a) a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, if there are EPS bearer
contexts to this PDN that are not related SIP sessions; or
b) a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message if all the EPS bearer contexts to this PDN
are related to SIP sessions.
NOTE: If the SIP signalling was carried over the default EPS bearer context,
all the resources established as a result of SIP signalling are released
without any explicit NAS signalling.
If the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection of the EPS bearer
context used for SIP signalling was deactivated at the start of this
subclause, and the procedures in bullet B) of this subclause ensured that the
EPS bearer context used for SIP signalling is available and acquired the
P-CSCF address(es), the UE shall perform a new initial registration according
to subclause 5.1.1.2.
### L.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses one of the following
methods to detect that a P-CSCF is not working any longer:
A if the UE used the Protocol Configuration Options to discover the P-CSCF
address at the EPS bearer context activation and if the UE receives an Modify
EPS Bearer Context Request message containing a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6
addresses that does not include the address of the currently used P-CSCF, then
the UE shall acquire the highest priority P-CSCF address in the list of P-CSCF
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in the Modify EPS Bearer Context Request message. The
UE shall assume that the list is prioritised with the first address within the
Protocol Configuration Options information element as the P-CSCF address with
the highest priority; and
B if the UE monitors the P-CSCF status by means of the procedures provided by
RFC 6223 [143] and if the P-CSCF fails to respond to a keep-alive request,
then the UE shall acquire a new P-CSCF address using one of the methods I, III
and IV for P-CSCF discovery described in the subclause L.2.2.1.
When a new P-CSCF address is acquired the UE shall perform an initial
registration as specified in subclause 5.1.
### L.2.2.2 Session management procedures
The existing procedures for session management as described in 3GPP TS 24.301
[8J] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### L.2.2.3 Mobility management procedures
The existing procedures for mobility management as described in 3GPP TS 24.301
[8J] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### L.2.2.4 Cell selection and lack of coverage
The existing mechanisms and criteria for cell selection as described in 3GPP
TS 36.304 [19B] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### L.2.2.5 EPS bearer contexts for media
#### L.2.2.5.1 General requirements
NOTE 1: In EPS, the UE cannot control whether media streams belonging to
different SIP sessions are established on the same EPS bearer context or not.
During establishment of a session, the UE establishes data streams(s) for
media related to the session. Such data stream(s) can result in activation of
additional EPS bearer context(s). Either the UE or the network can request for
resource allocations for media, but the establishment and modification of the
EPS bearer is controlled by the network as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J].
NOTE 2: When the UE wishes to allocate bandwidth for RTP and RTCP, the UE uses
the rules as those outlined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [13C].
If the resource allocation is initiated by the UE, the UE starts reserving
resources whenever it has sufficient information about the media streams, and
used codecs available as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J].
NOTE 3: If the resource reservation requests are initiated by the EPS IP CAN,
then the bearer establishment is initiated by the network after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
#### L.2.2.5.1A Activation or modification of EPS bearer contexts for media by
the UE
If the UE is configured not to initiate resource allocation for media
according to 3GPP TS 24.167 [8G], then the UE shall refrain from requesting
additional EPS bearer context(s) for media until the UE considers that the
network did not initiate resource allocation for the media.
#### L.2.2.5.1B Activation or modification of EPS bearer contexts for media by
the network
If the UE receives an activation request from the network for a EPS bearer
context which is associated with the EPS bearer context used for signalling,
the UE shall, based on the information contained in the Traffic Flow Template
information element, correlate the media EPS bearer context with a currently
ongoing SIP session establishment or SIP session modification.
If the UE receives a modification request from the network for a EPS bearer
context that is used for one or more media streams in an ongoing SIP session,
the UE shall:
1) modify the related EPS bearer context in accordance with the request
received from the network.
#### L.2.2.5.2 Special requirements applying to forked responses
Since the UE does not know that forking has occurred until a second,
provisional response arrives, the UE requests resource allocation as required
by the initial response received. If a subsequent provisional response is
received, different alternative actions may be performed depending on the
requirements in the SDP answer:
1) **the bearer requirements of the subsequent SDP can be accommodated by the
existing resources requested.** The UE performs no further resource requests.
2) **the subsequent SDP introduces different QoS requirements or additional IP
flows.** The UE requests further resource allocation according to subclause
L.2.2.5.1.
3) **the subsequent SDP introduces one or more additional IP flows.** The UE
requests further resource allocation according to subclause L.2.2.5.1.
NOTE: When several forked responses are received, the resources requested by
the UE are the \"logical OR\" of the resources indicated in the multiple
responses to avoid allocation of unnecessary resources. The UE does not
request more resources than proposed in the original INVITE request.
When a final answer is received for one of the early dialogues, the UE
proceeds to set up the SIP session. The UE shall release all the unneeded IP-
CAN resources. Therefore, upon the reception of the first final 200 (OK)
response for the INVITE request (in addition to the procedures defined in RFC
3261 [26] subclause 13.2.2.4), the UE shall:
1) in case resources were established or modified as a consequence of the
INVITE request and forked provisional responses that are not related to the
accepted 200 (OK) response, send release request to release the unneeded
resources.
#### L.2.2.5.3 Unsuccessful situations
One of the Rx and Gx interface related error codes can be received by the UE
in either the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REJECT message, or the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message.
If the UE receives a Rx and Gx interface related error code, the UE shall
either handle the resource reservation failure as described in subclause 6.1.1
or retransmit the message up to three times. The Rx and Gx interface related
error codes are further specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] and 3GPP TS 29.212
[13B].
### L.2.2.6 Emergency service
Emergency bearers are defined for use in emergency calls in EPS and core
network support of these bearers is indicated to the UE in NAS signalling.
Where the UE recognises that a call request is an emergency call and the core
network supports emergency bearers, the UE shall use these EPS bearer contexts
for both signalling and media for emergency calls made using the IM CN
subsystem.
Some jurisdictions allow emergency calls to be made when the UE does not
contain an ISIM or USIM, or where the credentials are not accepted.
Additionally where the UE is in state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE and EMM-
REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, a normal ATTACH has been attempted and it can also be
assumed that a registration in the IM CN subsystem will also fail. In such
cases, the procedures for emergency calls without registration apply, as
defined in subclause 5.1.6.8.2.
When activating a EPS bearer context to perform emergency registration, the UE
shall request a PDN connection for emergency bearer services as described in
3GPP TS 24.301 [8J]. The procedures for EPS bearer context activation and
P-CSCF discovery, as described in subclause L.2.2.1 of this specification
apply accordingly.
In order to find out whether the UE is attached to the home PLMN or to the
visited PLMN, the UE shall compare the MCC and MNC values derived from its
IMSI with the MCC and MNC of the PLMN the UE is attached to. If the MCC and
MNC of the PLMN the UE is attached to do not match with the MCC and MNC
derived from the IMSI, then for the purpose of emergency calls in the IM CN
subsystem the UE shall consider to be attached to a VPLMN.
NOTE 1: In this respect an equivalent HPLMN, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [4C]
will be considered as a visited network.
The type of emergency service for an emergency number is derived from the
settings of the emergency service category value (bits 1 to 5 of the emergency
service category value as specified in subclause 10.5.4.33 of 3GPP TS 24.008
[8]). Table L.2.2.6.1 below specifies mappings between a type of emergency
service and an emergency service URN. The UE shall use the mapping to match an
emergency service URN and a type of emergency service. If a dialled number is
an emergency number but does not map to a type of emergency service the
service URN shall be \"urn:service:sos\".
Table L.2.2.6.1: Mapping between type of emergency service and emergency
service URN
* * *
Type of emergency service Emergency service URN Police urn:service:sos.police
Ambulance urn:service:sos.ambulance Fire Brigade urn:service:sos.fire Marine
Guard urn:service:sos.marine Mountain Rescue urn:service:sos.mountain
* * *
If the IP-CAN did not provide a local emergency number that matches the
dialled number (see subclause 5.1.6.1) and multiple types of emergency service
can be derived for a dialled number from the information configured on the
USIM then:
\- if the UE is in the HPLMN, the UE shall map any one of these types of
emergency service to an emergency service URN as specified in table L.2.2.6.1;
and
\- if the UE is in the VPLMN, the UE shall select \"urn:service:sos\".
If the IP-CAN provided a local emergency number that matches the dialled
number (see subclause 5.1.6.1), and:
\- if the UE can derive one or more types of emergency service from the
information received from the IP-CAN for the dialled number and the UE cannot
derive types of emergency service from the information configured on the USIM
for the dialled number; or
\- if the UE is able to derive identical types of emergency service from both
the information received from the IP-CAN for the dialled number and from the
information configured on the USIM for the dialled number,
then the UE shall map any one of these emergency service types to an emergency
service URN as specified in table L.2.2.6.1.
NOTE 2: How the UE resolves clashes where an emergency number is associated
with one or more different types of emergency service configured in the USIM
and in information received from the access network, is implementation
dependent.
Upon reception of a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an INVITE request as
defined in subclause 5.1.3.1, if:
\- the 380 (Alternate Service) response contains a Contact header field;
\- the value of the Contact header field is a service URN; and
\- the service URN has a top-level service type of \"sos\";
then the UE determines that \"emergency service information is included\" as
described 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B], else the UE determines that \"emergency service
information\" as described 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] is not included.
If the \"emergency service information is included\" as described 3GPP TS
23.167 [4B]:
1) if the URN in the Contact header field matches an emergency service URN in
table L.2.2.6.1, then the type of emergency service is the value corresponding
to the matching entry in table L.2.2.6.1; and
2) if the URN in the Contact header field does not match any emergency service
URN in table L.2.2.6.1, then the type of emergency service is not identified.
NOTE 3: In bullet 2), the URN in the Contact header field either contains \"no
emergency subservice type\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] triggering an
emergency call, or contains an \"emergency subservice type that does not map
into an emergency service category for the CS domain\" as described in 3GPP TS
23.167 [4B] triggering a normal call when the dialled number is available or
triggering an emergency call when the dialled number is not available.
# L.2A Usage of SDP
## L.2A.0 General
NOTE: The UE constructs SDP based on the restrictions indicated in the IMSVoPS
indicator, if received in the EPS network feature support information element
(see 3GPP TS 24.301 [8J]). Regardless whether the IMSVoPS indicator indicating
voice is supported or not, m-lines can be set to \"audio\" and exclude voice
codecs from the SDP answer or SDP offer.
## L.2A.1 Impact on SDP offer / answer of activation or modification of EPS
bearer context for media by the network
If, due to the activation of EPS bearer context from the network the related
SDP media description needs to be changed, the UE shall update the related SDP
information by sending a new SDP offer within a SIP request, which is sent
over the existing SIP dialog,
If the UE receives a modification request from the network for a EPS bearer
context that is used for one or more media streams in an ongoing SIP session,
the UE shall:
1) if, due to the modification of the EPS bearer context, the related SDP
media description need to be changed, update the related SDP information by
sending a new SDP offer within a SIP request, that is sent over the existing
SIP dialog, and respond to the EPS bearer context modification request.
NOTE: The UE can decide to indicate additional media streams as well as
additional or different codecs in the SDP offer than those used in the already
ongoing session.
## L.2A.2 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE when originating UE has
resources available and IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation
for terminating UE
If the UE receives an SDP offer where the SDP offer includes all media streams
for which the originating side indicated its local preconditions as met, if
the precondition mechanism is supported by the terminating UE and the IP-CAN
performs network-initiated resource reservation for the terminating UE and the
available resources are not sufficient for the received offer, the terminating
UE shall indicate its local preconditions and provide the SDP answer to the
originating side without waiting for resource reservation.
NOTE: If the resource reservation is controlled by the EPS IP-CAN, the
resource reservation request is initiated by the network after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
# L.3 Application usage of SIP
## L.3.1 Procedures at the UE
### L.3.1.1 P-Access-Network-Info header field
The UE shall always include the P-Access-Network-Info header field where
indicated in subclause 5.1.
### L.3.1.2 Availability for calls
A UE shall perform an initial registration as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2,
if all the following conditions are met:
1) if the UE is operating in one of the following modes of operation (see 3GPP
TS 24.301 [8J]):
a) PS mode 1;
b) CS/PS mode 1 and the UE is attached for EPS-Services only;
2) if the UE is capable of receiving any (but not necessarily all) of the
media types which the CS domain supports, such that the media type can also be
used when accessing the IM CN subsystem using the current IP-CAN;
3) if the media type of item 2 is an \"audio\" media type, and the UE supports
codecs suitable for (conversational) speech;
4) if the UE determines that its contact has not been bound to a public user
identity using the IP-CAN, such that the contact is expected to be used for
the delivery of incoming requests in the IM CN subsystem relating to the media
of item 2 and item 3;
5) if the **IMSVoPS** indicator, provided by the lower layers (see 3GPP TS
24.301 [8J]), indicates voice is supported; and
6) if the procedures to perform the initial registration are enabled (see 3GPP
TS 24.305 [8T]).
NOTE: Regardless of any of the above conditions, a UE might attempt to
register with the IM CN subsystem at any time.
The UE indicates to the non-access stratum the status of being available for
voice over PS when:
I) the UE is capable of receiving any (but not necessarily all) of the media
types which the CS domain supports, such that the media type can also be used
when accessing the IM CN subsystem using the current IP-CAN;
II) if the media type of item I is an \"audio\" media type, and the UE
supports codecs suitable for (conversational) speech; and
III) the UE determines a contact has been bound to a public user identity
using the IP-CAN, such that this contact is expected to be used for the
delivery of incoming requests in the IM CN subsystem relating to such media.
The UE indicates to the non-access stratum the status of being not available
for voice over PS when:
I) in response to receiving the **IMSVoPS** indicator indicating voice is
supported, the UE:
\- initiated an initial registration as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2,
received a final response to the REGISTER request sent, but the conditions for
indicating the status of being available for voice over PS are not met; or
\- did not initiate an initial registration as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2
and, these conditions for indicating the status of being available for voice
over PS are not met; or
II) the conditions for indicating the status of being available for voice over
PS are no longer met.
## L.3.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### L.3.2.1 Determining network to which the originating user is attached
If the P-CSCF is configured to handle emergency requests, in order to
determine from which network the request was originated the P-CSCF shall check
the MCC and MNC fields received in the P-Access-Network-Info header field.
NOTE: The above check can be against more than one MNC code stored in the
P-CSCF.
### L.3.2.2 Location information handling
Void.
### L.3.2.3 Prohibited usage of PDN connection for emergency bearer services
If the P-CSCF detects that a UE uses a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services for a non-emergency REGISTER request, the P-CSCF shall reject that
request by a 403 (Forbidden) response.
## L.3.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
### L.3.3.1 Notification of AS about registration status
Not applicable.
# L.4 3GPP specific encoding for SIP header field extensions
## L.4.1 Void
# L.5 Use of circuit-switched domain
There is no CS domain in this access technology.
###### ## Annex M (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem to access IM CN
subsystem
# M.1 Scope
This annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for call control protocol for
use in the IM CN subsystem based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and
the associated Session Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is the
cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem. It also defines procedures for invoking CS
domain services.
# M.2 cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem aspects when connected to the IM CN
subsystem
## M.2.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself, utilise
the services provided by the cdma2000^Â®^ packet data subsystem to provide
packet-mode communication between the UE and the IM CN subsystem.
Requirements for the UE on the use of these packet-mode services are specified
in this subclause. Requirements for the IP-CAN bearer control point (i.e. the
point where the UE has attached itself to the cdma2000^Â®^ packet data
subsystem) support of this communication are specified in 3GPP2 X.S0011-C
[127].
## M.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### M.2.2.1 Establishment of IP-CAN bearer and P-CSCF discovery
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:
a) establish a connection with the cdma2000^Â®^ wireless IP network specified
in 3GPP2 X.S0011-C [127]. Upon establishment a connection with the cdma2000^Â®^
wireless IP network, the UE can have an IPv4 address only, an IPv6 address
only, or both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses simultaneously;
b) ensure that an IP-CAN bearer used for SIP signalling is available. This IP-
CAN bearer shall remain active throughout the period the UE is connected to
the IM CN subsystem, i.e. from the initial registration and at least until the
last deregistration.
The UE shall choose one of the following options when performing establishment
of this IP-CAN bearer:
I. A dedicated IP-CAN bearer for SIP signalling:
The UE shall indicate to the IP-CAN bearer control point that this is an IP-
CAN bearer intended to carry IM CN subsystem-related signalling only. The UE
may also use this IP-CAN bearer for DNS and DHCP access.
II. A general-purpose IP-CAN bearer:
The UE may decide to use a general-purpose IP-CAN bearer to carry IM CN
subsystem-related signalling. The UE may carry both signalling and media on
the general-purpose IP-CAN bearer;
c) discover a P-CSCF.
The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:
I. Use DHCP mechanism
II Retrieve the list of P-CSCF address(es) stored in the IMC
III Obtain the list of P-CSCF address(es) from the IMS management object
The UE can freely select method I, II, or III for P-CSCF discovery. If DHCP is
used, the following procedures apply:
Upon establishing an IP-CAN bearer, the UE may use the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) specified in RFC 2131 [40A] or Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specified in RFC 3315 [40] to
discover the P-CSCF.
Prior to accessing the DHCP server, the UE will have obtained an IP address
via means other than DHCP and DHCPv6, see 3GPP2 X.S0011-C [127]. Hence, if the
UE uses DHCP or DHCPv6 for P-CSCF discovery, the UE shall only request the
configuration information from the DHCP server through a single request and
reply exchanged with the DHCP server.
If the UE uses DHCP for P-CSCF discovery and the UE is unaware of the address
of the DHCP server, the UE shall send the DHCPINFORM using the limited
broadcast IP address (i.e., 255.255.255.255) and UDP port 67. If the UE knows
the IP address of the DHCP server, the UE shall send the DHCPINFORM to the
DHCP server's unicast IP address and UDP port 67. The DHCP server shall send
the DHCPACK on the IP address specified in the Client IP Address field of the
DHCPINFORM. The DHCP server may include, in the DHCPACK, the SIP Server DHCP
Option specified in RFC 3361 [35A], which carries either a list of IPv4
address(es) of the P-CSCF(s) or a list of DNS fully qualified domain name(s)
that can be mapped to one or more P-CSCF(s). If the UE uses DHCPv6 for P-CSCF
discovery and the UE is unaware of the address of the DHCP Server, the UE
shall send an Information Request using the IPv6 multicast address FF02::1:2
and the UDP port 547. If the UE knows the IP address of the DHCPv6 server, the
UE shall send the Information Request message to the DHCPv6 server's unicast
IP address and UDP port 547. In the Information Request, the UE may request
either one or both the SIP Servers Domain Name List option and the SIP Servers
IPv6 Address List option specified in RFC 3319 [41]. The DHCP server shall
send the Reply to the IP address specified in the Information Request. The
DHCP server may include in the Reply either one or both the SIP Servers Domain
Name List option and the SIP Servers IPv6 Address List option, as requested by
the UE.
In case several P-CSCF\'s IP addresses or domain names are provided to the UE,
the UE shall perform P-CSCF selection according to RFC 3361 [35A] or RFC 3319
[41]. The UE shall perform the procedure for the resolution of domain name
according to RFC 3263 [27A].
### M.2.2.1A Modification of IP-CAN used for SIP signalling
Not applicable.
### M.2.2.1B Re-establishment of the IP-CAN used for SIP signalling
Not applicable.
### M.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses the keep-alive
procedures described in RFC 6223 [143] for monitoring the P-CSCF status.
If the P-CSCF fails to respond to the keep-alive request the UE shall acquire
a new P-CSCF address using any of the methods described in the subclause
M.2.2.1 and perform an initial registartion as specified in subclause 5.1.
### M.2.2.2 Void
### M.2.2.3 IP-CAN bearer control point support of DHCP based P-CSCF discovery
The IP-CAN bearer control point, or Home Agent in case of Mobile IP with
reverse tunneling, may forward the packet to one or more local DHCP servers,
or relay the packet to a specific DHCP server. The IP-CAN bearer control
point, or Home Agent in case of Mobile IP with reverse tunnelling, shall not
forward the DHCPINFORM (or Information-Request) to any UE.
NOTE 1: For forwarding the DHCPINFORM or Information-Request, the IP-CAN
bearer control point, or Home Agent in case of Mobile IP with reverse
tunnelling, does not change the destination IP address of the packet.
NOTE 2: For relaying the DHCPINFORM or Information-Request, the IP-CAN bearer
control point, or Home Agent in case of Mobile IP with reverse tunnelling
inserts a DHCP server's IP address in the destination IP address field of the
packet.

Not applicable.
#### M.2.2.5.3 Unsuccessful situations
Not applicable.
### M.2.2.6 Emergency service
When establishing an HRPD session to perform emergency registration, the UE
shall follow the procedures defined in 3GPP2 X.S0060 [86B].
To determine whether the HRPD UE is attached to the home network or to the
visited network, the UE shall compare the Carrier ID values obtained per 3GPP2
X.S0060 [86B]. If the Carrier ID of the network the UE is attached to does not
match with the provisioned Carrier ID, then for the purpose of emergency calls
in the IM CN subsystem the UE shall consider to be attached to a visited
network.
NOTE: For 3GPP2-1X and 3GPP2-UMB, no IP-CAN specific support is provided in
the current release. No carrier identification is provided for 3GPP2-1X or
3GPP2-UMB in the P-Access-Network-Info header field, and thus there is no IMS
specific procedure for identifying that the UE is in the home network.

Carrier ID field received in the P-Access-Network-Info header field to
determine from which network the request was originated.
NOTE: For 3GPP2-1X and 3GPP2-UMB, no IP-CAN specific support is provided in
the current release. No carrier identification is provided for 3GPP2-1X or
3GPP2-UMB in the P-Access-Network-Info header field, and thus there is no IMS
specific procedure for identifying that the UE is in the home network.
### M.3.2.2 Location information handling
Void
## M.3.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
### M.3.3.1 Notification of AS about registration status
The procedures described in subclause 5.4.1.7 apply with the additional
procedures described in the present subclause:
1) in case the received REGISTER request contained a Timestamp header field,
the S-CSCF shall insert a Timestamp header field with the value of the
Timestamp header field from the received REGISTER request.
# M.4 3GPP specific encoding for SIP header field extensions
## M.4.1 Void
# M.5 Use of circuit switched domain
When an emergency call is to be set up over the CS domain, the UE shall

###### ## Annex N (Normative): Functions to support overlap signalling
# N.1 Scope
This annex defines the procedures performed by network entities within the IM
CN subsystem to support overlap signalling.
The support of overlap signalling within the IM CN subsystem is optional, and
is depended on the network policy.
# N.2 Digit collection function
## N.2.1 General
The digit collection function is invoked if an entity requires additional
digits for a decision where to route a INVITE request.
NOTE 1: The digit collection function is only applicable for the in-dialog
method of overlap signalling. Further information about digit collection is
provided in subclause 4.9.3.3.
The digit collection function may interact with a routeing database, to reach
this decision. The digit collection function shall be performed by an entity
acting as a B2BUA. The digit collection function requires the ability to
recognise incomplete numbers. The digit collection function may be implemented
in different network nodes depending on the operator\'s deployment strategy
(e.g. AS, IBCF).
NOTE 2: An HSS does not support the recognition of incomplete numbers. A
routeing database being queried by ENUM also does not support the recognition
of incomplete numbers.
NOTE 3: A private routeing database to support the recognition of incomplete
numbers e.g. for transit calls or ported numbers can be used.
## N.2.2 Collection of digits
### N.2.2.1 Initial INVITE request
Upon receiving an initial INVITE request carrying an SDP offer, the digit
collection function shall:
1) if the request contains enough digits to forward the request, forward the
request towards it's destination;
2) if the digit collection function chooses to collect additional digits in
INFO requests, in order to forward the request, and the sender of the INVITE
request has indicated support of reliable responses, store the received digits
and send a reliable 183 (Session Progress) provisional response in order to
establish an early dialog with the sender of the INVITE request. The response
shall not contain an SDP answer; or
3) if it is determined that the en-bloc will not be able to forward the
request even if additional digits are received,, send a 404 (Not Found)
response.
Upon receiving an initial INVITE request without an SDP offer, the digit
collection function shall:
1) if the request contains enough digits to forward the request, forward the
request towards it's destination; or
2) send a 404 (Not Found) response.
NOTE 1: If the initial INVITE request does not contain an SDP offer, a
reliable 18x provisional response generated by the en-bloc conversion function
would have to contain an SDP offer. In this case digit collection needs to be
performed by the originating SIP entity (e.g. MGCF).
When the digit collection function sends the reliable 183 (Session Progress)
provisional response, in order to establish an early dialog with the sender of
the INVITE request, the digit collection function shall start a digit
collection timer. If the timer expires, the digit collection function shall
terminate the call setup by sending a sending a 484 (Address Incomplete)
response towards the sender of the INVITE request.
NOTE 2: The digit collection timer is similar to the protection timer used in
PSTN/ISDN. The timer value range is between 5 and 15 seconds, and the default
value is 10 seconds.
### N.2.2.2 Collection of additional digits
Upon receiving an INFO request carrying additional digits, and if an early
dialog towards the destination of the initial INVITE request for the call does
not exist, the digit collection function shall:
1) send a 200 (OK) response to the INFO request;
2) add the received digits to the previously stored digits for the call;
3) restart the digit collection timer; and
4) check if enough digits have been received in order to forward the initial
INVITE request.
When enough digits for the call have been received in order to forward the
initial INVITE request, the digit collection function shall add all stored
digits to the request URI and forward the request towards its destination and
stop the digit collection timer.
Upon receiving an INFO request carrying additional digits, and the initial
INVITE request has been forwarded towards its destination, but an early dialog
towards the destination of the initial INVITE request for the call does not
exist, the digit collection function shall:
1) send a 200 (OK) response to the INFO request; and
2) add the received digits to the previously stored, but yet not forwarded,
digits for the call;
When the digit collection function receives a provisional response from the
destination of the initial INVITE request, and the digit collection function
has received additional digits in INFO requests, the digit collection shall
generate and send an INFO request towards the destination of the initial
INVITE request. The Request-URI shall contain all digits which have been
received and stored since the initial INVITE request was forwarded.
Upon receiving an INFO request carrying additional digits, and if an early
dialog towards the destination of the initial INVITE request for the call does
exist, the digit collection function shall forward the INFO request on the
early dialog towards the destination of the initial SIP INVITE request.
Upon receiving an INFO request carrying additional digits, and if a 180
(Ringing) or a 200 (OK) response to the initial INVITE request for the call
has been received, or the digit collection function has received some other
indication that enough digits have been forwarded in order for the INVITE
request to reach the terminating SIP user, the digit collection function
shall, based on operator policy:
1) send a 200 (OK) response to the INFO request and not forward the INFO
request; or
2) forward the INFO request on the early dialog towards the destination of the
initial SIP INVITE request.
### N.2.2.3 Handling of 404 (Not Found) / 484 (Address Incomplete) responses
Upon receiving a 404/484 response to the initial INVITE request, the digit
collection function shall acknowledge the response and shall start the digit
collection timer. The digit collection function shall not forward the response
towards the sender of the INVITE request.
NOTE: If the digit collection function has received a 404/484 response, it
will send a new initial INVITE request when it has received additional digits
as described above, in order to establish an early dialog towards the
destination of the INVITE request. The digit collection timer will re-start if
an INFO request with additional digits is received. At timer expiry, the digit
collection function will terminate the call as described above
## N.2.3 Forwarding of SIP messages by the digit collection function
Apart from 404/484 responses to the initial INVITE request, and INFO requests
carrying additional digits received after a 180 (Ringing) or a 200 (OK)
response to the initial INVITE request has been received, the digit collection
function shall forward all SIP messages. When forwarding SIP messages, the
digit collection function shall modify the SIP messages to comply with SIP
procedures on both call legs as specified below:
1) The digit collection function will receive a \"tag\" To header field
parameter value from the receiver of the initial INVITE request, which is
different from the \"tag\" To header field parameter value that the digit
collection function inserted in the 183 (Session Progress) response that it
sent when it received the initial INVITE request. The digit collection
function shall modify the \"tag\" header field parameter value accordingly
when forwarding mid-dialog SIP messages.
2) The digit collection function will return a Contact header field in the
initial 183 (Session Progress) provisional response to the originating side,
which contains a SIP-URI of the digit collection function. The contact
information is used in the Request-URI of subsequent mid-dialog SIP requests
sent by the originating side, until the digit collection function has
received, and forwarded to the originating side, a 183 (Session Progress)
provisional response from the destination of the INVITE request. If the
Request-URI of the received mid-dialog SIP request contains the SIP-URI of the
digit collection function, and the digit collection function forwards the
request, the digit collection function shall modify the Request-URI before
forwarding the SIP request.
3) The digit collection function will return the Record-Route header fields,
which it received in the initial INVITE request, in the initial 183 (Session
Progress) provisional response to the originating side. The information is
used in the Route header fields of subsequent mid-dialog SIP requests sent by
the originating side, until the digit collection function has received, and
forwarded to the originating side, a 183 (Session Progress) provisional
response from the destination of the INVITE request. If the Route header
fields of the received mid-dialog SIP request are based on the Record-Route
headers fields which the digit collection function returned in the initial 183
(Session Progress) provisional response, and the digit collection function
forwards the request, the digit collection function shall modify the Route
header fields before forwarding the SIP request.
# N.3 En-bloc conversion function
## N.3.1 General
The en-bloc conversion function may be performed in an entity acting as B2BUA.
The en-bloc conversion function may be implemented in different network nodes
depending on the operator\'s deployment strategy (e.g. AS, IBCF).
If the initial INVITE request is to be forwarded towards a network, or towards
a network entity, that does not support overlap signalling, the en-bloc
conversion function shall determine the end of address signalling.
The following methods can be used to determine the end of the address
signalling:
1) the maximum number of digits used in a national numbering plan has been
received;
2) number analysis, e.g. using a provisioned dial plan, is used to determinte
that the complete number of digits has been received; or
3) an inter digit timer expires, and the minimum number of digits required for
routeing the call have been received. The timer is started when the initial
INVITE request is received, and re-started every time new digit(s) are
received.
NOTE: The inter digit timer is similar to the protection timer used in
PSTN/ISDN. The timer value range is between 5 and 15 seconds, and the default
value is 10 seconds.
The procedures for collecting additional digits are described in subclauses
N.3.2 and N.3.3. When end of address signalling has been determined, the en-
bloc conversion function shall generate an INVITE request, add all digits to
the request and forwards the request towards its destination.
## N.3.2 Multiple-INVITE method
Upon reception of an INVITE request, the en-bloc conversion function shall:
1) if an inter digit timer is running for a previously received INVITE request
with the same Call-ID and From header, and
a) if the number of digits within that previous INVITE request is below the
number of digits received in the new INVITE request (or as an equivalent test
if the CseqID of the previous INVITE request is below the CseqID of the new
INVITE request), stop the inter-digit timer for that previous INVITE request
and send a 484 (Address Incomplete) response for it; and
b) if the number of digits with the previous INVITE request is above or equal
to the number of digits received in the new INVITE request (or as an
equivalent test if the CseqID of the previous INVITE request is below the
CseqID of the new INVITE request), send a 484 (Address Incomplete) response
for the new INVITE request; and
2) if the en-bloc conversion function determines that the number received in
the INVITE request is complete, forward the INVITE request; and
3) if the en-bloc conversion function determines that it will not be able to
forward the request even if additional digits are received, send a 404 (Not
Found) response; and
4) if the en-bloc conversion function chooses to collect additional digits,
store the INVITE request and start an inter-digit timer to wait for possible
INVITE requests with the same Call ID and From header.
When the inter-digit timer expires the en-bloc conversion function shall:
1) if it determines that the number received in the stored INVITE request is
incomplete (e. g. by number analysis), terminate the call setup by sending a
sending a 484 (Address Incomplete) response towards the sender of the INVITE
request; and
2) if it does not determines that the number received in the last INVITE
request is incomplete, forward the corresponding stored INVITE request to the
next hop.
After forwarding an INVITE request, the en-bloc conversion function shall
apply SIP proxy procedures for all subsequent SIP messages within the
corresponding dialogue, unless other functionality not related to en-bloc
conversion allocated in the same physical norde requires a different
behaviour.
## N.3.3 In-dialog method
Upon receiving an initial INVITE request carrying an SDP offer, the en-bloc
conversion function shall:
1) if it determines that the request contains a complete number, forward the
request towards it's destination;
2) if the en-bloc conversion function chooses to collect additional digits in
INFO requests before forwarding the request, and the sender of the INVITE
request has indicated support of reliable responses, store the received
digits, send a reliable 183 (Session Progress) provisional response without an
SDP answer in order to establish an early dialog with the sender of the INVITE
request, and start an inter digit timer; or
3) if the en-bloc conversion function determines that it will not be able to
forward the request even if additional digits are received, send a 404 (Not
Found) response.
Upon receiving an initial INVITE request without an SDP offer, the en-bloc
conversion function shall:
1) if it is determined that the request contains a complete number, forward
the request towards it's destination; or
2) send a 404 (Not Found) response.
NOTE: If the initial INVITE request does not contain an SDP offer, a reliable
18x provisional response generated by the en-bloc conversion function would
have to contain an SDP offer. The en-bloc conversion function for the in-
dialog method specified here does not support en-bloc conversion for calls
with an initial INVITE request that does not contain an SDP offer in the
present release. However, en-bloc conversion for an initial INVITE request
that does not contain an SDP offer can be performed by the originating SIP
entity (e.g. MGCF).
Upon receiving an INFO request carrying additional digits, and an early dialog
towards the destination of the initial SIP INVITE request for the call has not
been created, the en-bloc conversion function shall:
1) send a 200 (OK) response to the INFO request;
2) add the received digits to the previously stored digits for the call;
3) re-start the inter digit timer; and
4) check if it can determine that a complete number for the call has been
received.
When the en-bloc conversion function determines that a complete number for the
call has been received, it shall add all stored digits to the initial INVITE
request and forward the request towards its destination and stop the inter
digit timer.
When the inter-digit timer expires the en-bloc conversion function shall
1) if it determines that the number so far is incomplete (e. g. by number
analysis), terminate the call setup by sending a sending a 484 (Address
Incomplete) response towards the sender of the INVITE request; or
2) if it does not determines that the number received in the last INVITE
request is incomplete, forward the INVITE request to the next hop, including
all received digits.
Upon receiving an INFO request carrying additional digits, if the en-bloc
conversion function has forwarded the initial INVITE request towards its
destination, the en-bloc conversion function shall send a 200 (OK) response to
the INFO request and not forward the INFO request.
Apart from INFO requests carrying additional digits received after the initial
INVITE request has been forwarded, the en-bloc conversion function shall
forward all SIP messages.
The en bloc conversion function will receive a \"tag\" To header field
parameter value from the receiver of the initial INVITE request, which is
different from the \"tag\" To header field parameter value that the digit
collection function inserted in the 183 (Session Progress) response that it
sent when it received the initial INVITE request. The digit collection
function shall modify the \"tag\" To header field parameter value accordingly
when forwarding in-dialog SIP messages.
###### ## Annex O (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using the EPC via cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD to access IM CN subsystem
# O.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is the Evolved Packet Core (EPC)
via a cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD access network.
# O.2 IP-CAN aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
## O.2.1 Introduction
A UE accessing the IM CN subsystem, and the IM CN subsystem itself, utilise
the services provided by the EPC and cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD access network as
specified by 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C] to provide packet-mode communication between
the UE and the IM CN subsystem.
Requirements for the UE on the use of these packet-mode services are specified
in this clause. Requirements for the P-GW in support of this communication are
specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] and 3GPP TS 29.212 [13B].
Requirements for the use of the EPC via packet cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD as an IP-CAN
are specified in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C].
## O.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### O.2.2.1 IP-CAN bearer context activation and P-CSCF discovery
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:
a) establish a connection with the the IP-CAN via the cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD
wireless IP network specified in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C]. Upon establishing a
connection with the cdma2000^Â®^ eHRPD wireless IP network, the UE can have an
IPv4 address only, an IPv6 address only, or both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
simultaneously;
b) ensure that a IP-CAN bearer context used for SIP signalling is available,
according to the APN and P-GW selection criteria described in 3GPP TS 23.402
[7E]. This IP-CAN bearer context shall remain active throughout the period the
UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem, i.e. from the initial registration and
at least until the deregistration;
NOTE 1: Any IP-CAN bearer can carry both IM CN subsystem signalling and media
if the media does not need to be authorized by Policy and Charging control
mechanisms as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [13B], and the media stream is not
mandated by the P-CSCF to be carried in a separate IP-CAN bearer.
NOTE 2: IP-CAN PDN connection and bearer management procedures are specified
in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C].
c) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).
The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:
I. Use DHCP mechanism
II Retrieve the list of P-CSCF address(es) stored in the IMC
III Obtain the list of P-CSCFaddress(es) from the IMS management object
IV. Transfer P-CSCF address(es) within the IP-CAN bearer context activation
procedure.
The UE shall indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the network within
the Protocol Configuration Options information element of the during PDN
connectivity establishment as specified in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C].
If the network provides the UE with a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6 addresses,
the UE shall assume that the list is prioritised with the first address within
the Protocol Configuration Options information element as the P-CSCF address
with the highest priority.
The UE can freely select method I, II, III, or IV for P-CSCF discovery. If
DHCP is used, the following procedures apply:
Upon establishing an IP-CAN bearer , the UE may use the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) specified in RFC 2131 [40A] or Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specified in RFC 3315 [40] to
discover the P-CSCF.
Prior to accessing the DHCP server, the UE will have obtained an IP address
via means other than DHCP and DHCPv6. Hence, if the UE uses DHCP or DHCPv6 for
P-CSCF discovery, the UE shall only request the configuration information from
the DHCP server through a single request and reply exchanged with the DHCP
server.
If the UE uses DHCP for P-CSCF discovery and the UE is unaware of the address
of the DHCP server, the UE shall send the DHCPINFORM using the limited
broadcast IP address (i.e., 255.255.255.255) and UDP port 67. If the UE knows
the IP address of the DHCP server, the UE shall send the DHCPINFORM to the
DHCP server's unicast IP address and UDP port 67. The DHCP server shall send
the DHCPACK on the IP address specified in the Client IP Address field of the
DHCPINFORM. The DHCP server may include, in the DHCPACK, the SIP Server DHCP
Option specified in RFC 3361 [35A], which carries either a list of IPv4
address(es) of the P-CSCF(s) or a list of DNS fully qualified domain name(s)
that can be mapped to one or more P-CSCF(s). If the UE uses DHCPv6 for P-CSCF
discovery and the UE is unaware of the address of the DHCP Server, the UE
shall send an Information Request using the IPv6 multicast address FF02::1:2
and the UDP port 547. If the UE knows the IP address of the DHCPv6 server, the
UE shall send the Information Request message to the DHCPv6 server's unicast
IP address and UDP port 547. In the Information Request, the UE may request
either one or both the SIP Servers Domain Name List option and the SIP Servers
IPv6 Address List option specified in RFC 3319 [41]. The DHCP server shall
send the Reply to the IP address specified in the Information Request. The
DHCP server may include in the Reply either one or both the SIP Servers Domain
Name List option and the SIP Servers IPv6 Address List option, as requested by
the UE.
In case several P-CSCF\'s IP addresses or domain names are provided to the UE,
the UE shall perform P-CSCF selection according to RFC 3361 [35A] or RFC 3319
[41]. The UE shall perform the procedure for the resolution of domain name
according to RFC 3263 [27A].
### O.2.2.1A Modification of an IP-CAN bearer context used for SIP signalling
The UE shall not modify the IP-CAN bearer from being used exclusively for SIP
signalling to a general purpose IP-CAN bearer and vice versa.
After the establishment of a SIP bearer context used for SIP signalling, the
UE shall not indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the network when
requesting an IP-CAN bearer modification for that APN. The UE shall ignore
P-CSCF address(es) if received from the network as part of the bearer
modification procedure.
### O.2.2.1B Re-establishment of the IP-CAN bearer context for SIP signalling
If the IP-CAN bearer context for SIP signalling is lost and cannot be re-
established:
a. if the SIP signalling was carried over a dedicated IP-CAN bearer, the UE
shall release all resources established as a result of SIP signalling by
either:
\- requesting an IP-CAN bearer modification if there are IP-CAN bearers to
this PDN that are not related SIP sessions; or
\- initiating disconnection of the PDN connection if all the bearers to this
PDN are related to SIP sessions.
NOTE: If the SIP signalling was carried over the default IP-CAN bearer, all
the resources established as a result of SIP signalling are released.
### O.2.2.1C P-CSCF restoration procedure
An UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure uses one of the following
methods to detect that a P-CSCF is not working any longer:
A if the UE used the Protocol Configuration Options to discover the P-CSCF
address at the IP-CAN bearer context activation and if the UE receives an
VSNCP Configure-Request message containing a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6
addresses that does not include the address of the currently used P-CSCF, then
the UE shall acquire the highest priority P-CSCF address in the list of P-CSCF
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in the VSNCP Configure-Request message. The UE shall
assume that the list is prioritised with the first address within the Protocol
Configuration Options information element as the P-CSCF address with the
highest priority; and
B if the UE monitors the P-CSCF status by means of the procedures provided by
RFC 6223 [143] and if the P-CSCF fails to respond to a keep-alive request,
then the UE shall acquire a new P-CSCF address using one of the methods I, II
and III for P-CSCF discovery described in the subclause O.2.2.1.
When a new P-CSCF address is acquired the UE shall perform an initial
registration as specified in subclause 5.1.
### O.2.2.2 Session management procedures
The existing procedures for session management as described in 3GPP2 X.S0057
[86C] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### O.2.2.3 Mobility management procedures
The existing procedures for mobility management as described in 3GPP2 X.S0057
[86C] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### O.2.2.4 Cell selection and lack of coverage
The existing mechanisms and criteria for cell selection as described in 3GPP2
C.S0014-C [86D] shall apply while the UE is connected to the IM CN subsystem.
### O.2.2.5 IP-CAN bearer contexts for media
#### O.2.2.5.1 General requirements
NOTE 1: The UE cannot control whether media streams belonging to different SIP
sessions are established on the same IP-CAN bearer context or not. During
establishment of a session, the UE establishes data streams(s) for media
related to the session. Such data stream(s) can result in activation of
additional IP-CAN bearer context(s). Either the UE or the network can request
for resource allocations for media, but the establishment and modification of
the IP-CAN bearer is controlled by the network as described in 3GPP2 X.S0057
[86C].
NOTE 2: When the UE wishes to allocate bandwidth for RTP and RTCP, the rules
as outlined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [13C] apply. Application of QoS to when using an
EPC IP-CAN with cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD is described in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C].
#### O.2.2.5.1A Activation or modification of IP-CAN bearer contexts for media
by the UE
No additional clarifications are needed for the use of the EPC via cdma2000^Â®^
HRPD as an IP-CAN.
#### O.2.2.5.1B Activation or modification of IP-CAN bearer contexts for media
by the network
If the UE receives an activation request from the network for an IP-CAN bearer
context which is associated with the IP-CAN bearer context used for
signalling, the UE shall, based on the information contained in the Traffic
Flow Template provided by the network, correlate the media IP-CAN bearer
context with a currently ongoing SIP session establishment or SIP session
modification.
If the UE receives a modification request from the network for an IP-CAN
bearer context that is used for one or more media streams in an ongoing SIP
session, the UE shall modify the related IP-CAN bearer context in accordance
with the request received from the network.
#### O.2.2.5.2 Special requirements applying to forked responses
Since the UE does not know that forking has occurred until a second,
provisional response arrives, the UE requests resource allocation as required
by the initial response received. If a subsequent provisional response is
received, different alternative actions may be performed depending on the
requirements in the SDP answer:
1) **the bearer requirements of the subsequent SDP can be accommodated by the
existing resources requested.** The UE performs no further resource requests.
2) **the subsequent SDP introduces different QoS requirements or additional IP
flows.** The UE requests further resource allocation according to subclause
O.2.2.5.1.
3) **the subsequent SDP introduces one or more additional IP flows.** The UE
requests further resource allocation according to subclause O.2.2.5.1.
NOTE: When several forked responses are received, the resources requested by
the UE are the \"logical OR\" of the resources indicated in the multiple
responses to avoid allocation of unnecessary resources. The UE does not
request more resources than proposed in the original INVITE request.
When a final answer is received for one of the early dialogues, the UE
proceeds to set up the SIP session. The UE shall release all the unneeded IP-
CAN resources. Therefore, upon the reception of the first final 200 (OK)
response for the INVITE request (in addition to the procedures defined in RFC
3261 [26] subclause 13.2.2.4), the UE shall:
1) in case resources were established or modified as a consequence of the
INVITE request and forked provisional responses that are not related to the
accepted 200 (OK) response, send release request to release the unneeded
resources.
#### O.2.2.5.3 Unsuccessful situations
Not applicable.
### O.2.2.6 Emergency service
Emergency services is not supported when the IP-CAN is the EPC via a
cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD access network.
# O.2A Usage of SDP
## O.2A.0 General
Not applicable.
## O.2A.1 Impact on SDP offer / answer of activation or modification of IP-CAN
bearer context for media by the network
If, due to the activation of an IP-CAN bearer context from the network the
related SDP media description needs to be changed the UE shall update the
related SDP information by sending a new SDP offer within a SIP request, which
is sent over the existing SIP dialog,
If the UE receives a modification request from the network for an IP-CAN
bearer context that is used for one or more media streams in an ongoing SIP
session, the UE shall:
1) if, due to the modification of the IP-CAN bearer context, the related SDP
media description need to be changed, update the related SDP information by
sending a new SDP offer within a SIP request, that is sent over the existing
SIP dialog, and respond to the IP-CAN bearer context modification request.
NOTE: The UE can decide to indicate additional media streams as well as
additional or different codecs in the SDP offer than those used in the already
ongoing session.
## O.2A.2 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE when originating UE has
resources available and IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation
for terminating UE
If the UE receives an SDP offer where the SDP offer includes all media streams
for which the originating side indicated its local preconditions as met, if
the precondition mechanism is supported by the terminating UE and the IP-CAN
performs network-initiated resource reservation for the terminating UE and the
available resources are not sufficient for the received offer the terminating
UE shall indicate its local preconditions and provide the SDP answer to the
originating side without waiting for resource reservation.
NOTE: If the resource reservation is controlled by the network, the resource
reservation request is initiated by the network after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
# O.3 Application usage of SIP
## O.3.1 Procedures at the UE
### O.3.1.1 P-Access-Network-Info header field
The UE shall always include the P-Access-Network-Info header field where
indicated in subclause 5.1.
### O.3.1.2 Availability for calls
Not applicable.
## O.3.2 Procedures at the P-CSCF
### O.3.2.1 Determining network to which the originating user is attached
The P-CSCF handling is as defined in subclause M.3.2.
NOTE: Emergency call support for the EPC IP-CAN is not specified in this
release. A common P-Access-Network-Info header field value is used for both
cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD based IP-CANs (i.e. HRPD access specified by 3GPP2 X.S0011â€‘C
[127], and HRPD access as specified by 3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C]). The result of
this is that in both cases the handling in the P-CSCF must be identical. If an
operator deploys an IM CN subsystem with both cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD based IPâ€‘CANs,
the P-CSCF has no means of distinguishing one from the other. The emergency
call handling for the EPC IPâ€‘CAN using cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD access as specified by
3GPP2 X.S0057 [86C] is out of scope for this release of this specification,
and therefore all identified emergency calls with a P-Access-Network-Info
header field value of \"3GPP2â€‘1Xâ€‘HRPD\" will be handled with a 380
(Alternative Service) response when HRPD IP-CAN emergency support is not
active.
### O.3.2.2 Location information handling
Void.
## O.3.3 Procedures at the S-CSCF
The S-CSCF handling is as defined in subclause M.3.3.
# O.4 3GPP specific encoding for SIP header field extensions
## O.4.1 Void
# O.5 Use of circuit-switched domain
There is no CS domain in this access technology.
###### ## Annex P (informative): Void
###### ## Annex Q (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x Femtocell Network to access IM CN
subsystem
# Q.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a call control
protocol for use in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based
on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session
Description Protocol (SDP), where the IP-CAN is an IP network as incorporated
into the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x femtocell network subsystem [86E].
# Q.2 cdma2000^Â®^ 1x Femtocell Network aspects when connected to the IM CN
subsystem
## Q.2.1 Introduction
In the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x femtocell network subsystem, the cdma2000^Â® ^1x Mobile
Station (MS) accesses the IM CN subsystem by utilising the services provided
by the cdma2000^Â® ^1x Femtocell Access Point (FAP) [86E].
NOTE: Protocol between the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x MS and the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP is out
of scope of this document.
The cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP 3GPP2 X.P0059-200 [86E] acts as a UE toward the IM CN
subsystem.
From the perspective of the FAP, it is assumed that one or more IP-CAN
bearer(s) are provided, in the form of connection(s) managed by the layer 2.
## Q.2.2 Procedures at the UE
### Q.2.2.1 Activation and P-CSCF discovery
Unless a static IP address is allocated to the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP, prior to
communication with the IM CN subsystem, the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP shall perform a
Network Attachment procedure depending on the used cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP access
type. When using a cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP access, both IPv4 and IPv6 may be used
to access the IM CN subsystem. The cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP may request a DNS Server
IPv4 address(es) via RFC 2132 [20F] or a DNS Server IPv6 address(es) via RFC
3315 [40].
When using IPv4, the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP may acquires a P-CSCF address(es) by
using the DHCP (see RFC 2132 [20F]), the DHCPv4 options for SIP servers (see
RFC 3361 [35A]), and RFC 3263 [27A].
In case the DHCP server provides several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs to the
cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP, the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP shall select the P-CSCF address or
FQDN as indicated in RFC 3361 [35A]. If sufficient information for P-CSCF
address selection is not available, selection of the P-CSCF address by the
cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP is implementation specific.
When using IPv6, the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP may acquires a P-CSCF address(es) by
using the DHCPv6 (see RFC 3315 [40] and RFC 3646 [56C]), the DHCPv6 options
for SIP servers (see RFC 3319 [41]), and RFC 3263 [27H].
In case the DHCP server provides several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs to the
cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP, the cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP shall select the P-CSCF address or
FQDN as indicated in RFC 3319 [41]. If sufficient information for P-CSCF
address selection is not available, selection of the P-CSCF address by the
cdma2000^Â®^ 1x FAP is implementation specific.
