# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage three Protocol Description of the
Advice Of Charge (AOC) service, based on stage 1 and 2 of the ISDN
Supplementary Service Advice Of Charge for all calls (permanent mode). It
provides the protocol details in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)
subsystem based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session
Description Protocol (SDP).
Three AOC services exist:
**a) Charging information at communication set-up time (AOC-S)**
The AOC-S service enables a user to receive information about the charging
rates at communication set-up time and also to receive further information
during the communication if there is a change of charging rates.
**b) Charging information during the communication (AOC-D)**
The AOC-D service enables a user to receive information on the recorded
charges for a communication during the active phase of the communication.
**c) Charging information at the end of the communication (AOC-E)**
The AOC-E service enables a user to receive information on the recorded
charges for a communication when the communication is terminated.
The present document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) and Application
Servers (AS) which are intended to support the AOC supplementary services.

# 4 Advice Of Charge (AOC)
## 4.1 Introduction
The Advice Of Charge (AOC) service allows the served user to be informed of IP
Multimedia session related charging information.
## 4.2 Description
### 4.2.1 General description
The AOC service is limited to INVITE-initiated sessions.
The AOC service is not meant to replace the charge metering inside the network
which is considered to be correct in all cases.
The charging information given shall relate to the charges incurred in the
current network.
### 4.2.2 Charging information at communication set-up time (AOC-S)
When the AOC-S service is activated, the network shall provide the user with
information about the charging rates at communication establishment. In
addition, the network shall inform the served user if a change in charging
rates takes place during the communication.
## 4.3 Charging information during the communication (AOC-D)
When the AOC-D service is activated, the network shall provide the user with
charging information for a communication during the active phase of this
communication. The supplied charging information shall be provided as a
cumulative charge incurred so far for the communication (i.e. charges recorded
from the start of the communication and until the moment the charging
information is sent to the served user), or as charging units.
When the call is released, the network shall send the recorded charges for the
communication to the served user.
## 4.4 Charging information at the end of the communication (AOC-E)
When the AOC-E service is activated, the network shall provide the served user
with charging information indicating the recorded charges for a communication
when this communication is released.
## 4.5 Operational requirements
### 4.5.1 Provision/withdrawal
The AOC services shall be provided to the served user after prior arrangement
with the service provider or, as a service provider option, be generally
available. Withdrawal of these services shall be made on the served user\'s
request or for service provider reasons.
When available the AOC services shall be provided for all communications
(permanent mode).
### 4.5.2 Requirements on the originating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.5.3 Requirements on the terminating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
## 4.6 Coding requirements
The INFO method according to IETF RFC 2976 [4] is needed in support of AOC-D.
The AOC XML schema is defined in annex D. The AOC XML schema shall be
transported as a SIP MIME body. The MIME type for the AOC information is
\"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\" (see subclause 5.1). Any SIP message that
transports a body with AOC information shall identify the payload as MIME type
\"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\", the MIME type associated with AOC
information (see subclause 5.1), and shall identify in the \"sv\" or
\"schemaversion\" parameter\'s value the versions of AOC XML Schema that can
be used to validate the AOC information XML body (part). If both the \"sv\"
and \"schemaversion\" parameters are present, then the P-CSCF shall ignore the
value of the \"schemaversion\" parameter. The versions -- of the MIME type
associated with AOC information (see subclause 5.1) -- indicated shall
correspond with a value of the version attribute of the \ XML element
of an AOC XML Schema (see e.g. annex D).
## 4.7 Signalling requirements
### 4.7.1 Activation/deactivation
The AOC service is activated at provisioning and deactivated at withdrawal.
### 4.7.1A Registration/erasure
The AOC service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.
### 4.7.1B Interrogation
Interrogation of AOC is not applicable.
### 4.7.2 Invocation and operation
#### 4.7.2.0 Introduction
Basic communication procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] shall apply,
with the additions outlined in the subclauses below.
#### 4.7.2.1 Actions at the served UE
The served UE shall support the INFO method and the AOC XML schema defined in
annex D.
If methods or responses are received which contain AOC information, this
information may be rendered to the user.
In addition to the procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], the served UE
shall include the Accept header field with:
\- \"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\", the MIME type associated with AOC
information (see subclause 5.1), and indicate the versions of the AOC XML
Schema it supports. The versions -- of the MIME type associated with AOC
information (see subclause 5.1) -- indicated shall correspond with a value of
the version attribute of the \ XML element of an AOC XML Schema (see
e.g. annex D); and
\- any other MIME type the served UE is willing and capable to accept.
#### 4.7.2.2 Actions at the AS of the served user
##### 4.7.2.2.0 General
The AS shall assume that the served user\'s UE supports version 1.0 of the
MIME type associated with AOC information (see subclause 5.1), if support for
the MIME type associated with AOC information in the Accept header is not
indicated. The versions -- of the MIME type associated with AOC information
(see subclause 5.1) -- indicated shall correspond with a value of the version
attribute of the \ XML element of an AOC XML Schema (see e.g. Annex
D).
When sending AOC information, the AS shall encode this information according
to the XML-schema defined in annex D. In addition, for this MIME body the AS
shall:
\- set the Content-Type header to \"vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\", the MIME type
associated with AOC information (see subclause 5.1), and shall include in its
\"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter's value the versions of AOC XML Schema
that can be used to validate the AOC information XML body (part). If both the
\"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameters are present, then the P-CSCF shall
ignore the value of the \"schemaversion\" parameter. The versions -- of the
MIME type associated with AOC information (see subclause 5.1) -- indicated
shall correspond with a value of the version attribute of the \ XML
element of an AOC XML Schema (see e.g. Annex D); and
\- set the Content-Disposition to \"render\" with the \"handling\" parameter
set to \"optional\".
In the case the AOC information is transported in a message that is forwarded
by the AS that contains already a content body, the AS shall generate a
multipart/mixed MIME body containing two sub-parts:
\- one with the AOC information; the Content-Type and Content-Disposition of
this sub-part should be coded as specified for non-multipart bodies;
\- one with the received body; headers describing the content of the received
SIP message (e.g. Content-type) should be moved into the headers of the this
subpart.
In the case the AOC information is transported in a message that is forwarded
by the AS, that contains already a content body and the served user\'s UE has
not indicated support for multipart content, the AS shall forward the message
unchanged.
NOTE: The above subclause ensures that a communication setup is not affected
in case a terminal does not support multipart content.
##### 4.7.2.2.1 Actions for AOC-S
###### 4.7.2.2.1.1 Served user is the originating user
When an INVITE request is received, and the served user is subscribed to AOC-S
service, the AS shall either (network operator option) operate as a SIP proxy
as specified in subclause 5.7.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] and in IETF RFC 3262 [5]
and include the AOC information in the content body of a reliable 1xx
provisional responses, or operate as a routing B2BUA as specified in subclause
5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] and include the AOC information in the content
body a 200 (OK) response forwarded by the AS.
If the charging rates change during the communication, the AS shall send the
AOC information to the UE of the served user in the content body of a mid-
dialog request forwarded by the AS or an INFO request generated by the AS.
NOTE: If no charging information is available, then the AS can, as a network
option, stop the communication establishment before the session is confirmed
by sending a 504 (Server Time-out) response to the originating user and a BYE
request to the terminating side. The BYE request contains a Reason header
field with a reason value with the protocol set to \"SIP\" and the cause set
to \"504\" and optionally a reason value with the protocol set to \"Q.850\"
and the cause set to \"31\".
###### 4.7.2.2.1.2 Served user is the terminating user
The AS shall operate as a routing B2BUA as specified in subclause 5.7.5 of
3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
When an INVITE request is received, and the served user is subscribed to the
AOC-S service, the AS shall include the AOC information in the content body in
the INVITE request before sending the INVITE request to the terminating UE.
If the charging rates change during the communication, the AS shall send the
AOC information to the UE of the served user in the content body of a mid-
dialog request forwarded by the AS or an INFO request generated by the AS.
NOTE: If no charging information is available, then the AS can, as a network
option, not forward the communication invitation and send a 504 (Server Time-
out) response to the originating side.
##### 4.7.2.2.2 Actions for AOC-D
The AS shall operate as a routing B2BUA as specified in subclause 5.7.5 of
3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
The procedures for AOC-D service at the AS are the same for the originating
and the terminating user.
If the user is subscribed to AOC-D service, the AS may provide charging
information to the user at any moment during the active phase of the
communication. When sending the charging information, the AS shall include the
AOC information in the content body of a mid-dialog request or mid-dialog
response forwarded by the AS to the served user or an INFO request to the
served user generated by the AS. The supplied charging information shall be
provided as a cumulative charge incurred so far for the communication (i.e.
charges recorded from the start of the communication until the moment the
charging information is sent to the served user).
When the communication is terminated, the AS shall include the recorded AOC
information for the communication in the content body of either the BYE
request or the final response to the BYE request sent to the served user. If
the communication is free of charge, then the AS shall indicate the charged
amount as zero in the AOC information.
##### 4.7.2.2.3 Actions for AOC-E
The AS shall operate as a SIP proxy as specified in subclause 5.7.4 of 3GPP TS
24.229 [2].
The procedures for AOC-E service at the AS are the same for the originating
and the terminating user.
If the user is subscribed to AOC-E service, when the communication is
terminated the AS shall include the recorded AOC information for the
communication in the content body of either the BYE request or the final
response to the BYE request sent to the served user. If the communication is
free of charge, then the AS shall indicate the charged amount as zero in the
AOC information.

## 4.9 Interactions with other networks
Not applicable.
## 4.10 Parameter values (timers)
Not applicable.
# 5 Extensions within the present document
## 5.1 AOC information XML body
### 5.1.1 General
This subclause contains the AOC information XML body in XML format. The AOC
information XML shall be valid against the AOC XML schema defined in Annex D.
See subclause 5.1.2 for the associated MIME type definition.
### 5.1.2 MIME type definition
#### 5.1.2.1 Introduction
This subclause defines the MIME type for \"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\". An
AOC information XML Document can be identified with this media type.
#### 5.1.2.2 Syntax
The following optional parameters are defined:
\- \"charset\": the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
of the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in IETF RFC 3023 [8].
\- \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\": the syntax for the \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\"
parameter is specified in table 2:
Table 2: Syntax of the \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter
m-parameter =/ (\"sv\" / \"schemaversion\") EQUAL LDQUOT [ sv-value-list ]
RDQUOT
sv-value-list = sv-value-range *( \",\" sv-value )
sv-value-range = sv-value [ \"-\" sv-value ]
sv-value = number / token
number = 1*DIGIT [ \".\" 1*DIGIT ]
The BNF for m-parameter is taken from IETF RFC 3261 [7] and modified
accordingly.
#### 5.1.2.3 Operation
The encoding considerations for \"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\" are identical
to those of \"application/xml\" as described in IETF RFC 3023 [8].
The \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter\'s value is used to indicate:
\- the versions of the AOC information XML schema that can be used to validate
the AOC information XML body (if the MIME type and parameter are present in
the Content-Type header); or
\- the accepted versions of the AOC information XML body (if the MIME type and
parameter are present in the Accept header). If the \"sv\" or
\"schemaversion\" parameter's value is empty, no versions of the of the AOC
information XML schema are supported.
If the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameter are absent, it shall be assumed
that version 1.0 of the XML Schema for the AOC information XML body is
supported.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows

###### ## Annex B (informative): Example of Filter Criteria
This annex provides an example of a filter criterion that triggers SIP
requests that are subject to initial filter criteria evaluation.
An example of an IFC when the AOC service is active at the originating S-CSCF
is:
\- Method: INVITE.
###### ## Annex C (normative): Charging Information Elements
# C.1 General
This annex describes the charging information to be provided to the served
user. The AoC information model and UNI protocol mapping of the information
elements is defined in 3GPP TS 32.280 [10].
# C.2 AOC-S
The AOC-S service provides tariff information at the start of the call or when
tariff changes occur during the call.
## C.2.1 Charged Items
AOC-S can provide a list of charged items or a special charging arrangement.
Following charged items are thought applicable:
\- basic communication;
\- communication attempt;
\- communication setup;
\- operation of supplementary services.
The special charging arrangement excludes all other charged items and is
therefore mentioned separately. As defined in 3GPP TS 32.280 [10], special
charging arrangement for AOC-S is not supported in IMS.
### C.2.1.1 Charged Item: basic communication
This expresses the rate for the basic communication.
The rate shall be expressed as:
\- price per time unit and time unit (see subclause C.2.2.1); or
\- free of charge (see subclause C.2.2.2); or
\- flat rate (see subclause C.2.2.3); or
\- special charging code (see subclause C.2.2.4); or
\- not available (see subclause C.2.2.6).
As defined in 3GPP TS 32.280 [10], the special charging code for AOC-S is not
supported in IMS.
### C.2.1.2 Charged Item: communication attempt
This expresses the cost of a communication attempt.
The cost shall be expressed as:
\- free of charge (see subclause C.2.2.2); or
\- flat rate (see subclause C.2.2.3); or
\- special charging code (see subclause C.2.2.4); or
\- not available (see subclause C.2.2.6).
As defined in 3GPP TS 32.280 [10], the special charging code for AOC-S is not
supported in IMS.
### C.2.1.3 Charged Item: communication setup
This expresses the cost of a communication setup.
The cost shall be expressed as:
\- free of charge (see subclause C.2.2.2); or
\- flat rate (see subclause C.2.2.3); or

###### ## Annex D (normative): AOC XML Schema, version 1.0:
This annex defines the XML Schema to be used for providing the charging
information described in annex C in the SIP methods to the served user. As
defined in 3GPP TS 32.280 [10], the information elements \"special-
arrangement\", \"special-code\" and \"billing-id\" are not supported in IMS.
The application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml MIME type used to provide the charging
information requested by the served user shall be coded as following
described:

###### ## Annex E (informative): IANA Registration templates
# E.1 IANA registry for Application Media Types
## E.1.1 IANA Registration template for application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml
NOTE: IETF RFC 4288 [9], section 9, states the process that applies in case of
changes to the registry of media types. Any future changes to the format or to
annex E.1.1 would invoke this procedure.
MIME media type name:
application
MIME subtype name:
vnd.etsi.aoc+xml
Required parameters:
None
Optional parameters:
\"charset\" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of
the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in IETF RFC 3023 [8].
\"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" the parameter\'s value is used to indicate:
\- the versions of the SIP AOC information XML schema that can be used to
validate the AOC information XML body (if the MIME type and parameter are
present in the Content-Type header field) or
\- the accepted versions of the AOC information XML body (if the MIME type and
parameter are present in the Accept header field).
If the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameter are absent, it shall be assumed
that version 1.0 of the AOC information XML body is supported.
Encoding considerations:
Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as specified in IETF RFC
3023 [8]
Security considerations:
Same as general security considerations for application/xml as specified in
section 10 of IETF RFC 3023 [8].
In addition, this content type provides a format for exchanging information in
SIP, so the security considerations from IETF RFC 3261 [7] apply.
Interoperability considerations:
Same as Interoperability considerations as specified in section 3.1 of IETF
RFC 3023 [8].
If both \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" are specified, then the value of
\"schemaversion\" MUST be ignored
Published specification:
3GPP TS 24.647: \"Advice Of Charge (AOC) using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network
(CN) subsystem\", as published in subclause E.1.1, version 8.2.0.
Available via \.
Applications which use this media:
Applications that use the 3GPP IP multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem
as defined by 3GPP.
Intended usage:
COMMON
