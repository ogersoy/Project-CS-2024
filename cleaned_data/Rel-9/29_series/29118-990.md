# 1 Scope
CS Fallback in the Evolved Packet System (EPS) enables the provisioning of CS-
domain services (e.g. voice call, Location Services (LCS) or supplementary
services) by reuse of CS infrastructure when the UE is served by E-UTRAN.
Additionally, SMS delivery via the CS core network is realized without CS
fallback.
The present document specifies the procedures and the SGs Application Part
(SGsAP) messages used on the SGs interface between the Mobility Management
Entity (MME) in the EPS and the Visitor Location Register (VLR), to allow
location management coordination and to relay certain messages related to GSM
circuit switched services over the EPS system.
The present document also specifies the use of Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) for the transport of SGsAP messages.
The present document is applicable to the MME in the EPS and to the VLR. The
functional split between the MME and the VLR is defined in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7].

# 4 Description of the SGs association between a VLR and an MME
## 4.1 General
CS fallback function and SMS delivery via the CS core network is realized by
reusing Gs interface mechanisms as defined in 3GPP TS 29.018 [16] on the
interface between the MME in the EPS and the VLR. This interface is called SGs
interface.
NOTE: Within this specification, the term VLR refers to MSC/VLR or MSC
Server/VLR.
The SGs interface connects the databases in the VLR and the MME. The
procedures described in the present document are used to co-ordinate the
location information of UEs that are IMSI attached to both EPS and non-EPS
services. The SGs interface is also used to convey some circuit switched
related procedures via the MME.
The basis for the interworking between a VLR and an MME is the existence of a
SGs association between those entities per UE. The SGs association is
applicable to UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or
SMS over SGs only.
The behaviour of the VLR and the MME entities related to the SGs interface are
defined by the state of the SGs association for a UE. Individual states per
SGs association, i.e. per UE are held at both the VLR and the MME.
## 4.2 SGs association at the VLR
### 4.2.1 General
The states associated to the SGs interface in the VLR are specified in
subclause 4.2.2 and the state diagram at the VLR is shown in figure 4.2.2.1.
The state diagram does not include the message error handling specified in
clause 7.
### 4.2.2 States at the VLR
SGs-NULL
> There is no SGs association with an MME for the UE and therefore the VLR
> considers that the UE is IMSI detached for EPS services. In this state no
> SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST messages are sent to the MME. The VLR may
> initiate paging on the SGs interface if the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\"
> restoration indicator in the VLR is set to \"false\" (see 3GPP TS 23.007
> [4]). Any message from the MME is ignored except SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-
> REQUEST and SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION.
LA-UPDATE-PRESENT
> The VLR has received an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message from the MME.
> In this state, the VLR may be waiting for the outcome of the Update Location
> procedure from the HSS, if the IMSI is not known in the VLR. For UEs which
> are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only,
> the VLR shall send SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages only via the SGs interface.
SGs-ASSOCIATED
> The VLR considers that the UE is attached to both EPS and non-EPS services.
> For UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS
> over SGs only, the VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages only via the SGs
> interface. The VLR can perform the MM information procedure.
NOTE: Receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME may change or
not the state of the SGs interface of all the associations associated to the
restarted MME, see subclause 5.8.3.
Figure 4.2.2.1: State diagram at the VLR
## 4.3 SGs association at the MME
### 4.3.1 General
The MM context variables associated to the SGs interface in the MME are
specified in subclause 4.3.2 and states associated to the SGs interface in the
MME are specified in subclause 4.3.3. The state diagram at the MME is shown in
figure 4.3.3.1. The state diagram does not include the message error handling
specified in clause 7.
### 4.3.2 MM context variables at the MME
VLR-Reliable:
> Boolean set to \"false\" when the MME has received a reset indication from
> the VLR. The MME may request the UE, upon reception of the next tracking
> area update (periodic or combined) procedure, to re-attach to non-EPS
> services if the UE is still IMSI attached to non-EPS services.
> Alternatively, the MME may, upon reception of a periodic or combined
> tracking area update request from a UE that is still attached for non-EPS
> services, perform immediately the location update for non-EPS services
> procedure.
MME-Reset:
> Boolean set to \"true\" when the MME restarts after a failure. The \"MME-
> Reset\" restoration indicator is unique within an MME and it applies to all
> the MM contexts stored in the MME.
### 4.3.3 States at the MME
SGs-NULL
> There is no SGs association with a VLR for the UE and therefore the MME
> considers that the UE is IMSI detached for non-EPS services. In this state
> the MME accepts SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages to UEs only if the \"MME-
> Reset\" restoration indicator in the MME is set to \"true\".
LA-UPDATE-REQUESTED
> The MME has sent an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the VLR. In
> this state the MME waits for the outcome of the Update Location for non-EPS
> services procedure at the VLR before sending the response to the UE. In this
> state the MME accepts SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages.
SGs-ASSOCIATED
> The MME stores an SGs association for the UE. In this state the MME performs
> the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the VLR for UEs
> capable of and configured to use CS Fallback when they are moving to a
> tracking area not in the list of assigned tracking areas.
Figure 4.3.3.1: State diagram at the MME
### 4.3.4 State transitions in the MME without SGsAP signaling
If it is required by network configuration or operator policy, the MME shall
change the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL if the following
conditions are fulfilled:
\- the MME receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message with service type set
to \"mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency
call\";
\- the state of the SGs association is not SGs-NULL; and
\- the MME determines that the UE is not available for PS services at the
target RAT as described in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7].
# 5 Procedures for SGs
## 5.1 Paging for non-EPS services procedure
### 5.1.1 General description
This procedure is used by the VLR to send an SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message to a
UE. This procedure applies to UEs that are simultaneously attached for EPS
services and non-EPS services, or for EPS services and SMS only.
### 5.1.2 Procedures in the VLR
#### 5.1.2.1 General
The VLR shall handle the timers, queuing and retransmission for sending the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message on the SGs interface in the same way that it
handles the sending of a PAGING message on the A or Iu interface.
#### 5.1.2.2 Paging Initiation
When a VLR has to page a UE, the VLR shall check whether the VLR has a SGs
association for that UE. The VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages to the
MME if the state of the SGs association for the UE is SGs-ASSOCIATED, LA-
UPDATE-PRESENT or if the state of the SGs association is SGs-NULL and the
\"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to \"false\". The
sending of the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not change the state of the
SGs association with the MME.
If the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to
\"true\", the VLR shall include the Location area identifier information
element into the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, otherwise (i.e. after a VLR
failure), the VLR shall not include the Location area identifier information
element. When sending the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, the VLR shall start
timer Ts5.
If the state of the SGs association is SGs-NULL and the \"Confirmed by Radio
Contact\" restoration indicator is set to \"false\", the VLR shall also
perform a search procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [5].
In this message, the VLR includes the Service indicator information element
which will be used to indicate the type of CS service. If the SGs paging
request is sent as a result of reception of Provide Subscriber Information
Request message, the VLR sets the Service indicator information element to
either \"SMS indicator\" or \"CS call indicator\" as specified in subclause
7.2.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.018 [5]. For SMS, SMS indicator is used. For all the
other CS services, CS call indicator is used.
If the Calling Line Identification of the service (see 3GPP TS 24.081 [12]) is
available in the VLR, the VLR may include the CLI information element in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. The conditions specified in 3GPP TS 23.081 [5A]
and 3GPP TS 29.011 [15A] apply also here. If the paging is due to a NW-
initiated Call Independent SS procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 24.010 [9], the
VLR shall include the SS code as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15]. If the paging
is due to a Mobile Terminated Location Request as defined in 3GPP TS 24.030
[11], the VLR shall include LCS client identity and LCS indicator as defined
in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15] in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST.
While domain specific access control of the PS domain is ongoing, the VLR
shall be configured to send paging messages on both the SGs and the A/Iu
interface. The VLR may apply implementation specific rules for sending the
paging on the A/Iu interface; e.g. paging on the A/Iu interface may be limited
to cases when the UE does not respond to a first paging on SGs interface.
#### 5.1.2.3 Paging Response
The VLR stops the paging procedure on expiry of timer Ts5 or on receipt of a
SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message from the MME.
NOTE 1: On receipt of an SCCP connection establishment containing the Initial
L3 message from the UE via the A or Iu interface, the VLR stops the paging
procedure if ongoing, see 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
Upon receiving the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message with the UE EMM mode
information element indicating \"EMM-CONNECTED\", the VLR triggers the Call
Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [5B].
If the paging response is received via the A or Iu interface from a location
area which differs from the one stored in the VLR, the VLR shall move the SGs
association to the SGs-NULL state after the UE has been authenticated
successfully.
NOTE 2: UE sends this paging response as a result of receiving paging request
with IMSI and with CN domain indicator set to \"CS\" (see 3GPP TS 24.301
[14]).
#### 5.1.2.4 Paging Failure
On receipt of an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message before the timer Ts5 expires, the
VLR stops timer Ts5. If the SGs cause information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-
REJECT message does not indicate \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call
rejected by the user\", the SGs association is moved to the SGs-NULL state and
within this state the SGs association is marked with the contents of the SGs
cause information element. If the SGs cause information element in the SGsAP-
PAGING-REJECT message indicates \"IMSI detached for EPS services\" the VLR
shall send the paging message on the A/Iu interface. If the SGs cause
information element indicates \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call rejected
by the user\", the SGs association state shall not be changed.
When the VLR receives the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message with the SGs cause
information element indicating \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call rejected
by the user\", the VLR shall trigger User Determined User Busy (UDUB) as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.082 [13].
#### 5.1.2.5 UE unreachable
On receipt of an SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message before the timer Ts5 expires,
the VLR stops timer Ts5, the paging procedure for that paging request towards
the MME is stopped and the VLR applies the equivalent handling as for Call
Forwarding on Not Reachable, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [5B] and 3GPP TS
29.011 [15A]. The state of the SGs association at the VLR is not changed.
When the VLR receives the SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message after receipt of the
service request message, including the CS call indicator, from the MME, the
VLR may trigger Call Forwarding on Not Reachable (CFNRc) as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.082 [5B] and 3GPP TS 29.011 [15A]; the SGs association state shall not
be changed.
NOTE: If no SCCP connection establishment containing the Initial L3 message
from the UE via the A or Iu interface is received, as described in 3GPP TS
24.008 [8], before the timer Ts5 expires, the VLR applies the equivalent
handling as for Call Forwarding on Not Reachable, as specified in 3GPP TS
23.082 [5B] and 3GPP TS 29.011 [15A].
### 5.1.3 Procedures in the MME
#### 5.1.3.1 General
The MME accepts SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages in any state of the SGs
association apart from SGs-NULL. When a MME receives a SGs-PAGING-REQUEST
message from a VLR, the MME shall first check if the UE is known by the MME.
The handling of the paging request depends on the state of the SGs
association, the EMM context variables at the MME, and the Service indicator
information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.
If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\", the MME shall handle the paging
request as follows:
a) If the UE is known:
\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS services and \"SMS
only\", the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to the VLR
indicating in the SGs cause information element \"Mobile terminating CS
fallback call rejected by the user\";
\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS services
(i.e. the SGs association is not in the state SGs-NULL), the MME shall page
the UE based on the location information stored in the MME. If the location
area stored in the MME differs from the one received in the SGsAP-PAGING-
REQUEST message, the MME shall use the IMSI to page the UE. If ISR is
activated, and in addition the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include
the Location area identifier or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable in
the MME is set to \"false\", then the MME shall send Detach Notification
(Local Detach) message to the associated SGSN;
\- if the UE is marked as IMSI detached for EPS services or IMSI (implicitly
or explicitly) detached for non-EPS services (i.e. the state of the SGs
association is SGs-NULL), the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message
to that VLR indicating in the SGs cause information element the detach
circumstance (\"IMSI detached for EPS services\", \"IMSI detached for non-EPS
services\" or \"IMSI implicitly detached for non-EPS services\");
\- if the UE is marked as unreachable, indicated by Paging Proceed Flag set to
\"false\", and the ISR is not activated, the MME shall return an SGsAP-UE-
UNREACHABLE message to that VLR indicating in the SGs cause information
element \"UE unreachable\". The state of the SGs association does not change
at the MME; or
\- if the UE is marked as unreachable, indicated by Paging Proceed Flag set to
\"false\", and the ISR is activated, the MME shall not return an SGsAP-UE-
UNREACHABLE message to that VLR. If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not
include the Location area identifier or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context
variable in the MME is set to \"false\", then the MME shall send Detach
Notification (Local Detach) message to the associated SGSN; Otherwise the MME
shall forward the paging request to the associated SGSN, as described in 3GPP
TS 29.274 [17A].
b) If the UE is not known and the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator at the
MME is set to \"false\":
\- the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to that VLR indicating
in the SGs cause information element \"IMSI unknown\".
c) If the UE is not known and the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator at the
MME is set to \"true\", the MME shall handle the paging request as follows:
\- if the MME only supports \"SMS only\", the MME shall return an SGsAP-
PAGING-REJECT message to the VLR indicating in the SGs cause information
element \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\";
\- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area identifier
information element, the MME shall page the UE in all the tracking areas
served by the MME that can be mapped to the location area indicated in the
Location area identifier information element; or
\- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location area
identifier information element, the MME may page in all the tracking areas
served by the MME, or the tracking areas served by the MME and by the VLR.
NOTE: The MME can initiate the paging procedure using IMSI with CN domain
indicator set to \"PS\" to request the UE to initiate the attach procedure as
described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14].
If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\", the MME shall handle the paging request
as follows:
a) If the UE is known:
\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS services or
IMSI attached for EPS services and \"SMS only\", the MME shall page the UE
based on the location information stored in the MME; or
\- if the UE is marked as IMSI detached for EPS services or IMSI (implicitly
or explicitly) detached for non-EPS services, or as unreachable, the MME shall
proceed as specified for the case when the service indicator indicates \"CS
call indicator\".
b) If the UE is not known and the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator at the
MME is set to \"false\":
\- the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to that VLR indicating
in the SGs cause information element \"IMSI unknown\".
c) If the UE is not known and the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator at the
MME is set to \"true\", the MME shall handle the paging request as follows:
> \- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area identifier
> information element, the MME shall page the UE in all the tracking areas
> served by the MME that can be mapped to the location area indicated in the
> Location area identifier information element; or
>
> \- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location area
> identifier information element, the MME may page in all the tracking areas
> served by the MME, or the tracking areas served by the MME and by the VLR.
#### 5.1.3.2 Procedure when no NAS signalling connection exists
If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\", the MME shall proceed as follows:
\- If the MME accepts the paging request and no NAS signalling connection
exists, and the VLR TMSI is omitted or the UE is not known in the MME, the
IMSI is used instead of the S-TMSI as a paging address at the radio interface.
If location information is reliably known by the MME (i.e. MME stores the list
of tracking areas), the MME shall page the UE in all the tracking areas. If
the MME does not have a stored tracking area list for the UE, the MME shall
use the location information received from the VLR, if any, to page the UE.
The MME shall take action as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14], subclause
5.6.2.3.
If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\", the MME shall use the S-TMSI as paging
address at the radio interface and take action as described in 3GPP TS 24.301
[14], subclause 5.6.2.4.
Independent of the Service indicator information element, if the MME has
activated Idle mode Signalling Reduction for the UE, the MME shall forward the
paging request to the associated SGSN, as described in 3GPP TS 29.274 [17A].
Independent of the Service indicator information element, the MME shall not
retransmit the paging message to the UE. Additionally, if the MME has
activated Idle mode Signalling Reduction for the UE, the MME shall not
retransmit the paging request to the associated SGSN.
#### 5.1.3.3 Procedure when a NAS signalling connection exists
If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\", the MME shall proceed as follows:
\- If the MME accepts the paging request and a NAS signalling connection
exists, the MME shall send the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message to the UE
through the NAS signalling connection, including the CS service related
parameters (CLI, SS code, LCS indicator and LCS client identity), received
from the VLR.
If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\" and a NAS signalling connection exists,
the MME need not take any action towards the UE.
## 5.2 Location update for non-EPS services procedure
### 5.2.1 General description
The location update for non-EPS services procedure is a general procedure used
by UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over
SGs only. This procedure allows UEs and the network to perform:
\- combined IMSI attach for EPS and non-EPS services or for SMS only;
\- IMSI attach for non-EPS services or for SMS only if the UE is already IMSI
attached for EPS services;
\- normal location update procedure to the VLR if the UE is IMSI attached for
both EPS and non-EPS services, or for SMS only; or
\- allocation of new TMSI to an UE.
The location update for non-EPS services procedure in the SGs interface is
always started as a consequence of a direct action from the UE. The combined
attach and tracking area update procedures are further specified in 3GPP TS
23.272 [7] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [14].
When a UE is IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS services, the VLR shall stop
any implicit detach timer. Instead the MME uses the \"Paging Proceed Flag\" to
determine the likely availability of the UE to the network. Upon reception of
the periodic Tracking Area Update message, the MME does not report to the VLR,
and the MME shall not change the state of the SGs association. When the UE
performs a detach only for EPS services or the MME performs an implicit detach
for EPS services, the EPS detach indication to the VLR shall cause the VLR\'s
implicit detach timer to be restarted from its initial value.
If the MME performs an implicit detach for both EPS and non-EPS services, then
the MME shall send to the VLR an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message with
cause \"Implicit network initiated IMSI detach from non-EPS services\", as
further described in subclause 5.6 (the implicit IMSI detach message indicates
that the UE is unavailable for both EPS and non-EPS services).
### 5.2.2 Procedures in the MME
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The location update for non-EPS services procedure is initiated with a
combined attach or a combined tracking area update procedure. On receipt of an
ATTACH REQUEST message or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message from the UE,
the MME shall handle the EPS related request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301
[14]. The location update for non-EPS services procedure is started by the MME
when it receives the Update Location Answer message containing subscription
data from the HSS. The MME shall wait for the outcome of both location update
procedures towards the VLR and the HSS before sending the response message to
the UE. If the Update Location Answer message indicates that the UE has
subscription for packet only (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [17]), the MME sends the
response message to the UE without starting the location update for non-EPS
services procedure.
#### 5.2.2.2 Location update initiation
If timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME shall start the location update for
non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:
\- an attach request indicating combined EPS/IMSI attach;
\- a combined tracking area update request indicating Combined TA/LA updating
with IMSI attach;
\- a combined tracking area update request and the MME detects that the LAI
has changed;
\- a combined tracking area update request and the state of the SGs
association is SGs-NULL; or
\- a combined tracking area update request and the MME serving the UE has
changed.
If timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME may start the location update for non-
EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:
\- a combined tracking area update request or a periodic tracking area update
, if the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" for the MS is set to \"false\"
(see subclause 5.7.3).
If multiple PLMNs are available for the CS domain, the MME shall select a PLMN
for CS domain as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]. If the MME cannot select any
PLMN for CS domain for the UE, the MME informs the UE that the CS domain is
not available.
The MME shall determine the new location area identification as follows:
\- if the MME received a combined attach request or combined tracking area
update request from the UE with an indication for \"SMS only\", or the network
only supports \"SMS only\" or the network only has a few VLRs that support SGs
interface, the MME may allocate a default location area identification
specifically configured for that case;
\- else the MME derives the location area identification from the current
tracking area identity where the UE is located.
The MME shall derive the VLR name from the location area identification which
was determined. In case multiple VLRs serve this location area identification,
the MME shall use the location area identification and an IMSI hash value to
retrieve the VLR name.The MME shall include the location area identification
in the new location area identifier information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-
UPDATE-REQUEST message.
NOTE: The selection of the VLR in the MME follows the same rule as the
selection of the VLR in the SGSN, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A], and the
same IMSI hash values and IMSI hash tables are used by the MME and the SGSN.
In networks supporting the feature \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to
Multiple CN Nodes\" as defined in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A], the MME shall support
load re-distribution of UEs to another VLR than the current one. When the MME
receives a periodic tracking area update request or a combined tracking area
update request, the MME shall check whether for this UE there is a SGs
association to a VLR for which load re-distribution has been initiated in the
MME by O&M. If this is the case, the MME derives the new VLR name using the
new IMSI hash table configured in the MME. The MME shall then send the SGsAP-
LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected VLR.
The SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message includes the type of location update
performed by the UE in the EPS location update type information element. If
the UE has performed a combined attach or a combined tracking area update
indicating \"combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach\", the MME indicates
\"IMSI attach\", otherwise the MME indicates \"Normal location update\".
The MME shall include the TMSI status in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST
message if the UE indicates in the ATTACH REQUEST or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message that it has no valid TMSI available. The MME shall also
include the old location area identifier in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST
message if the UE included the old location area identification in the ATTACH
REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.
If the MME supports the \"Automatic Device Detection\" (see 3GPP TS 22.101
[2]) or the \"Trace for Management Based Activation/Deactivation\" (see 3GPP
TS 32.422 [18]), the MME shall include the IMEISV in the SGsAP-LOCATION-
UPDATE-REQUEST message.
The MME shall include the UE's current TAI and E-CGI in the SGsAP-LOCATION-
UPDATE-REQUEST message.
When the MME sends the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST, the MME shall start
timer Ts6-1.
If timer Ts6-1 is running and the MME receives from the UE:
\- an attach request indicating combined EPS/IMSI attach; or
\- a combined tracking area update with or without IMSI attach.
Then:
  * if the LAI determined by the MME is the same as in the outstanding request, the MME shall not process this new request and shall wait for the VLR response to the ongoing procedure;
  * if the LAI determined by the MME is different but the VLR name is the same as for previous LAI, any response from the VLR to the outstanding request is ignored, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1 and the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure; or
  * if the LAI determined by the MME is different and the VLR name is different as for previous LAI, any response from the previously addressed VLR to the outstanding request is ignored, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1, and the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure.
When the MME receives from the UE a tracking area update request and the MME
serving the UE has changed, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1.
#### 5.2.2.3 Location update response
If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message from the VLR, the
MME shall stop timer Ts6-1 and:
\- move the state of the SGs association to SGs-ASSOCIATED;
\- set the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" to \"true\"; and
\- indicate to the UE the acceptance of the VLR to the location update
procedure. The message sent to the UE includes the Location Area Identity (see
3GPP TS 24.301 [14]).
The MME shall wait for the outcome of the location update for non-EPS services
procedure towards the VLR before sending a response to location update
procedure to the UE. When the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT
message from the VLR, it will map the reject cause received to the appropriate
reject cause as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14], and report this reject cause
to the UE.
If the VLR included the Mobile identity information element in the SGsAP-
LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message, the MME shall relay the information received
to the UE. If the Mobile identity information element contains a new TMSI,
this will cause the UE to perform a TMSI reallocation procedure. In this case,
the MME shall send to the VLR the SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message
when the MME receives the ATTACH COMPLETE or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE
message from the UE. If the Mobile identity information element contains an
IMSI, this will cause the UE to deallocate its TMSI.
#### 5.2.2.4 Location update failure
If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the VLR, the
MME shall:
\- stop timer Ts6-1;
\- move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL; and
\- indicate to the UE the rejection of the Location Update procedure by the
VLR as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]. The Reject cause value sent by the
VLR shall be mapped to the appropriate reject cause as specified in 3GPP TS
24.301 [14], and the latter is forwarded to the UE.
#### 5.2.2.5 Abnormal cases
If timer Ts6-1 expires, the MME shall abort the Location Update for non-EPS
service procedure and indicate this to the UE with the Reject cause value
\'MSC temporarily not reachable\'. The state of the SGs association to the VLR
shall be SGs-NULL.
If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message and timer Ts6-1 is
not running then:
\- if timer Ts8 is running (see subclause 5.4), the message shall be ignored;
\- if timer Ts9 is running (see subclause 5.5), the message shall be ignored;
or
\- if timers Ts8 and Ts9 are not running:
\- if the state of the SGs association to the VLR is SGs-ASSOCIATED, the
message shall be ignored; or
\- if the state of the SGs association to the VLR is different than SGs-
ASSOCIATED, the message shall be treated as a message incompatible with the
protocol state of the MME (see subclause 7.3).
### 5.2.3 Procedures in the VLR
#### 5.2.3.1 General
When a VLR receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the VLR shall
check whether the IMSI is known. If the IMSI is not known, the VLR shall
retrieve the MM context of the UE from the HSS.
#### 5.2.3.2 Location update response
If the location update is accepted by the VLR and, if necessary, by the HSS,
the VLR shall:
\- move the SGs association to the SGs-ASSOCIATED state;
\- set the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to \"true\";
\- update the SGs association by storing the MME address included in SGsAP-
LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and
\- send an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message to the sending MME. This
message includes the location area identifier received in the New location
area identifier information element in the previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-
REQUEST message.
#### 5.2.3.3 Location update failure
If the location update is rejected by the VLR, the VLR shall:
\- send an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message to the MME with the
appropriate reject cause as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]; and
\- move the SGs association to SGs-NULL.
#### 5.2.3.4 TMSI reallocation procedure
If the VLR decides to allocate a new TMSI to the UE, the VLR shall include the
new TMSI in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message. After sending the SGsAP-
LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message with a new TMSI the VLR shall start timer
Ts6-2. If the VLR decides to deallocate the TMSI of the UE, the VLR shall
include the IMSI of the UE in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message.
Upon receipt of the SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message, the VLR shall
stop the timer Ts6-2 and consider the new TMSI as valid.
If the IMSI was sent to the UE, the VLR considers the old TMSI as deleted.
If no SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message is received by the VLR before
the timer Ts6-2 expires, the VLR aborts the TMSI reallocation procedure. The
outcome of the TMSI reallocation procedure does not change the state of the
SGs association. The VLR uses the IMSI or the new TMSI for paging.
#### 5.2.3.5 Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
i) MM signalling via A or Iu interface
> If the VLR receives a Location Update request or an IMSI detach indication
> from the UE by the A or Iu interface when the state of the SGs association
> in the VLR is not SGs-NULL, the VLR shall move the state of the SGs
> association to SGs-NULL.
ii) Additional Location Update Request
> If the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT and an
> SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message is received, then:
\- if the message is from the same MME and indicates the same New location
area identifier information element as the outstanding location update
request, then the VLR shall ignore this additional SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-
REQUEST message;
\- if the message is from the same MME but indicates a different New location
area identifier information element to the outstanding location update
request, then the VLR shall treat this additional SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-
REQUEST message and the VLR shall not send any response to the previous SGsAP-
LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; or
\- if the message is from a different MME (indicating either the same or
different New location area identifier information element) to the outstanding
location update request, then the VLR shall treat this additional SGsAP-
LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the VLR shall not send any response to the
previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.
iii) Detach signalling from the MME
> If the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT and
> either an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION or an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION
> message is received, then the VLR shall abandon the Location Update for non-
> EPS services procedure (neither an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor an
> SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT messages is sent) and the further actions
> described in subclauses 5.4 or 5.5 or 5.6 are followed.
iv) Signalling via Gs interface
> If the VLR receives for a UE a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message (as
> defined in 3GPP TS 29.018 [16]) from an SGSN when the state of the SGs
> association for this UE in the VLR is not SGs-NULL, the VLR shall move the
> state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL.
## 5.3 Non-EPS alert procedure
### 5.3.1 General description
This procedure is used by the VLR to request from an MME an indication when
any signalling activity from the UE is detected. This procedure can be invoked
at any time by the VLR. The MME shall acknowledge the SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST
message.
### 5.3.2 Procedures in the VLR
#### 5.3.2.1 Alert Initiation
The VLR may start the Non-EPS alert procedure at any time. When the VLR wants
to request from an MME that further activity from a UE is reported by the MME,
the VLR shall send an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message to that MME. The VLR starts
timer Ts7 when the SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message is sent.
#### 5.3.2.2 Alert Response
When an SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message is received, the VLR shall stop the timer Ts7.
The state of the SGs association is not changed.
#### 5.3.2.3 Alert Failure
If an SGsAP-ALERT-REJECT message is received, the VLR shall stop the timer
Ts7, move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL and within this state
the SGs association is marked with the contents of the SGs cause information
element.
#### 5.3.2.4 Alert Indication
The VLR shall not change the state of the SGs association upon reception of an
SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message.
#### 5.3.2.5 Abnormal cases
If no SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message is received before the timer Ts7 expires, the
VLR shall retransmit the SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message a maximum of Ns7 times.
NOTE: If no SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message is received after that, a report is made
to the O&M system. The state of the SGs association is not changed.
### 5.3.3 Procedures in the MME
#### 5.3.3.1 Alert response
The MME may receive an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message in any state of the SGs
association. Upon receipt of an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message from the VLR and
if the IMSI is known in the MME, the MME shall reply with an SGsAP-ALERT-ACK
message and set the NEAF. If the MME has activated Idle mode Signaling
Reduction for the UE, the MME shall send an Alert MME Notification message to
the associated SGSN, as described in 3GPP TS 29.274 [17A], except for the
conditions specified in subclause 8.2.5c of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7].
#### 5.3.3.2 Alert failure
If an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message is received for an IMSI that is unknown at
the MME, the MME shall return an SGsAP-ALERT-REJECT message to the VLR
indicating the SGs cause information element value \"IMSI unknown\".
#### 5.3.3.3 Alert indication
The MME shall report to the VLR upon detection of any activity in E-UTRAN
(either signalling or, indirectly detected via S-GW, data transfer) from the
UE if the NEAF is set. If the MME detects EPS signalling that leads to a
procedure towards the VLR, the MME shall follow this procedure and reset the
NEAF. If the MME detects activity that does not lead to any procedure towards
the VLR, the MME shall send an SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message towards
the VLR and reset the NEAF. Upon receipt of a UE Activity Notification message
from the SGSN, the MME shall reply with a UE Activity Acknowledge message,
send an SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message to the VLR and reset the NEAF
flag.
## 5.4 Explicit IMSI detach from EPS services
### 5.4.1 General description
This procedure is used by the MME to indicate to the VLR that the UE has been
detached from EPS services and therefore the SGs association between the MME
and the VLR has to be deactivated. This procedure only applies to UEs which
are not in the SGs-NULL state at the MME. The procedures specified in this
subclause apply to EPS detach indication initiated by the UE or by the network
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14].
The procedure is also used by the MME to indicate to the VLR when a combined
tracking area update procedure has been rejected by the MME or the MME
receives the Detach Notification from the SGSN, as described in 3GPP TS 29.274
[17A], when Idle mode Signalling Reduction is activated.
The Explicit IMSI detach from EPS services procedure aborts any other ongoing
procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the MME and in the VLR.
### 5.4.2 Procedures in the MME
#### 5.4.2.1 Explicit EPS detach indication
The MME shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to a VLR if:
\- the MME receives a detach for EPS from the UE;
\- the MME performs network initiated EPS detach procedure;
\- the combined tracking area update procedure is rejected by the MME; or
\- the MME receives a Detach Notification from the SGSN with the Detach type
indicating \"PS Detach\".
If the MME receives a Detach Request from a UE or Detach Notification from an
SGSN and the state of the SGs association to a VLR for that UE is not SGs-
NULL, the MME shall check the detach type indicated in the Detach Request
message or the detach type indicated in the Detach Notification message. If
the UE has indicated EPS detach the MME shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-
INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"UE initiated IMSI detach from EPS
services\".
If the MME decides to perform a network initiated detach procedure and the
state of the SGs association to a VLR for that MS is not SGs-NULL, the MME
shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"MME
initiated IMSI detach from EPS services\".
If the combined tracking area update procedure is rejected at the MME for a UE
with an SGs association state different from SGs-NULL, the MME shall send an
SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION to the VLR indicating \"EPS services not
allowed\".
After sending of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the MME shall move
the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall start timer Ts8
upon transmission of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message and the MME shall
stop and reset timer Ts6-1 if running.
#### 5.4.2.2 Explicit EPS detach response
If a confirmation of the detach needs to be sent to the UE, the MME shall not
wait for the reception of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message to send such
confirmation.
#### 5.4.2.3 Abnormal cases
If no SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message is received by the MME in response to a
previous SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer Ts8 expires, the MME
shall repeat the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns8 times.
NOTE: If no SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message is received after that, a report is
made to the O&M system. The state of the SGs association during the
acknowledgement procedure remains SGs-NULL.
### 5.4.3 Procedures in the VLR
When a VLR receives an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR shall send
an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message to the sending MME. The VLR shall check the
MME name indicated in the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message. If the received
MME name is not changed comparing to the MME name stored in the VLR, the VLR
shall move the state of the SGs association for the UE from any state to SGs-
NULL and marks the SGs association as \"detached for EPS services\" with the
reason indicated in the IMSI detach from EPS service type information element.
Otherwise, the VLR shall discard the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message and
the state of the SGs association shall not be changed.
If the VLR's implicit detach timer is not running then the VLR shall set and
restart the implicit detach timer upon reception of an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-
INDICATION message. If the VLR's implicit detach timer is running (the state
of the SGs association was already SGs-NULL) then the reception of an SGsAP-
EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message shall not affect VLR's implicit detach timer.
## 5.5 Explicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services
### 5.5.1 General description
This procedure is used by the MME to indicate to the VLR that the UE has
performed IMSI detach from non-EPS services and therefore the SGs association
between the MME and the VLR has to be deactivated. This procedure applies only
to UEs for which there is a SGs association at the MME. The procedures
specified in this subclause apply only to IMSI detach request, combined IMSI
and EPS detach requests from the UE or Detach Notification message from an
SGSN.
The explicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services procedure aborts any other
ongoing procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the MME and in
the VLR.
In order to ensure that the VLR and the UE are synchronized as to which paging
channel to use for any of the subsequent paging events, the MME shall attempt
to inform the VLR about the detach event by using a retry scheme if the
initial delivery of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message fails.
### 5.5.2 Procedures in the MME
#### 5.5.2.1 Explicit IMSI detach initiation
When an MME receives a Detach Request from a UE for which an SGs association
exists, the MME shall check the detach type indicated. If the UE is indicating
IMSI detach or combined EPS/IMSI detach, the MME shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-
DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"Explicit UE initiated IMSI
detach from non-EPS services\" or \"Combined UE initiated IMSI detach from EPS
and non-EPS services\".
When an MME receives a Detach Notification message for a UE from an SGSN and
an SGs association for the UE exists, the MME shall check the cause and detach
type indicated. If the cause is indicating \"IMSI Detach only\", the MME shall
send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"Explicit
UE initiated IMSI detach from non-EPS services\". If the cause is indicating
\"Complete Detach\" and detach type is indicating \"Combined PS/CS Detach\" as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.274 [17A], the MME shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-
INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"Combined UE initiated IMSI detach
from EPS and non-EPS services\".
After the sending of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR, the
MME shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall
start timer Ts9 upon transmission of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message
and the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1, if running.
#### 5.5.2.2 Explicit IMSI detach response
If the detach type received from the UE indicated IMSI only detach or combined
EPS/IMSI detach not due to switch off, the MME shall wait for the reception of
the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message before sending the confirmation of the
detach to the UE.
#### 5.5.2.3 Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
i) no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK received for a detach with switch off
> If the MME sent an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message for a combined IMSI
> and EPS detach due to switch off and timer Ts9 expires, the MME shall repeat
> the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns9 times.
ii) no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK received for a detach with no switch off
> If the MME sent an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message for an IMSI only
> detach or a combined IMSI and EPS detach not due to switch off and timer Ts9
> expires, the MME shall repeat the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a
> maximum of Ns9 times. If no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK is received after that the
> MME shall send the confirmation of the detach to the UE.
### 5.5.3 Procedures in the VLR
When a VLR receives an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR shall
send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message to the sending MME. The VLR shall move
the state of the SGs association for the UE from any state to SGs-NULL. If the
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message indicated \"Explicit UE initiated IMSI
detach from non-EPS services\", the VLR marks the SGs association as \"IMSI
detached for non-EPS services\". If the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message
indicated \"Combined UE initiated IMSI detach from EPS and non-EPS services\",
the VLR marks the SGs association as \"IMSI detached for EPS and non-EPS
services\".
## 5.6 Implicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services
### 5.6.1 General description
This procedure is used by the MME to indicate when an internal MME timer
mechanism has caused the MME to delete the EMM context of an UE or mark its
EMM context as detached. This procedure only applies to UEs for which there is
an SGs association at the MME.
The implicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services procedure aborts any other
ongoing procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the MME and in
the VLR.
In order to ensure that the VLR and the UE are synchronized as to which paging
channel to use for any of the subsequent paging events the MME shall attempt
to inform the VLR about the detach event by using a retry scheme if the
initial delivery of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message fails.
### 5.6.2 Procedures in the MME
When the implicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services procedure is started for a
UE by the above mentioned internal MME timer mechanism, the MME shall send an
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"Implicit network
initiated IMSI detach from non-EPS services\".
After the sending of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the MME shall
move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall start timer
Ts10 upon transmission of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message.
If no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message is received by the MME to a previous
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer Ts10 expires, the MME shall
repeat the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns10 times. The
state of the SGs association during the acknowledgement procedure remains SGs-
NULL.
### 5.6.3 Procedures in the VLR
When a VLR receives the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message and the state of
the SGs association is not SGs-NULL, the VLR shall move the state of the SGs
association for the UE to SGs-NULL. The VLR marks the SGs association as
\"IMSI implicitly detached for EPS and non-EPS services\". The VLR shall also
send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message to the sending MME.
When a VLR receives the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message and the state of
the SGs association is SGs-NULL, the VLR shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK
message to the sending MME.
## 5.7 VLR failure procedure
### 5.7.1 General description
This procedure is used by the VLR to inform the MMEs with an SGs association
about the recovery from an internal failure that has affected the SGs
association with the MMEs.
NOTE: The VLR recovery procedure is handled in such a way that the signalling
load on the VLR and MMEs does not create any overload problem.
### 5.7.2 Procedures in the VLR
#### 5.7.2.1 VLR Reset Initiation
In the event of a failure at the VLR which has resulted in the loss of the SGs
association information for some UEs, the VLR shall move from any state to the
SGs-NULL state for all the SGs associations with MMEs per UE. The VLR shall
also set the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to \"false\"
(see 3GPP TS 23.007 [4]). The VLR shall not send any SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-
REQUEST messages to UEs with the SGs association in the SGs-NULL state.
When the VLR restarts, the VLR shall send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message to
all the MMEs connected to the VLR by the SGs interface. This message indicates
to the MME that for the UEs with an SGs association to that VLR, the SGs
associations are no longer reliable. The VLR shall also start a separate timer
Ts11 for each MME.
#### 5.7.2.2 VLR Reset Response
Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message from an MME, the VLR shall stop the
timer Ts11 for that MME.
#### 5.7.2.3 Abnormal cases
If the VLR does not receive an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message from that MME before
the timer Ts11 expires, the VLR shall retransmit the SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION
message. The retransmission is repeated a maximum of Ns11 times.
NOTE: If no SGsAP-RESET-ACK is received after that a report is made to the O&M
system.
### 5.7.3 Procedures in the MME
Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the VLR, the MME is
informed that all the SGs associations with that VLR for all the UEs
registered in the MME are no longer reliable because the VLR has lost
information about the state of the UEs and during the failure the VLR might
have missed signalling messages. The MME shall set the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM
context variable to \"false\". The detach procedures for deleting the SGs
association are still applicable (see subclauses 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6). If the
\"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable is set to \"false\", upon reception of a
Combined Tracking Area update request or a periodic Tracking Area Update from
the UE that is attached for non-EPS service, the MME may request the re-attach
to non-EPS services, or may alternatively immediately perform the Location
Update for non-EPS services procedure towards the VLR as described in
subclause 5.2.
The MME sends an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message to the VLR.
## 5.8 MME failure procedure
### 5.8.1 General description
This procedure is used by the MME to inform the associated VLRs about the
recovery from an internal failure that has affected the SGs association with
the VLRs.
NOTE: The MME recovery procedure is handled in such a way that the signalling
load on the MME and VLRs does not create any overload problem.
### 5.8.2 Procedures in the MME
#### 5.8.2.1 MME Reset Initiation
In the event of a failure at the MME which has resulted in the loss of the SGs
association information on some UEs, the MME shall move from any state to the
SGs-NULL state all the SGs associations with VLRs per UE. The MME shall also
set the \"MME-Reset\" MM context variable to \"true\" and start the timer
Ts12-1. When the timer Ts12-1 expires the \"MME-Reset\" MM context variable is
set to \"false\".
The MME may send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message to all the VLRs connected
to the MME by SGs interfaces. The SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message indicates to
the VLR that all the SGs associations with that particular MME for all the UEs
registered in the VLR are no longer reliable. The normal procedures for
updating the SGs association are still applicable (see subclauses 5.2, 5.4,
5.5 and 5.6). The MME shall also start a separate timer Ts12-2 for each VLR.
If the MME does not send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message, the MME shall move
from any state to the SGs-NULL state only the associations of the UEs affected
by the loss of VLR association information.
NOTE: The option to not send any SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message to all the
VLRs connected to the MME by SGs interfaces reduces subsequent paging
signalling initiated by VLRs by avoiding a complete search of the UE on the
entire VLR area.
#### 5.8.2.2 MME Reset Response
Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message, the MME shall stop the timer
Ts12-2 for that VLR.
#### 5.8.2.3 Abnormal cases
If the MME does not receive an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message from that VLR before
the timer Ts12-2 expires, the MME shall retransmit the SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION
message. The retransmission is repeated a maximum of Ns12 times.
NOTE: If no SGsAP-RESET-ACK is received after that a report is made to the O&M
system.
### 5.8.3 Procedures in the VLR
Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME, the VLR is
informed that all the SGs associations with that MME for all the UEs
registered in the MME are no longer reliable because the MME has lost
information about the state of the UEs for that VLR and during the failure the
MME might have missed signalling messages. The VLR shall either:
\- set the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to \"false\"
in all the SGs associations containing the restarted MME and set the state of
all the SGs associations containing the restarted MME to the SGs-NULL state;
or
\- keep the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indication and the
state of all the SGs associations containing the restarted MME unchanged.
NOTE: The option to not set the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration
indicator to \'false\' in all the associations containing the restarted MME
reduces subsequent paging signalling the VLR can initiate by avoiding a
complete search of the UE on the entire VLR area.
The VLR shall then send an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message to the MME.
If the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is \"false\" the
VLR may send paging messages on both the SGs and the A/Iu interface.
## 5.9 HSS failure
### 5.9.1 General description
This subclause describes the MME behaviour towards the VLR as a consequence of
an HSS reset.
In the case of an HSS failure, the HSS informs the associated MMEs about the
recovery from an internal failure that has affected the SGs association with
the MMEs according to the HSS reset procedure specified in 3GPP TS **29.272**
**[17]**.
This information is used in the MME to trigger the VLR to perform a location
update towards the HSS in order to restore the HSS subscriber data.
### 5.9.2 Procedures in the MME
Upon receipt of a HSS reset indication from the HSS, the MME shall set the
NEAF for all registered UEs in the MME for which a valid SGs association with
a VLR exists.
Upon detection of any signalling activity from the UE, the MME shall report to
the VLR if the NEAF, as defined in subclause 5.3.3, is set for this UE. If the
MME detects signalling that leads to a procedure towards the VLR, the MME
shall follow this procedure and reset the NEAF. If the MME detects activity
that does not lead to any procedure towards the VLR, the MME shall send an
SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message towards the VLR and reset the NEAF. The
MME may delay sending the activity indication for a maximum operator-
configuration depending time period to avoid high signalling load.
## 5.10 MM information procedure
### 5.10.1 General description
The MM information procedure is performed between the VLR and the MME via the
SGs interface if the target UE for the MM information procedure is IMSI
attached to both EPS and non-EPS services (i.e. the state of the SGs
association is SGs-ASSOCIATED). The outcome of the MM Information procedure
does not change the state of the SGs association at the VLR or MME.
### 5.10.2 Procedures in the VLR
If for the target UE for the MM information procedure the state of the SGs
association in the VLR is SGs-ASSOCIATED, the VLR may initiate the MM
information procedure by transferring an SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST message
to the MME.
### 5.10.3 Procedures in the MME
If an SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST message is received for a UE for which
there exists an SGs association at the MME, the MME shall forward the contents
of the MM information information element to the UE indicated in the SGsAP-MM-
INFORMATION-REQUEST message, using an EMM INFORMATION message as defined in
3GPP TS 24.301 [14].
## 5.11 Procedure for tunnelling of NAS messages
### 5.11.1 General description
The tunnelling of NAS messages procedure is used to encapsulate the NAS
messages exchanged between the UE and the VLR. This procedure can be used by
either the VLR or the MME depending on the direction of the NAS message. The
two procedures are identified as uplink unitdata, in the direction from the
MME to the VLR, and downlink unitdata in the direction from the VLR to the
MME.
### 5.11.2 Uplink unitdata procedure
#### 5.11.2.1 Procedures in the MME
When the MME receives an Uplink NAS Transport message (see 3GPP TS 24.301
[14]) from a UE, the MME shall copy the value part of the NAS message
container information element to the value part of the NAS message container
information element of the SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA message and send the SGsAP-
UPLINK-UNITDATA message to the VLR.
In order to permit the VLR to create an accurate charging record, the MME
shall add the IMEISV, the UE Time Zone, the Mobile Station Classmark 2, and
the UE's current TAI and E-CGI to the SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA message.
#### 5.11.2.2 Procedures in the VLR
Upon reception of an SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA, the VLR shall extract the NAS
message container information element and treat the value part of this
information element according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.011
[10].
Other parameters in the message may be used as specified in 3GPP TS 32.250
[17B] and 3GPP TS 23.078 [5AA].
#### 5.11.2.3 Abnormal cases
The following abnormal case can be identified:
i) if there is no SGs association for the UE at the VLR
If the VLR receives an SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA from the MME for a UE for which
no SGs association exists, then the VLR shall ignore the received message.
### 5.11.3 Downlink unitdata procedure
#### 5.11.3.1 Procedures in the VLR
When the VLR needs to send a NAS message to the UE, the VLR shall first verify
whether or not it has an SGs association for the UE. If the state of the SGs
association for the UE is SGs-ASSOCIATED and LA-UPDATE-PRESENT, then the VLR
continues with the procedure. The VLR shall build and encapsulate the NAS
message into the value part of the NAS message container information element
of an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message and send the SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA
message to the MME.
#### 5.11.3.2 Procedures in the MME
Upon reception of an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message, the MME shall copy the
value part of the NAS message container information element to the value part
of the NAS message container information element of a Downlink NAS Transport
message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]) and send the Downlink NAS Transport message
to the UE.
#### 5.11.3.3 Abnormal cases
The following abnormal case can be identified:
i) if there is no SGs association for the UE at the MME
If the MME receives an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message from the VLR for a UE
for which there is no SGs association, then the MME shall ignore the received
message.
### 5.11.4 Release procedure
When the VLR determines that there are no more NAS messages to be exchanged
between the VLR and the UE, the VLR shall send the SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST
message to the MME, including the IMSI of the UE for which there are no more
NAS messages to be tunnelled.
NOTE: For the SMS transport, the VLR can send the SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST
message when the SMS transaction is complete (reception of a CP-ACK message
for the MO case, sending of a CP-ACK message for the MT case), upon reception
of a CP-ERROR message, abort of SMS transaction by upper layers, or upon some
error cases such as TC1 expiry.
This indication can be used by the MME to control the release of the NAS
signalling connection with the UE indicated in the SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST
message.
## 5.12 Service request procedure
### 5.12.1 General description
After the reception of an SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message from the VLR, the MME
will use this procedure to indicate to the VLR that a NAS signalling
connection exists between the UE and the MME. The procedure can be invoked, by
the MME, either upon reception of a Service Request message from the UE or
directly after receiving the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message from the VLR, based
on the UE's EMM mode.
### 5.12.2 Procedures in the MME
When receiving the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, the MME shall first take
action as described in subclause 5.1.3 and check whether the UE, for which the
paging is sent, is in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode.
If the MME accepts the paging request, the MME shall proceed as follows:
\- If the UE was in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall immediately create and
send an SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message to the VLR. If the UE subsequently
rejects the CS fallback call, the MME shall send the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT
message to the VLR with the SGs cause information element indicating \"Mobile
terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\"; or
\- If the UE was in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME shall send the SGsAP-SERVICE-
REQUEST message to the VLR when the UE enters EMM-CONNECTED mode.
In both EMM-IDLE and EMM-CONNECTED modes, the MME shall set the service
indicator in the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message equal to what was received in
the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. Additionally, in order to permit the VLR to
create an accurate charging record, the MME shall add the IMEISV, the UE Time
Zone, the Mobile Station Classmark 2, and the UE\'s current TAI and E-CGI to
the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message.
### 5.12.3 Procedures in the VLR
Upon reception of the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message, the VLR shall stop Timer
Ts5 and consider the paging procedure as successful. If the paging procedure
is for SMS, the VLR shall then start the delivery of the SMS message(s)
according to the subclause 5.11.3.1. If the paging procedure with the Service
indicator information element indicating \"SMS Indicator\" was triggered upon
reception of a Provide Subscriber Information Request message, the VLR can
return an SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST message to the MME as specified in subclause
7.2.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.018 [5].
Other parameters in the message may be used as specified in 3GPP TS 32.250
[17B] and 3GPP TS 23.078 [5AA].
## 5.13 Implicit IMSI detach from EPS services
### 5.13.1 General description
This procedure is used by the MME to indicate when an internal MME timer
mechanism has caused the MME to delete the EMM context of an UE or mark its
EMM context as detached. This procedure only applies to UEs for which there is
an SGs association at the MME and the network operating in NMO I and
supporting ISR.
The implicit IMSI detach from EPS services procedure aborts any other ongoing
procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the MME and in the VLR.
In order to ensure that the VLR and the UE are synchronized as to which paging
channel to use for any of the subsequent paging events the MME shall attempt
to inform the VLR about the detach event by using a retry scheme if the
initial delivery of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message fails.
### 5.13.2 Procedures in the MME
When the implicit IMSI detach from EPS services procedure is started for a UE
by the above mentioned internal MME timer mechanism, the MME shall send an
SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"Network initiated
IMSI detach from EPS services\".
After the sending of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the MME shall
move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall start timer
Ts13 upon transmission of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message.
If no SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message is received by the MME to a previous SGsAP-
EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer Ts13 expires, the MME shall repeat
the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns10 times. The state of
the SGs association during the acknowledgement procedure remains SGs-NULL.
### 5.13.3 Procedures in the VLR
When a VLR receives an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR shall
perform the procedures described in subclause 5.4.3.
# 6 SGs transport
## 6.1 General
This subclause specifies the standards for signalling transport to be used
across SGs interface. SGs interface is a logical interface between the MME and
the VLR. All the SGsAP messages described in the present document require an
SCTP association between the MME and the VLR.
## 6.2 IP layer
The MME and the VLR shall support IPv6 (see IETF RFC 2460 [22]) and/or IPv4
(see IETF RFC 791 [20]).
The IP layer of SGs only supports point-to-point transmission for delivering
SGsAP messages.
## 6.3 Transport layer
SCTP (see IETF RFC 4960 [23]) shall be supported as the transport layer of
SGsAP messages.
Semi-permanent SCTP associations shall be established between the MME and VLR,
i.e. the SCTP associations shall remain up under normal circumstances.
Transport network redundancy can be achieved by SCTP multi-homing between two
end-points, of which one or both is assigned with multiple IP addresses. SCTP
end-points shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP end-point. For SCTP
endpoint redundancy, an SCTP endpoint (in the MME or VLR) may send an INIT, at
any time for an already established SCTP association, which the other SCTP
endpoint shall handle as defined in IETF RFC 4960 [23].
MME and VLR shall support a configuration with a single SCTP association per
MME/VLR pair. Configurations with multiple SCTP endpoints per MME/VLR pair may
be supported.
Within the SCTP association established between one MME and one VLR, both MME
and VLR shall reserve several stream identifiers, based on the INIT message
exchange for the sole use of SGsAP procedures.
The MME shall establish the SCTP association.
The registered port number for SGsAP is 29118.
The payload protocol identifier to be used for SGsAP is 0.
# 7 Error handling
## 7.1 General
This subclause specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen,
and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity (i.e. the MME or the VLR).
These procedures are called \"error handling procedures\", but in addition to
providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility
mechanism for future extensions of the protocol.
In this subclause the following terminology is used:
\- an information element is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a
message if it contains at least one value defined as \"reserved\", or if its
value part violates coding rules. However, it is not a syntactical error that
an information element indicates in its Length Indicator a greater length than
defined in the relevant subclause; and
\- a message is defined to have semantically incorrect contents if it contains
information which, possibly dependant on the state of the receiver, is in
contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to the procedural part
of current specification.
When a receiving entity detects the need to send an SGsAP-STATUS message (see
errors detailed below), the entity shall copy the IMSI information element
value (if included) of the incorrect message to the IMSI information element
of the SGsAP-STATUS message. The message in error is also included in the
SGsAP-STATUS message. Both the receiving and the sending entity shall abandon
the procedure related to the incorrect message and return to the state from
where the procedure related to the incorrect message was started.
Both the receiving and the sending entity shall inform the O&M entity upon
sending or receiving an SGsAP-STATUS message.
The next subclauses shall be applied in order of precedence.
## 7.2 Message too short
When the receiving entity receives a message that is too short to contain a
complete message type information element, the receiving entity shall ignore
that message.
## 7.3 Unknown or unforeseen message type
The entity receiving a message with a message type not defined or not
implemented shall ignore the message. The receiving entity shall return an
SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to \"message
unknown\" and the Erroneous message information element containing the
received message.
The entity receiving a message that is not compatible with the protocol state
shall return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element
set to \"message not compatible with the protocol state\" and the erroneous
message.
The entity receiving a message that is not defined to be received by that
entity (i.e. the message is sent in the wrong direction) shall treat the
message as unknown message and shall ignore the message. The entity shall
return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to
\"message unknown\" and the Erroneous message information element containing
the received message.
## 7.4 Missing mandatory information element
When the receiving entity diagnoses a \"missing mandatory information
element\" error, the receiving entity shall ignore the message and return an
SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to \"missing
mandatory information element\" and shall return the Erroneous message
information element containing the received message.
## 7.5 Information elements unknown or unforeseen in the message
The receiving entity shall ignore all information elements unknown or
unforeseen in a message.
## 7.6 Out of sequence information elements
The receiving entity shall ignore all information elements that are out of
sequence.
## 7.7 Repeated information elements
If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a message
in which repetition of the information element is not specified, the receiving
entity shall only handle the contents of the information element appearing
first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element.
When repetition of information elements is specified, the receiving entity
shall only handle the contents of specified repeated information elements. If
the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded, the receiving
entity shall handle the contents of information elements appearing first up to
the limit of repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the
information element.
## 7.8 Syntactically incorrect mandatory information element.
On receipt of a message which contains a syntactically incorrect mandatory
information element, the receiver shall ignore the message and return an
SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to \"invalid
mandatory information\" and shall return the Erroneous message information
element containing the received message.
## 7.9 Syntactically incorrect optional information elements
The receiving entity shall treat all optional information elements that are
syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.
## 7.10 Conditional information element errors
When the entity receiving a message diagnoses a \"missing conditional
information element\" error or an \"unexpected conditional information
element\" error or when it receives a message containing at least one
syntactically incorrect conditional information element which is required to
be present in the message, the receiving entity shall ignore the message and
return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to
\"conditional information element error\" and shall return the Erroneous
message information element containing the received message.
When the entity receives a message containing a syntactically incorrect
conditional information element which is not required to be present in the
message, nor required to be absent in the message, then the receiving entity
shall ignore that information element.
## 7.11 Information elements with semantically incorrect contents
When an information element with semantically incorrect contents is received,
the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of the present specification are
performed.
If however no such reactions are specified, the receiving entity shall ignore
that information element and treat the rest of the message. If, because this
information element was ignored, the rest of the message can no longer be
handled then the receiving entity shall return an SGsAP-STATUS message with
the SGs cause information element set to \"semantically incorrect message\"
and shall return the Erroneous message information element containing the
received message.

This information element represents the identity to be used for (and then by)
the UE.
If this information element is an IMSI, then the UE is not allocated any TMSI
(and deletes any TMSI accordingly). If this information element is a TMSI,
then the UE will use this TMSI as the new temporary identity (the UE deletes
its old TMSI and stores the new TMSI). If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI are
included in this information element, the old TMSI, if any available, will be
kept.
## 8.10 SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message
