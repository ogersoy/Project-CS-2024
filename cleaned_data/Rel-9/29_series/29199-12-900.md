The present document is Part 12 of the Stage 3 Parlay X Web Services
specification for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Multimedia Conference Web Service aspects
of the interface. All aspects of the Multimedia Conference Web Service are
defined here, these being:
  * Name spaces.
  * Sequence diagrams.
  * Data definitions.
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions.
  * Fault definitions.
  * Service policies.
  * WSDL Description of the interfaces.
The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

# 4 Detailed service description
The Multimedia Conferencing is a simple Web Service that allows the creation
of a multimedia conference and the dynamic management of the participants
involved.
The underlying model of the service is based on the following entities:
  * **Conference:** a \"context\" (uniquely identified) to which > participants can be added/removed.
  * **Participant:** each of the parties involved in the conference. > There may exist a participant that is also the \"owner\" of the > conference, i.e. the user who can end the call and/or be the > reference user for billing purposes.
  * **Media:** the conference can utilize multiple media streams to > support the participants\' communication. In particular both audio > and video streams are available, including the specific stream > direction (i.e. in, out, bidirectional).
NOTE: A call session allows the application to avail of other web service
features that can add value to the created call session. For example the Audio
Call web service can provide multimedia message delivery to call participants
in the call session (playXXXMessage operation) and furthermore control of the
media streams for the call participants thus enabling conversational
multimedia communication including voice, video, chat, and data. Media can be
added/removed for participants using the operations
**addMediaForParticipants** and **deleteMediaForParticipants** in Audio Call
An application setting up a multimedia conference must initially invoke the
**createConference** operation. The result of such invocation is the creation
of a \"context\" that represents a \"virtual\" room where users can \"meet\".
A unique identifier, a callSessionIdentifier is assigned to the just-created
conference. At this stage no participant is connected yet.
Subsequently the application may wish to add participants to the conference.
In order to do so the operation **inviteParticipant** can be used. The result
of such operation is to alert the user of the incoming connection request
(e.g. the user\'s terminal rings).
If the application wishes to check whether the user has accepted the
invitation (i.e. is connected) it can invoke (at a later time) the
**getParticipantInfo** operation.
Note that:
  * As soon as the first participant connects, the conference becomes > \"active\". The duration of the conference is then measured > starting from the moment the conference has became active.
  * The initial media set utilized by the participant will depend on the > conference type and the media actually supported by the > participant\'s terminal.
During the conference session the application is able to:
  * Add (or remove) a specific media stream to a single participant: > e.g. adding a video bidirectional stream to a participant that has > an audio connection to the conference. This can be obtained by > invoking the media control (**addMediaForParticipants** and the > **deleteMediaForParticipants)** operations of the Audio Call web > service.
  * Disconnect a participant from the conference, by invoking the > **disconnectParticipant** operation.
  * Retrieve information related to the conference and its status, by > invoking **getConferenceInfo** and **getParticipants.**
There are different conditions that can determine the end of the conference:
1) The application may invoke the operation **endConference** , that >
\"forces\" the termination of the conference and the disconnection > of all
participants.
2) The owner of the conference (if defined) leaves the conference. If > the
owner is not defined this condition will apply when all the > participants
have left the conference (disconnected).
3) The conference duration exceeds a maximum value (specified during > the
conference creation step).
# 5 Namespaces
The Multimedia Conference interface uses the namespace:
> http://www.csapi.org/wsdl/parlayx/multimedia_conference/v4_0
The data types are defined in the namespace:
> http://www.csapi.org/schema/parlayx/multimedia_conference/v4_0
The \'xsd\' namespace is used in the present document to refer to the XML
Schema data types defined in XML Schema [5]. The use of the name \'xsd\' is
not semantically significant.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: MultimediaConference
The MultimediaConference interface can be used by an application for creating
a multimedia conference call and for dynamically managing the participants
involved in the call.
### 8.1.1 Operation: createConference
The invocation of **createConference** requests to create a multi-media
conference with initially no participants connected. The reference to the new
multimedia conference is returned in the output parameter.
The conference termination can be driven either by a user action or by the
expiring of a maximum duration. In particular, three possible situations are
considered. In the first scenario, the concept of the \"conference owner\" is
used. This user that has the control of the call and when the conference owner
leaves the conference, all users are disconnected (such a user could be for
instance the reference for the conference billing). In this scenario, the
optional parameter **conferenceOwner** is present in the method call.
In the second scenario, the conference is terminated when the last participant
abandons (in this case the parameter **conferenceOwner** is not present).
A third case is when the optional parameter **maximumDuration** is present: in
this situation, when the maximum duration is reached, the conference is
terminated.
The selection of the scenario depends on the presence of the optional
parameters; if no optional parameter is present, the conference end condition
is the disconnection of the last user in conference, if both are present, the
conference is terminated when the duration expires (this case could happen if
the information concerning the conference owner is needed for billing
purposes).
The values **maximumDuration** and **maximumNumberOfParticipants** must not
exceed the corresponding service policies otherwise a policy exception is
raised.
#### 8.1.1.1 Input message: createConferenceRequest
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description ConferenceType xsd:string Yes
Conference type, i.e. one of a list of operator-specific identifiers that
indicates how the conference is rendered on the terminals
ConferenceDescription xsd:string No A text describing the conference Charging
common:ChargingInformation Yes If present, defines the charge per unit of time
consumed on the conference call. If the service does not support charging, a
PolicyException (POL0008) will be returned. MaximumDuration xsd:int Yes If
present it represents the maximum duration of the multimedia conference in
seconds. If this parameter is present, it represents the end condition of the
conference. MaximumNumberOfParticipants xsd:int No Maximum number of
participants allowed ConferenceOwner xsd:anyURI Yes It is the address of the
multimedia conference owner. If this parameter is present, and the
maximumDuration is not present, the conference is terminated when this user
disconnects, else this information can be used for billing or other purpose
