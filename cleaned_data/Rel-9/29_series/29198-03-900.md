# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 3 of the Stage 3 specification for an Application
Programming Interface (API) for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardised
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Framework aspects of the interface. All
aspects of the Framework are defined in the present document, these being:
  * Sequence Diagrams;
  * Class Diagrams;
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions;
  * State Transition diagrams;
  * Data definitions;
  * IDL Description of the interfaces.
  * WSDL Description of the interfaces
  * Reference to the Javaâ„¢ API description of the interfaces
The process by which this task is accomplished is through the use of object
modelling techniques described by the Unified Modelling Language (UML).
This specification has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group, in co-operation with a number of JAINâ„¢ Community
member companies.

# 4 Overview of the Framework
This clause explains which basic mechanisms are executed in the OSA Framework
prior to offering and activating applications.
The Framework API contains interfaces between the Application Server and the
Framework, between Network Service Capability Server (SCS) and the Framework,
and between the Enterprise Operator and the Framework (these interfaces are
represented by the yellow circles in the figure below). The description of the
Framework in the present document separates the interfaces into three distinct
sets: Framework to Application interfaces, Framework to Enterprise Operator
interfaces and Framework to Service interfaces.
Some of the mechanisms are applied only once (e.g. establishment of service
agreement), others are applied each time a user subscription is made to an
application (e.g. enabling the call attempt event for a new user).
Basic mechanisms between Application and Framework:
**\- Authentication:** Once an off-line service agreement exists, the
application can access the authentication interface. The authentication model
of OSA is a peer-to-peer model, but authentication does not have to be mutual.
The application must be authenticated before it is allowed to use any other
OSA interface. It is a policy decision for the application whether it must
authenticate the framework or not. It is a policy decision for the framework
whether it allows an application to authenticate it before it has completed
its authentication of the application.
**\- Authorisation:** Authorisation is distinguished from authentication in
that authorisation is the action of determining what a previously
authenticated application is allowed to do. Authentication shall precede
authorisation. Once authenticated, an application is authorised to access
certain SCFs.
**\- Discovery of Framework and network SCFs:** After successful
authentication, applications can obtain available Framework interfaces and use
the discovery interface to obtain information on authorised network SCFs.\ The
Discovery interface can be used at any time after successful authentication.
**\- Establishment of service agreement:** Before any application can interact
with a network SCF, a service agreement shall be established. A service
agreement may consist of an off-line (e.g. by physically exchanging documents)
and an on-line part. The application has to sign the on-line part of the
service agreement before it is allowed to access any network SCF.
\- **Access to network SCFs:** The Framework shall provide access control
functions to authorise the access to SCFs or service data for any API method
from an application, with the specified security level, context, domain, etc.
Basic mechanism between Framework and Service Capability Server (SCS):
  * **Registering of network SCFs:**. SCFs offered by a SCS can be registered at the Framework. In this way the Framework can inform the Applications upon request about available SCFs (Discovery). For example, this mechanism is applied when installing or upgrading an SCS.
Basic mechanism between Framework and Enterprise Operator:
**â€‘** **Service Subscription function:** This function represents a
contractual agreement between the Enterprise Operator and the Framework. In
this subscription business model, the enterprise operators act in the role of
_subscriber/customer_ of services and the client applications act in the role
of _users or consumers_ of _services_.\ The framework itself acts in the role
of _retailer_ of services.
The following clauses describe each aspect of the Framework in the following
order:
  * The _sequence diagrams_ give the reader a practical idea of how the Framework is implemented.
  * The _class diagrams_ clause shows how each of the interfaces applicable to the Framework relate to one another.
  * The _interface specification_ clause describes in detail each of the interfaces shown within the class diagram part.
  * The _State Transition Diagrams (STD)_ show the transition between states in the Framework. The states and transitions are well-defined; either methods specified in the Interface specification or events occurring in the underlying networks cause state transitions.
  * The _data definitions_ clause shows a detailed expansion of each of the data types associated with the methods within the classes. Note that some data types are used in other methods and classes and are therefore defined within the common data types part of the present document (29.198-2).
An implementation of this API which supports or implements a method described
in the present document, shall support or implement the functionality
described for that method, for at least one valid set of values for the
parameters of that method. Where a method is not supported by an
implementation of a Framework or Service interface, the exception
P_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED shall be returned to any call of that method. Where a
method is not supported by an implementation of an Application interface, a
call to that method shall be possible, and no exception shall be returned.
# 5 The Base Interface Specification
## 5.1 Interface Specification Format
This clause defines the interfaces, methods and parameters that form a part of
the API specification. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is used to specify
the interface classes. The general format of an interface specification is
described below.
### 5.1.1 Interface Class
This shows a UML interface class description of the methods supported by that
interface, and the relevant parameters and types. The Service and Framework
interfaces for client applications are denoted by classes with name Ip\.
The callback interfaces to the applications are denoted by classes with name
IpApp\. For the interfaces between a Service and the Framework, the
Service interfaces are typically denoted by classes with name IpSvc\,
while the Framework interfaces are denoted by classes with name IpFw\.
### 5.1.2 Method descriptions
Each method (API method "call") is described. Both synchronous and
asynchronous methods are used in the API. Asynchronous methods are identified
by a \'Req\' suffix for a method request, and, if applicable, are served by
asynchronous methods identified by either a \'Res\' or \'Err\' suffix for
method results and errors, respectively. To handle responses and reports, the
application or service developer must implement the relevant IpApp\ or
IpSvc\ interfaces to provide the callback mechanism.
### 5.1.3 Parameter descriptions
Each method parameter and its possible values are described. Parameters
described as \'in\' represent those that must have a value when the method is
called. Those described as \'out\' are those that contain the return result of
the method when the method returns.
### 5.1.4 State Model
If relevant, a state model is shown to illustrate the states of the objects
that implement the described interface.
## 5.2 Base Interface
### 5.2.1 Interface Class IpInterface
All application, framework and service interfaces inherit from the following
interface. This API Base Interface does not provide any additional methods.
+-------------------+ | \> | | | | IpInterface | +-------------------+ | | +-------------------+ | | +-------------------+
## 5.3 Service Interfaces
### 5.3.1 Overview
The Service Interfaces provide the interfaces into the capabilities of the
underlying network - such as call control, user interaction, messaging,
mobility and connectivity management.
The interfaces that are implemented by the services are denoted as \'Service
Interface\'. The corresponding interfaces that must be implemented by the
application (e.g. for API callbacks) are denoted as \'Application Interface\'.
## 5.4 Generic Service Interface
### 5.4.1 Interface Class IpService
Inherits from: IpInterface
All service interfaces inherit from the following interface.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpService | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | setCallback (appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef) : void | | | | setCallbackWithSessionID (appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef, | | sessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
#### 5.4.1.1 Method setCallback()
This method specifies the reference address of the callback interface that a
service uses to invoke methods on the application. It is not allowed to invoke
this method on an interface that uses SessionIDs. Multiple invocations of this
method on an interface shall result in multiple callback references being
specified. The SCS shall use the most recent callback interface provided by
the application using this method. In the event that a callback reference
fails or is no longer available, the next most recent callback reference
available shall be used.
Parameters
appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
Specifies a reference to the application interface, which is used for
callbacks.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
#### 5.4.1.2 Method setCallbackWithSessionID()
This method specifies the reference address of the application\'s callback
interface that a service uses for interactions associated with a specific
session ID: e.g. a specific call, or call leg. It is not allowed to invoke
this method on an interface that does not use SessionIDs. Multiple invocations
of this method on an interface shall result in multiple callback references
being specified. The SCS shall use the most recent callback interface provided
by the application using this method. In the event that a callback reference
fails or is no longer available, the next most recent callback reference
available shall be used.
Parameters
appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
Specifies a reference to the application interface, which is used for
callbacks.
sessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the session for which the service can invoke the application\'s
callback interface.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
# 6 Framework Access Session API
## 6.1 Sequence Diagrams
### 6.1.1 Trust and Security Management Sequence Diagrams
#### 6.1.1.1 Initial Access
The following figure shows a client accessing the OSA Framework for the first
time.
Before being authorized to use the OSA SCFs, the client must first of all
authenticate itself with the Framework. For this purpose the client needs a
reference to the Initial Contact interfaces for the Framework; this may be
obtained through a URL, a Naming or Trading Service or an equivalent service,
a stringified object reference, etc. At this stage, the client has no
guarantee that this is a Framework interface reference, but it is to initiate
the authentication process with the Framework. The Initial Contact interface
supports the initiateAuthenticationWithVersion method to allow the
authentication process to take place.
Once the client has been authenticated by the Framework, it can gain access to
other framework interfaces and SCFs. This is done by invoking the
requestAccess method, by which the client requests a certain type of access
SCF.
Independently, the client could decide to authenticate the Framework, before
deciding to continue using the interfaces provided by the Framework.
{width="6.682638888888889in" height="5.215277777777778in"}
1: Initiate Authentication
The client invokes initiateAuthenticationWithVersion on the Framework\'s
\"public\" (initial contact) interface to initiate the authentication process.
It provides in turn a reference to its own authentication interface. The
Framework returns a reference to its authentication interface.
2: Select Authentication Mechanism
The client invokes selectAuthenticationMechanism on the Framework\'s API Level
Authentication interface, identifying the authentication algorithm it supports
for use with CHAP authentication. The Framework prescribes the method to be
used. OSA authentication is based on CHAP, which prescribes the MD5 hashing
algorithm as the minimum to be supported. Note however that the framework need
not accept this algorithm.
3: The client authenticates the Framework, issuing a challenge in the
challenge() method.
4: The client provides an indication if authentication succeeded.
5: The Framework authenticates the client. The sequence diagram illustrates
one of a series of one or more invocations of the challenge method on the
client\'s API Level Authentication interface. In each invocation, the
Framework supplies a challenge and the client returns the correct response.
The Framework could authenticate the client before the client authenticates
the Framework, or afterwards, or the two authentication processes could be
interleaved. However, the client shall respond immediately to any challenge
issued by the Framework, as the Framework might not respond to any challenge
issued by the client until the Framework has successfully authenticated the
client.
6: The Framework provides an indication if authentication succeeded.
7: Request Access
Upon successful authentication of the client by the Framework, the client is
permitted to invoke requestAccess on the Framework\'s API Level Authentication
interface, providing in turn a reference to its own access interface. The
Framework returns a reference to a framework Access interface that is unique
for this client. The success or failure of the client\'s authentication of the
Framework does not affect the client\'s right to invoke requestAccess.
8: The client and framework negotiate the signing algorithm to be used for any
signed exchanges.
9: The client invokes obtainInterface or obtainInterfaceWithCallback on the
framework\'s Access interface. This is used to obtain a reference to a
framework interface that supports the required framework functionality, such
as service discovery, integrity management, service subscription etc.
#### 6.1.1.2 Framework Terminates Access
This sequence shows how a Framework could terminate an application\'s use of
the Framework and of all service instances. This type of termination is
unusual, but possible with the terminateAccess method. Note that if at any
point the framework\'s level of confidence in the identity of the client
becomes too low, perhaps due to re-authentication failing, the framework
should terminate all outstanding service agreements for that client, and
should take steps to terminate the client\'s access session WITHOUT invoking
terminateAccess() on the client. This follows a generally accepted security
model where the framework has decided that it can no longer trust the client
and will therefore sever ALL contact with it.
{width="6.686805555555556in" height="2.854861111111111in"}
1: Following successful authentication and service discovery, the client
initiates the service agreement signing process (not shown). This is completed
when the client invokes signServiceAgreement on the Framework\'s
IpServiceAgreementManagement interface, and a reference to an instance of a
service manager interface is returned.
2: The client (application) had initiated service agreement signing process
for a second service agreement (not shown), and when the client signs this
second service agreement, a reference to an instance of another service
manager, for another service type, is returned.
3: The application starts to use the new service manager interface.
4: The application starts to use the other new service manager interface.
5: The framework decides to terminate the application\'s access session, and
to terminate all its service agreements. This is an unusual and drastic step,
but could be e.g. due to violation or expiry of the application\'s service
agreements, or some problem within the framework itself. The framework will
also destroy each of the service managers the application was using (not
shown). The application is now no longer authenticated with the framework, and
all Framework and service interfaces it was using are destroyed.
#### 6.1.1.3 Application Terminates Access
This sequence shows how an application could terminate its use of the
Framework and of all service instances. This type of termination is unusual,
but possible with the terminateAccess method.
{width="6.684027777777778in" height="2.847916666666667in"}
1: The application terminates its use of the multi-party call control service
manager in a controlled manner.
2: The application ceases to use the user location camel SCF.
3: The application decides to terminate its access session and all its service
agreements in one go. The framework will also destroy each of the service
managers the application was using (not shown). The application is now no
longer authenticated with the framework, and all Framework and service
interfaces it was using are destroyed. The application could have terminated
its service agreements one by one, by invoking terminateServiceAgreement on
the Framework\'s IpServiceAgreementManager interface, and then invoked
terminateAccess on the Framework\'s IpAccess interface, which would have been
a more controlled shutdown.
#### 6.1.1.4 Non-API level Authentication
The following figure shows a client accessing the OSA Framework for the first
time. The client and the framework have mutually authenticated one another
using an underlying distribution technology mechanism, or the client and the
framework recognise each other as a trusted party, not requiring
authentication.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="4.822916666666667in"}
1: The client calls initiateAuthenticationWithVersion on the OSA Framework
Initial interface. This allows the client to specify the type of
authentication process. In this case, the client selects to use the underlying
distribution technology mechanism for identification and authentication. What
that mechanism is, if it even exists, is outside the scope of the API.
2: The client invokes the requestAccess method on the Framework\'s
Authentication interface. This returns a reference to the framework Access
interface that is unique for the client.
3: If the authentication was successful, the client and the framework can
negotiate, on the framework\'s Access interface, the signing algorithm to be
used for any signed exchanges.
4: The client can now invoke obtainInterface or obtainInterfaceWithCallback on
the framework\'s Access interface. This is used to obtain a reference to a
framework interface such as service discovery, integrity management, service
subscription etc.
#### 6.1.1.5 API Level Authentication
This sequence diagram illustrates the two-way mechanism by which the client
and the framework mutually authenticate one another.
The OSA API supports multiple authentication techniques. The procedure used to
select an appropriate technique for a given situation is described below. The
authentication mechanisms may be supported by cryptographic processes to
provide confidentiality, and by digital signatures to ensure integrity. The
inclusion of cryptographic processes and digital signatures in the
authentication procedure depends on the type of authentication technique
selected. In some cases strong authentication may need to be enforced by the
Framework to prevent misuse of resources. In addition it may be necessary to
define the minimum encryption key length that can be used to ensure a high
degree of confidentiality.
The client must authenticate with the Framework before it is able to use any
of the other interfaces supported by the Framework. Invocations on other
interfaces will fail until authentication has been successfully completed.
1) The client calls initiateAuthenticationWithVersion on the OSA Framework
Initial interface. This allows the client to specify the type of
authentication process. This authentication process may be specific to the
provider, or the implementation technology used. The
initiateAuthenticationWithVersion method can be used to specify the specific
process, (e.g. CORBA security). OSA defines a generic authentication interface
(API Level Authentication), which can be used to perform the authentication
process. The initiateAuthenticationWithVersion method allows the client to
pass a reference to its own authentication interface to the Framework, and
receive a reference to the authentication interface preferred by the client,
in return. In this case the API Level Authentication interface.
2) The client invokes the selectAuthenticationMechanism on the Framework\'s
API Level Authentication interface. This includes the authentication
algorithms supported by the client. The framework then chooses a mechanism
based on the capabilities of the client and the Framework. If the client is
capable of handling more than one mechanism, then the Framework chooses one
option, defined in the prescribedMethod parameter. In some instances, the
authentication mechanism of the client may not fulfil the demands of the
Framework, in which case, the authentication will fail, for example CHAP
prescribes the MD5 hashing algorithm as the minimum to be supported, however
the framework need not accept this algorithm.
3) The application and Framework interact to authenticate each other by using
the challenge method. For an authentication method of P_OSA_AUTHENTICATION,
this procedure consists of a number of challenge/ response exchanges. This
authentication protocol is performed using the challenge method on the API
Level Authentication interface. P_OSA_AUTHENTICATION is based on CHAP, which
is primarily a one-way protocol. There are in fact two authentication
processes: authentication of the client performed by the Framework , and
authentication of the Framework performed by the client. Mutual authentication
is achieved by both these processes terminating successfully. Mutual
authentication may not necessarily be required, i.e. it could be that a client
may not need to authenticate the Framework. There is also no required order
for the execution of these two authentication processes, however, the client
shall respond immediately to any challenge issued by the Framework, as the
Framework might not respond to any challenge issued by the client until the
Framework has successfully authenticated the client.
Note that at any point during the access session, either side can request re-
authentication of the other side.

Figure: Trust and Security Management Package Overview
## 6.3 Interface Classes
### 6.3.1 Trust and Security Management Interface Classes
The Trust and Security Management Interfaces provide:
\- the first point of contact for a client to access a Framework provider;
\- the authentication methods for the client and Framework provider to perform
an authentication protocol;
\- the client with the ability to select a service capability feature to make
use of;
\- the client with a portal to access other Framework interfaces.
The process by which the client accesses the Framework provider has been
separated into 3 stages, each supported by a different Framework interface:
1) Initial Contact with the Framework;
2) Authentication;
3) Access to Framework and Service Capability Features.
#### 6.3.1.1 Interface Class IpClientAPILevelAuthentication
Inherits from: IpInterface.
If the IpClientAPILevelAuthentication interface is implemented by a client,
challenge(), abortAuthentication() and authenticationSucceeded() methods shall
be implemented.
+----------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpClientAPILevelAuthentication | +----------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------+ | abortAuthentication () : void | | | | authenticationSucceeded () : void | | | | challenge (challenge : in TpOctetSet) : TpOctetSet | +----------------------------------------------------+
##### 6.3.1.1.1 Method abortAuthentication()
The framework uses this method to abort the authentication process where the
client is authenticating the Framework. This method is invoked if the
framework wishes to abort the authentication process before it has been
authenticated by the client, (unless the client responded incorrectly to a
challenge in which case no further communication with the client should
occur.) Calls to this method after the Framework has been authenticated by the
client shall not result in an immediate removal of the Framework\'s
authentication (the client may wish to authenticate the Framework again,
however).
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
##### 6.3.1.1.2 Method authenticationSucceeded()
The Framework uses this method to inform the client of the success of the
authentication attempt. The client may invoke requestAccess on the
Framework\'s APILevelAuthentication interface following invocation of this
method.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
##### 6.3.1.1.3 Method challenge()
This method is used by the framework to authenticate the client. The client
must respond with the correct responses to the challenges presented by the
framework. The number of exchanges is dependent on the policies of each side.
The authentication of the client is deemed successful when the
authenticationSucceeded method is invoked by the Framework.
The invocation of this method may be interleaved with challenge() calls by the
client on the IpAPILevelAuthentication interface. The client shall respond
immediately to authentication challenges from the Framework, and not wait
until the Framework has responded to any challenge the client may issue.
Returns \ : This is the response of the client application to the
challenge of the framework in the current sequence. The formatting and
construction of this parameter shall be according to section 4.1 of RFC 1994.
A complete CHAP Response packet shall be used to carry the response octet set.
That octet set will be the result of applying the designated hashing
algorithm, which is indicated via the client\'s invocation of
selectAuthenticationMechanism(), to an octet set consisting of the
concatenation of the CHAP Identifier, the shared \"secret\", and the supplied
challenge value. The Name field of the CHAP Response packet must be present
and contain a valid value in order for the CHAP Response to be valid. However,
the Name field is not used in the authentication process.
Steps for constructing the response octet set:
1\. Extract the Identifier and Value fields from the CHAP Challenge packet
passed in the challenge() method\'s challenge parameter
2\. Build an octet set consisting of the concatenation of the Identifier, the
\"shared secret\", and the Value from the CHAP Challenge
3\. Compute the hash of the octet set resulting from the previous step using
the designated hashing algorithm
4\. Construct a complete CHAP Response packet with the resulting octet set
from previous step as the CHAP Value
Steps for validating the response octet set:
1\. Verify that the Identifier sent in the original CHAP Challenge matches the
Identifier received in the CHAP Response. If it does not, authentication
fails.
2\. Build an octet set consisting of the concatenation of the original
Identifier, the \"shared secret\", and the original challenge value
3\. Compute the hash of the resulting octet set from the previous step using
the designated hashing algorithm
4\. Verify the octet set resulting from the previous step matches the octet
set contained in the Value field of the CHAP Response. A match indicates
successful authentication.
Parameters
challenge : in TpOctetSet
The challenge presented by the framework to be responded to by the client. The
challenge format used will be in accordance with the IETF PPP Authentication
Protocols - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (RFC 1994).
The challenge octet set must be formatted as a CHAP Challenge packet as
defined in section 4.1 of RFC 1994. A complete and properly formatted CHAP
Challenge packet must be used. The Name field of the CHAP Challenge packet
must be present and contain a valid value in order for the CHAP Response to be
valid. However, the Name field is not used in the authentication process.
Steps for constructing the challenge octet set:
1\. Create a random challenge value (octet set). Per RFC 1994, this value must
between 1 and 255 octets in length.
2\. Construct a CHAP Challenge packet based on 4.1 of RFC 1994 with the octet
set from the previous step passed in the Value field within the CHAP
Challenge.
Returns
TpOctetSet
#### 6.3.1.2 Interface Class IpClientAccess
Inherits from: IpInterface.
IpClientAccess interface is offered by the client to the framework to allow it
to initiate interactions during the access session. This interface and the
terminateAccess() method shall be implemented by a client.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpClientAccess | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | terminateAccess (terminationText : in TpString, signingAlgorithm : | | in TpSigningAlgorithm, digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 6.3.1.2.1 Method terminateAccess()
The terminateAccess operation is used by the framework to end the client\'s
access session.
After terminateAccess() is invoked, the client will no longer be authenticated
with the framework. The client will not be able to use the references to any
of the framework interfaces gained during the access session. Any calls to
these interfaces will fail. The framework shall also identify and terminate
all remaining service instances that apply as a result of the client access
termination. If at any point the framework\'s level of confidence in the
identity of the client becomes too low, perhaps due to re-authentication
failing, the framework should terminate all outstanding service agreements for
that client, and should take steps to terminate the client\'s access session
WITHOUT invoking terminateAccess() on the client. This follows a generally
accepted security model where the framework has decided that it can no longer
trust the client and will therefore sever ALL contact with it.
Parameters
terminationText : in TpString
This is the termination text describes the reason for the termination of the
access session.
signingAlgorithm : in TpSigningAlgorithm
This is the algorithm used to compute the digital signature. It shall be
identical to the one chosen by the framework in response to
IpAccess.selectSigningAlgorithm(). If the signingAlgorithm is not the chosen
one, is invalid, or unknown to the client, the P_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM
exception will be thrown. The list of possible algorithms is as specified in
the TpSigningAlgorithm table. The identifier used in this parameter must
correspond to the digestAlgorithm and signatureAlgorithm fields in the
SignerInfo field in the digitalSignature (see below).
digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet
This contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as defined in RFC
2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is calculated and created
as per section 5 of RFC 2630. The content is made of the termination text. The
\"external signature\" construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in
the EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the termination
text string). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC
2630, shall also be used to provide replay prevention. The framework uses this
to confirm its identity to the client. The client can check that the
terminationText has been signed by the framework. If a match is made, the
access session is terminated, otherwise the P_INVALID_SIGNATURE exception will
be thrown.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM, P_INVALID_SIGNATURE
#### 6.3.1.3 Interface Class IpInitial
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The Initial Framework interface is used by the client to initiate the
authentication with the Framework. This interface and the
initiateAuthenticationWithVersion() method shall be implemented by a
Framework.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpInitial | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | initiateAuthenticationWithVersion (clientDomain : in TpAuthDomain, | | authType : in TpAuthType, frameworkVersion : in TpVersion) : | | TpAuthDomain | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 6.3.1.3.1 Method initiateAuthenticationWithVersion()
This method is invoked by the client to start the process of authentication
with the framework, and request the use of a specific authentication method
using the new method with support for backward compatibility in the framework.
The returned fwDomain authInterface will be selected to match the proposed
version from the Client in the Framework response. If the Framework cannot
work with the proposed framework version the framework returns an error code
(P_INVALID_VERSION).
Returns \ : This provides the client with a framework identifier,
and a reference to call the authentication interface of the framework.
structure TpAuthDomain { domainID: TpDomainID; authInterface: IpInterfaceRef;
};
The domainID parameter is an identifier for the framework (i.e. TpFwID). It is
used to identify the framework to the client.
The authInterface parameter is a reference to the authentication interface of
the framework that is unique for each requesting client. The type of this
interface is defined by the authType parameter. The client uses this interface
to authenticate with the framework.
Note, there are no identifiers used in the authentication interface to
correlate requests and responses, therefore the authentication interface may
not be shared amongst multiple clients.
Parameters
clientDomain : in TpAuthDomain
This identifies the client domain to the framework, and provides a reference
to the authentication interface. structure TpAuthDomain { domainID:
TpDomainID; authInterface: IpInterfaceRef; };
The domainID parameter is an identifier either for a client application (i.e.
TpClientAppID) or for an enterprise operator (i.e. TpEntOpID), or for an
instance of a service for which a client application has signed a service
agreement (i.e. TpServiceInstanceID), or for a service supplier (i.e.
TpServiceSupplierID). It is used to identify the client domain to the
framework, (see challenge() on IpAPILevelAuthentication). If the framework
does not recognise the domainID, the framework returns an error code
(P_INVALID_DOMAIN_ID).
A client application (identifiable by a given TpClientAppID) may optionally
initiate authentication with the Framework by invoking this method multiple
times. The Framework may elect to reject these subsequent requests, or may
choose to associate them together as independent sessions under the same
TpClientAppID.
The authInterface parameter is a reference to call the authentication
interface of the client. The type of this interface is defined by the authType
parameter. If the interface reference is not of the correct type, the
framework returns an error code (P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE).
authType : in TpAuthType
This identifies the type of authentication mechanism requested by the client.
It provides operators and clients with the opportunity to use an alternative
to the API level Authentication interface, e.g. an implementation specific
authentication mechanism like CORBA Security, using the IpAuthentication
interface, or Operator specific Authentication interfaces. OSA API level
Authentication is the default authentication mechanism (P_OSA_AUTHENTICATION).
If P_OSA_AUTHENTICATION is selected, then the clientDomain and fwDomain
authInterface parameters are references to interfaces of type
Ip(Client)APILevelAuthentication. If P_AUTHENTICATION is selected, the
fwDomain authInterface parameter references to interfaces of type
IpAuthentication that is used when an underlying distribution technology
authentication mechanism is used.
frameworkVersion : in TpVersion
This identifies the version of the Framework implemented in the client. The
TpVersion is a String containing the version number. Valid version numbers are
defined in the respective framework specification.
Returns
TpAuthDomain
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_DOMAIN_ID, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE,
P_INVALID_AUTH_TYPE, P_INVALID_VERSION
#### 6.3.1.4 Interface Class IpAuthentication
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The Authentication Framework interface is used by client to request access to
other interfaces supported by the Framework. The authentication process should
in this case be done with some underlying distribution technology
authentication mechanism, e.g. CORBA Security. At least one of
IpAuthentication or IpAPILevelAuthentication interfaces shall be implemented
by a Framework as a minimum requirement. The requestAccess() method shall be
implemented in each.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpAuthentication | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | requestAccess (accessType : in TpAccessType, clientAccessInterface : | | in IpInterfaceRef) : IpInterfaceRef | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 6.3.1.4.1 Method requestAccess()
Once the client has been authenticated by the framework, the client may invoke
the requestAccess operation on the IpAuthentication or
IpAPILevelAuthentication interface. This allows the client to request the type
of access they require. If they request P_OSA_ACCESS, then a reference to the
IpAccess interface is returned. (Operators can define their own access
interfaces to satisfy client requirements for different types of access.)
If this method is called before the client has been successfully
authenticated, then the request fails, and an error code (P_ACCESS_DENIED) is
returned.
This method may be invoked by the client immediately on IpAuthentication, when
API Level authentication is not being used, since there is no indication to
the client at API level that it is authenticated with the Framework.
Returns \ : This provides the reference for the client to
call the access interface of the framework. The access reference provided is
unique to the requesting client.
Parameters
accessType : in TpAccessType
This identifies the type of access interface requested by the client. If the
framework does not provide the type of access identified by accessType, then
an error code (P_INVALID_ACCESS_TYPE) is returned.
clientAccessInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
This provides the reference for the framework to call the access interface of
the client. If the interface reference is not of the correct type, the
framework returns an error code (P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE).
Returns
IpInterfaceRef
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_ACCESS_TYPE,
P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
#### 6.3.1.5 Interface Class IpAPILevelAuthentication
Inherits from: IpAuthentication.
The API Level Authentication Framework interface is used by the client to
authenticate the Framework. It is also used to initiate the authentication
process. If the IpAPILevelAuthentication interface is implemented by a
Framework, then selectAuthenticationMechanism(), challenge(),
abortAuthentication() and authenticationSucceeded () shall be implemented.
IpAPILevelAuthentication inherits the requirements of IpAuthentication,
therefore requestAccess() shall be implemented.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpAPILevelAuthentication | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | abortAuthentication () : void | | | | authenticationSucceeded () : void | | | | selectAuthenticationMechanism (authMechanismList : in | | TpAuthMechanismList) : TpAuthMechanism | | | | challenge (challenge : in TpOctetSet) : TpOctetSet | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 6.3.1.5.1 Method abortAuthentication()
The client uses this method to abort the authentication process where the
framework is authenticating the client. This method is invoked if the client
no longer wishes to continue the authentication process, (unless the framework
responded incorrectly to a challenge in which case no further communication
with the framework should occur.) If this method has been invoked before the
client has been authenticated by the Framework, calls to the requestAccess
operation on IpAPILevelAuthentication will return an error code
(P_ACCESS_DENIED), until the client has been properly authenticated. If this
method is invoked after the client has been authenticated by the Framework, it
shall not result in the immediate removal of the client\'s authentication.
(The Framework may wish to authenticate the client again, however).
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED
##### 6.3.1.5.2 Method authenticationSucceeded()
The client uses this method to inform the framework of the success of the
authentication attempt. Calls to this method have no impact on the client\'s
rights to call requestAccess(), which depend exclusively on the framework\'s
successful authentication of the client.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED
##### 6.3.1.5.3 Method selectAuthenticationMechanism()
The client uses this method to inform the Framework of the different
authentication mechanisms it supports as part of API level Authentication. The
Framework will select one of the suggested authentication mechanisms and that
mechanism shall be used for authentication by both Framework and Client. The
authentication mechanism chosen as a result of the response to this method
remains valid for an instance of IpAPILevelAuthentication and until this
method is re-invoked by the client. If a mechanism that is acceptable to the
framework within the capability of the client cannot be found, the framework
throws the P_NO_ACCEPTABLE_AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISM exception.
Returns: selectedMechanism. This is the authentication mechanism chosen by the
Framework. The chosen mechanism shall be taken from the list of mechanisms
proposed by the Client.
Parameters
authMechanismList : in TpAuthMechanismList
The list of authentication mechanisms supported by the client.
Returns
TpAuthMechanism
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_NO_ACCEPTABLE_AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISM
##### 6.3.1.5.4 Method challenge()
This method is used by the client to authenticate the framework. The framework
must respond with the correct responses to the challenges presented by the
client. The domainID received in the initiateAuthenticationWithVersion() can
be used by the framework to reference the correct public key for the client
(the key management system is currently outside of the scope of the OSA APIs).
The number of exchanges is dependent on the policies of each side. The
authentication of the framework is deemed successful when the
authenticationSucceeded method is invoked by the client.
The invocation of this method may be interleaved with challenge() calls by the
framework on the client\'s APILevelAuthentication interface.
Returns \ : This is the response of the framework to the challenge
of the client in the current sequence. The formatting and construction of this
parameter shall be according to section 4.1 of RFC 1994\. A complete CHAP
Response packet shall be used to carry the response octet set. That octet set
will be the result of applying the designated hashing algorithm, which is
indicated via the client\'s invocation of selectAuthenticationMechanism(), to
an octet set consisting of the concatenation of the CHAP Identifier, the
shared \"secret\", and the supplied challenge value. The Name field of the
CHAP Response packet must be present and contain a valid value in order for
the CHAP Response to be valid. However, the Name field is not used in the
authentication process.
Steps for constructing the response octet set:
1\. Extract the Identifier and Value fields from the CHAP Challenge packet
passed in the challenge() method\'s challenge parameter
2\. Build an octet set consisting of the concatenation of the Identifier, the
\"shared secret\", and the Value from the CHAP Challenge
3\. Compute the hash of the octet set resulting from the previous step using
the designated hashing algorithm
4\. Construct a complete CHAP Response packet with the resulting octet set
from previous step as the CHAP Value
Steps for validating the response octet set:
1\. Verify that the Identifier sent in the original CHAP Challenge matches the
Identifier received in the CHAP Response. If it does not, authentication
fails.
2\. Build an octet set consisting of the concatenation of the original
Identifier, the \"shared secret\", and the original challenge value
3\. Compute the hash of the resulting octet set from the previous step using
the designated hashing algorithm
4\. Verify the octet set resulting from the previous step matches the octet
set contained in the Value field of the CHAP Response. A match indicates
successful authentication.
Parameters
challenge : in TpOctetSet
The challenge presented by the client to be responded to by the framework. The
challenge format used will be in accordance with the IETF PPP Authentication
Protocols - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (RFC 1994).
The challenge octet set must be formatted as a CHAP Challenge packet as
defined in section 4.1 of RFC 1994. A complete and properly formatted CHAP
Challenge packet must be used. The Name field of the CHAP Challenge packet
must be present and contain a valid value in order for the CHAP Response to be
valid. However, the Name field is not used in the authentication process.
Steps for constructing the challenge octet set:
1\. Create a random challenge value (octet set). Per RFC 1994, this value must
between 1 and 255 octets in length.
2\. Construct a CHAP Challenge packet based on 4.1 of RFC 1994 with the octet
set from the previous step passed in the Value field within the CHAP
Challenge.
Returns
TpOctetSet
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED
#### 6.3.1.6 Interface Class IpAccess
Inherits from: IpInterface.
This interface shall be implemented by a Framework. As a minimum requirement
the obtainInterface() and obtainInterfaceWithCallback(),
selectSigningAlgorithm() and terminateAccess() methods shall be implemented.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpAccess | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | obtainInterface (interfaceName : in TpInterfaceName) : | | IpInterfaceRef | | | | obtainInterfaceWithCallback (interfaceName : in TpInterfaceName, | | clientInterface : in IpInterfaceRef) : IpInterfaceRef | | | | listInterfaces () : TpInterfaceNameList | | | | selectSigningAlgorithm (signingAlgorithmCaps : in | | TpSigningAlgorithmCapabilityList) : TpSigningAlgorithm | | | | terminateAccess (terminationText : in TpString, digitalSignature : | | in TpOctetSet) : void | | | | relinquishInterface (interfaceName : in TpInterfaceName, | | terminationText : in TpString, digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet) : | | void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 6.3.1.6.1 Method obtainInterface()
This method is used to obtain other framework interfaces. The client uses this
method to obtain interface references to other framework interfaces. (The
obtainInterfaceWithCallback method should be used if the client is required to
supply a callback interface to the framework.)
Returns \ : This is the reference to the interface requested.
Parameters
interfaceName : in TpInterfaceName
The name of the framework interface to which a reference to the interface is
requested. If the interfaceName is invalid, the framework returns an error
code (P_INVALID_INTERFACE_NAME).
Returns
IpInterfaceRef
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_NAME
##### 6.3.1.6.2 Method obtainInterfaceWithCallback()
This method is used to obtain other framework interfaces. The client uses this
method to obtain interface references to other framework interfaces, when it
is required to supply a callback interface to the framework. (The
obtainInterface method should be used when no callback interface needs to be
supplied.)
Returns \ : This is the reference to the interface requested.
Parameters
interfaceName : in TpInterfaceName
The name of the framework interface to which a reference to the interface is
requested. If the interfaceName is invalid, the framework returns an error
code (P_INVALID_INTERFACE_NAME).
clientInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
This is the reference to the client interface, which is used for callbacks. If
a client interface is not needed, then this method should not be used. (The
obtainInterface method should be used when no callback interface needs to be
supplied.) If the interface reference is not of the correct type, the
framework returns an error code (P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE).
Returns
IpInterfaceRef
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_NAME,
P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
##### 6.3.1.6.3 Method listInterfaces()
The client uses this method to obtain the names of all interfaces supported by
the framework. It can then obtain the interfaces it wishes to use using either
obtainInterface() or obtainInterfaceWithCallback().
Returns \ : The frameworkInterfaces parameter contains a
list of interfaces that the framework makes available.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Returns
TpInterfaceNameList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED
##### 6.3.1.6.4 Method selectSigningAlgorithm()
The client uses this method to inform the Framework of the different signing
algorithms it supports for use in all cases where digital signatures are
required. The Framework will select one of the suggested algorithms. This
method shall be the first method invoked by the client on IpAccess. The
algorithm chosen as a result of the response to this method remains valid for
an instance of IpAccess and until this method is re-invoked by the client.
Subsequent invocations of selectSigningAlgorithm() may change the signing
algorithm used during the access session. However, once signServiceAgreement()
has been called on the client by the framework, the signing algorithm
currently selected must be used for the client\'s invocation of
signServiceAgreement() on the Framework as well as for subsequent calls to
terminateServiceAgreement(). Other operations requiring digital signatures
will use the latest algorithm specified by selectSigningAlgorithm().
If an algorithm that is acceptable to the framework within the capability of
the client cannot be found, the framework throws the
P_NO_ACCEPTABLE_SIGNING_ALGORITHM exception.
Returns: selectedAlgorithm. This is the signing algorithm chosen by the
Framework. The chosen algorithm shall be taken from the list proposed by the
Client.
Parameters
signingAlgorithmCaps : in TpSigningAlgorithmCapabilityList
The list of signing algorithms supported by the client.
Returns
TpSigningAlgorithm
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_NO_ACCEPTABLE_SIGNING_ALGORITHM
##### 6.3.1.6.5 Method terminateAccess()
The terminateAccess method is used by the client to request that its access
session with the framework is ended. After it is invoked, the client will no
longer be authenticated with the framework. The client will not be able to use
the references to any of the framework interfaces gained during the access
session. Any calls to these interfaces will fail. Also, all remaining service
instances created by the framework either directly in this access session or
on behalf of the client during this access session shall be terminated.
Parameters
terminationText : in TpString
This is the termination text describes the reason for the termination of the
access session.
digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet
This contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as defined in RFC
2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is calculated and created
as per section 5 of RFC 2630 using the latest signing algorithm selected with
selectSigningAlgorithm(). The content is made of the termination text. The
\"external signature\" construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in
the EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the termination
text string). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC
2630, shall also be used to provide replay prevention. The client uses this to
confirm its identity to the framework. The framework can check that the
terminationText has been signed by the client. If a match is made, the access
session is terminated, otherwise the P_INVALID_SIGNATURE exception will be
thrown.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SIGNATURE
##### 6.3.1.6.6 Method relinquishInterface()
The client uses this method to release an instance of a framework interface
that was obtained during this access session.
Parameters
interfaceName : in TpInterfaceName
This is the name of the framework interface which is being released. If the
interfaceName is invalid, the framework throws the P_INVALID_INTERFACE_NAME
exception. If the interface has not been given to the client during this
access session, then the P_TASK_REFUSED exception will be thrown.
terminationText : in TpString
This is the termination text describes the reason for the release of the
interface. This text is required simply because the digitalSignature parameter
requires a terminationText to sign.
digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet
This contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as defined in RFC
2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is calculated and created
as per section 5 of RFC 2630 using the latest signing algorithm selected with

## 6.4 State Transition Diagrams
This clause contains the State Transition Diagrams for the objects that
implement the Framework interfaces on the gateway side. The State Transition
Diagrams show the behaviour of these objects. For each state the methods that
can be invoked by the client are shown. Methods not shown for a specific state
are not relevant for that state and will return an exception. Apart from the
methods that can be invoked by the client also events internal to the gateway
or related to network events are shown together with the resulting event or
action performed by the gateway. These internal events are shown between
quotation marks.

using initiateAuthenticationWithVersion() and challenge() method combination
##### 6.4.1.2.1 Idle State
When the client has invoked the IpInitial initiateAuthenticationWithVersion
method, an object implementing the IpAPILevelAuthentication interface is
created. The client now has to select the authentication mechanism to be used
using selectAuthenticationMechanism.
##### 6.4.1.2.2 Authenticating Framework State
When entering this state, the client requests the Framework to authenticate
itself. The client invokes the challenge method on the Framework. The
Framework may either buffer the requests and respond when the client has been
authenticated, or respond immediately, depending on policy. When the client
has processed the response from the authenticate request on the Framework, the
response is analysed. If the response is valid but the authentication process
is not yet complete, then another authenticate request or challenge is sent to
the Framework. If the response is valid and the authentication process has
been completed, then a transition to the state Framework Authenticated is made
and the Framework is informed of its success by invoking
authenticationSucceeded. At any time the Framework may abort the
authentication process by calling abortAuthentication on the client\'s
APILevelAuthentication interface. The client may also call
selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash algorithm.
##### 6.4.1.2.3 Framework Authenticated State
This state is entered when the client indicates that the Framework has been
authenticated, by calling authenticationSucceeded on the Framework\'s
IpAPILevelAuthentication interface. The client may at any time request re-
authentication of the Framework by calling the challenge method, resulting in
a transition back to Authenticating Framework state. The client may also call
selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash algorithm.
##### 6.4.1.2.4 Authenticating Client State
When entering this state, the Framework requests the client to authenticate
itself. The Framework invokes the challenge method on the client. When the
Framework has processed the response from the authenticate request or
challenge on the client, the response is analysed. If the response is valid
but the authentication process is not yet complete, then another authenticate
request or challenge is sent to the client. If the response is valid and the
authentication process has been completed, then a transition to the state
Client Authenticated is made, the client is informed of its success by
invoking authenticationSucceeded. In case the response is not valid, the
Authentication object is destroyed. This implies that the client has to re-
initiate the authentication by calling once more the
initiateAuthenticationWithVersion method on the IpInitial interface. At any
time the client may abort the authentication process by calling
abortAuthentication on the Framework\'s IpAPILevelAuthentication interface.
The client may also call selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash
algorithm.
##### 6.4.1.2.5 Client Authenticated State
In this state the client is considered authenticated and is now allowed to
request access to the IpAccess interface If the framework decides to re-
authenticate the client, then the challenge is sent to the client and a
transition back to the AuthenticatingClient state occurs. The client may also
call selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash algorithm.

using initiateAuthenticationWithVersion() and challenge() method combination
##### 6.4.1.2.6 Idle State
When the client has invoked the IpInitial initiateAuthenticationWithVersion
method, an object implementing the IpAPILevelAuthentication interface is
created. The client now has to select the authentication mechanism to be used
using selectAuthenticationMechanism.
##### 6.4.1.2.7 Authenticating Framework State
When entering this state, the client requests the Framework to authenticate
itself. The client invokes the challenge method on the Framework. The
Framework may either buffer the requests and respond when the client has been
authenticated, or respond immediately, depending on policy. When the client
has processed the response from the authenticate request on the Framework, the
response is analysed. If the response is valid but the authentication process
is not yet complete, then another authenticate request or challenge is sent to
the Framework. If the response is valid and the authentication process has
been completed, then a transition to the state Framework Authenticated is made
and the Framework is informed of its success by invoking
authenticationSucceeded. At any time the Framework may abort the
authentication process by calling abortAuthentication on the client\'s
APILevelAuthentication interface. The client may also call
selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash algorithm.
##### 6.4.1.2.8 Framework Authenticated State
This state is entered when the client indicates that the Framework has been
authenticated, by calling authenticationSucceeded on the Framework\'s
IpAPILevelAuthentication interface. The client may at any time request re-
authentication of the Framework by calling the challenge method, resulting in
a transition back to Authenticating Framework state. The client may also call
selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash algorithm.
##### 6.4.1.2.9 Authenticating Client State
When entering this state, the Framework requests the client to authenticate
itself. The Framework invokes the challenge method on the client. When the
Framework has processed the response from the authenticate request or
challenge on the client, the response is analysed. If the response is valid
but the authentication process is not yet complete, then another authenticate
request or challenge is sent to the client. If the response is valid and the
authentication process has been completed, then a transition to the state
Client Authenticated is made, the client is informed of its success by
invoking authenticationSucceeded. In case the response is not valid, the
Authentication object is destroyed. This implies that the client has to re-
initiate the authentication by calling once more the
initiateAuthenticationWithVersion method on the IpInitial interface. At any
time the client may abort the authentication process by calling
abortAuthentication on the Framework\'s IpAPILevelAuthentication interface.
The client may also call selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash
algorithm.
##### 6.4.1.2.10 Client Authenticated State
In this state the client is considered authenticated and is now allowed to
request access to the IpAccess interface If the framework decides to re-
authenticate the client, then the challenge is sent to the client and a
transition back to the AuthenticatingClient state occurs. The client may also
call selectAuthenticationMechanism to choose another hash algorithm.

Figure : State Transition Diagram for IpAccess
##### 6.4.1.3.1 Active State
When the client requests access to the Framework on the IpAuthentication
(IpAPILevelAuthentication) interface, an object implementing the IpAccess
interface is created. The client can now request other Framework interfaces,
including Service Discovery, Integrity Management, Service Subscription etc.,
and if at any point these framework interfaces are no longer required, to
relinquish these. In addition the client can select the signing algorithm that
shall be used during the access session in cases where a digital signature is
required. When the client is no longer interested in using the interfaces it
calls the terminateAccess method. This results in the destruction of all
interface objects used by the client. In case the network operator decides
that the client has no longer access to the interfaces the same will happen.

### 7.1.1 Event Notification Sequence Diagrams
#### 7.1.1.1 Enable Event Notification
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="4.969444444444444in"}
1: This message is used to create an object implementing the
IpAppEventNotification interface.
2: This message is used to receive a reference to the object implementing the
IpEventNotification interface and set the callback interface for the
framework.
3: If there is currently no object implementing the IpEventNotification
interface, then one is created using this message.
4: createNotification(eventCriteria : in TpFwEventCriteria) : TpAssignmentID.
This message is used to enable the notification mechanism so that subsequent
framework events can be sent to the application. The framework event the
application requests to be informed of is the availability of new SCFs.
Newly installed SCFs become available after the invocation of registerService
and announceServiceAvailability on the Framework. The application uses the
input parameter eventCriteria to specify the SCFs of whose availability it
wants to be notified: those specified in ServiceTypeNameList.
The result of this invocation has many similarities with the result of
invoking listServiceTypes: in both cases the application is informed of the
availability of a list of SCFs. The differences are:
Â· in the case of invoking listServiceTypes, the application has to take the
initiative, but it is informed of ALL SCFs available
Â· in the case of using the event notification mechanism, the application needs
not take the initiative to ask about the availability of SCFs, but it is only
informed of the ones that are newly available.
Alternatively, or additionally, the application can request to be informed of
SCFs becoming unavailable.
5: The application is notified of the availability of new SCFs of the
requested type(s).

#### 7.1.2.7 Heartbeat Management: Start/perform/end heartbeat supervision of
the application
In this sequence diagram, the framework has decided that it wishes to monitor
the application, and has therefore requested the application to commence
sending its heartbeat. The application responds by sending its heartbeat at
the specified interval. The framework then decides that it is satisfied with
the application\'s health and disables the heartbeat mechanism. If the
heartbeat was not received from the application within the specified interval,
the framework can decide that the application has failed the heartbeat and can
then perform some recovery action.

#### 7.1.2.8 Fault Management: Framework detects a Service failure
The framework has detected that a service instance has failed (probably by the
use of the heartbeat mechanism). The framework informs the client application.
{width="6.69375in" height="4.51875in"}
1: The framework informs the client application that is using the service
instance that the service is unavailable. The client application may wait to
receive a new call to the svcAvailStatusInd with the reason SVC_AVAILABLE when
the Service has become available again. The different Unavailability reasons
used by the Framework (TpSvcAvailStatusReason) guides the client application
developers to make the decision.
#### 7.1.2.9 Fault Management: Application requests a Framework activity test
{width="6.700694444444444in" height="6.491666666666666in"}
1: The client application asks the framework to do an activity test. The
client identifies that it would like the activity test done for the framework,
rather then a service, by supplying an empty string value for the svcId
parameter.
2: The framework does the requested activity test and sends the result to the
client application.
### 7.1.3 Service Discovery Sequence Diagrams
#### 7.1.3.1 Service Discovery
The following figure shows how Applications discover a new Service Capability
Feature in the network. Even applications that have already used the OSA API
of a certain network know that the operator may upgrade it any time; this is
why they use the Service Discovery interfaces.
Before the discovery process can start, the Application needs a reference to
the Framework\'s Service Discovery interface; this is done via an invocation
the method obtainInterface on the Framework\'s Access interface.
Discovery can be a three-step process. The first two steps have to be
performed initially, but can subsequently be skipped (if the service type and
its properties are already known, the application can invoke discoverService()
without having to re-invoke the list/discoverServiceType methods).
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="3.967361111111111in"}
2: Discovery: first step - list service types.
In this first step the application asks the Framework what service types that
are available from this network. Service types are standardized or non-
standardised SCF names, and thus this first step allows the Application to
know what SCFs are supported by the network.
The following output is the result of this first discovery step:
Â· out listTypes.
This is a list of service type names, i.e., a list of strings, each of them
the name of a SCF or a SCF specialization (e.g. \"P_MPCC\").
3: Discovery: second step - describe service type.
In this second step the application requests what are the properties that
describe a certain service type that it is interested in, among those listed
in the first step.
The following input is necessary:
Â· in name.
This is a service type name: a string that contains the name of the SCF whose
description the Application is interested in (e.g. \"P_MPCC\") .
And the output is:
Â· out serviceTypeDescription.
The description of the specified SCF type. The description provides
information about:
Â· the property names associated with the SCF;
Â· the corresponding property value types;
Â· the corresponding property mode (mandatory or read only) associated with
each SCF property;
Â· the names of the super types of this type; and
Â· whether the type is currently enabled or disabled.
4: Discovery: third step - discover service
In this third step the application requests for a service that matches its
needs by tuning the service properties (i.e. assigning values for certain
properties).
The Framework then checks whether there is a match, in which case it sends the
Application the serviceID that is the identifier this network operator has
assigned to the SCF version described in terms of those service properties.
This is the moment where the serviceID identifier is shared with the
application that is interested on the corresponding service.
This is done for either one service or more (the application specifies the
maximum number of responses it wishes to accept).
Input parameters are:
Â· in serviceTypeName.
This is a string that contains the name of the SCF whose description the
Application is interested in (e.g. \"P_MPCC\").
Â· in desiredPropertyList.
This is again a list like the one used for service registration, but where the
value of the service properties have been fine tuned by the Application to
(they will be logically interpreted as \"minimum\", \"maximum\", etc. by the
Framework).
The following parameter is necessary as input:
Â· in max.
This parameter states the maximum number of SCFs that are to be returned in
the \"ServiceList\" result.
And the output is:
Â· out serviceList.
This is a list of duplets: (serviceID, servicePropertyList). It provides a
list of SCFs matching the requirements from the Application, and about each:
the identifier that has been assigned to it in this network (serviceID), and
once again the service property list.
### 7.1.4 Service Agreement Management Sequence Diagrams
#### 7.1.4.1 Service Selection
The following figure shows the process of selecting an SCF.
After discovery the Application gets a list of one or more SCF versions that
match its required description. It now needs to decide which service it is
going to use; it also needs to actually get a way to use it.
This is achieved by the following two steps:
{width="6.686111111111111in" height="4.348611111111111in"}
1: Service Selection: first step - selectService
In this first step the Application identifies the SCF version it has finally
decided to use. This is done by means of the serviceID, which is the agreed
identifier for SCF versions. The Framework acknowledges this selection by
returning to the Application an identifier for the service chosen: a service
token, that is a private identifier for this service between this Application
and this network, and is used for the process of signing the service
agreement.
Input is:
Â· in serviceID.
This identifies the SCF required.
And output:
Â· out serviceToken.
This is a free format text token returned by the framework, which can be
signed as part of a service agreement. It contains operator specific
information relating to the service level agreement. An application
(identifiable by a given TpClientAppID) may select the same service on more
than one occasion in which case the same serviceToken, that identifies the
relationship between the Application and the network, and the service
agreement that applies, shall be returned.
2: Service Selection: second step - signServiceAgreement
In this second step an agreement is signed that allows the Application to use
the chosen SCF version. And once these contractual details have been agreed,
then the Application can be given the means to actually use it. The means are
a reference to the manager interface of the SCF version (remember that a
manager is an entry point to any SCF). By calling the createServiceManager
operation on the lifecycle manager the Framework retrieves this interface and
returns it to the Application. The service properties suitable for this
application are also fed to the SCF (via the lifecycle manager interface) in
order for the SCS to instantiate an SCF version that is suitable for this
application.
The sequence of events indicated above, where the application initiates the
signature process by calling initiateSignServiceAgreement, and where the
framework calls signServiceAgreement on the application\'s
IpAppServiceAgreementManagement interface before the application calls
signServiceAgreement on the frameworks\'s IpServiceAgreementManagement, is the
only sequence permitted.
Input:
Â· in serviceToken.
This is the identifier that the network and Application have agreed to
privately use for a certain version of SCF.
Â· in agreementText.
This is the agreement text that is to be signed by the Framework using the
private key of the Framework.
Â· in signingAlgorithm.
This is the algorithm used to compute the digital signature.
Output:
Â· out signatureAndServiceMgr.
This is a reference to a structure containing the digital signature of the
Framework for the service agreement, and a reference to the manager interface
of the SCF.
There must be only one service instance per client application. Therefore, in
case an application (identifiable by a given TpClientAppID) attempts to select
a service for which it has already signed a service agreement and this service
agreement has not been terminated, the Framework may return a reference to the
already existing service, or may raise an exception to the client indicating
that this request is denied.

## 7.3 Interface Classes
### 7.3.1 Service Discovery Interface Classes
#### 7.3.1.1 Interface Class IpServiceDiscovery
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The service discovery interface, shown below, consists of four methods. Before
a service can be discovered, the enterprise operator (or the client
applications) must know what \"types\" of services are supported by the
Framework and what service \"properties\" are applicable to each service type.
The listServiceTypes() method returns a list of all \"service types\" that are
currently supported by the framework and the \"describeServiceType()\" returns
a description of each service type. The description of service type includes
the \"service-specific properties\" that are applicable to each service type.
Then the enterprise operator (or the client applications) can discover a
specific set of registered services that both belong to a given type and
possess the desired \"property values\", by using the \"discoverService()
method. Once the enterprise operator finds out the desired set of services
supported by the framework, it subscribes to (a sub-set of) these services
using the Subscription Interfaces. The enterprise operator (or the client
applications in its domain) can find out the set of services available to it
(i.e., the service that it can use) by invoking \"listSubscribedServices()\".
The service discovery APIs are invoked by the enterprise operators or client
applications. They are described below. This interface shall be implemented by
a Framework with as a minimum requirement the listServiceTypes(),
describeServiceType() and discoverService() methods.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpServiceDiscovery | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | listServiceTypes () : TpServiceTypeNameList | | | | describeServiceType (name : in TpServiceTypeName) : | | TpServiceTypeDescription | | | | discoverService (serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName, | | desiredPropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList, max : in TpInt32) : | | TpServiceList | | | | listSubscribedServices () : TpServiceList | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 7.3.1.1.1 Method listServiceTypes()
This operation returns the names of all service super and sub types that are
in the repository. The details of the service types can then be obtained using
the describeServiceType() method. If a sub type of a service is registered,
this method returns, besides the sub type, also the super type.
Returns \ : The names of the requested service types.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Returns
TpServiceTypeNameList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED
##### 7.3.1.1.2 Method describeServiceType()
This operation lets the caller obtain the details for a particular service
type.
Returns \ : The description of the specified service
type. The description provides information about: Â· the service properties
associated with this service type: i.e. a list of service property {name, mode
and type} tuples; Â· the names of the super types of this service type; and Â·
whether the service type is currently available or unavailable.
Parameters
name : in TpServiceTypeName
The name of the service type to be described.
Â· If the \"name\" is malformed, then the P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE exception is
raised.
Â· If the \"name\" does not exist in the repository, then the
P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised.
Returns
TpServiceTypeDescription
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE,
P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE
##### 7.3.1.1.3 Method discoverService()
The discoverService operation is the means by which a client application is
able to obtain the service IDs of the services that meet its requirements. The
client application passes in a list of desired service properties to describe
the service it is looking for, in the form of attribute/value pairs for the
service properties. The client application also specifies the maximum number
of matched responses it is willing to accept. The framework must not return
more matches than the specified maximum, but it is up to the discretion of the
Framework implementation to choose to return less than the specified maximum.
The discoverService() operation returns a serviceID/Property pair list for
those services that match the desired service property list that the client
application provided. The service properties returned form a complete view of
what the client application can do with the service, as per the service level
agreement. If the framework supports service subscription, the service level
agreement will be encapsulated in the subscription properties contained in the
contract/profile for the client application, which will be a restriction of
the registered properties.
Returns \ : This parameter gives a list of matching services.
Each service is characterised by its service ID and a list of service
properties {name and value list} associated with the service.
Parameters
serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName
The \"serviceTypeName\" parameter conveys the required service type. It is key
to the central purpose of \"service trading\". It is the basis for type safe
interactions between the service exporters (via registerService) and service
importers (via discoverService). By stating a service type, the importer
implies the service type and a domain of discourse for talking about
properties of service.
Â· If the string representation of the \"type\" does not obey the rules for
service type identifiers, then the P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised.
Â· If the \"type\" is correct syntactically but is not recognised as a service
type within the Framework, then the P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE exception is
raised.
The framework may return a service of a subtype of the \"type\" requested. The
requestor may also request for a service of a specific subtype. The framework
will not return the corresponding supertype(s) in this case.
desiredPropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList
The \"desiredPropertyList\" parameter is a list of service property {name,
mode and value list} tuples that the discovered set of services should
satisfy. These properties deal with the non-functional and non-computational
aspects of the desired service. The property values in the desired property
list must be logically interpreted as \"minimum\", \"maximum\", etc. by the
framework (due to the absence of a Boolean constraint expression for the
specification of the service criterion). It is suggested that, at the time of
service registration, each property value be specified as an appropriate range
of values, so that desired property values can specify an \"enclosing\" range
of values to help in the selection of desired services.
The desiredPropertyList only contains service properties that are relevant for
the application. If an application is not interested in the value of a certain
service property, this service property shall not be included in the
desiredPropertyList.
P_INVALID_PROPERTY is raised when an application includes an unknown service
property name or invalid service property value.
max : in TpInt32
The \"max\" parameter states the maximum number of services that are to be
returned in the \"serviceList\" result.
Returns
TpServiceList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE,
P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE, P_INVALID_PROPERTY
##### 7.3.1.1.4 Method listSubscribedServices()
Returns a list of services so far subscribed by the enterprise operator. The
enterprise operator (or the client applications in the enterprise domain) can
obtain a list of subscribed services that they are allowed to access.
Returns \ : The \"serviceList\" parameter returns a list of
subscribed services. Each service is characterised by its service ID and a
list of service properties {name and value list} associated with the service.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Returns
TpServiceList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED

Inherits from: IpInterface.
This interface and the signServiceAgreement() and terminateServiceAgreement()
methods shall be implemented by an application.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpAppServiceAgreementManagement | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | signServiceAgreement (serviceToken : in TpServiceToken, | | agreementText : in TpString, signingAlgorithm : in | | TpSigningAlgorithm) : TpOctetSet | | | | terminateServiceAgreement (serviceToken : in TpServiceToken, | | terminationText : in TpString, digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet) : | | void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 7.3.2.1.1 Method signServiceAgreement()
Upon receipt of the initiateSignServiceAgrement() method from the client
application, this method is used by the framework to request that the client
application sign an agreement on the service. The framework provides the
service agreement text for the client application to sign. The service manager
returned will be configured as per the service level agreement. If the
framework uses service subscription, the service level agreement will be
encapsulated in the subscription properties contained in the contract/profile
for the client application, which will be a restriction of the registered
properties. If the client application agrees, it signs the service agreement,
returning its digital signature to the framework.
Returns \ : This contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message
Syntax) object (as defined in RFC 2630) with content type Signed-data. The
signature is calculated and created as per section 5 of RFC 2630. The content
is the agreement text given by the framework. The \"external signature\"
construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in the
EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the agreement
text). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC 2630,
shall also be used to provide replay prevention. If the signature is incorrect
the serviceToken will be expired immediately.
Parameters
serviceToken : in TpServiceToken
This is the token returned by the framework in a call to the selectService()
method. This token is used to identify the service instance to which this
service agreement corresponds. (If the client application selects many
services, it can determine which selected service corresponds to the service
agreement by matching the service token). If the serviceToken is invalid, or
not known by the client application, then the P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN
exception is thrown.
agreementText : in TpString
This is the agreement text that is to be signed by the client application
using the private key of the client application. If the agreementText is
invalid, then the P_INVALID_AGREEMENT_TEXT exception is thrown.
signingAlgorithm : in TpSigningAlgorithm
This is the algorithm used to compute the digital signature. It shall be
identical to the one chosen by the framework in response to
IpAccess.selectSigningAlgorithm(). If the signingAlgorithm is not the chosen
one, is invalid, or unknown to the client application, the
P_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM exception is thrown. The list of possible
algorithms is as specified in the TpSigningAlgorithm table. The identifier
used in this parameter must correspond to the digestAlgorithm and
signatureAlgorithm fields in the SignerInfo field in the digitalSignature (see
below).
Returns
TpOctetSet
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_AGREEMENT_TEXT, P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN,
P_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM
##### 7.3.2.1.2 Method terminateServiceAgreement()
This method is used by the framework to terminate an agreement for the
service.
Parameters
serviceToken : in TpServiceToken
This is the token passed back from the framework in a previous selectService()
method call. This token is used to identify the service agreement to be
terminated. If the serviceToken is invalid, or unknown to the client
application, the P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN exception will be thrown.
terminationText : in TpString
This is the termination text that describes the reason for the termination of
the service agreement.
digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet
This contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as defined in RFC
2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is calculated and created
as per section 5 of RFC 2630 using the same signing algorithm as was used to
initially sign the service agreement. The content is the termination text. The
\"external signature\" construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in
the EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the termination
text string). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC
2630, shall also be used to provide replay prevention. The signing algorithm
used is the same as the signing algorithm given when the service agreement was
signed using signServiceAgreement(). The framework uses this to confirm its
identity to the client application. The client application can check that the
terminationText has been signed by the framework. If a match is made, the
service agreement is terminated, otherwise the P_INVALID_SIGNATURE exception
will be thrown.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN, P_INVALID_SIGNATURE
#### 7.3.2.2 Interface Class IpServiceAgreementManagement
Inherits from: IpInterface.
This interface and the signServiceAgreement(), terminateServiceAgreement(),
selectService() and initiateSignServiceAgreement() methods shall be
implemented by a Framework.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpServiceAgreementManagement | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | signServiceAgreement (serviceToken : in TpServiceToken, | | agreementText : in TpString, signingAlgorithm : in | | TpSigningAlgorithm) : TpSignatureAndServiceMgr | | | | terminateServiceAgreement (serviceToken : in TpServiceToken, | | terminationText : in TpString, digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet) : | | void | | | | selectService (serviceID : in TpServiceID) : TpServiceToken | | | | initiateSignServiceAgreement (serviceToken : in TpServiceToken) : | | void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 7.3.2.2.1 Method signServiceAgreement()
After the framework has called signServiceAgreement() on the application\'s
IpAppServiceAgreementManagement interface, this method is used by the client
application to request that the framework sign the service agreement, which
allows the client application to use the service. A reference to the service
manager interface of the service is returned to the client application. The
service manager returned will be configured as per the service level
agreement. If the framework uses service subscription, the service level
agreement will be encapsulated in the subscription properties contained in the
contract/profile for the client application, which will be a restriction of
the registered properties. If the client application is not allowed to access
the service, then an error code (P_SERVICE_ACCESS_DENIED) is returned. If the
client application invokes this method before the processing (i.e. digital
signature verification) of the response of signServiceAgreement() on the
application\'s IpAppServiceAgreementManagement interface has completed, a
TpCommonExceptions with ExceptionType P_INVALID_STATE may be raised to
indicate that this method is currently unable to complete the method due to a
race condition. In this case, the TpCommonExceptions with ExceptionType
P_INVALID_STATE suggests the application to retry the method invocation after
a reasonable amount of time has passed.
There must be only one service instance per client application. Therefore, in
case the client attempts to select a service for which it has already signed a
service agreement and this service agreement has not been terminated, a
reference to the already existing service manager will be returned.
Returns \ : This contains the digital signature of the
framework for the service agreement, and a reference to the service manager
interface of the service. structure TpSignatureAndServiceMgr {
digitalSignature: TpOctetSet; serviceMgrInterface: IpServiceRef; };
The digitalSignature contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as
defined in RFC 2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is
calculated and created as per section 5 of RFC 2630. The content is the
agreement text given by the client application. The \"external signature\"
construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in the
EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the agreement text
string). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC 2630,
shall also be used to provide replay prevention.
The serviceMgrInterface is a reference to the service manager interface for
the selected service.
Parameters
serviceToken : in TpServiceToken
This is the token returned by the framework in a call to the selectService()
method. This token is used to identify the service instance requested by the
client application. If the serviceToken is invalid, or has expired, an error
code (P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN) is returned.
agreementText : in TpString
This is the agreement text that is to be signed by the framework using the
private key of the framework. If the agreementText is invalid, then an error
code (P_INVALID_AGREEMENT_TEXT) is returned.
signingAlgorithm : in TpSigningAlgorithm
This is the algorithm used to compute the digital signature. It shall be
identical to the one used by the framework when invoking
signServiceAgreement() on the client. If the signingAlgorithm is not the same
one, is invalid, or unknown to the framework, an error code
(P_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM) is returned. The list of possible algorithms is
as specified in the TpSigningAlgorithm table. The identifier used in this
parameter must correspond to the digestAlgorithm and signatureAlgorithm fields
in the SignerInfo field in the digitalSignature (see below).
Returns
TpSignatureAndServiceMgr
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_AGREEMENT_TEXT,
P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN, P_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM, P_SERVICE_ACCESS_DENIED
##### 7.3.2.2.2 Method terminateServiceAgreement()
This method is used by the client application to terminate an agreement for
the service.
Parameters
serviceToken : in TpServiceToken
This is the token passed back from the framework in a previous selectService()
method call. This token is used to identify the service agreement to be
terminated. If the serviceToken is invalid, or has expired, an error code
(P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN) is returned.
terminationText : in TpString
This is the termination text that describes the reason for the termination of
the service agreement.
digitalSignature : in TpOctetSet
This contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as defined in RFC
2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is calculated and created
as per section 5 of RFC 2630 using the same signing algorithm as was used to
initially sign the service agreement. The content is the termination text. The
\"external signature\" construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in
the EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the termination
text string). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC
2630, shall also be used to provide replay prevention. The signing algorithm
used is the same as the signing algorithm given when the service agreement was
signed using signServiceAgreement(). The framework uses this to check that the
terminationText has been signed by the client application. If a match is made,
the service agreement is terminated, otherwise an error code
(P_INVALID_SIGNATURE) is returned.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN,
P_INVALID_SIGNATURE
##### 7.3.2.2.3 Method selectService()
This method is used by the client application to identify the service that the
client application wishes to use. If the client application is not allowed to
access the service, then the P_SERVICE_ACCESS_DENIED exception is thrown.
Returns \ : This is a free format text token returned by the
framework, which can be signed as part of a service agreement. This will
contain operator specific information relating to the service level agreement.
The serviceToken has a limited lifetime. If the lifetime of the serviceToken
expires, a method accepting the serviceToken will return an error code
(P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN). Service Tokens will automatically expire if the
client application or framework invokes the terminateAccess method on the
other\'s corresponding access interface.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
This identifies the service required. If the serviceID is not recognised by
the framework, an error code (P_INVALID_SERVICE_ID) is returned.
Returns
TpServiceToken
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_SERVICE_ID,
P_SERVICE_ACCESS_DENIED
##### 7.3.2.2.4 Method initiateSignServiceAgreement()
This method is used by the client application to initiate the sign service
agreement process. This method shall be invoked following the application\'s
call to selectService(), and before the signing of the service agreement can
take place. If the client application is not allowed to initiate the sign
service agreement process, the exception (P_SERVICE_ACCESS_DENIED) is thrown.
Parameters
serviceToken : in TpServiceToken
This is the token returned by the framework in a call to the selectService()
method. This token is used to identify the service instance requested by the
client application. If the serviceToken is invalid, or has expired, the
exception (P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN) is thrown.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN, P_SERVICE_ACCESS_DENIED

Used by the client application to correlate this response (when it arrives)
with the original request.
activityTestResult : in TpActivityTestRes
The result of the activity test.
##### 7.3.3.1.2 Method appActivityTestReq()
The framework invokes this method to test that the client application is
operational. On receipt of this request, the application must carry out a test
on itself, to check that it is operating correctly. The application reports
the test result by invoking the appActivityTestRes method on the
IpFaultManager interface.
Parameters
activityTestID : in TpActivityTestID
The identifier provided by the framework to correlate the response (when it
arrives) with this request.
##### 7.3.3.1.3 Method \> fwFaultReportInd()
This method is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It is
strongly recommended not to implement this method. The new method
fwAvailStatusInd shall be used instead, using the new type of reason parameter
to inform the Application the reason why the Framework is unavailable.
The framework invokes this method to notify the client application of a
failure within the framework. The client application must not continue to use
the framework until it has recovered (as indicated by a fwFaultRecoveryInd).
Parameters
fault : in TpInterfaceFault
Specifies the fault that has been detected by the framework.
##### 7.3.3.1.4 Method \> fwFaultRecoveryInd()
This method is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It is
strongly recommended not to implement this method. The new method
fwAvailStatusInd shall be used instead, using the new type of reason parameter
to inform the Application when the Framework becomes available again.
The framework invokes this method to notify the client application that a
previously reported fault has been rectified. The application may then resume
using the framework.
Parameters
fault : in TpInterfaceFault
Specifies the fault from which the framework has recovered.
##### 7.3.3.1.5 Method \> fwUnavailableInd()
This method is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It is
strongly recommended not to implement this method. The new method
fwAvailStatusInd shall be used instead, using the new type of reason parameter
to inform the Application the reason why the Framework is unavailable and also
when the Framework becomes available again.
The framework invokes this method to inform the client application that it is
no longer available.
Parameters
reason : in TpFwUnavailReason
Identifies the reason why the framework is no longer available.
##### 7.3.3.1.6 Method activityTestErr()
The framework uses this method to indicate that an error occurred during an
application-initiated activity test.
Parameters
activityTestID : in TpActivityTestID
Used by the application to correlate this response (when it arrives) with the
original request.
##### 7.3.3.1.7 Method appUnavailableInd()

service instance has detected that it is not responding.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
Specifies the service for which the indication of unavailability was received.
##### 7.3.3.1.8 Method svcAvailStatusInd()
The framework invokes this method to inform the client application about the
Service instance availability status, i.e. that it can no longer use its
instance of the indicated service according to the reason parameter but as
well information when the Service Instance becomes available again. On receipt
of this request, the client application either acts to reset its use of the
specified service (using the normal mechanisms, such as the discovery and
authentication interfaces, to stop use of this service instance and begin use
of a different service instance). The client application can also wait for the
problem to be solved and just stop the usage of the service instance until the
svcAvailStatusInd() is called again with the reason SVC_AVAILABLE.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
Identifies the affected service.
reason : in TpSvcAvailStatusReason
Identifies the reason why the service is no longer available or that it has
become available again.
##### 7.3.3.1.9 Method generateFaultStatisticsRecordRes()
This method is used by the framework to provide fault statistics to a client
application in response to a generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq method
invocation on the IpFaultManager interface.
Parameters

Used by the client application to correlate this error (when it arrives) with
the original request.
faultStatistics : in TpFaultStatsErrorList
The list of fault statistics errors returned.
serviceIDs : in TpServiceIDList
Specifies the framework or services that are included in the list of fault
statistics errors returned. If the serviceIDs parameter is an empty list, then
the fault statistics error relates to the framework.
In the case where a list of services is present, this is an ordered list in
which the location of the service in this list corresponds to the location of
the related fault statistics error in the TpFaultStatsErrorList returned.
##### 7.3.3.1.11 Method generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq()
This method is used by the framework to solicit fault statistics from the
client application, for example when the framework was asked for these
statistics by a service instance by using the generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq
operation on the IpFwFaultManager interface. On receipt of this request, the
client application must produce a fault statistics record, for the application
during the specified time interval, which is returned to the framework using
the generateFaultStatisticsRecordRes operation on the IpFaultManager
interface.
Parameters
faultStatsReqID : in TpFaultReqID
The identifier provided by the framework to correlate the response (when it
arrives) with this request.
timePeriod : in TpTimeInterval
The period over which the fault statistics are to be generated. Supplying both
a start time and stop time as empty strings leaves the time period to the
discretion of the client application.
##### 7.3.3.1.12 Method fwAvailStatusInd()
The framework invokes this method to inform the client application about the
Framework availability status, i.e. that it can no longer use the Framework
according to the reason parameter or that the Framework has become available
again. The client application may wait for the problem to be solved and just
stop the usage of the Framework until the fwAvailStatusInd() is called again
with the reason FRAMEWORK_AVAILABLE.
Parameters
reason : in TpFwAvailStatusReason
Identifies the reason why the framework is no longer available or that it has
become available again.
#### 7.3.3.2 Interface Class IpFaultManager
Inherits from: IpInterface.
This interface is used by the application to inform the framework of events
that affect the integrity of the framework and services, and to request
information about the integrity of the system. The fault manager operations do
not exchange callback interfaces as it is assumed that the client application
supplies its Fault Management callback interface at the time it obtains the
Framework\'s Fault Management interface, by use of the
obtainInterfaceWithCallback operation on the IpAccess interface. If the
IpFaultManager interface is implemented by a Framework, at least one of these
methods shall be implemented. If the Framework is capable of invoking the
IpAppFaultManager.appActivityTestReq() method, it shall implement
appActivityTestRes() and appActivityTestErr() in this interface. If the
Framework is capable of invoking
IpAppFaultManager.generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq(), it shall implement
generateFaultStatisticsRecordRes() and generateFaultStatisticsRecordErr() in
this interface.

##### 7.3.3.2.1 Method activityTestReq()
The application invokes this method to test that the framework or its instance
of a service is operational. On receipt of this request, the framework must
carry out a test on itself or on the client\'s instance of the specified
service, to check that it is operating correctly. The framework reports the
test result by invoking the activityTestRes method on the IpAppFaultManager
interface. If the application does not have access to a service instance with
the specified serviceID, the P_UNAUTHORISED_PARAMETER_VALUE exception shall be
thrown. The extraInformation field of the exception shall contain the
corresponding serviceID.
For security reasons the client application has access to the service ID
rather than the service instance ID. However, as there is a one to one
relationship between the client application and a service, i.e. there is only
one service instance of the specified service per client application, it is
the obligation of the framework to determine the service instance ID from the
service ID.
Parameters
activityTestID : in TpActivityTestID
The identifier provided by the client application to correlate the response
(when it arrives) with this request.
svcID : in TpServiceID
Identifies either the framework or a service for testing. The framework is
designated by an empty string.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SERVICE_ID, P_UNAUTHORISED_PARAMETER_VALUE
##### 7.3.3.2.2 Method appActivityTestRes()
The client application uses this method to return the result of a framework-
requested activity test.
Parameters

Used by the framework to correlate this response (when it arrives) with the
original request.
activityTestResult : in TpActivityTestRes
The result of the activity test.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_ACTIVITY_TEST_ID
##### 7.3.3.2.3 Method svcUnavailableInd()
This method is used by the client application to inform the framework that it
can no longer use its instance of the indicated service (either due to a
failure in the client application or in the service instance itself). On
receipt of this request, the framework should take the appropriate corrective
action.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
Identifies the service that the application can no longer use.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SERVICE_ID, P_UNAUTHORISED_PARAMETER_VALUE
##### 7.3.3.2.4 Method appActivityTestErr()
The client application uses this method to indicate that an error occurred
during a framework-requested activity test.
Parameters

Used by the framework to correlate this response (when it arrives) with the
original request.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_ACTIVITY_TEST_ID
##### 7.3.3.2.5 Method appAvailStatusInd()
This method is used by the application to inform the framework of its
availability status. If the Application has detected a failure it uses one of
the APP_UNAVAILABLE reason types to indicate the problem and that it is
ceasing its use of all of its subscribed service instances. When the
Application is working again it shall call this method again with the
APP_AVAILABLE reason to inform the Framework that it is working properly
again. The Framework shall also attempt to inform all of the service instances
used by the specific application and/or its administrator about the problem.
Parameters
reason : in TpAppAvailStatusReason
Identifies the reason why the application is no longer available.
APP_AVAILABLE is used to inform the Framework and the Service that the
Application is available again.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions
##### 7.3.3.2.6 Method generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq()
This method is used by the application to solicit fault statistics from the
framework. On receipt of this request the framework must produce a fault
statistics record, for either the framework or for the client\'s instances of
the specified services during the specified time interval, which is returned
to the client application using the generateFaultStatisticsRecordRes operation
on the IpAppFaultManager interface. If the application does not have access to
a service instance with the specified serviceID, the
P_UNAUTHORISED_PARAMETER_VALUE exception shall be thrown. The extraInformation
field of the exception shall contain the corresponding serviceID.
Parameters
faultStatsReqID : in TpFaultReqID
The identifier provided by the application to correlate the response (when it
arrives) with this request.
timePeriod : in TpTimeInterval
The period over which the fault statistics are to be generated. Supplying both
a start time and stop time as empty strings leaves the time period to the
discretion of the framework.
serviceIDs : in TpServiceIDList

The identifier provided by the framework to correlate the response (when it
arrives) with this request.
timeInterval : in TpTimeInterval
Specifies the time interval for which load statistic records should be
reported.
##### 7.3.3.7.7 Method queryLoadStatsRes()
The framework uses this method to send load statistic records back to the
application that requested the information; i.e. in response to an invocation
of the queryLoadStatsReq method on the IpLoadManager interface.
Parameters
loadStatsReqID : in TpLoadTestID
Used by the client application to correlate this response (when it arrives)
with the original request.
loadStatistics : in TpLoadStatisticList
Specifies the framework-supplied load statistics.
##### 7.3.3.7.8 Method queryLoadStatsErr()
The framework uses this method to return an error response to the application
that requested the framework\'s load statistics information, when the
framework is unsuccessful in obtaining any load statistic records; i.e. in
response to an invocation of the queryLoadStatsReq method on the IpLoadManager
interface.

Used by the client application to correlate this error (when it arrives) with
the original request.
loadStatisticsError : in TpLoadStatisticError
Specifies the error code associated with the failed attempt to retrieve the
framework\'s load statistics.
#### 7.3.3.8 Interface Class IpLoadManager
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The framework API should allow the load to be distributed across multiple
machines and across multiple component processes, according to a load
management policy. The separation of the load management mechanism and load
management policy ensures the flexibility of the load management services. The
load management policy identifies what load management rules the framework
should follow for the specific client application. It might specify what
action the framework should take as the congestion level changes. For example,
some real-time critical applications will want to make sure continuous service
is maintained, below a given congestion level, at all costs, whereas other
services will be satisfied with disconnecting and trying again later if the
congestion level rises. Clearly, the load management policy is related to the
QoS level to which the application is subscribed. The framework load
management function is represented by the IpLoadManager interface. Most
methods are asynchronous, in that they do not lock a thread into waiting
whilst a transaction performs. To handle responses and reports, the client
application developer must implement the IpAppLoadManager interface to provide
the callback mechanism. The application supplies the identity of this callback
interface at the time it obtains the framework\'s load manager interface, by
use of the obtainInterfaceWithCallback operation on the IpAccess interface. If
the IpLoadManager interface is implemented by a Framework, at least one of the
methods shall be implemented as a minimum requirement. If load level
notifications are supported, the createLoadLevelNotification() and
destroyLoadLevelNotification() methods shall be implemented. If
suspendNotification() is implemented, then resumeNotification() shall be
implemented also. If a Framework is capable of invoking the
IpAppLoadManager.queryAppLoadStatsReq() method, then it shall implement
queryAppLoadStatsRes() and queryAppLoadStatsErr() methods in this interface.

##### 7.3.3.8.1 Method reportLoad()
The client application uses this method to report its current load level (0,
1, or 2) to the framework: e.g. when the load level on the application has
changed.
At level 0 load, the application is performing within its load specifications

##### 7.4.3.1.1 Idle State
In this state the application has obtained an interface reference of the
LoadManager from the IpAccess interface.
##### 7.4.3.1.2 Notification Suspended State
Due to e.g. a temporary load condition, the application has requested the
LoadManager to suspend sending the load level notification information.
##### 7.4.3.1.3 Active State
In this state the application has indicated its interest in notifications by
performing a createLoadLevelNotification() invocation on the IpLoadManager.
The load manager can now request the application to supply load statistics
information (by invoking queryAppLoadStatsReq()). Furthermore the LoadManager
can request the application to control its load (by invoking
loadLevelNotification(), resumeNotification() or suspendNotification() on the
application side of interface). In case the application detects a change in
load level, it reports this to the LoadManager by calling the method
reportLoad().

##### 7.4.3.4.2 Framework Faulty State
In this state, the framework has detected an internal problem with itself such
that application and services capability features cannot communicate with it
anymore; attempts to invoke any methods that belong to any SCFs of the
framework return an error. If the framework ever recovers, applications with
fault management callbacks will be notified via a fwAvailStatusInd message.

### 8.1.1 Service Discovery Sequence Diagrams
No Sequence Diagrams exist for Service Discovery
### 8.1.2 Service Registration Sequence Diagrams
#### 8.1.2.1 New SCF Sub Type Registration
The following figure shows the process of registering a new proprietary
Service Capability Feature in the Framework. This SCF is a sub type of the
standard SCF.
{width="6.672916666666667in" height="4.6097222222222225in"}
1: Registration: first step - register service sub type. For sub type
registration, besides the values for the standard service properties, the
modes, types, and values for the additional service properties must be
provided by the SCF.
2: Registration: second step - announce service availability. This is
identical to announcing availability of super types.
#### 8.1.2.2 New SCF Registration
The following figure shows the process of registering a new Service Capability
Feature in the Framework. Service Registration is a two step process:
{width="6.6875in" height="3.9881944444444444in"}
1: Registration: first step - register service.
The purpose of this first step in the process of registration is to agree,
within the network, on a name to call, internally, a newly installed SCF
version. It is necessary because the OSA Framework and SCF in the same network
may come from different vendors. The goal is to make an association between
the new SCF version, as characterized by a list of properties, and an
identifier called serviceID.
This service ID will be the name used in that network (that is, between that
network\'s Framework and its SCSs), whenever it is necessary to refer to this
newly installed version of SCF (for example for announcing its availability,
or for withdrawing it later).
The following input parameters are given from the SCS to the Framework in this
first registration step:
Â· in serviceTypeName
This is a string with the name of the SCF, among a list of standard names
(e.g. \"P_MPCC\").
Â· in servicePropertyList
This is a list of types TpServiceProperty; each TpServiceProperty is a pair of
(ServicePropertyName, ServicePropertyValueList).
Â· ServicePropertyName is a string that defines a valid SFC property name
(valid SCF property names are listed in the SCF data definition).
Â· ServicePropertyValueList is a numbered set of types TpServicePropertyValue;
TpServicePropertyValue is a string that describes a valid value of a SCF
property (valid SCF property values are listed in the SCF data definition).
The following output parameter results from service registration:
Â· out serviceID
This is a string, automatically generated by the Framework and unique within
the Framework.
This is the name by which the newly installed version of SCF, described by the
list of properties above, is going to be identified internally in this
network.
2: Registration: second step - announce service availability.
At this point the network\'s Framework is aware of the existence of a new SCF,
and could let applications know - but they would have no way to use it.
Installing the SCS logic and assigning a name to it does not make this SCF
available. In order to make the SCF available an \"entry point\", called
lifecycle manager, is used. The role of the lifecycle manager is to control
the life cycle of an interface, or set of interfaces, and provide clients with
the references that are necessary to invoke the methods offered by these
interfaces. The starting point for a client to use an SCF is to obtain an
interface reference to a lifecycle manager of the desired SCF.
A Network Operator, upon completion of the first registration phase, and once
it has an identifier to the new SCF version, will instantiate a lifecycle
manager for it that will allow client to use it. Then it will inform the
Framework of the value of the interface associated to the new SCF. After the
receipt of this information, the Framework makes the new SCF (identified by
the pair [serviceID, serviceInstanceLifecycleManagerRef]) discoverable.
The following input parameters are given from the SCS to the Framework in this
second registration step:
Â· in serviceID.
This is the identifier that has been agreed in the network for the new SCF;
any interaction related to the SCF needs to include the serviceID, to know
which SCF it is.
Â· in serviceInstanceLifecycleManagerRef.
This is the interface reference at which the lifecycle manager of the new SCF
is available. Note that the Framework will have to invoke the method
createServiceManager() in this interface when a client application signs an
agreement to use the SCF so that it can get the service manager interface
necessary for applications as an entry point to any SCF.
### 8.1.3 Service Instance Lifecycle Manager Sequence Diagrams
#### 8.1.3.1 Sign Service Agreement
This sequence illustrates how the application can get access to a specified
service. It only illustrates the last part: the signing of the service
agreement and the corresponding actions towards the service. For more
information on accessing the framework, authentication and discovery of
services, see the corresponding clauses.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.808333333333333in"}
1: The application selects the service, using a serviceID for the generic call
control service. The serviceID could have been obtained via the discovery
interface. A ServiceToken is returned to the application.
2: The client application signs the service agreement.
3: The framework signs the service agreement. As a result a service manager
interface reference (in this case of type IpCallControlManager) is returned to
the application.
4: Provided the signature information is correct and all conditions have been
fulfilled, the framework will request the service identified by the serviceID
to return a service manager interface reference. The service manager is the
initial point of contact to the service.
5: The lifecycle manager creates a new manager interface instance (a call
control manager) for the specified application. It should be noted that this
is an implementation detail. The service implementation may use other
mechanism to get a service manager interface instance.
Following the creation of the service manager outlined above, a unique
instance of the service particular to the application client results. This
service instance is assigned a serviceInstanceID by the Framework, which is
provided to the Service Instance Lifecycle manager during the
createServiceManager operation. If it is necessary that Framework Integrity
Management functionality and operations are to be supported between the
Framework and the service instance identified by the defined
serviceInstanceID, it is then necessary for the new service instance to
establish an access session with the Framework. This provides the Framework
with the ability to manage and monitor the operation of the service instance
that relates to a particular application client. The steps required to
establish a Framework access session are outlined in clause 6 of the present
document.
6: The application creates a new IpAppCallControlManager interface to be used
for callbacks.
7: The Application sets the callback interface to the interface created with
the previous message.
An application (identifiable by a given TpClientAppID may carry out the
sequence, as exemplified above, multiple times.

#### 8.1.4.4 Heartbeat Management: Start/perform/end heartbeat supervision of
the service
In this sequence diagram, the framework has decided that it wishes to monitor
the service, and has therefore requested the service to commence sending its
heartbeat. The service responds by sending its heartbeat at the specified
interval. The framework then decides that it is satisfied with the service\'s
health and disables the heartbeat mechanism. If the heartbeat was not received
from the service within the specified interval, the framework can decide that
the service has failed the heartbeat and can then perform some recovery
action.

#### 8.1.4.5 Fault Management: Service requests Framework activity test
{width="6.692361111111111in" height="3.2506944444444446in"}
1: The service asks the framework to carry out its activity test. The service
denotes that it requires the activity test done for the framework, rather than
an application, by supplying an appropriate parameter.
2: The framework carries out the test and returns the result to the service.
#### 8.1.4.6 Fault Management: Service requests Application activity test
{width="6.686805555555556in" height="5.098611111111111in"}
1: The service instance asks the framework to invoke an activity test on the
client application.
2: The framework asks the application to do the activity test. It is assumed
that there is internal communication between the service facing part of the
framework (i.e. IpFwFaultManager interface) and the part that faces the client
application.
3: The application does the activity test and returns the result to the
framework.
4: The framework internally passes the result from its application facing
interface (IpFaultManager) to its service facing side, and sends the result to
the service.
#### 8.1.4.7 Fault Management: Application requests Service activity test
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="7.4375in"}
1: The client application asks the framework to invoke an activity test on a
service, the service is identified by the svcId parameter.
2: The framework asks the service to do the activity test. It is assumed that
there is internal communication between the application facing part of the
framework (i.e. IpFaultManager interface) and the part that faces the service.
3: The service does the activity test and returns the result to the framework.
4: The framework internally passes the result from its service facing
interface (IpFwFaultManager) to its application facing side, and sends the
result to the client application.
#### 8.1.4.8 Fault Management: Application detects service is unavailable
{width="6.686111111111111in" height="5.008333333333334in"}
1: The client application detects that the service instance is currently not
available, i.e. the service instance is not responding to the client
application in the normal way, so it informs the framework.
2: The framework informs the service instance that the client application was
unable to get a response from it and can no longer use the service instance.
The service or framework may then decide to carry out an activity test to see
whether there is a general problem with the service instance that requires
further action.

## 8.3 Interface Classes
### 8.3.1 Service Registration Interface Classes
Before a service can be brokered (discovered, subscribed, accessed, etc.) by
an enterprise, it has to be registered with the Framework. Services are
registered against a particular service type. Therefore service types are
created first, and then services corresponding to those types are accepted
from the Service Suppliers for registration in the framework. The framework
maintains a repository of service types and registered services.
In order to register a new service in the framework, the service supplier must
select a service type and the \"property values\" for the service. The service
discovery functionality described in the previous clause enables the service
supplier to obtain a list of all the service types supported by the framework
and their associated sets of service property values.
The Framework service registration-related interfaces are invoked by third
party service supplier\'s administrative applications. They are described
below. Note that these methods cannot be invoked until the authentication
methods have been invoked successfully.
#### 8.3.1.1 Interface Class IpFwServiceRegistration
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The Service Registration interface provides the methods used for the
registration of network SCFs at the framework. This interface and at least the
methods registerService(), announceServiceAvailability(), unregisterService()
and unannounceService() shall be implemented by a Framework.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpFwServiceRegistration | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | registerService (serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName, | | servicePropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList) : TpServiceID | | | | announceServiceAvailability (serviceID : in TpServiceID, | | serviceInstanceLifecycleManagerRef : in | | service_lifecycle::IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManagerRef) : void | | | | unregisterService (serviceID : in TpServiceID) : void | | | | describeService (serviceID : in TpServiceID) : TpServiceDescription | | | | unannounceService (serviceID : in TpServiceID) : void | | | | registerServiceSubType (serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName, | | servicePropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList, | | extendedServicePropertyList : in TpServiceTypePropertyValueList) : | | TpServiceID | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 8.3.1.1.1 Method registerService()
The registerService() operation is the means by which a service is registered
in the Framework, for subsequent discovery by the enterprise applications.
Registration can only succeed when the Service type of the service is known to
the Framework (ServiceType is \'available\'). A service-ID is returned to the
service supplier when a service is registered in the Framework. When the
service is not registered because the ServiceType is \'unavailable\', a
P_SERVICE_TYPE_UNAVAILABLE is raised. The service-ID is the handle with which
the service supplier can identify the registered service when needed (e.g. for
withdrawing it). The service-ID is only meaningful in the context of the
Framework that generated it.
This method should be used for registration of service super types only. For
registering service sub types, the registerServiceSubType() method should be
used.
Returns \ : This is the unique handle that is returned as a result
of the successful completion of this operation. The Service Supplier can
identify the registered service when attempting to access it via other
operations such as unregisterService(), etc. Enterprise client applications
are also returned this service-ID when attempting to discover a service of
this type.
If a service is registered with the property P_COMPATIBLE_WITH_SERVICE in its
servicePropertyList, then the Framework shall notify all applications using
instances of services identified by this property, using the
P_EVENT_FW_MIGRATION_SERVICE_AVAILABLE event, if they have registered for such
a notification. If an incorrect combination of properties is included in
conjunction with P_COMPATIBLE_WITH_SERVICE, a P_MISSING_MANDATORY_PROPERTY
exception is raised.
Parameters
serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName
The \"serviceTypeName\" parameter identifies the service type. If the string
representation of the \"type\" does not obey the rules for identifiers, then a
P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised. If the \"type\" is correct
syntactically but the Framework is able to unambiguously determine that it is
not a recognised service type, then a P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE exception is
raised.
servicePropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList
The \"servicePropertyList\" parameter is a list of property name and property
value pairs. They describe the service being registered. This description
typically covers behavioural, non-functional and non-computational aspects of
the service. Service properties are marked \"mandatory\" or \"readonly\".
These property mode attributes have the following semantics: a. mandatory - a
service associated with this service type must provide an appropriate value
for this property when registering. b. readonly - this modifier indicates that
the property is optional, but that once given a value, subsequently it may not
be modified. Specifying both modifiers indicates that a value must be provided
and that subsequently it may not be modified. Examples of such properties are
those which form part of a service agreement and hence cannot be modified by
service suppliers during the life time of service. If the type or the
semantics of the type of any of the property values is not the same as the
declared type (declared in the service type), then a P_PROPERTY_TYPE_MISMATCH
exception is raised. If the \"servicePropertyList\" parameter omits any
property declared in the service type with a mode of mandatory, then a
P_MISSING_MANDATORY_PROPERTY exception is raised. If two or more properties
with the same property name are included in this parameter, the
P_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME exception is raised.
Returns
TpServiceID
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_PROPERTY_TYPE_MISMATCH, P_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME,
P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE, P_MISSING_MANDATORY_PROPERTY,
P_SERVICE_TYPE_UNAVAILABLE
##### 8.3.1.1.2 Method announceServiceAvailability()
The registerService() method described previously does not make the service
discoverable. The announceServiceAvailability() method is invoked after the
service is authenticated and its service instance lifecycle manager is
instantiated at a particular interface. This method informs the framework of
the availability of \"service instance lifecycle manager\" of the previously
registered service, identified by its service ID, at a specific interface.
After the receipt of this method, the framework makes the corresponding
service discoverable.
There exists a \"service manager\" instance per service instance. Each service
implements the IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManager interface. The
IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManager interface supports a method called the
createServiceManager(application: in TpClientAppID, serviceProperties : in
TpServicePropertyList, serviceInstanceID : in TpServiceInstanceID) :
IpServiceRef. When the service agreement is signed for some serviceID (using
signServiceAgreement()), the framework calls the createServiceManager() for
this service, gets a serviceManager and returns this to the client
application.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
The service ID of the service that is being announced. If the string
representation of the \"serviceID\" does not obey the rules for service
identifiers, then a P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID exception is raised. If the
\"serviceID\" is legal but there is no service offer within the Framework with
that ID, then a P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID exception is raised.
serviceInstanceLifecycleManagerRef : in
service_lifecycle::IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManagerRef
The interface reference at which the service instance lifecycle manager of the
previously registered service is available.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID,
P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
##### 8.3.1.1.3 Method unregisterService()
The unregisterService() operation is used by the service suppliers to remove a
registered service from the Framework. The service is identified by the
\"service-ID\" which was originally returned by the Framework in response to
the registerService() operation. The service must be in the SCF Registered
state. All instances of the service will be deleted.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
The service to be withdrawn is identified by the \"serviceID\" parameter which
was originally returned by the registerService() operation. If the string
representation of the \"serviceID\" does not obey the rules for service
identifiers, then a P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID exception is raised. If the
\"serviceID\" is legal but there is no service offer within the Framework with
that ID, then a P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID exception is raised.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID
##### 8.3.1.1.4 Method describeService()
The describeService() operation returns the information about a service that
is registered in the framework. It comprises, the \"type\" of the service ,
and the \"properties\" that describe this service. The service is identified
by the \"service-ID\" parameter which was originally returned by the
registerService() operation.
The SCS may register various versions of the same SCF, each with a different
description (more or less restrictive, for example), and each getting a
different serviceID assigned.
Returns \ : This consists of the information about an
offered service that is held by the Framework. It comprises the \"type\" of
the service , and the properties that describe this service.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
The service to be described is identified by the \"serviceID\" parameter which
was originally returned by the registerService() operation. If the string
representation of the \"serviceID\" does not obey the rules for object
identifiers, then an P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID exception is raised. If the
\"serviceID\" is legal but there is no service offer within the Framework with
that ID, then a P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID exception is raised.
Returns
TpServiceDescription
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID
##### 8.3.1.1.5 Method unannounceService()
This method results in the service no longer being discoverable by
applications. It is, however, still registered and the service ID is still
associated with it. Applications currently using the service can continue to
use the service but no new applications should be able to start using the
service. Also, all unused service tokens relating to the service will be
expired. This will prevent anyone who has already performed a selectService()
but not yet performed the signServiceAgreement() from being able to obtain a
new instance of the service.
Parameters
serviceID : in TpServiceID
The service ID of the service that is being unannounced. If the string
representation of the \"serviceID\" does not obey the rules for service
identifiers, then a P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID exception is raised. If the
\"serviceID\" is legal but there is no service offer within the Framework with
that ID, then a P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID exception is raised.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_ID, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_ID
##### 8.3.1.1.6 Method registerServiceSubType()
The registerServiceSubType() operation is the means by which an extended
service is registered in the Framework, for subsequent discovery by the
enterprise applications. Registration only succeeds if the service type is
known to the Framework (ServiceType is \'available\'). A service-ID is
returned to the service supplier when a service is registered in the
Framework. When the service is not registered because the ServiceType is
\'unavailable\', a P_SERVICE_TYPE_UNAVAILABLE exception is raised. The
service-ID is the handle with which the service supplier can identify the
registered service when needed (e.g. for withdrawing it). The service-ID is
only meaningful in the context of the Framework that generated it.
This method should be used for registration of service sub types only. For
registering service super types, the registerService () method should be used.
Returns \ : This is the unique handle that is returned as a result
of the successful completion of this operation. The Service Supplier can
identify the registered service when attempting to access it via other
operations such as unregisterService(), etc. Enterprise client applications
are also returned this service-ID when attempting to discover a service of
this type.
Parameters
serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName
The \"serviceTypeName\" parameter identifies the service type. If the string
representation of the \"type\" does not obey the rules for identifiers, then a
P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised. If the \"type\" is correct
syntactically but the Framework is able to unambiguously determine that it is
not a recognised service type, then a P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE exception is
raised.
servicePropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList
The \"servicePropertyList\" parameter is a list of property name and property
value pairs corresponding to the service properties applicable to the standard
service. They describe the service being registered.
If the type or the semantics of the type of any of the property values is not
the same as the declared type (declared in the service type), then a
P_PROPERTY_TYPE_MISMATCH exception is raised.
If the \"servicePropertyList\" parameter omits any property declared in the
service type with a mode of mandatory, then a P_MISSING_MANDATORY_PROPERTY
exception is raised.
If two or more properties with the same property name are included in this
parameter, the P_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME exception is raised.
extendedServicePropertyList : in TpServiceTypePropertyValueList
The \"extendedServicePropertyList\" parameter is a list of property name,
mode, type, and property value tuples corresponding to the service properties
applicable to the extended standard service. They describe the service being
registered.
If two or more properties with the same property name are included in this
parameter, the P_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME exception is raised.
Returns
TpServiceID
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_PROPERTY_TYPE_MISMATCH, P_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME,
P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE, P_MISSING_MANDATORY_PROPERTY,
P_SERVICE_TYPE_UNAVAILABLE
### 8.3.2 Service Instance Lifecycle Manager Interface Classes
The IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManager interface allows the framework to get
access to a service manager interface of a service. It is used during the
signServiceAgreement, in order to return a service manager interface reference
to the application. Each service has a service manager interface that is the
initial point of contact for the service. E.g. the generic call control
service uses the IpCallControlManager interface.
#### 8.3.2.1 Interface Class IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManager
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManager interface allows the Framework to create
and destroy Service Manager Instances. This interface and the
createServiceManager() and destroyServiceManager() methods shall be
implemented by a Service.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpServiceInstanceLifecycleManager | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | createServiceManager (application : in TpClientAppID, | | serviceProperties : in TpServicePropertyList, serviceInstanceID : in | | TpServiceInstanceID) : IpServiceRef | | | | destroyServiceManager (serviceInstance : in TpServiceInstanceID) : | | void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 8.3.2.1.1 Method createServiceManager()
This method returns a new service manager interface reference for the
specified application. The service instance will be configured for the client
application using the properties agreed in the service level agreement.
In case there is already a service manager available for the specified
application and serviceInstanceID this reference is returned and no new
service manager is created.
Returns \ : Specifies the service manager interface reference
for the specified application ID.
Parameters
application : in TpClientAppID
Specifies the application for which the service manager interface is
requested.
serviceProperties : in TpServicePropertyList
Specifies the service properties and their values that are to be used to
configure the service instance. These properties form a part of the service
level agreement. An example of these properties is a list of methods that the
client application is allowed to invoke on the service interfaces.
serviceInstanceID : in TpServiceInstanceID
Specifies the Service Instance ID that the new Service Manager is to be
identified by.
Returns
IpServiceRef
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_PROPERTY
##### 8.3.2.1.2 Method destroyServiceManager()
This method destroys an existing service manager interface reference. This
will result in the client application being unable to use the service manager
any more.
Parameters
serviceInstance : in TpServiceInstanceID
Identifies the Service Instance to be destroyed.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions
### 8.3.3 Service Discovery Interface Classes
This API complements the Service Registration functionality described in
another clause.
Before a service can be registered in the framework, the service supplier must
know what \"types\" of services the Framework supports and what service
\"properties\" are applicable to each service type. The \"listServiceType()\"
method returns a list of all \"service types\" that are currently supported by
the framework and the \"describeServiceType()\" method returns a description
of each service type. The description of service type includes the \"service-
specific properties\" that are applicable to each service type. Then the
service supplier can retrieve a specific set of registered services that both
belong to a given type and possess a specific set of \"property values\", by
using the \"discoverService()\" method.
Additionally the service supplier can retrieve a list of all registered
services, without regard to type or property values, by using the
\"listRegisteredServices()\" method. However the scope of the list will depend
upon the framework implementation; e.g. a service supplier may only be
permitted to retrieve a list of services that the service supplier has
previously registered.
#### 8.3.3.1 Interface Class IpFwServiceDiscovery
Inherits from: IpInterface.
This interface shall be implemented by a Framework with as a minimum
requirement the listServiceTypes(), describeServiceType() and
discoverService() methods.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpFwServiceDiscovery | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | listServiceTypes () : TpServiceTypeNameList | | | | describeServiceType (name : in TpServiceTypeName) : | | TpServiceTypeDescription | | | | discoverService (serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName, | | desiredPropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList, max : in TpInt32) : | | TpServiceList | | | | listRegisteredServices () : TpServiceList | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
##### 8.3.3.1.1 Method listServiceTypes()
This operation returns the names of all service types that are in the
repository. The details of the service types can then be obtained using the
describeServiceType() method.
Returns \ : The names of the requested service types.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Returns
TpServiceTypeNameList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions
##### 8.3.3.1.2 Method describeServiceType()
This operation lets the caller obtain the details for a particular service
type.
Returns \ : The description of the specified service
type. The description provides information about: the service properties
associated with this service type: i.e. a list of service property {name, mode
and type} tuples, the names of the super types of this service type, and
whether the service type is currently available or unavailable.
Parameters
name : in TpServiceTypeName
The name of the service type to be described. If the \"name\" is malformed,
then the P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised. If the \"name\" does not
exist in the repository, then the P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised.
Returns
TpServiceTypeDescription
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE
##### 8.3.3.1.3 Method discoverService()
The discoverService operation is the means by which the service supplier can
retrieve a specific set of registered services that both belong to a given
type and possess a specific set of \"property values\". The service supplier
passes in a list of desired service properties to describe the service it is
looking for, in the form of attribute/value pairs for the service properties.
The service supplier also specifies the maximum number of matched responses it
is willing to accept. The framework must not return more matches than the
specified maximum, but it is up to the discretion of the Framework
implementation to choose to return less than the specified maximum. The
discoverService() operation returns a serviceID/Property pair list for those
services that match the desired service property list that the service
supplier provided.
Returns \ : This parameter gives a list of matching services.
Each service is characterised by its service ID and a list of service
properties {name and value list} associated with the service.
Parameters
serviceTypeName : in TpServiceTypeName
The name of the required service type. If the string representation of the
\"type\" does not obey the rules for service type identifiers, then the
P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised. If the \"type\" is correct
syntactically but is not recognised as a service type within the Framework,
then the P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE exception is raised. The framework may return
a service of a subtype of the \"type\" requested. A service sub-type can be
described by the properties of its supertypes.
desiredPropertyList : in TpServicePropertyList
The \"desiredPropertyList\" parameter is a list of service properties {name
and value list} that the required services should satisfy. These properties
deal with the non-functional and non-computational aspects of the desired
service. The property values in the desired property list must be logically
interpreted as \"minimum\", \"maximum\", etc. by the framework (due to the
absence of a Boolean constraint expression for the specification of the
service criterion). It is suggested that, at the time of service registration,
each property value be specified as an appropriate range of values, so that
desired property values can specify an \"enclosing\" range of values to help
in the selection of desired services.
max : in TpInt32
The \"max\" parameter states the maximum number of services that are to be
returned in the \"serviceList\" result.
Returns
TpServiceList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ILLEGAL_SERVICE_TYPE, P_UNKNOWN_SERVICE_TYPE,
P_INVALID_PROPERTY
##### 8.3.3.1.4 Method listRegisteredServices()
Returns a list of services so far registered in the framework.
Returns \ : The \"serviceList\" parameter returns a list of
registered services. Each service is characterised by its service ID and a
list of service properties {name and value list} associated with the service.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Returns
TpServiceList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions
### 8.3.4 Integrity Management Interface Classes
#### 8.3.4.1 Interface Class IpFwFaultManager
Inherits from: IpInterface.
This interface is used by the service instance to inform the framework of
events which affect the integrity of the API, and request fault management
status information from the framework. The fault manager operations do not
exchange callback interfaces as it is assumed that the service instance has
supplied its Fault Management callback interface at the time it obtains the
Framework\'s Fault Management interface, by use of the
obtainInterfaceWithCallback operation on the IpAccess interface. If the
IpFwFaultManager interface is implemented by a Framework, at least one of
these methods shall be implemented. If the Framework is capable of invoking
the IpSvcFaultManager.svcActivityTestReq() method, it shall implement
svcActivityTestRes() and svcActivityTestErr() in this interface. If the
Framework is capable of invoking
IpSvcFaultManager.generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq(), it shall implement
generateFaultStatisticsRecordRes() and generateFaultStatisticsRecordErr() in
this interface. If the Framework is capable of invoking
IpSvcFaultManager.generateFaultStatisticsRecordReq(), it shall implement

#### 8.3.4.7 Interface Class IpFwLoadManager
Inherits from: IpInterface.
The framework API should allow the load to be distributed across multiple
machines and across multiple component processes, according to a load
management policy. The separation of the load management mechanism and load
management policy ensures the flexibility of the load management services. The
load management policy identifies what load management rules the framework
should follow for the specific service. It might specify what action the
framework should take as the congestion level changes. For example, some real-
time critical applications will want to make sure continuous service is
maintained, below a given congestion level, at all costs, whereas other
services will be satisfied with disconnecting and trying again later if the
congestion level rises. Clearly, the load management policy is related to the
QoS level to which the application is subscribed. The framework load
management function is represented by the IpFwLoadManager interface. To handle
responses and reports, the service developer must implement the
IpSvcLoadManager interface to provide the callback mechanism. If the
IpFwLoadManager interface is implemented by a Framework, at least one of the
methods shall be implemented as a minimum requirement. If load level
notifications are supported, the createLoadLevelNotification() and
destroyLoadLevelNotification() methods shall be implemented. If
suspendNotification() is implemented, then resumeNotification() shall be
implemented also. If a Framework is capable of invoking the
IpSvcLoadManager.querySvcLoadStatsReq() method, then it shall implement
querySvcLoadStatsRes() and querySvcLoadStatsErr() methods in this interface.

##### 8.3.4.7.1 Method reportLoad()
The service instance uses this method to report its current load level (0, 1,

changed.
At level 0 load, the service instance is performing within its load
specifications (i.e. it is not congested or overloaded). At level 1 load, the
service instance is overloaded. At level 2 load, the service instance is
severely overloaded. In addition this method shall be called by the service

##### 8.4.1.1.1 SCF Registered State
This is the state entered when a Service Capability Server (SCS) registers its
SCF in the Framework, by informing it of the existence of an SCF characterised
by a service type and a set of service properties. As a result the Framework
associates a service ID to this SCF, that will be used to identify it by both
sides.
An SCF may be unregistered, the service ID then being no longer associated
with the SCF.
##### 8.4.1.1.2 SCF Announced State
This is the state entered when the existence of the SCF has been announced,
thus making it available for discovery by applications. The SCF can be
unannounced at any time, taking it back into the SCF Registered state where it
is no longer available for discovery.

##### 8.4.4.1.3 Active State
In this state the service has indicated its interest in notifications by
performing a createLoadLevelNotification() invocation on the IpFwLoadManager.
The load manager can now request the service to supply load statistics
information (by invoking querySvcLoadStatsReq()). Furthermore the LoadManager
can request the service to control its load (by invoking
loadLevelNotification(), resumeNotification() or suspendNotification() on the
service side of interface). In case the service detects a change in load
level, it reports this to the LoadManager by calling the method reportLoad().

to handle requests from both applications and service capability features.
##### 8.4.4.2.2 Framework Activity Test State
In this state, the framework is performing a self-diagnostic test. If a
problem is diagnosed, all services with fault management callbacks are
notified through an fwAvailStatusInd message.
##### 8.4.4.2.3 Application Activity Test State
In this state, the framework is performing a test on one client application.
If the application is faulty, services that are used by the application and
that have provided fault management callbacks are notified accordingly through
an appAvailStatusInd message.
##### 8.4.4.2.4 Framework Faulty State
In this state, the framework has detected an internal problem with itself such
that application and service capability features cannot communicate with it
anymore; attempts to invoke any methods that belong to any SCFs of the
framework return an error. If the framework ever recovers, services with fault
management callbacks will be notified via a fwAvailStatusInd message.

# 8a Frameworkâ€‘toâ€‘Enterprise Operator API
In some cases, the client applications (or the enterprise operators on behalf
of these applications) must explicitly subscribe to the services before the
client applications can access those services. To accomplish this, they use
the service subscription function of the Framework for subscribing or
unâ€‘subscribing to services. Subscription represents a contractual agreement
between the enterprise operator and the Framework operator. In general, an
entity acting in the role of a _customer/subscriber_ subscribes to the
services provided by the Framework on behalf of the _users/consumers_ of the
service.
In this model, the enterprise operators act in the role of
_subscriber/customer_ of services and the client applications act in the role
of _users or consumers_ of _services_. The framework itself acts in the role
of _retailer_ of services. The following examples illustrate these roles:
  * Service (to be subscribed): Call Centre Service, Mobility Service, > etc.
  * Framework Operator: AT&T, BT, etc.
  * Enterprise Operator: A Financial institution such as a Bank or > Insurance Company, or possibly an Application Service Provider > (Such an enterprise has a conformant Subscription Application in > its domain which \"talks\" to its peer in the Framework).
  * User/Consumer: Client Applications (or their associated users) in > the enterprise domain that use the Call Centre Service or the > Mobility Service.
The Service Subscription interface is used by an enterprise operator to
subscribe to new services and is required before a client application of the
enterprise can use the new service. In general, the service subscription is
performed after an offâ€‘line negotiation of a set of services and the
associated price between the framework operator and the enterprise operator.
The service subscription is performed online by the enterprise operator in the
frame of an existing offâ€‘line negotiated contract between the framework
operator and the enterprise. The onâ€‘line service subscription function is used
for subscriber, client application, and service contract management. The
following clause describes a service subscription model.
Subscription Business Model
The following figure shows the subscription business model with respect to the
business roles involved in the service subscription process. The subscription
process involves the enterprise operator (which acts in the role of service
_subscriber_) and the Framework (which acts in the role of _provider_ or
_retailer_ of a service).
Services may be provided to the Enterprise Operator directly by a service
provider or indirectly through a retailer, such as the Framework. An
enterprise operator represents an organisation or a company which will be
hosting client applications. Before a service can be used by the _client
applications_ in the enterprise operator\'s domain, subscription to the
service must take place. An enterprise operator subscribes to a service by
(electronically) signing a contract about the service usage with the
Framework, using an onâ€‘line subscription interface provided by the Framework.
The Framework provides the service according to the service contract. The
Enterprise Operator authorises the client application in his/her domain for
the service usage. Finally a subscribed service can be used by a particular
client application.
Figure: Subscription Business Model
The interfaces between an enterprise operator and the client applications in
its domain are outside the scope of this API.
The enterprise operator provides to the Framework the data about the client
applications in its domain and the type of services each of them should be
allowed access to, using the subscription interfaces offered by the Framework.
The Framework provides (to the enterprise operator) the subscription
interfaces for subscriber, client application and service contract management.
This gives the enterprise operators the capability to dynamically create,
modify and delete, in the framework domain, the client applications and
service contracts belonging to its domain.
The enterprise operator is represented in the Framework domain as an EntOp
_object_. The EntOp object is identified by a unique _ID_ and contains the
_enterprise operator properties_. The EntOp ID is a unique identifier of an
enterprise operator in the Framework domain. It is created by the Framework
Operator during the preâ€‘subscription offâ€‘line negotiation of services (and
their price, etc.) phase. The enterprise operator properties contain
information such as the name and address of the enterprise operator
(individual or organisation), service charge payment information, etc. The
enterprise operator domain has one or more client applications associated with
it. The enterprise operator may group a subâ€‘set of client applications in its
domain in order to assign the same set of service features to the group. Such
a group is called a Subscription Assignment Group (SAG). An enterprise
operator may have multiple SAGs in its domain. A SAG relates a client
application to the features of a service. A client application may be a member
of multiple SAGs, one for each service subscribed for the client application
by its enterprise operator.
The enterprise operator subscribes to a number of services by creating a
_service contract_ with the Framework for each service. Each service
subscription is described by a _service contract_ which defines the conditions
for the service provision. A _service contract_ restricts the usage of a
service at subscription time. A service contract contains one or more _Service
Profile_ s, one for each SAG in the enterprise operator domain. A _Service
Profile_ contains the service parameters which further restrict the
corresponding parameters in the service contract in order to adapt the service
to the SAG\'s needs. A service profile is therefore a restriction of the
service contract in order to provide restricted service features to a SAG. It
is identified by a unique _ID_ (within the framework domain) and contains a
set of _service properties_ , which defines the restricted usage of service
allowed for that SAG (and its client applications).
Figure: Relationship between Client Applications/SAG, Service Contract and
Service Profiles
The _client application_ is related to the _enterprise operator_ for the usage
of a service. The client application is represented in the Framework domain as
a _clientApp_ object. The _clientApp_ object is identified by a unique ID and
contains a set of _client application properties_ describing the client
application relevant information for subscription. Each _client application_
is part of at least one _SAG_ , which can contain one or more client
applications. Each SAG has one s _ervice profile_ per service that defines the
preferences of the SAG members for the usage of that service. A SAG can have
multiple Service Profiles associated with it, one for each service subscribed
by the enterprise operator on behalf of the SAG members. The figure above
shows the relationship between client application objects, SAGs, service
contracts and service profiles.
An enterprise operator may not want to grant all client applications in its
domain the same service characteristics and usage permissions. In this case
the enterprise operator can group them in a set of SAGs and assign a
particular Service Profile to each group. A client application can be assigned
to more than one service profile for a given service, as long as the dates
within those service profiles do not overlap. The figure below illustrates
this. Here the client is assigned to two SAGs. One of these SAGs uses
ServiceProfile1 to control access to service 1. The other uses ServiceProfile3
to control access to service 1. If the dates in the two service profiles
overlap, as is the case here, then it cannot be determined when the client
signs the service agreement which service profile should be used. For example,
if the client application signed the service agreement on February the 8^th^,
then it could not be determined which of service profile 1 or service profile
3 would apply. If the dates are not overlapping then there is not a problem
with identifying which of the service profiles to use. A SAG may have multiple
service profiles, one for each subscribed service, associated with it.
Figure: Overlapping date fields in service profiles
Figure: Multiple Enterprise Operators
The figure above illustrates that the framework can offer its services to
applications in the domains of many enterprise operators. An enterprise
operator could be an Application Service Provider, a corporation, or even the
network operator (if the services offered through the framework belong to a
single network -- it is even possible that the network operator will be the
only enterprise operator). It is possible, however, that each service
registered with the framework could actually be in a different network. The
client application IDs have to be unique within the framework. The framework
operator could decide to allocate a block of application IDs to each
enterprise operator, or even negotiate with the enterprise operators to
provide a set of client application IDs that are meaningful to them.
Service subscription and subscription management requires a careful
delineation of subscriptionâ€‘related functions. The service subscription
interfaces are classified in the following categories:
  * Enterprise Operator Account Management.
  * Enterprise Operator Account Query.
  * Service Contract Management.
  * Service Contract Query.
  * Service Profile Management.
  * Service Profile Query.
  * Client Application Management.
  * Client Application Query.
Only the enterprise operator, which is registered and later on authenticated,
is allowed to use these interfaces.
## 8a.1 Sequence Diagrams
### 8a.1.1 Event Notification Sequence Diagrams
No Sequence Diagrams exist for Event Notification.
### 8a.1.2 Service Subscription Sequence Diagrams
#### 8a.1.2.1 Service Discovery and Subscription Scenario
This scenario is shown in the sequence diagram below. Services are subscribed
to by the enterprise operator on behalf of the client applications which then
use these services. Before an enterprise operator can subscribe to a service,
it must have knowledge of the existence of that service in the framework. The
enterprise operator discovers the set of services provided by the framework
using the IpServiceDiscovery interface. Initially, the enterprise operator
obtains a list of service types supported by the framework by invoking
listServiceTypes() on IpServiceDiscovery interface. Then it obtains the
description of a service type using describeServiceType() to find out the set
of properties applicable to a particular service type. Subsequently it invokes
discoverService() to discover the services of a given type which supports the
desired set of property values. The discoverService() method returns a list of
\"serviceIDs\" and their associated property values. The service discovery
phase is followed by the service subscription phase. The enterprise operator
uses the IpServiceContractManagement and IpServiceProfileManagement interfaces
to perform service subscription.
The enterprise operator invokes the createServiceContract() on
IpServiceContractManagement interface to subscribe to a service. Depending
upon the Framework Operator\'s policy, the services may be subscribed by
identifying them by their \"serviceID\" or by their service type. In the
former case only the specific service can be used by the enterprise operator
and its client applications. In the latter case, all registered services of
the given type can be used. The enterprise operator may create multiple
service profiles (each of which are a restriction of the service contract) by
invoking createServiceProfile() on IpServiceProfileManagement interface and
assign each service profile to a different Subscription Assignment Group
(SAG), using assign() method. This allows an enterprise operator to assign
different service privileges to different client application groups. During
the life time of a service contract, the enterprise operator may perform
service contract and service profile management functions, such as modifying
the service profiles (modifyServiceProfile()) and service contract
(modifyServiceContract()), reâ€‘assigning the service profiles to a SAG
(assign()), obtaining information about a service profile
(getServiceProfile()), deleting service profiles (deleteServiceProfile()),
etc. These methods may be interleaved in any logical order. The enterprise
operator or the client applications, can at any time obtain a list of
currently subscribed services by invoking listSubscribedServices() method on
the IpServiceDiscovery interface. This method returns a list of serviceIDs of
the set of subscribed services. The service contract ceases to exist after the
specified end date. The deleteServiceContract deletes the service contract
object held in the framework. It is up to the discretion of the Framework
operator to allow the enterprise operator to delete a service contract before
its specified end date.
After the service subscription is performed the client applications can access
and use the set of subscribed services in addition to the set of freely
available services. In order to start a service, the interface reference of
the service is required. The discoverService() method or the
listSubscribedServices() method, described above, return the \"serviceID\".
The interface reference of the service is obtained in the service access
phase. The service access phase begins with the client applications selecting
the service, via the selectService() method, and signing a service agreement,
via the signServiceAgreement() method. The selectService() method is used by
the client application to identify the service that it wants to initiate. The
input to the selectService() is the \"serviceID\" returned by the
discoverService() or the listSubscribedServices() and the output is a
\"serviceToken\". The serviceToken is free format text token returned by the
framework, which can be used as part of a service agreement. If the service is
not subscribed by the enterprise operator, then a \"service not subscribed\"
exception is raised. The signServiceAgreement() is invoked by the client
application on the framework to sign an agreement on the service. The input to
this method is the service token returned by the selectService() method. The
sign service agreement is used as a way of nonâ€‘repudiation of the intention to
use the service by the client application. The successful completion of the
signServiceAgreement() returns the interface reference to the service (or to
its service manager). The client application can then use this interface
reference to start the service.

#### 8a.1.2.2 Enterprise Operator and Client Application Subscription
Management Sequence Diagram
The first step in the service subscription process is the creation of an
account for the enterprise operator. The creation of enterprise operator
accounts is performed by the Framework Operator via interfaces outside of the
present document. When the enterprise operator\'s account has been created
they are allowed to use the framework. The enterprise operator (acting in the
role of service subscriber) can then create accounts within the framework for
all of the client applications in its domain. The enterprise operator obtains
the reference to the IpEntOpManagement interface by invoking obtainInterface()
on the IpAccess interface. The enterprise operator at any time may inspect its
subscription account by invoking describeEntOpAccount on the
IpEntOpAccountInfoQuery interface and modify the subscriberâ€‘related
information contained in its subscription account by invoking
modifyEntOpAccount() on IpEntOpAccountManagement interface.
An enterprise operator usually has many client applications in its enterprise
domain. These client applications must be registered within the framework so
that the set of services subscribed to by the enterprise operator (through
createServiceContract()) can be assigned to these client applications by
associating a service profile (a restriction of service contracts) with a
group of client applications, called a Subscription Assignment Group (SAG). In
order to create an account for individual client applications, the enterprise
operator invokes createClientApp() on IpClientAppManagement interface. The
enterprise operator groups a related set of client applications in a SAG so
that the same service profile can be assigned to them. The enterprise operator
may create an empty SAG by invoking createSAG() on IpClientAppManagement
interface. The enterprise operator adds client applications to the newly
created SAG by invoking addSAGMembers() on IpClientAppManagement interface.
The enterprise operator also performs other client application / SAG
management functions such as modifyClientApp(), deleteClientApp(),
modifySAG(), listSAGs(), listSAGMembers(), addSAGmembers(),
removeSAGmembers()etc. These methods can be interleaved in any logical order.
Finally, the enterprise operator (or the framework operator) can delete its
subscription account by invoking deleteEntOpAccount() on
IpEntOpAccountManagement interface.

### 8a.3.2 Service Subscription Interface Classes
#### 8a.3.2.1 Interface Class IpClientAppManagement
Inherits from: IpInterface.
If the enterprise operator wants the client applications in its domain to
access the subscribed services in name of the enterprise, then (s)he has to
register these client applications in the Framework domain. For this the
enterprise operator must use the client application management interface, to
which (s)he can subscribe as a privileged user. The client application
management interface is intended for cases where an organisation wants to
allow several client applications to register with a Framework as service
consumers. It allows enterprise operators to dynamically add new client
applications and SAGs, delete them and to modify subscription related
information concerning the client applications and the SAGs. Client
applications use the subscribed services in the enterprise operator\'s name.
The main task of client application management is to register, modify and
delete client applications (Client Application Management), and manage groups
of client applications, called Subscription Assignment Groups (SAG
Management).

method addSagMembers() on this interface (i.e. Information about the
invocation of addSagMembers() that raised a P_INVALID_ADDITION_TO_SAG). Each
client application may be assigned to a service only through a single service
profile at a particular moment in time. The enterprise operator might try to
add a client application to a SAG, where both, the client application and the
SAG are already assigned to the same service through different service
profiles. As this may happen in one method call for multiple client
applications, a conflict list is generated.
It is only possible to retrieve information about the last conflicting
addSagMembers() method call; information about previous conflicts cannot be
requested. If there has never been a conflict, the method returns an empty
conflict list.

invocation of addSagMembers() that raised a P_INVALID_ADDITION_TO_SAG. Each
conflict contains the following elements:
a. The conflict generating client application. b. The SAG and the service
profile through which the conflict generating client application is already
assigned to the conflict generating service. It includes the current service
profile. c. The SAG, to which the conflict generating client application
should be added. However, this SAG is already assigned to a concurrent service
profile concerning the conflict generating service. This creates a conflict,
as each client application may be assigned to a service only through a single
service profile at a particular moment in time. d. The conflict generating
service.

The modified Service Profile. If the serviceProfileID specified in the
serviceProfile parameter does not exist, an exception
\"P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID\" would be raised.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID
##### 8a.3.2.3.3 Method deleteServiceProfile()
Deletes the specified Service Profile. If there are any service instances
running that are governed by this profile then they will be terminated. Only
the enterprise operator associated with the particular service profile is
allowed to delete it, a \"P_TASK_REFUSED\" exception will be raised if a
nonâ€‘associated enterprise operator invokes this method.
Parameters

The \"serviceProfileID\" parameter identifies the Service Profile that is to
be deleted. If the serviceProfileID does not exist, a
\"P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID\" exception will be raised.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID
##### 8a.3.2.3.4 Method assign()
Assign a Service Profile to the specified SAG. Only the enterprise operator
associated with the serviceProfileID is allowed to assign it to a SAG, an
exception \"P_TASK_REFUSED\" would be raised if a nonâ€‘associated enterprise
operator invokes this method. Each client application may be assigned to a
service only through a single service profile at a particular moment in time.
If this condition is violated, a
\"P_INVALID_SAG_TO_SERVICE_PROFILE_ASSIGNMENT\" would be raised. In this case,
no partial execution of this method is performed. The enterprise operator can
query further information about this invalid assignment using the method
requestConflictInfo().
Parameters
sagID : in TpSagID
The \"sagID\" parameter identifies the SAG to which Service Profile is to be
assigned. If the SAG ID does not exist, an exception \"P_INVALID_SAG_ID\"
would be raised.
serviceProfileID : in TpServiceProfileID
The \"serviceProfileID\" parameter identifies the Service Profile that is to
be assigned to the SAG. If the serviceProfileID does not exist, an exception
\"P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID\" would be raised.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED, P_INVALID_SAG_ID,
P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID, P_INVALID_SAG_TO_SERVICE_PROFILE_ASSIGNMENT
##### 8a.3.2.3.5 Method deassign()
Deâ€‘assign the Service Profile from the specified SAG. Because only the
enterprise operator associated with the serviceProfileID is allowed to
deassign it from a SAG, an exception \"P_TASK_REFUSED\" would be raised if a
nonâ€‘associated enterprise operator invokes this method.
Parameters
sagID : in TpSagID
The \"sagID\" parameter identifies the SAG whose Service Profile is to be
deâ€‘assigned. If the SAG ID does not exist, an exception \"P_INVALID_SAG_ID\"
would be raised.
serviceProfileID : in TpServiceProfileID

P_INVALID_SERVICE_PROFILE_ID
##### 8a.3.2.3.6 Method requestConflictInfo()
Requests details about the latest conflict that occurred during performing the
method assign() on this interface (i.e. Information about the invocation of
assign () that threw a P_INVALID_SAG_TO_SERVICE_PROFILE_ASSIGNMENT). Each
client application may be assigned to a service only through a single service
profile at a particular moment in time. The enterprise operator could try to
assign a SAG to a service profile of a given service. If one or more client
applications in this SAG are already assigned to service profiles belonging to
the given service, the client applications would have two concurrent service
profiles at a particular moment in time. As this is prohibited, a conflict
list is generated.
It is only possible to retrieve information about the last conflicting
assign() method call; information about previous conflicts cannot be
requested. If there has never been a conflict, the method returns an empty
conflict list.
Returns \: The description of the
conflicts occurring at the latest invocation of assign() that raised a
P_INVALID_SAG_TO_SERVICE_PROFILE_ASSIGNMENT. Each conflict contains the
following elements:
a. The conflict generating client application. b. The SAG and the service
profile through which the conflict generating client application is already
assigned to the conflict generating service. It includes the current service
profile. c. The conflict generating service.
The conflict generating SAG and service profile are supposed to be well known,
because they are input parameters of the assign() method. Therefore, they do
not appear in the returned conflict list.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method.
Returns
TpAssignSagToServiceProfileConflictList
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_ACCESS_DENIED

##### 8a.3.2.5.1 Method createServiceContract()
Create a new service contract for an enterprise operator. The enterprise
operator provides the service contract description. This contract should
conform to the previously negotiated high â€‘ level agreement (regarding the
services, their usage and the price, etc.), if any, between the enterprise
operator and the framework operator, otherwise the appropriate exception is

service type (e.g. obtained from listServiceType() method); f. service ID
(e.g. obtained from discoverService() method). For certain services, service
type information is sufficient and service ID may not be required. This
implies that any service of the type specified above is subscribed and hence
accessible to the enterprise operator or to its client applications; g. list
of service subscription properties and their value ranges (service profiles
further restrict these value ranges).
Returns
TpServiceContractID
Raises

# 9 Service Properties
## 9.1 Service Super and Sub Types
Service Properties are used at service registration to indicate the
capabilities of an SCF. They are normally used as an indication for
limitations an SCF has. These limitations can come from the way an SCF is
implemented or from limitations in the network. The service type of an SCF
defines which properties the supplier shall provide at registration of the
SCF.
An application uses Service Properties at service discovery to find services
that have the required capabilities. The Framework validates the requested
properties with the registered properties and provides the application with a
list of SCFs that comply to the application\'s request.
The capabilities of an SCF can be extended by providing service properties in
addition to the ones defined in this standard. For this extended SCF, a
dedicated sub-type of a service is defined. A sub-type of an SCF shall be
fully compatible with the standard SCF, that is, an application shall be able
to use the sub type as if it was the standard type. This implies that the
interface to the SCF remains unchanged. Also SCF sub types can be further
extended. This way a hierarchy of service types can be built with the standard
type being the root.
An example of a sub type is a Multy Party Call Control service that allows the
application to request a certain quality-of-service level. An additional
service property is added for this.
## 9.2 Service Property Types
At Service Registration the properties of a type shall be interpreted as the
set of values that can be supported by the service. If a service type has a
certain property (e.g. \"CAN_DO_SOMETHING\"), a service registers with a
property value of {\"true\", \"false\"}. This means that the SCS is able to
support Service instances where this property is used or allowed and instances
where this property is not used or allowed. This clarifies why sets of values
shall be used for the property values instead of primitive types.
At establishment of the Service Level Agreement the property can then be set
to the value of the specific agreement. The context of the Service Level
Agreement thus restricts the set of property values of the SCS and will thus
lead to a sub-set of the service property values. When the correct SCF is
instantiated during the discovery and selection procedure (see Note), the
Service Properties shall thus be interpreted as the requested property values.
NOTE: This is achieved through the createServiceManager() operation in the
Service Instance Lifecycle Manager interface.
All property values are represented by an array of strings. The following
table shows all supported service property types.

### 10.3.9 TpServiceToken
This data type is identical to a TpString, and identifies a selected SCF. This
is a free format text token returned by the Framework, which can be signed as
part of a service agreement. This will contain Network operator specific
information relating to the service level agreement. The serviceToken has a
limited lifetime, which is the same as the lifetime of the service agreement
in normal conditions. If something goes wrong the serviceToken expires, and
any method accepting the serviceToken will return an error code
(P_INVALID_SERVICE_TOKEN). Service Tokens will automatically expire if the
client or Framework invokes the terminateAccess method on the other\'s
corresponding access interface.

The digitalSignature contains a CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) object (as
defined in RFC 2630) with content type Signed-data. The signature is
calculated and created as per section 5 of RFC 2630. The content is the
agreement text given by the client application. The \"external signature\"
construct shall not be used (i.e. the eContent field in the
EncapsulatedContentInfo field shall be present and contain the agreement text
string). The signing-time attribute, as defined in section 11.3 of RFC 2630,
shall also be used to provide replay prevention.
The ServiceMgrInterface is a reference to the SCF manager interface for the
selected SCF.
### 10.3.11 TpSigningAlgorithm
This data type is identical to a TpString, and is defined as a string of
characters that identify the signing algorithm that shall be used. Other
Network operator specific capabilities may also be used, but should be
preceded by the string \"SP_\". The following values are defined.
* * *
String Value Description _NULL_ An empty (NULL) string indicates no signing
algorithm is required P_MD5_RSA_512 MD5 takes an input message of arbitrary
length and produces as output a 128-bit message digest of the input. This is
then encrypted with the private key under the RSA public-key cryptography
system using a 512-bit modulus. The signature generation follows the process
and format defined in RFC 2313 (PKCS#1 v1.5). The use of this signing method
is deprecated. P_MD5_RSA_1024 MD5 takes an input message of arbitrary length
and produces as output a 128-bit message digest of the input. This is then
encrypted with the private key under the RSA public- key cryptography system
using a 1024-bit modulus. .The signature generation follows the process and
format defined in RFC 2313 (PKCS#1 v1.5). The use of this signing method is
deprecated. P_RSASSA_PKCS1_v1_5_SHA1_1024 SHA-1 is used to produce a 160-bit
message digest based on the input message to be signed. RSA is then used to
generate the signature value, following the process defined in section 8 of
RFC 2437 and format defined in section 9.2.1 of RFC 2437. The RSA
private/public key pair is using a 1024-bit modulus. P_SHA1_DSA SHA-1 is used
to produce a 160-bit message digest based on the input message to be signed.
DSA is then used to generate the signature value. The signature generation
follows the process and format defined in section 7.2.2 of RFC 2459.
* * *
### 10.3.12 TpSigningAlgorithmCapabilityList
This data type is identical to a TpString. It is a string of multiple
TpSigningAlgorithm concatenated using a comma (,) as the separation character.
### 10.3.13 TpAuthMechanism
This data type is identical to a TpString. It identifies an authentication
mechanism to be used for API Level Authentication. The following values are
defined:
* * *
String Value Description P_OSA_MD5 Authentication is based on the use of MD5
(RFC 1321) hashing algorithm to generate a response based on a shared secret
and a challenge received via challenge() method. The capability to use this
algorithm is required to be supported when using CHAP (RFC 1994) but its use
is not recommended. P_OSA_HMAC_SHA1_96 Authentication is based on the use of
HMAC-SHA1 (RFC 2404) hashing algorithm to generate a response based on a
shared secret and a challenge received via challenge() method.
P_OSA_HMAC_MD5_96 Authentication is based on the use of HMAC-MD5 (RFC 2403)
hashing algorithm to generate a response based on a shared secret and a
challenge received via challenge() method.
