# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 4, Sub-part 2 of the Stage 3 specification for an
Application Programming Interface (API) for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardised
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Generic Call Control Service Capability
Feature (SCF) aspects of the interface. All aspects of the Generic Call
Control SCF are defined here, these being:
  * Sequence Diagrams
  * Class Diagrams
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions
  * State Transition diagrams
  * Data definitions
  * IDL Description of the interfaces
  * WSDL Description of the interfaces
  * Reference to the Javaâ„¢ API description of the interfaces
The process by which this task is accomplished is through the use of object
modelling techniques described by the Unified Modelling Language (UML).
This specification has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and the Parlay Group, in co-operation with a number of JAINâ„¢ Community
member companies.

# 4 Generic Call Control Service Sequence Diagrams
The Generic Call Control API of 3GPP Rel.4 relies on the CAMEL Service
Environment (CSE) and thus some restrictions exist to the use of the
interface. The most significant one is that there is no support for createCall
method. The detailed description of the supported methods and further
restrictions is given in the chapter 8.
## 4.1 Additional Callbacks
The following sequence diagram shows how an application can register two call
back interfaces for the same set of events. If one of the call backs can not
be used, e.g. because the application crashed, the other call back interface
is used instead.
{width="6.684722222222222in" height="5.743055555555555in"}
1: The first instance of the application is started on node 1. The application
creates a new IpAppCallControlManager to handle callbacks for this first
instance of the logic.
2: The enableCallNotification is associated with an applicationID. The call
control manager uses the applicationID to decide whether this is the same
application.
3: The second instance of the application is started on node 2. The
application creates a new IpAppCallControlManager to handle callbacks for this
second instance of the logic.
4: The same enableCallNotification request is sent as for the first instance
of the logic. Because both requests are associated with the same application,
the second request is not rejected, but the specified callback object is
stored as an additional callback.
5: When the trigger occurs one of the first instance of the application is
notified. The gateway may have different policies on how to handle additional
callbacks, e.g., always first try the first registered or use some kind of
round robin scheme.
6: The event is forwarded to the first instance of the logic.
7: When the first instance of the application is overloaded or unavailable
this is communicated with an exception to the call control manager.
8: Based on this exception the call control manager will notify another
instance of the application (if available).
9: The event is forwarded to the second instance of the logic.
## 4.2 Alarm Call
The following sequence diagram shows a \'reminder message\', in the form of an
alarm, being delivered to a customer as a result of a trigger from an
application. Typically, the application would be set to trigger at a certain
time, however, the application could also trigger on events.
{width="6.69375in" height="6.420833333333333in"}
1: This message is used to create an object implementing the IpAppCall
interface.
2: This message requests the object implementing the IpCallControlManager
interface to create an object implementing the IpCall interface.
3: Assuming that the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall
interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is met it is created.
4: This message instructs the object implementing the IpCall interface to
route the call to the customer destined to receive the \'reminder message\'
5: This message passes the result of the call being answered to its callback
object.
6: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
7: The application requests a new UICall object that is associated with the
call object.
8: Assuming all criteria are met, a new UICall object is created by the
service.
9: This message instructs the object implementing the IpUICall interface to
send the alarm to the customer\'s call.
10: When the announcement ends this is reported to the call back interface.
11: The event is forwarded to the application logic.
12: The application releases the UICall object, since no further announcements
are required. Alternatively, the application could have indicated
P_FINAL_REQUEST in the sendInfoReq in which case the UICall object would have
been implicitly released after the announcement was played.
13: The application releases the call and all associated parties.
## 4.3 Application Initiated Call
The following sequence diagram shows an application creating a call between
party A and party B. This sequence could be done after a customer has accessed
a Web page and selected a name on the page of a person or organisation to talk
to.
{width="6.69375in" height="9.865972222222222in"}
1: This message is used to create an object implementing the IpAppCall
interface.
2: This message requests the object implementing the IpCallControlManager
interface to create an object implementing the IpCall interface.
3: Assuming that the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall
interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is met, it is created.
4: This message is used to route the call to the A subscriber (origination).
In the message the application request response when the A party answers.
5: This message indicates that the A party answered the call.
6: This message forwards the previous message to the application logic.
7: This message is used to route the call to the B-party. Also in this case a
response is requested for call answer or failure.
8: This message indicates that the B-party answered the call. The call now has
two parties and a speech connection is automatically established between them.
9: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
10: Since the application is no longer interested in controlling the call, the
application deassigns the call. The call will continue in the network, but
there will be no further communication between the call object and the
application.
## 4.4 Call Barring 1
The following sequence diagram shows a call barring service, initiated as a
result of a prearranged event being received by the call control service.
Before the call is routed to the destination number, the calling party is
asked for a PIN code. The code is accepted and the call is routed to the
original called party.
{width="6.686111111111111in" height="6.159722222222222in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a call barring service, it is likely
that all new call events destined for a particular address or address range
prompted for a password before the call is allowed to progress. When a new
call, that matches the event criteria set, arrives a message (not shown) is
directed to the object implementing the IpCallControlManager. Assuming that
the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall interface (e.g.
load control values not exceeded) is met, other messages (not shown) are used
to create the call and associated call leg object.
3: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
4: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
5: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface. The reference to this object is passed back to the
object implementing the IpCallControlManager using the return parameter of the
callEventNotify.
6: This message is used to create a new UICall object. The reference to the
call object is given when creating the UICall.
7: Provided all the criteria are fulfilled, a new UICall object is created.
8: The call barring service dialogue is invoked.
9: The result of the dialogue, which in this case is the PIN code, is returned
to its callback object.
10: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
11: This message releases the UICall object.
12: Assuming the correct PIN is entered, the call is forward routed to the
destination party.
13: This message passes the result of the call being answered to its callback
object.
14: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic
15: When the call is terminated in the network, the application will receive a
notification. This notification will always be received when the call is
terminated by the network in a normal way, the application does not have to
request this event explicitly.
16: The event is forwarded to the application.
17: The application must free the call related resources in the gateway by
calling deassignCall.
## 4.5 Number Translation 1
The following sequence diagram shows a simple number translation service,
initiated as a result of a prearranged event being received by the call
control service.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="7.986111111111111in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a number translation service, it is
likely that only new call events within a certain address range will be
enabled. When a new call, that matches the event criteria set in message 2,
arrives a message (not shown) is directed to the object implementing the
IpCallControlManager. Assuming that the criteria for creating an object
implementing the IpCall interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is
met, other messages (not shown) are used to create the call and associated
call leg object.
3: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
4: This message is used to forward message 3 to the IpAppLogic.
5: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface. The reference to this object is passed back to the
object implementing the IpCallControlManager using the return parameter of
message 3.
6: This message invokes the number translation function.
7: The returned translated number is used in message 7 to route the call
towards the destination.
8: This message passes the result of the call being answered to its callback
object
9: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
10: The application is no longer interested in controlling the call and
therefore deassigns the call. The call will continue in the network, but there
will be no further communication between the call object and the application.
## 4.6 Number Translation 1 (with callbacks)
The following sequence diagram shows a simple number translation service,
initiated as a result of a prearranged event being received by the call
control service.
For illustration, in this sequence the callback references are set explicitly.
This is optional. All the callbacks references can also be passed in other
methods. From an efficiency point of view that is also the preferred method.
The rest of the sequences use that mechanism.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="8.92361111111111in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message sets the reference of the IpAppCallControlManager object in
the CallControlManager. The CallControlManager reports the callEventNotify to
referenced object only for enableCallNotifications that do not have an
explicit IpAppCallControlManager reference specified in the
enableCallNotification.
3: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a number translation service, it is
likely that only new call events within a certain address range will be
enabled. When a new call, that matches the event criteria set in message 3,
arrives a message (not shown) is directed to the object implementing the
IpCallControlManager. Assuming that the criteria for creating an object
implementing the IpCall interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is
met, other messages (not shown) are used to create the call and associated
call leg object.
4: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
5: This message is used to forward message 4 to the IpAppLogic.
6: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface.
7: This message is used to set the reference to the IpAppCall for this call.
8: This message invokes the number translation function.
9: The returned translated number is used in message 7 to route the call
towards the destination.
10: This message passes the result of the call being answered to its callback
object.
11: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
12: The application is no longer interested in controlling the call and
therefore deassigns the call. The call will continue in the network, but there
will be no further communication between the call object and the application.
## 4.7 Number Translation 2
The following sequence diagram shows a number translation service, initiated
as a result of a prearranged event being received by the call control service.
If the translated number being routed to does not answer or is busy then the
call is automatically released.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="6.346527777777778in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a number translation service, it is
likely that only new call events within a certain address range will be
enabled. When a new call, that matches the event criteria, arrives a message
(not shown) is directed to the object implementing the IpCallControlManager.
Assuming that the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall
interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is met, other messages (not
shown) are used to create the call and associated call leg object.
3: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
4: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
5: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface. The reference to this object is passed back to the
object implementing the IpCallControlManager using the return parameter of the
callEventNotify.
6: This message invokes the number translation function.
7: The returned translated number is used to route the call towards the
destination.
8: Assuming the called party is busy or does not answer, the object
implementing the IpCall interface sends a callback in this message, indicating
the unavailability of the called party.
9: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
10: The application takes the decision to release the call.
## 4.8 Number Translation 3
The following sequence diagram shows a number translation service, initiated
as a result of a prearranged event being received by the call control service.
If the translated number being routed to does not answer or is busy then the
call is automatically routed to a voice mailbox.
{width="6.69375in" height="7.907638888888889in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a number translation service, it is
likely that only new call events within a certain address range will be
enabled. When a new call, that matches the event criteria, arrives a message
(not shown) is directed to the object implementing the IpCallControlManager.
Assuming that the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall
interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is met, other messages (not
shown) are used to create the call and associated call leg object.
3: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
4: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
5: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface. The reference to this object is passed back to the
object implementing the IpCallControlManager using the return parameter of the
callEventNotify.
6: This message invokes the number translation function.
7: The returned translated number is used to route the call towards the
destination.
8: Assuming the called party is busy or does not answer, the object
implementing the IpCall interface sends a callback, indicating the
unavailability of the called party.
9: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
10: The application takes the decision to translate the number, but this time
the number is translated to a number belonging to a voice mailbox system.
11: This message routes the call towards the voice mailbox.
12: This message passes the result of the call being answered to its callback
object.
13: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
14: The application is no longer interested in controlling the call and
therefore deassigns the call. The call will continue in the network, but there
will be no further communication between the call object and the application.
## 4.9 Number Translation 4
The following sequence diagram shows a number translation service, initiated
as a result of a prearranged event being received by the call control service.
Before the call is routed to the translated number, the application requests
for all call related information to be delivered back to the application on
completion of the call.
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="8.004166666666666in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a number translation service, it is
likely that only new call events within a certain address range will be
enabled. When a new call, that matches the event criteria, arrives a message
(not shown) is directed to the object implementing the IpCallControlManager.
Assuming that the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall
interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is met, other messages (not
shown) are used to create the call and associated call leg object.
3: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
4: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
5: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface. The reference to this object is passed back to the
object implementing the IpCallControlManager using the return parameter of the
callEventNotify.
6: This message invokes the number translation function.
7: The application instructs the object implementing the IpCall interface to
return all call related information once the call has been released.
8: The returned translated number is used to route the call towards the
destination.
9: This message passes the result of the call being answered to its callback
object.
10: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
11: Towards the end of the call, when one of the parties disconnects, a
message (not shown) is directed to the object implementing the IpCall. This
causes an event, to be passed to the object implementing the IpAppCall object.
12: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic.
13: The application now waits for the call information to be sent. Now that
the call has completed, the object implementing the IpCall interface passes
the call information to its callback object.
14: This message is used to forward the previous message to the IpAppLogic
15: After the last information is received, the application deassigns the
call. This will free the resources related to this call in the gateway.
## 4.10 Number Translation 5
The following sequence diagram shows a simple number translation service which
contains a status check function, initiated as a result of a prearranged event
being received. In the following sequence, when the application receives an
incoming call, it checks the status of the user, and returns a busy code to
the calling party.
{width="6.685416666666667in" height="4.141666666666667in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a number translation service, it is
likely that only new call events within a certain address range will be
enabled.
When a new call, that matches the event criteria set in message 2, arrives a
message (not shown) is directed to the object implementing the
IpCallControlManager. Assuming that the criteria for creating an object
implementing the IpCall interface (e.g. load control values not exceeded) is
met, other messages (not shown) are used to create the call and associated
call leg object.
3: This message is used to pass the new call event to the object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
4: This message is used to forward message 3 to the IpAppLogic.
5: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCall interface. The reference to this object is passed back to the
object implementing the IpCallControlManager using the return parameter of
message 3.
6: This message invokes the status checking function.
7: The application decides to release the call, and sends a release cause to
the calling party indicating that the user is busy.
## 4.11 Prepaid
This sequence shows a Pre-paid application.
The subscriber is using a pre-paid card or credit card to pay for the call.
The application each time allows a certain timeslice for the call. After the
timeslice, a new timeslice can be started or the application can terminate the
call. In the following sequence the end-user will receive an announcement
before his final timeslice.
{width="6.69375in" height="9.070833333333333in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a pre-paid service, it is likely that
only new call events within a certain address range will be enabled. When a
new call, that matches the event criteria, arrives a message (not shown) is
directed to the object implementing the IpCallControlManager. Assuming that
the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall interface (e.g.
load control values not exceeded) is met, other messages (not shown) are used
to create the call and associated call leg object.
3: The incoming call triggers the Pre-Paid Application (PPA).
4: The message is forwarded to the application.
5: A new object on the application side for the Generic Call object is
created.
6: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) requests to supervise the call. The
application will be informed after the period indicated in the message. This
period is related to the credits left on the account of the pre-paid
subscriber.
7: Before continuation of the call, PPA sends all charging information, a
possible tariff switch time and the call duration supervision period, towards
the GW which forwards it to the network.
8: At the end of each supervision period the application is informed and a new
period is started.
9: The message is forwarded to the application.
10: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) requests to supervise the call for another
call duration.
11: At the end of each supervision period the application is informed and a
new period is started.
12: The message is forwarded to the application.
13: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) requests to supervise the call for another
call duration. When the timer expires it will indicate that the user is almost
out of credit.
14: When the user is almost out of credit the application is informed.
15: The message is forwarded to the application.
16: The application decides to play an announcement to the parties in this
call. A new UICall object is created and associated with the call.
17: An announcement is played informing the user about the near-expiration of
his credit limit.
18: When the announcement is completed the application is informed.
19: The message is forwarded to the application.
20: The application releases the UICall object.
21: The user does not terminate so the application terminates the call after
the next supervision period.
22: The supervision period ends.
23: The event is forwarded to the logic.
24: The application terminates the call. Since the user interaction is already
explicitly terminated no userInteractionFaultDetected is sent to the
application.
## 4.12 Pre-Paid with Advice of Charge (AoC)
This sequence shows a Pre-paid application that uses the Advice of Charge
feature.
The application will send the charging information before the actual call
setup and when during the call the charging changes new information is sent in
order to update the end-user. Note: the Advice of Charge feature requires an
application in the end-user terminal to display the charges for the call,
depending on the information received from the application.
{width="6.6090277777777775in" height="9.915277777777778in"}
1: This message is used by the application to create an object implementing
the IpAppCallControlManager interface.
2: This message is sent by the application to enable notifications on new call
events. As this sequence diagram depicts a pre-paid service, it is likely that
only new call events within a certain address range will be enabled. When a
new call, that matches the event criteria, arrives a message (not shown) is
directed to the object implementing the IpCallControlManager. Assuming that
the criteria for creating an object implementing the IpCall interface (e.g.
load control values not exceeded) is met, other messages (not shown) are used
to create the call and associated call leg object.
3: The incoming call triggers the Pre-Paid Application (PPA).
4: The message is forwarded to the application.
5: A new object on the application side for the Call object is created.
6: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) sends the AoC information (e.g. the tariff
switch time). (it shall be noted the PPA contains ALL the tariff information
and knows how to charge the user).
During this call sequence 2 tariff changes take place. The call starts with
tariff 1, and at the tariff switch time (e.g. 18:00 hours) switches to tariff
2. The application is not informed about this (but the end-user is!)
7: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) requests to supervise the call. The
application will be informed after the period indicated in the message. This
period is related to the credits left on the account of the pre-paid
subscriber.
8: The application requests to route the call to the destination address.
9: At the end of each supervision period the application is informed and a new
period is started.
10: The message is forwarded to the application.
11: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) requests to supervise the call for another
call duration.
12: At the end of each supervision period the application is informed and a
new period is started.
13: The message is forwarded to the application.
14: Before the next tariff switch (e.g., 19:00 hours) the application sends a
new AOC with the tariff switch time. Again, at the tariff switch time, the
network will send AoC information to the end-user.
15: The Pre-Paid Application (PPA) requests to supervise the call for another
call duration. When the timer expires it will indicate that the user is almost
out of credit.
16: When the user is almost out of credit the application is informed.
17: The message is forwarded to the application.
18: The application creates a new call back interface for the User interaction
messages.
19: A new UI Call object that will handle playing of the announcement needs to
be created.
20: The Gateway creates a new UI call object that will handle playing of the
announcement.
21: With this message the announcement is played to the parties in the call.
22: The user indicates that the call should continue.
23: The message is forwarded to the application.
24: The user does not terminate so the application terminates the call after
the next supervision period.
25: The user is out of credit and the application is informed.
26: The message is forwarded to the application.
27: With this message the application requests to release the call.
28: Terminating the call which has still a UICall object associated will
result in a userInteractionFaultDetected. The UICall object is terminated in
the gateway and no further communication is possible between the UICall and
the application.
# 5 Class Diagrams
The generic call control service consists of two packages, one for the
interfaces on the application side and one for interfaces on the service side.
The class diagrams in the following figures show the interfaces that make up
the generic call control application package and the generic call control
service package. Communication between these packages is indicated with the
\> associations; e.g. the IpCallControlManager interface uses the
IpAppCallControlManager, by means of calling callback methods.
This class diagram shows the interfaces of the generic call control service
package.

# 6 Generic Call Control Service Interface Classes
The Generic Call Control Service (GCCS) provides the basic call control
service for the API. It is based around a third party model, which allows
calls to be instantiated from the network and routed through the network.
The GCCS supports enough functionality to allow call routing and call
management for today\'s Intelligent Network (IN) services in the case of a
switched telephony network, or equivalent for packet based networks.
It is the intention of the GCCS that it could be readily specialised into call
control specifications, for example, ITU-T Recommendations H.323, Q.763 ISUP,
Q.931 and Q.2931, ATM Forum specification UNI3.1 and RFC 3261 Session
Initiation Protocol, or any other call control technology.
For the generic call control service, only a subset of the call model defined
in clause 4 is used; the API for generic call control does not give explicit
access to the legs and the media channels. This is provided by the Multi-Party
Call Control Service. Furthermore, the generic call is restricted to two party
calls, i.e. only two legs are active at any given time. Active is defined here
as \'being routed\' or connected.
The GCCS is represented by the IpCallControlManager and IpCall interfaces that
interface to services provided by the network. Some methods are asynchronous,
in that they do not lock a thread into waiting whilst a transaction performs.
In this way, the client machine can handle many more calls, than one that uses
synchronous message calls. To handle responses and reports, the developer must
implement IpAppCallControlManager and IpAppCall to provide the callback
mechanism.
## 6.1 Interface Class IpCallControlManager
Inherits from: IpService
This interface is the \'service manager\' interface for the Generic Call
Control Service. The generic call control manager interface provides the
management functions to the generic call control service. The application
programmer can use this interface to provide overload control functionality,
create call objects and to enable or disable call-related event notifications.
This interface shall be implemented by a Generic Call Control SCF. As a
minimum requirement either the createCall() method shall be implemented, or
the enableCallNotification() and disableCallNotification() methods shall be
implemented.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpCallControlManager | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | createCall (appCall : in IpAppCallRef) : TpCallIdentifier | | | | enableCallNotification (appCallControlManager : in | | IpAppCallControlManagerRef, eventCriteria : in TpCallEventCriteria) | | : TpAssignmentID | | | | disableCallNotification (assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID) : void | | | | setCallLoadControl (duration : in TpDuration, mechanism : in | | TpCallLoadControlMechanism, treatment : in TpCallTreatment, | | addressRange : in TpAddressRange) : TpAssignmentID | | | | changeCallNotification (assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID, | | eventCriteria : in TpCallEventCriteria) : void | | | | getCriteria () : TpCallEventCriteriaResultSet | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
### 6.1.1 Method createCall()
This method is used to create a new call object.
Callback reference:
An IpAppCallControlManager should already have been passed to the
IpCallControlManager, otherwise the call control will not be able to report a
callAborted() to the application. The application shall invoke setCallback()
prior to createCall() if it wishes to ensure this.
Returns callReference: Specifies the interface reference and sessionID of the
call created.
Parameters
appCall : in IpAppCallRef
Specifies the application interface for callbacks from the call created.
Returns
TpCallIdentifier
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
### 6.1.2 Method enableCallNotification()
This method is used to enable call notifications so that events can be sent to
the application. This is the first step an application has to do to get
initial notification of calls happening in the network. When such an event
happens, the application will be informed by callEventNotify(). In case the
application is interested in other events during the context of a particular
call session it has to use the routeReq() method on the call object. The
application will get access to the call object when it receives the
callEventNotify(). (Note that the enableCallNotification() is not applicable
if the call is setup by the application).
The enableCallNotification method is purely intended for applications to
indicate their interest to be notified when certain call events take place. It
is possible to subscribe to a certain event for a whole range of addresses,
e.g. the application can indicate it wishes to be informed when a call is made
to any number starting with 800.
If some application already requested notifications with criteria that overlap
the specified criteria, the request is refused with P_GCCS_INVALID_CRITERIA.
The criteria are said to overlap if both originating and terminating ranges
overlap and the same number plan is used and the same CallNotificationType is
used.
If a notification is requested by an application with the monitor mode set to
notify, then there is no need to check the rest of the criteria for
overlapping with any existing request as the notify mode does not allow
control on a call to be passed over. Only one application can place an
interrupt request if the criteria overlap.
If a notification is requested by an application with an event type that is
mutually exclusive compared to existing requested event types, then there is
no need to check against the rest of the criteria for overlap. An example
could be one application that trigger on \"user busy\" together with another
application that trigger on \"answer\" - both requests should be allowed as
only one can occur on the same call or session.
The overlap criteria have been defined to prevent multiple points of control,
leading to possible interaction problems in networks that have no multi
service support. Notice that dynamic aspects cannot be taken into account in
the overlap criteria check. Therefore where dynamic event arming from an
application causes a persistent control relationship it can prevent other
applications to be invoked in the case single point of application control
applies in the network.
However, the criteria check for overlap may as a network option be overruled
by Multi Service networks allowing more services or applications to gain
control of the same call or session at the same point in time. Refer to Call
Control Common Definitions subpart of this specification (TS 29.198-4-1) for
further details on application control over a call or session.
Setting the callback reference:
The callback reference can be registered either in a) enableCallNotification()
or b) explicitly with a separate setCallback() method depending on how the
application provides its callback reference.
Case a:
From an efficiency point of view the enableCallNotification() with explicit
immediate registration (no \"Null\" value) of callback reference may be the
preferred method.
Case b:
The enableCallNotfication() with no call back reference (\"Null\" value) is
used where (e.g. due to distributed application logic) the callback reference
is provided previously in a setCallback(). If no callback reference has been
provided previously to the service, the exception P_NO_CALLBACK_ADDRESS_SET
shall be raised.
In case the enableCallNotification() contains no callback, at the moment the
application needs to be informed the gateway will use as callback the callback
that has been registered by setCallback(). See example in clause 4.6
Set additional callback:
If the same application invokes this method multiple times with exactly the
same criteria but with different callback references, then these shall be
treated as additional callback references. Each such notification request
shall share the same assignmentID. The gateway shall use the most recent
callback interface provided by the application using this method. In the event
that a callback reference fails or is no longer available, the next most
recent callback reference available shall be used. See example in clause 4.1.
Returns assignmentID: Specifies the ID assigned by the generic call control
manager interface for this newly-enabled event notification.
Parameters
appCallControlManager : in IpAppCallControlManagerRef
If this parameter is set (i.e. not NULL) it specifies a reference to the
application interface, which is used for callbacks. If set to NULL, the
application interface defaults to the interface specified previously via the
setCallback() method.
eventCriteria : in TpCallEventCriteria
Specifies the event specific criteria used by the application to define the
event required. Only events that meet these criteria are reported. Examples of
events are \"incoming call attempt reported by network\", \"answer\", \"no
answer\", \"busy\". Individual addresses or address ranges may be specified
for destination and/or origination.
Returns
TpAssignmentID
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_CRITERIA, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE,
P_INVALID_EVENT_TYPE
### 6.1.3 Method disableCallNotification()
This method is used by the application to disable call notifications.
Parameters
assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID
Specifies the assignment ID given by the generic call control manager
interface when the enableCallNotification() was called. If the assignment ID
does not correspond to one of the valid assignment IDs, the exception
P_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_ID will be raised.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_ID
### 6.1.4 Method setCallLoadControl()
This method imposes or removes load control on calls made to a particular
address range within the generic call control service. The address matching
mechanism is similar as defined for TpCallEventCriteria.
Returns assignmentID: Specifies the assignmentID assigned by the gateway to
this request. This assignmentID can be used to correlate the
callOverloadEncountered and callOverloadCeased methods with the request.
Parameters
duration : in TpDuration
Specifies the duration for which the load control should be set.
A duration of 0 indicates that the load control should be removed.
A duration of -1 indicates an infinite duration (i.e. until disabled by the
application).
A duration of -2 indicates the network default duration.
mechanism : in TpCallLoadControlMechanism
Specifies the load control mechanism to use (for example, admit one call per
interval), and any necessary parameters, such as the call admission rate. The
contents of this parameter are ignored if the load control duration is set to
zero.
treatment : in TpCallTreatment
Specifies the treatment of calls that are not admitted. The contents of this
parameter are ignored if the load control duration is set to zero.
addressRange : in TpAddressRange
Specifies the address or address range to which the overload control should be
applied or removed.
Returns
TpAssignmentID
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_ADDRESS, P_UNSUPPORTED_ADDRESS_PLAN
### 6.1.5 Method changeCallNotification()
This method is used by the application to change the event criteria introduced
with enableCallNotification. Any stored criteria associated with the specified
assignmentID will be replaced with the specified criteria.
Parameters
assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID
Specifies the ID assigned by the generic call control manager interface for
the event notification. If two call backs have been registered under this
assignment ID both of them will be changed.
eventCriteria : in TpCallEventCriteria
Specifies the new set of event specific criteria used by the application to
define the event required. Only events that meet these criteria are reported.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_ID, P_INVALID_CRITERIA,
P_INVALID_EVENT_TYPE
### 6.1.6 Method getCriteria()
This method is used by the application to query the event criteria set with
enableCallNotification or changeCallNotification.
Returns eventCriteria: Specifies the event specific criteria used by the
application to define the event required. Only events that meet these criteria
are reported.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method
Returns
TpCallEventCriteriaResultSet
Raises
TpCommonExceptions
## 6.2 Interface Class IpAppCallControlManager
Inherits from: IpInterface
The generic call control manager application interface provides the
application call control management functions to the generic call control
service.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpAppCallControlManager | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | callAborted (callReference : in TpSessionID) : void | | | | callEventNotify (callReference : in TpCallIdentifier, eventInfo : in | | TpCallEventInfo, assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID) : IpAppCallRef | | | | callNotificationInterrupted () : void | | | | callNotificationContinued () : void | | | | callOverloadEncountered (assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID) : void | | | | callOverloadCeased (assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID) : void | | | | abortMultipleCalls (callReferenceSet : in TpSessionIDSet) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
### 6.2.1 Method callAborted()
This method indicates to the application that the call object (at the gateway)
has aborted or terminated abnormally. No further communication will be
possible between the call and application.
Parameters
callReference : in TpSessionID
Specifies the sessionID of call that has aborted or terminated abnormally.
### 6.2.2 Method callEventNotify()
This method notifies the application of the arrival of a call-related event.
If this method is invoked with a monitor mode of
P_CALL_MONITOR_MODE_INTERRUPT, then the APL has control of the call. If the
APL does nothing with the call (including its associated legs) within a
specified time period (the duration of which forms a part of the service level
agreement), then the call in the network shall be released and callEnded()
shall be invoked, giving a release cause of 102 (Recovery on timer expiry).
Setting the callback reference:
A reference to the application interface has to be passed back to the call
interface to which the notification relates. However, the setting of a call
back reference is only applicable if the notification is in INTERRUPT mode.
When the callEventNotify() method is invoked with a monitor mode of
P_CALL_MONITOR_MODE_INTERRUPT, the application writer should ensure that no
continue processing e.g. routeReq() is performed until an IpAppCall has been
passed to the gateway, either through an explicit setCallbackWithSessionID()
invocation on the supplied IpCall, or via the return of the callEventNotify()
method.
The callback reference can be registered either in a) callEventNotify() or b)
explicitly with a setCallbackWithSessionID() method e.g. depending on how the
application provides its call reference.
Case a:
From an efficiency point of view the callEventNotify() with explicit pass of
registration may be the preferred method.
Case b:
The callEventNotify() with no callback reference (\"Null\" value) is used
where (e.g. due to distributed application logic) the callback reference is
provided previously in a setCallbackWithSessionID(). If no callback reference
has been provided previously to the service, the exception
P_NO_CALLBACK_ADDRESS_SET shall be raised, and no further application
invocations related to the call shall be permitted.
In case the callEventNotify() contains no callback, at the moment the
application needs to be informed the gateway will use as callback the callback
that has been registered previously by setCallbackWithSessionID(). See example
in clause 4.6
Returns appCall: Specifies a reference to the application interface which
implements the callback interface for the new call. If the application has
previously explicitly passed a reference to the IpAppCall interface using a
setCallbackWithSessionID() invocation, this parameter may be null, or if
supplied must be the same as that provided during the
setCallbackWithSessionID().
This parameter will be null if the notification is in NOTIFY mode and in case
b).
Parameters
callReference : in TpCallIdentifier
Specifies the reference to the call interface to which the notification
relates. If the notification is in NOTIFY mode, this parameter shall be
ignored by the application client implementation, and consequently the
implementation of the SCS entity invoking callEventNotify may populate this
parameter as it chooses.
eventInfo : in TpCallEventInfo
Specifies data associated with this event.
assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID
Specifies the assignment id which was returned by the enableCallNotification()
method. The application can use assignment id to associate events with event
specific criteria and to act accordingly.
Returns
IpAppCallRef
### 6.2.3 Method callNotificationInterrupted()
This method indicates to the application that all event notifications have
been temporarily interrupted (for example, due to faults detected).
Note that more permanent failures are reported via the Framework (integrity
management).
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method
### 6.2.4 Method callNotificationContinued()
This method indicates to the application that event notifications will again
be possible.
Parameters
No Parameters were identified for this method
### 6.2.5 Method callOverloadEncountered()
This method indicates that the network has detected overload and may have
automatically imposed load control on calls requested to a particular address
range or calls made to a particular destination within the call control
service.
Parameters
assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID
Specifies the assignmentID corresponding to the associated setCallLoadControl.
This implies the address range for within which the overload has been
encountered.
### 6.2.6 Method callOverloadCeased()
This method indicates that the network has detected that the overload has
ceased and has automatically removed any load controls on calls requested to a
particular address range or calls made to a particular destination within the
call control service.
Parameters
assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID
Specifies the assignmentID corresponding to the associated setCallLoadControl.
This implies the address range for within which the overload has been ceased.
### 6.2.7 Method abortMultipleCalls()
The service may invoke this method on the IpAppCallControlManager interface to
indicate that a number of ongoing call sessions have aborted or terminated
abnormally. No further communication will be possible between the application
and the calls. This may be used for example in the event of service failure
and recovery in order to instruct the application that a number of call
sessions have failed. The service shall provide a set of call sessionIDs
indicating to the application the call sessions that have aborted. In the case
that the service invokes this method and provides an empty set of sessionIDs,
this shall be used to indicate that all call sessions previously active on the
IpCallControlManager interface have been aborted.
Parameters
callReferenceSet : in TpSessionIDSet
Specifies the set of sessionIDs of calls that have aborted or terminated
abnormally. The empty set shall be used to indicate that all calls have
aborted.
## 6.3 Interface Class IpCall
Inherits from: IpService
The generic Call provides the possibility to control the call routing, to
request information from the call, control the charging of the call, to
release the call and to supervise the call. It does not give the possibility
to control the legs directly and it does not allow control over the media. The
first capability is provided by the multi-party call and the latter as well by
the multi-media call. The call is limited to two party calls, although it is
possible to provide \'follow-on\' calls, meaning that the call can be rerouted
after the terminating party has disconnected or routing to the terminating
party has failed. Basically, this means that at most two legs can be in
connected or routing state at any time. This interface shall be implemented by
a Generic Call Control SCF. As a minimum requirement, the routeReq (),
release() and deassignCall() methods shall be implemented.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpCall | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | routeReq (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, responseRequested : in | | TpCallReportRequestSet, targetAddress : in TpAddress, | | originatingAddress : in TpAddress, originalDestinationAddress : in | | TpAddress, redirectingAddress : in TpAddress, appInfo : in | | TpCallAppInfoSet) : TpSessionID | | | | release (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, cause : in | | TpCallReleaseCause) : void | | | | deassignCall (callSessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | | | | getCallInfoReq (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, callInfoRequested : | | in TpCallInfoType) : void | | | | setCallChargePlan (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, callChargePlan : | | in TpCallChargePlan) : void | | | | setAdviceOfCharge (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, aOCInfo : in | | TpAoCInfo, tariffSwitch : in TpDuration) : void | | | | getMoreDialledDigitsReq (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, length : in | | TpInt32) : void | | | | superviseCallReq (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, time : in | | TpDuration, treatment : in TpCallSuperviseTreatment) : void | | | | continueProcessing (callSessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
### 6.3.1 Method routeReq()
This asynchronous method requests routing of the call to the remote party
indicated by the targetAddress.
Note that in case of routeReq() it is recommended to request for
\'successful\' (e.g. \'answer\' event) and \'failure\' events at invocation,
because those are needed for the application to keep track of the state of the
call.
The extra address information such as originatingAddress is optional. If not
present (i.e. the plan is set to P_ADDRESS_PLAN_NOT_PRESENT), the information
provided in corresponding addresses from the route is used, otherwise the
network or gateway provided numbers will be used.
If this method in invoked, and call reports have been requested, yet no
IpAppCall interface has been provided, this method shall throw the
P_NO_CALLBACK_ADDRESS_SET exception.
This operation continues processing of the call implicitly.
Returns callLegSessionID: Specifies the sessionID assigned by the gateway.
This is the sessionID of the implicitly created call leg. The same ID will be
returned in the routeRes or Err. This allows the application to correlate the
request and the result.
This parameter is only relevant when multiple routeReq() calls are executed in
parallel, e.g. in the multi-party call control service.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
responseRequested : in TpCallReportRequestSet
Specifies the set of observed events that will result in zero or more
routeRes() being generated.
E.g. when both answer and disconnect is monitored the result can be received
two times.
If the application wants to control the call (in whatever sense) it shall
enable event reports.
targetAddress : in TpAddress
Specifies the destination party to which the call leg should be routed.
originatingAddress : in TpAddress
Specifies the address of the originating (calling) party.
originalDestinationAddress : in TpAddress
Specifies the original destination address of the call.
redirectingAddress : in TpAddress
Specifies the address from which the call was last redirected.
appInfo : in TpCallAppInfoSet
Specifies application-related information pertinent to the call (such as
alerting method, tele-service type, service identities and interaction
indicators).
Returns
TpSessionID
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID, P_INVALID_ADDRESS,
P_UNSUPPORTED_ADDRESS_PLAN, P_INVALID_NETWORK_STATE, P_INVALID_CRITERIA,
P_INVALID_EVENT_TYPE
### 6.3.2 Method release()
This method requests the release of the call object and associated objects.
The call will also be terminated in the network. If the application requested
reports to be sent at the end of the call (e.g., by means of getCallInfoReq)
these reports will still be sent to the application.
The application should always either release or deassign the call when it is
finished with the call, unless a callFaultDetected is received by the
application.
This operation continues processing of the call implicitly.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
cause : in TpCallReleaseCause
Specifies the cause of the release.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID, P_INVALID_NETWORK_STATE
### 6.3.3 Method deassignCall()
This method requests that the relationship between the application and the
call and associated objects be de-assigned. It leaves the call in progress,
however, it purges the specified call object so that the application has no
further control of call processing. If a call is de-assigned that has event
reports, call information reports or call Leg information reports requested,
then these reports will be disabled and any related information discarded.
The application should always either release or deassign the call when it is
finished with the call, unless callFaultDetected is received by the
application.
This operation continues processing of the call implicitly.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID
### 6.3.4 Method getCallInfoReq()
This asynchronous method requests information associated with the call to be
provided at the appropriate time (for example, to calculate charging). This
method must be invoked before the call is routed to a target address.
A report is received when the destination leg or party terminates or when the
call ends. The call object will exist after the call is ended if information
is required to be sent to the application at the end of the call. In case the
originating party is still available the application can still initiate a
follow-on call using routeReq.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
callInfoRequested : in TpCallInfoType
Specifies the call information that is requested.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID
### 6.3.5 Method setCallChargePlan()
Set an operator specific charge plan for the call.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
callChargePlan : in TpCallChargePlan
Specifies the charge plan to use.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID
### 6.3.6 Method setAdviceOfCharge()
This method allows for advice of charge (AOC) information to be sent to
terminals that are capable of receiving this information.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
aOCInfo : in TpAoCInfo
Specifies two sets of Advice of Charge parameter.
tariffSwitch : in TpDuration
Specifies the tariff switch interval that signifies when the second set of AoC
parameters becomes valid.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID
### 6.3.7 Method getMoreDialledDigitsReq()
This asynchronous method requests the call control service to collect further
digits and return them to the application. Depending on the administered data,
the network may indicate a new call to the gateway if a caller goes off-hook
or dialled only a few digits. The application then gets a new call event which
contains no digits or only the few dialled digits in the event data.
The application should use this method if it requires more dialled digits,
e.g. to perform screening.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
length : in TpInt32
Specifies the maximum number of digits to collect.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID
### 6.3.8 Method superviseCallReq()
The application calls this method to supervise a call. The application can set
a granted connection time for this call. If an application calls this function
before it calls a routeReq() or a user interaction function the time
measurement will start as soon as the call is answered by the B-party or the
user interaction system.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
time : in TpDuration
Specifies the granted time in milliseconds for the connection.
treatment : in TpCallSuperviseTreatment
Specifies how the network should react after the granted connection time
expired.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID
### 6.3.9 Method continueProcessing()
This operation continues processing of the call explicitly. Applications can
invoke this operation after call processing was interrupted due to detection
of a notification or event the application subscribed its interest in.
In case the operation is invoked and call processing is not interrupted the
exception P_INVALID_NETWORK_STATE will be raised.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID, P_INVALID_NETWORK_STATE
## 6.4 Interface Class IpAppCall
Inherits from: IpInterface
The generic call application interface is implemented by the client
application developer and is used to handle call request responses and state
reports.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpAppCall | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | routeRes (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, eventReport : in | | TpCallReport, callLegSessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | | | | routeErr (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, errorIndication : in | | TpCallError, callLegSessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | | | | getCallInfoRes (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, callInfoReport : in | | TpCallInfoReport) : void | | | | getCallInfoErr (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, errorIndication : in | | TpCallError) : void | | | | superviseCallRes (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, report : in | | TpCallSuperviseReport, usedTime : in TpDuration) : void | | | | superviseCallErr (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, errorIndication : | | in TpCallError) : void | | | | callFaultDetected (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, fault : in | | TpCallFault) : void | | | | getMoreDialledDigitsRes (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, digits : in | | TpString) : void | | | | getMoreDialledDigitsErr (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, | | errorIndication : in TpCallError) : void | | | | callEnded (callSessionID : in TpSessionID, report : in | | TpCallEndedReport) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
### 6.4.1 Method routeRes()
This asynchronous method indicates that the request to route the call to the
destination was successful, and indicates the response of the destination
party (for example, the call was answered, not answered, refused due to busy,
etc.).
If this method is invoked with a monitor mode of
P_CALL_MONITOR_MODE_INTERRUPT,
then the APL has control of the call. If the APL does nothing with the call
(including its associated legs) within a specified time period (the duration
of which forms a part of the service level agreement), then the call in the
network shall be released and callEnded() shall be invoked, giving a release
cause of 102 (Recovery on timer expiry).
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
eventReport : in TpCallReport
Specifies the result of the request to route the call to the destination
party. It also includes the network event, date and time, monitoring mode and
event specific information such as release cause.
callLegSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the sessionID of the associated call leg. This corresponds to the
sessionID returned at the routeReq() and can be used to correlate the response
with the request.
### 6.4.2 Method routeErr()
This asynchronous method indicates that the request to route the call to the
destination party was unsuccessful - the call could not be routed to the
destination party (for example, the network was unable to route the call, the
parameters were incorrect, the request was refused, etc.).
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
errorIndication : in TpCallError
Specifies the error which led to the original request failing.
callLegSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the sessionID of the associated call leg. This corresponds to the
sessionID returned at the routeReq() and can be used to correlate the error
with the request.
### 6.4.3 Method getCallInfoRes()
This asynchronous method reports time information of the finished call or call
attempt as well as release cause depending on which information has been
requested by getCallInfoReq. This information may be used e.g. for charging
purposes. The call information will possibly be sent after routeRes in all
cases where the call or a leg of the call has been disconnected or a routing
failure has been encountered.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
callInfoReport : in TpCallInfoReport
Specifies the call information requested.
### 6.4.4 Method getCallInfoErr()
This asynchronous method reports that the original request was erroneous, or
resulted in an error condition.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
errorIndication : in TpCallError
Specifies the error which led to the original request failing.
### 6.4.5 Method superviseCallRes()
This asynchronous method reports a call supervision event to the application
when it has indicated its interest in this kind of event.
It is also called when the connection is terminated before the supervision
event occurs.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
report : in TpCallSuperviseReport
Specifies the situation which triggered the sending of the call supervision
response.
usedTime : in TpDuration
Specifies the used time for the call supervision (in milliseconds).
### 6.4.6 Method superviseCallErr()
This asynchronous method reports a call supervision error to the application.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
errorIndication : in TpCallError
Specifies the error which led to the original request failing.
### 6.4.7 Method callFaultDetected()
This method indicates to the application that a fault in the network has been
detected. The call may or may not have been terminated.
The system deletes the call object. Therefore, the application has no further
control of call processing. No report will be forwarded to the application.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call in which the fault has been
detected.
fault : in TpCallFault
Specifies the fault that has been detected.
### 6.4.8 Method getMoreDialledDigitsRes()
This asynchronous method returns the collected digits to the application.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
digits : in TpString
Specifies the additional dialled digits if the string length is greater than
zero.
### 6.4.9 Method getMoreDialledDigitsErr()
This asynchronous method reports an error in collecting digits to the
application.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call session ID of the call.
errorIndication : in TpCallError
Specifies the error which led to the original request failing.
### 6.4.10 Method callEnded()
This method indicates to the application that the call has terminated in the
network. However, the application may still receive some results (e.g.
getCallInfoRes) related to the call. The application is expected to deassign
the call object after having received the callEnded.
Note that the event that caused the call to end might also be received
separately if the application was monitoring for it.
Parameters
callSessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the call sessionID.
report : in TpCallEndedReport
Specifies the reason the call is terminated.

Manager object.
{width="6.6875in" height="4.286111111111111in"}
Figure : Application view on the Call Control Manager
### 7.1.1 Active State
In this state a relation between the Application and the Generic Call Control
Service has been established. The state allows the application to indicate
that it is interested in call related events. In case such an event occurs,
the Call Control Manager will create a Call object and inform the application
by invoking the operation callEventNotify() on the IpAppCallControlManager
interface. The application can also indicate it is no longer interested in
certain call related events by calling disableCallNotification().
### 7.1.2 Notification terminated State
When the Call Control Manager is in the Notification terminated state, events
requested with enableCallNotification() will not be forwarded to the
application. There can be multiple reasons for this: for instance it might be
that the application receives more notifications from the network than defined
in the Service Level Agreement. Another example is that the Service has
detected it receives no notifications from the network due to e.g. a link
failure. In this state no requests for new notifications will be accepted.

Figure : Application view on the IpCall object for 3GPP
### 7.2.1 Network Released State
In this state the call has ended and the Gateway collects the possible call
information requested with getCallInfoReq() and / or superviseCallReq(). The
information will be returned to the application by invoking the methods
getCallInfoRes() and / or superviseCallRes() on the application. Also when a
call was unsuccessful these methods are used. In case the application has not
requested additional call related information immediately a transition is made
to state Finished.
### 7.2.2 Finished State
In this state the call has ended and no call related information is to be send
to the application. The application can only release the call object. Calling
the deassignCall() operation has the same effect. Note that the application
has to release the object itself as good OO practice requires that when an
object was created on behalf of a certain entity, this entity is also
responsible for destroying it when the object is no longer needed.
### 7.2.3 Application Released State
In this state the application has requested to release the Call object and the
Gateway collects the possible call information requested with getCallInfoReq()
and / or superviseCallReq(). In case the application has not requested
additional call related information the Call object is destroyed immediately.
### 7.2.4 Active State
In this state a call between two parties is being setup or present. Refer to
the substates for more details. The application can request supervision of the
call by calling superviseCallReq(). It is also allowed to send Advice of
Charge information by calling setAdviceOfCharge() as well as to define the
charging by invoking setCallChargePlan.
Call processing is suspended when a network event is met for the call, which
was requested to be monitored in the P_CALL_MONITOR_MODE_INTERRUPT. In order
to resume of the suspended call processing, the application invokes
continueProcessing(), routeReq(), release() or deassignCall() method.
### 7.2.5 1 Party in Call State
In this state there is one party in the call.
In this state the application can also request the gateway for a certain type
of charging of the call by calling setCallChargePlan(). The application can
also request for charging related information by calling getCallInfoReq(). The
setCallChargePlan() and getCallInfoReq() should be issued before requesting a
connection to a second party in the call by means of routeReq().
Two cases apply: network initiated calls and application initiated calls.
In case the call originated from the network the application can now request
for more digits in case more digits are needed. When the calling party
abandons the call before the application has invoked the routeReq() operation,
the application is informed with callEnded(). When the calling party abandons
the call after the application has invoked routeReq() but before the call has
actually been established, the gateway informs the application by invoking
callEnded().
In case the call was setup by the application and the called party was reached
by issuing a routeReq() the application can request a connection to a second
call party by calling the operation routeReq() again.
Otherwise, it depends on the actual number of invoked (and still outstanding
or successful) routing requests whether the application can still call the
routeReq() operation in order to setup a connection to a called party. Also in
this case the called party can disconnect before another party is reached. In
this case depending on the actual configuration, the call is ended or a
transition is made back to the Routing to Destinations substate. When the
second party answers the call, a transition will be made to the 2 Parties in
Call state.
In this state user interaction is possible unless there is an outstanding
routing request.
### 7.2.6 2 Parties in Call State
A connection between two parties has been established.
In case the calling party disconnects, the gateway informs the application by
invoking callEnded().
When the called party disconnects different situations apply:
1\. the application is monitoring for this event in interrupt mode: a
transition is made to the 1 Party in Call state, the application is informed
with routeRes with indication that the called party has disconnected and all
requested reports are sent to the application. The application now again has
control of the call.
2\. the application is monitoring for this event but not in interrupt mode. In
this case a transition is made to the Network Released state and the gateway
informs the application by invoking the operation routeRes() and callEnded().
3\. the application is not monitoring for this event. In this case the
application is informed by the gateway invoking the callEnded() operation and
a transition is made to the Network Released state.
In this state user interaction is possible, depending on the underlying
network.
### 7.2.7 No Parties State
In this state the Call object has been created. The application can request
the gateway for a certain type of charging of the call by calling
setCallChargePlan(). The application can request for charging related
information by calling getCallInfoReq(). Furthermore the application can
request supervision of the call by calling superviseCallReq(). It is also
allowed to request Advice of Charge information to be sent by calling
setAdviceOfCharge().
### 7.2.8 Routing to Destination(s) State
In this state there is at least one outstanding routeReq.

The network has collected the information from the A-party, but not yet
analysed the information. The number can still be incomplete. Applications
might set notifications for this event when part of the number analysis needs
to be done in the application (see also the getMoreDialledDigitsReq method on
the call class).
