# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 7 of the Stage 3 Parlay X Web Service
specification for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Account Management Web Service aspects of
the interface. All aspects of the Account Management Web Service are defined
here, these being:
  * Name spaces.
  * Sequence diagrams.
  * Data definitions.
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions.
  * Fault definitions.
  * Service policies.
  * WSDL Description of the interfaces.
The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

# 4 Detailed service description
Pre-paid subscribers, whether they have subscribed to pre-paid telephony, SMS,
or data service, have credits with their service providers; the consumption of
services will lead to reduction of their credit, or the credit may expire.
Therefore, from time to time, subscribers may have to recharge their accounts.
This occurs through an application that interfaces with the subscriber either
directly or indirectly. Examples of direct interaction are voice prompts and
WAP/web pages, or even SMS. Typically, such multi-modal applications either
request a currency amount and, e.g. credit card information, or a voucher
number plus credentials. The voucher number and credentials are then validated
and causes a pre-determined currency amount to be transferred.
The Parlay X Account Management API described in the present document supports
account querying, direct recharging and recharging through vouchers. As a side
effect, it may prevent subscribers from having their account balance credits
expire.
# 5 Namespaces
The AccountManagement interface uses the namespace:
http://www.csapi.org/wsdl/parlayx/account_management/v4_0
The AccountManagementNotification interface uses the namespace:
http://www.csapi.org/wsdl/parlayx/ account_management /notification/v4_0
The AccountManagementNotificationManager interface uses the namespace:
http://www.csapi.org/wsdl/parlayx/ account_management
/notification_manager/v4_0
The data types are defined in the namespace:
http://www.csapi.org/schema/parlayx/account_management/v4_0
The \'xsd\' namespace is used in the present document to refer to the XML
Schema data types defined in XML Schema [5]. The use of the name \'xsd\' is
not semantically significant.
# 6 Sequence diagrams
This subclause discusses three scenarios; one where a subscriber uses a
voucher, one where the subscriber directly recharges after the payment is
cleared, and one where the subscriber checks the recent transactions.
NOTE: Associated Account Management API messages are shown in \'bold\' format:
e.g. (**getBalance**).
## 6.1 Prepaid account recharge using a voucher
The prepaid subscriber wishes to recharge their account with a voucher and
query their account balance. The subscriber uses their mobile phone or other
wireline phone to interact with an IVR system. In order to recharge their
account, the subscriber must enter the voucher number, the MSISDN to be
recharged , and PIN(s). The IVR system accesses an external voucher database
to validate the voucher number. The subscriber\'s account balance is then
increased with the value of the voucher (**voucherUpdate**). The subscriber
queries their account balance (**getBalance**), before and/or after the
recharge.

Figure 1
## 6.2 Prepaid account recharge using direct payment
Directly recharging (i.e. without a voucher) works much along the same way. In
this case, we assume the prepaid subscriber interacts with a web page. After
providing the MSISDN, along with the PIN, the user can query the account
balance (**getBalance**). For recharging, the subscriber must enter payment
details, for example credit card information, from which the payment will be
made. After clearing the payment details, the currency amount will be
transferred and the subscriber\'s prepaid account balance expiration date will
be reset (**balanceUpdate**). The subscriber also queries their account
balance expiration date (**getCreditExpiryDate**), after the recharge.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: AccountManagement
The Account Management interface provides access to account information for
update and query operations.
### 8.1.1 Operation: GetBalance
This message results in getting account balances indicated by the end user
identifier and associated end user PIN. The returned amount for each balance
is specified as a currency amount.
End users accounts may have a single balance for all usage, or may have
multiple balances for different uses. For example, an end user may have a
separate balance for voice calls, SMS messages, and GPRS usage.
#### 8.1.1.1 Input message: GetBalanceRequest
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description EndUserIdentifier xsd:anyURI No This
parameter identifies the end user\'s account. EndUserPin xsd:string Yes

### 8.1.3 Operation: BalanceUpdate
This message results in directly recharging the account indicated by the end
user identifier and optional associated end user PIN. The reference code is
used to uniquely identify the request; it is the application\'s responsibility
to provide a unique reference code within the scope of the application. The
balance type identifies an existing balance type in the account, or a new
balance type to be added to the account.
NOTE: getBalanceTypes operation is used to discover the set of allowed balance
types that can be associated with a specific end user's account.
The recharge is specified as a currency amount. The balance is requested to
expire in the number of days indicated by the period parameter. The
operator\'s policies may overrule this parameter. If the optional period
parameter is not present, the operator\'s policy on balance expiration is
always in effect.

### 8.1.4 Operation: VoucherUpdate
This message results in directly recharging the account indicated by the end
user identifier and optional associated end user PIN. The reference code is
used to uniquely identify the request; it is the application\'s responsibility
to provide a unique reference code within the scope of the application. A
voucher identifier indirectly specifies the charge. The optional voucher PIN
code can be used to verify the voucher.

  * POL0220 - Vouchers not accepted.
### 8.1.5 Operation: GetHistory
This message results in returning the transaction history of the account
indicated by the end user identifier and associated optional end user PIN. The
maximum number of entries to return and the start date define the range of
transactions that are of interest to the requester.
If the total number of entries in the transaction history, starting at the
specified date, is larger than the specified maximum number of entries, only
the most recent events are returned. Note that the operator might limit the
maximum amount of entries to be returned or the period for which the entries
are to be returned.

correlator provided in the reference must be unique for this Web Service at
the time the notification is initiated, otherwise a ServiceException (SVC0005)
will be returned to the application. The endUserIdentifier is the end user\'s
account to monitor. The criteria provide the filtering condition to make
notifications to the application. The balanceTypes part identifies balances
for different types of usage within an account (e.g. Voice, SMS, gaming etc).
