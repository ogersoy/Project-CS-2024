# 4 Detailed service description
Currently, in order to programmatically receive and send Multimedia Messages,
it is necessary to write applications using specific protocols to access MMS
functions provided by network elements (e.g. MMS-C). This approach requires ap
This clause describes Parlay X Web Service for sending and receiving
Multimedia messages. The overall scope of this Web Service is to provide
application developers primitives to handle Multimedia messages in a simple
way. In fact, using Multimedia Messaging Web Service, application developers
can invoke Multimedia Messaging functions without specific Telco knowledge.
This version of Multimedia Messaging Web Services provides generic messaging
features that can support different messaging service types such as SMS, MMS,
IM, E-mail etc.
Multimedia Messaging provides operations (see clause 8.1, SendMessage API) for
sending a Multimedia message to the network and a polling mechanism for
monitoring the delivery status of a sent Multimedia message. It also provides
an asynchronous notification mechanism for delivery status (see clause 8.3,
MessageNotification API). In addition, a mechanism is provided to start and
stop the notification of delivery receipts (see clause 8.4,
MessageNotificationManager API).
Multimedia Messaging also allows an application to receive Multimedia
messages. Both a polling (see clause 8.2, ReceiveMessage API) and an
asynchronous notification mechanism (see clause 8.3, Message Notification API)
are available.
Figure 4.1 shows an example scenario using sendMessage and
getMessageDeliveryStatus to send data to subscribers and to determine if the
data has been received by the subscriber. The application invokes a Web
Service to retrieve a stock quote (1) and (2) and sends the current quote -
sendMessage - using the Parlay X Interface (3) of the Multimedia Messaging Web
Service. After invocation, the Multimedia Message Web Service sends the
message to an MMS-C using the MM7 interface (4) for onward transmission (5) to
the subscriber over the Mobile network.
Later, when the next quote is ready, the application checks to see -
getMessageDeliveryStatus - if the previous quote has been successfully
delivered to the subscriber. If not, it may for instance perform an action
(not shown) to provide a credit for the previous message transmission. This
way, the subscriber is only charged for a stock quote if it is delivered on
time.
Figure 4.1: Multimedia Messaging Scenario
Alternatively this service could have been built using WAP push features in
the network.
Figure 4.2 shows an example scenario using sendMessage and
getMessageDeliveryStatus to send a link to subscribers and to determine if the
data has been received by the subscriber. The application invokes a Web
Service to generate a stock quote graph (1) and (2) and sends the current
quote as a WAP push link - sendMessage - using the Parlay X Interface (3) of
the Multimedia Messaging Web Service. After invocation, the Multimedia Message
Web Service sends the message to an SMS (4) for onward transmission (5) to the
subscriber over the Mobile network. The subscriber can then open the link and
access his content.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: SendMessage
Operations to send messages and check status on sent messages.
### 8.1.1 Operation: SendMessage
Request to send a Message to a set of destination addresses, returning a
**requestIdentifier** to identify the message. The **requestIdentifier** can
subsequently be used by the application to poll for the message status, i.e.
using **getMessageDeliveryStatus** to see if the message has been delivered or
not. The content is sent as one or more attachments as specified in SOAP
Messages with Attachments [7].
**addresses** may include group URIs as defined in the Address List Management
specification. If groups are not supported, a PolicyException (POL0006) will
be returned to the application.
Optionally the application can also indicate the sender address
(**senderAddress**), i.e. the string that is displayed on the user\'s terminal
as the originator of the message, the message **priority** , the message
**subject** , the **charging** information and a **receiptRequest**. The
**receiptRequest** which is a SimpleReference structure indicates the
application endpoint, interface used for notification of delivery receipt and
a correlator that uniquely identifies the sending request. By invoking this
operation with the optional **receiptRequest** part the application requires
to receive the notification of the status of the message delivery.
The optional message part **receiptRequest** is not used (or will be
overridden) in case the **startDeliveryReceiptNotification** operation is used
when the application requires to receive delivery receipt notifications. This
is to avoid overlapping criteria.
If notification mechanism is not supported by a network a fault (SVC0283) will
be returned to the application and the message will not be sent to the
addresses specified. Notification to the application is done by invoking the
**notifyMessageDeliveryReceipt** operation at the endpoint specified in
**receiptRequest**.
The correlator provided in the **receiptRequest** must be unique for this Web
Service and application at the time the notification is initiated, otherwise a
**ServiceException** (SVC0005) will be returned to the application.
Optional parameter **format** is used to indicate the format of a message that
is included in the request (at the same time it indicates preferred delivery
method for the message). If the parameter is not present, MMS format type is
assumed. Enumeration data type **MessageFormat** includes message format types
that can be used with these specifications. If a specified message format is
not supported, a **ServiceException** (SVC0284) will be returned to the
application.
#### 8.1.1.1 Input message: SendMessageRequest
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description
Addresses xsd:anyURI [1..unbounded] No Destination addresses for the Message.
SenderAddress xsd:string Yes Message sender address. This parameter is not
allowed for all 3^rd^ party providers. Parlay X server needs to handle this

each message sent as a result of a previous **sendMessage** message
invocation. The **requestIdentifier** parameter identifies this previous
message invocation.
This operation can be invoked multiple times by the application even if the
status has reached a final value. However, after the status has reached a
final value, status information will be available only for a limited period of
time as defined by a service policy.

## 8.2 Interface: ReceiveMessage
Operations to retrieve messages that have been received.
### 8.2.1 Operation: GetReceivedMessages
This method enables the application to poll for new messages received that
fulfil the criteria identified by **registrationIdentifier**. The priority
parameter may be used by the application to retrieve references to higher
priority messages, e.g. if Normal is chosen only references to high priority
and normal priority messages are returned. If the priority parameter is
omitted all message references are returned.
The operation returns a new list of received messages: i.e. only the received
messages that the application has not retrieved by previous invocations of
this operation. Moreover, each received message will be automatically removed
from the server after an agreed time interval, as defined by a service policy.
#### 8.2.1.1 Input message: GetReceivedMessagesRequest
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description RegistrationIdentifier xsd:string No
Identifies the provisioning step that enables the application to receive
notification of Message reception according to specified criteria. Priority

  * SVC0002 - Invalid input value.
PolicyException from [6]:
  * POL0001 - Policy error.
  * POL0010 -- Retention time interval expired
### 8.2.2 Operation: GetMessageURIs
This method will read the different parts of the message, create local files
in the Parlay Gateway and return URI references to them. The application can
then simply read each file or just have them presented as links to the end-
user. The URIs to the files will be active for as long as the message remains
on the server: i.e. an agreed time interval as defined by a service policy.
#### 8.2.2.1 Input message: GetMessageURIsRequest
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description MessageRefIdentifier xsd:string No
The identity of the message to retrieve.
* * *
#### 8.2.2.2 Output message: GetMessageURIsResponse
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description result MessageURI No It contains the
complete message, i.e. the textual part of the message, if such exists, and a
list of file references for the message attachments, if any.
* * *
#### 8.2.2.3 Referenced faults

  * SVC0002 - Invalid input value.
PolicyException from [6]:
  * POL0001 - Policy error.
  * POL0010 -- Retention time interval expired.
## 8.3 Interface: MessageNotification
MessageNotification is the application side notification interface to which
multimedia messages are delivered.
### 8.3.1 Operation: NotifyMessageReception
The notification is used to send a multimedia message to the application. The
notification will occur only if the multimedia message fulfils the criteria
specified when starting the multimedia message notification.
#### 8.3.1.1 Input message: NotifyMessageReceptionRequest
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description correlator xsd:string No Correlator
provided in request to set up this notification Message MessageReference No
This parameter contains all the information associated with the received
message.
* * *
#### 8.3.1.2 Output message: NotifyMessageReceptionResponse
* * *
Part name Part type Optional Description None
* * *
#### 8.3.1.3 Referenced faults
None.
### 8.3.2 Operation: NotifyMessageDeliveryReceipt
The **notifyMessageDeliveryReceipt** method must be implemented by a Web
Service at the **_application side_** if it requires notification of message
delivery receipt. It will be invoked by the Parlay X server to notify the
application when a message sent by an application has been delivered to the
terminal of the recipient or if delivery is impossible. The notification will
occur if and only if the status of the sent message is 'DeliveredToTerminal'
or 'DeliveryImpossible' and the application has specified interest in
notification using one of the following mutually exclusive mechanisms:
  * when sending a message by specifying the optional receiptRequest parameter. The correlator returned corresponds to the identifier specified by the application in the **receiptRequest** of the original **sendMessage** request
  * by invoking the **startDeliveryReceiptNotification** operation requesting to receive delivery receipt notifications. The correlator returned corresponds to the identifier specified by the application in the **reference** of the original **startDeliveryReceiptNotification** request
When a message is sent to multiple addresses, the notification from the server
will send notification for each terminal as and when a message is delivered to
a terminal.
The following three different message delivery status will be returned in
NotifyMessageDeliveryReceiptResponse:
  * \'DeliveryImpossible\': unsuccessful delivery; the message could not be delivered before it expired.
  * \'DeliveredToTerminal\': when message has been successfully delivered to the terminal.

## 8.4 Interface: MessageNotificationManager
The multimedia message notification manager enables applications to set up and
tear down notifications for multimedia messages online.
### 8.4.1 Operation: StartMessageNotification
Start notifications to the application for a given Message Service activation
number and criteria.
The Message Service activation number is an Address Data item e.g. Shortcode,
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.199-1 [6].
The correlator provided in the reference must be unique for the application
Web Service at the time the notification is initiated, otherwise a
ServiceException (SVC0005) will be returned to the application..
If specified, criteria will be used to filter messages that are to be
delivered to an application. If criteria are not provided, or are an empty
string, then all messages for the MessageServiceActivationNumber will be
delivered to the application. The MessageServiceActivationNumber and criteria
combination must be unique. If a criteria overlaps then SVC0008 will be
returned to the application and the notification will not be set up. Note that
the use of criteria will allow different notification endpoints to receive
notifications for the same MessageServiceActivationNumber. The combination of
MessageServiceActivationNumber and criteria must be unique, so that a
notification will be delivered to only one notification endpoint. If no match
is found, the message will not be delivered to the application.

### 8.4.3 Operation: StartDeliveryReceiptNotification
Start notifications to the application for delivery receipts. The reference
will be where to send the delivery receipts. The
**notifyMessageDeliveryReceipt** method (see clause 8.3.2) must be implemented
by a Web Service at the application side if it requires notification of
Multimedia Message delivery receipt. When the
**startDeliveryReceiptNotification** operation is supported by the Service
Provider, its use overrides the delivery receipting mechanism supported in the
SendMessage API (see clause 8.1: **sendMessage** operation).
