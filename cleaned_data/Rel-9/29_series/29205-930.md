# 1 Scope
The present document describes the protocols to be used when ITU-T Q.1902
\"Bearer Independent Call Control\" is used as call control protocol in a 3GPP
Bearer Independent CS core network 3GPP TS 23.205 [1] The Q.1902 operates
between (G)MSC servers .The BICC architecture as described in ITU-T Q.1902
[6]-[10] consists of a number of protocols. The following types of protocols
are described: call control protocol, bearer control protocols and a resource
control protocol for this architecture. The architecture complies with the

with Release 4 and later.
Note: Q.1902 can be used in other network architectures than the one defined
in 3GPP TS 23.205 [1]

###### ## Annex A: Void
###### ## Annex B (normative): Transparent Support of Mobile Services
# B.1 Introduction
This Annex specifies a new mobile APM usage \"Transparent support of mobile
services\".
In ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.3 [8], for the Application Transport Parameter
(APP), the following codepoint is defined to refer to this application context
identifier (ACI):
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 MST \
The text in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.5 [10] shall be followed when
implementing this application with the following clarification:
\- where the text refers to BAT ASE this shall be interpreted to mean Mobile
Service Transport (MST) service.
The MST service shall use implicit addressing; see ITU-T Recommendation Q.765
[24].
# B.2 Mobile Service Transport (MST) -- Format and Codes
## B.2.1 Encapsulated Application Information
### B.2.1.1 General Layout
The general layout of the Encapsulated Application Information field of the
Application Transport parameter as defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.3
[8] is shown in Table B.2.1.1.1.
Table B.2.1.1.1: Encapsulated application information field
* * *
MSB LSB  
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Octet Identifier 1 1  
Length indicator 1 2  
Compatibility information 1 3  
Contents 1 4
Identifier n m  
Length indicator n  
Compatibility information n  
Contents n p
* * *
Each information element within the Encapsulated Application Information field
has the same structure. An information element consists of four fields which
always appear in the following order: Identifier (one octet), Length
indicator, Compatibility information, Contents.
The Identifier distinguishes one type from another one and governs the
interpretation of the contents. There are two types of Identifiers: type
\"constructor\" and type \"simple\", for which the contents are defined as
follows:
\- For a \"constructor\" type, the Contents field shall again consist of one
or more information elements, each of which is structured as described above,
i.e., Identifier, Length indicator, Compatibility information, Contents.
\- For a \"simple\" type, the Contents field contains one value only.
When passing on an information element of type \"constructor\", the order of
the information elements within this \"constructor\" shall be maintained.
The Length indicator specifies the length (i.e., integral number of octets in
pure binary representation) of the Compatibility information and Contents. The
length does not include the Identifier nor the Length indicator.
The format of the Length indicator is shown in Table B.2.1.1.2. Bit 8 is
defined as Extension indicator and indicates whether or not the information on
the length continues through the next octet. Value \"_0_ \" of the Extension
indicator means \"_information continues through the next octet_ \", while
value \"_1_ \" means \"_last octet_ \". The Length indicator itself has a
maximum length of 2 octets, i.e., if octet 1a is needed, the Extension
indicator of octet 1a is always set to value \"_1_ \".
Table B.2.1.1.2: Length indicator
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Octet ext. LSB 1 ext. 1 0 0 0 MSB 1a

The Compatibility information contains corresponding instructions for the case
that the received information element is unrecognised. The format of this
field is shown in Table B.2.1.1.3.
Table B.2.1.1.3: Compatibility information
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---+---+-------+ | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | Octet | +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---+---+-------+ | ext. | p | re | g | 1 | | | | | | | ass-on | served | eneral | | | | | | | | not | | action | | | | | | | | po | | | | | | | | | | ssible | | | | | | | | +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---+---+-------+ | | send\ | instr | | send\ | instr | | | | | | notifi | uction | | notif | uction | | | | | | cation | | | icaton | ind | | | | | | | ind | | | icator | | | | | | ind | icator | | ind | | | | | | | icator | | | icator | | | | | +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---+---+-------+
The following codes are used in the subfields of the Compatibility information
field.
Bits 2 1 _Instruction indicator for general action_
> 0 0 Pass on information element
>
> 0 1 Discard information element
>
> 1 0 Discard MST data
>
> 1 1 Release call
Bit 3 _Send notification indicator for general action_
> 0 Do not send notification
>
> 1 Send notification
Bit 4 reserved
Bits 6 5 _Instruction indicator for pass-on not possible_
> 0 0 Release call
>
> 0 1 Discard information element
>
> 1 0 Discard MST data
>
> 1 1 reserved (interpreted as 00)
Bit 7 _Send notification indicator for pass-on not possible_
> 0 Do not send notification
>
> 1 Send notification
Bit 8 _Extension indicator_
> 0 Information continues through the next octet
>
> 1 Last octet
The Contents field is the substance of the element and contains the
information the element is intended to convey.
### B.2.1.2 List of Identifiers
Table B.2.1.2.1 contains the list of Identifiers.

### B.2.1.3 Mobile Equipment Identifier
The format of the Mobile Equipment Identifier is shown in Table B.2.1.3.1.

* * *
MSB LSB  
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Octet Mobile Equipment Identifier 1

The MEI contains either the International Mobile station Equipment Identity
(IMEI) or the International Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software
Version Number (IMEISV) as defined in subclause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [25].
Both IMEI and IMEISV are TBCD encoded where IMEI is 15 digits and IMEISV is 16
digits. Bits 5 to 8 of octet n+1 (where n represents the octet of the IMEI(SV)
being encoded) encodes digit 2n, bits 1 to 4 of octet n+1 encodes digit 2n-1
(i.e. the order of digits is swapped in each octet compared to the digit order
defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [25]). For IMEI, bits 5 to 8 of the last octet shall
be filled with an end mark coded as \'1111\'.
For the use of the Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEI) see 3GPP TS 23.216 [26]
and 3GPP TS 23.237 [27].
## B.2.2 Application Transport Instruction Indicators
For the MST service the Application Transport Instruction Indicators (ATII)
shall be set as follows:
Bits 1 _Release call indicator (RCI)_
> 0 do not release call
Bit 2 _Send notification indicator (SNI)_
> 0 do not send notification
