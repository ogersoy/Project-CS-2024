# 5 General issues
## 5.1 Message Routing Mechanism
The principles for IWF message routing are:
\- For the same user, the messages shall go to and come back through the same
route with the same IWF(s) for the duration of a MAP dialog.
\- To ensure the correct message routing for the interworking scenarios, the
IWFs in the network shall be able to map the SS7 number and the Diameter
identity of the MME/SGSN 1-to-1. This may be achieved by static or dynamic
configuration.
\- To ensure the parallel multiple request messages can get their correct
response messages, the IWFs in the network shall be able to map the MAP
Dialogue Id and the Diameter Session Id 1-to-1.
The overall message routing mechanism for the scenario is described as below:
1\. The MME/SGSN may not be able to identify whether there is an IWF or not on
the route to an HSS. The routing of the first message from the MME/SGSN to the
IWF/HSS is the same as for a normal Diameter message routing. If the MME/SGSN
knows the address/name of the IWF/HSS for a certain user, both the
Destination-Realm and Destination-Host AVPs shall be present in the request.
Otherwise, only the Destination-Realm AVP shall be present and the command
shall be routed to the next Diameter node based on the Diameter routing table
in the client.
> When the MME/SGSN receives an answer message from the IWF/HSS, it should
> store the identity of the IWF/HSS for each IMSI for future reference to be
> able to send messages for the same IMSI.
2\. The IWF shall assign an SS7 number for the Diameter node MME/SGSN and
shall assign a Diameter identity for the SS7 node HSS. This may be achieved by
static configuration or dynamic assignment when the first signalling exchange
occurs between the Diameter/SS7 nodes and the IWF. The IWF shall maintain a
mapping table (address mapping table) for the assignment relationship.
> When a Diameter message reaches the IWF to set up a new Diameter session,
> the IWF(s) shall allocate a MAP Dialogue Id for the Diameter session. The
> IWF(s) shall maintain a mapping table (session mapping table) between the
> MAP Dialogue Id and the Diameter Session Id.
>
> The IWF shall then process messages as described below:
>
> a. When the IWF receives a Diameter message from a Diameter node, it shall
> map the Diameter message to a MAP message. It shall obtain a MAP Dialogue Id
> from the Diameter Session Id in the received message according to the
> session mapping table. The IWF shall obtain the source/destination SS7
> Number from the source/destination Diameter Identity in the received message
> according to the address mapping table.
>
> b. When the IWF receives an SS7 message from an SS7 node, it shall map the
> MAP message to a Diameter message. It shall obtain the Diameter Session Id
> from the MAP Dialogue Id in the received message according to the session
> mapping table. The IWF shall obtain the source/destination Diameter Identity
> from the source/destination SS7 Number in the received message according to
> the address mapping table.
3\. When the HSS/HLR receives the first message from IWF/SGSN, the HSS/HLR
shall record the SS7 number of the source for future message handling.
## 5.2 Void
## 5.3 Security Consideration for IWF
To support the full EPS-AKA security level for the related IWF scenarios, the
Pre Rel8 HLR shall be upgraded so that E-UTRAN authentication vector requests
from nodes serving E-UTRAN can be identified. The detailed mechanism is
described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [2].
# 6 The Interworking Scenarios
## 6.1 One IWF scenario
In this scenario, one IWF is located between MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN
and HSS or one IWF is located between MME and EIR, as illustrated in figure
6.1-1:
{width="5.99375in" height="1.8868055555555556in"}
Figure 6.1.-1: One IWF scenarios
The IWF needs not to be aware whether its connection via Gr is to an HSS or to
a second IWF (see Two IWF scenario).
## 6.2 Two IWF scenario
In this scenario, two IWFs are located between MME or SGSN or combined
MME/SGSN and HSS, as illustrated in figure 6.2-1:
Figure 6.2-1: Two IWFs scenario
The IWF1 is located in the VPLMN. IWF2 is located in the HPLMN. The IWF1 needs
not to be aware whether its connection via Gr is to an IWF or to an HSS (see
One IWF scenario).
# 7 The Mapping of the Procedures
## 7.1 Authentication Information Retrieval
### 7.1.1 One IWF Scenario
The mapping of procedures for this scenario is shown in figure 7.1.1-1:
Figure 7.1.1-1: Mapping of Authentication Info Retrieval Procedure for
scenario with one IWF
1\. The IWF receives an AIR message from the MME, SGSN or combined MME/SGSN.
2\. The IWF opens a MAP v3 dialogue towards the HSS by sending
SendAuthenticationInfo.
3\. The HSS may initiate MAP version fallback and/or send partial results. The
IWF performs the version fallback and/or stores the partial results. If EPS-
Vectors are requested for immediate use, version fallback is not applicable;
4\. The HSS closes the MAP dialogue by sending the (final)
SendAuthenticationInfo Ack to the IWF.
5\. The IWF uses the information received from the HSS to construct an AIA
which is sent to the MME, SGSN, or combined MME/SGSN.
### 7.1.2 Two IWFs Scenario
The mapping of procedures for this scenario is shown in figure 7.1.2-1:
Figure 7.1.2-1: Mapping of Authentication Info Retrieval Procedure for
scenario with two IWFs
1\. The IWF1 receives an AIR message from the MME, SGSN or combined MME/SGSN.
2\. The IWF1 opens a MAP v3 dialogue towards IWF2 by sending
SendAuthenticationInfo.
3\. The IWF2 constructs an AIR message and sends it to the HSS.
4\. The IWF2 receives AIA from the HSS.
5\. If segmentation is required, the IWF2 sends partial results to the IWF1
which stores the partial results.
6\. The IWF2 closes the MAP dialogue by sending the (final)
SendAuthenticationInfo Ack to IWF1.
7\. The IWF1 uses the information received from the IWF2 to construct an AIA
which is sent to the MME, SGSN, or combined MME/SGSN.
## 7.2 Update Location
### 7.2.1 One IWF Scenario
The mapping of procedures for this scenario is shown in figure 7.2.1-1:
Figure 7.2.1-1: Mapping of Update Location Procedure for scenario with one IWF
1\. The IWF receives an ULR message from the MME, SGSN or combined MME/SGSN.
2\. The IWF shall open a MAP v3 dialogue towards the HSS by sending
UpdateGprsLocation.
3\. Depending on \"skip subscriber data\" indication received in the ULR
(bullet 1 aboveand hence sent as per bullet 2 in the UpdateGprsLocation), the
HSS may continue the MAP dialogue by sending one or several
InsertSubscriberData messages (in acknowledgement mode or in burst mode) to
the IWF. The IWF then temporarily stores the received data and sends
InsertSubscriberData Ack messages to the HSS.
Note that the HSS may send InsertSubscriberData messages although a \"skip
subscriber data\" indication was present. In this case InsertSubscriberData
messages received from the HSS shall be acknowledged but need not be stored in
the IWF.
When sending InsertSubscriberData Ack messages to the HSS the IWF shall mirror
back any services requested by the HSS (within the InsertSubscriberData
message) but not supported by the MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN (as
indicated in 1.ULR). The IWF shall reject a MAP ActivateTraceMode message
received from the HSS by returning ActivateTraceMode Error
(facilityNotSupported).
If the IWF received a MAP ActivateTraceMode message from the HSS, the IWF
needs to store the received trace data. Based upon support of tracing (as
indicated the ULR received in bullet 1 above), the MME/SGSN sends an
ActivateTraceMode Result (positive Ack) or Error FacilityNotSupported
(negative Ack) to the HSS.
4\. The HSS shallclose the MAP dialogue by sending UpdateGprsLocation Ack to
the IWF.
5\. The IWF shal use the information received from the HSS to construct an ULA
which is sent to the MME, SGSN, or combined MME/SGSN.
### 7.2.2 Two IWFs Scenario
The mapping of procedures for this scenario is shown in figure 7.2.2-1:
Figure 7.2.2-1: Mapping of Update Location Procedure for scenario with two
IWFs
1\. The IWF1 receives an ULR message from the MME, SGSN or combined MME/SGSN.
2\. The IWF1 shall open a MAP v3 dialogue towards IWF2 by sending
UpdateGprsLocation.
3\. The IWF2 shall construct a ULR message and shall send it to the HSS.
4\. The IWF2 receives ULA from the HSS.
5\. If subscriber data is included in the ULA(as per bullet 4), the IWF2 shall
send one or several InsertSubscriberData messages (in acknowledgement mode or
in burst mode) to the IWF1. IWF1 then temporarily stores the received data and
sends InsertSubscriberData Ack messages to the IWF2. If trace data is included
in the ULA (bullet 4. above) , the IWF2 sends an ActivateTraceMode message to
the IWF1, which sends an ActivateTraceMode Ack message to the IWF2.
6\. The IWF2 shall close the MAP dialogue by sending UpdateGprsLocation Ack to
IWF1.
7\. The IWF1 shall use the information received from the IWF2 to construct an
ULA which shall be sent to the MME, SGSN, or combined MME/SGSN.

3\. The IWF receives CLA.
4\. The IWF closes the MAP dialogue with the HSS by sending CancelLocation
Ack.

Figure 7.3.2-1: Mapping of Cancel Location Procedure for scenario with two
IWFs
1\. The IWF2 receives a CLR message from the HSS.
2\. The IWF2 opens a MAP v3 dialogue towards IWF1 by sending CancelLocation.
3\. The IWF1 constructs a CLR message and sends it to the MME, SGSN, or
combined MME/SGSN.
4\. The IWF1 receives CLA from the MME, SGSN or combined MME/SGSN.
5\. The IWF1 closes the MAP dialogue with the IWF2 by sending CancelLocation
Ack.
6\. The IWF2 sends CLA to the HSS.

## 7.5 Insert Subscriber Data
### 7.5.1 One IWF Scenario
The mapping of procedures for this scenario is shown in figure 7.5.1-1:
Figure 7.5.1-1: Mapping of Insert Subscriber Data Procedure for scenario with
one IWF

combined MME/SGSN.
3\. The IWF receives IDA from the MME, SGSN, or combined MME/SGSN.
4\. The IWF sends InsertSubscriberData or ProvideSubscriberInfo Ack to the
HSS.
5\. Steps 1 to 4 may be repeated several times for InsertSubscriberData. The
repetition may be in burst mode or in acknowledge mode.
6\. The HSS closes the MAP dialogue.
NOTE: In a mapping procedure, the IWF correlates the MAP Dialogue ID of the
MAP request message and the Diameter Session-ID of the mapped Diameter request
message which is to be used in the subsequent mapping from Diameter Answer
message to corresponding MAP Ack message.

InsertSubscriberData (if the IDR-Flags AVP within the IDR is not present or
the \"UE Reachability Request\" flag was set in the IDR-Flags AVP within the
IDR) or ProvideSubscriberInfo in other cases. If segmentation of the data (on
MAP level) is required the IWF2 temporarily stores the data that could not be
sent in this step.
3\. The IWF1 constructs a IDR message and sends it to the MME, SGSN, or
combined MME/SGSN.
4\. The IWF1 receives IDA from the MME, SGSN, or combined MME/SGSN.

repeated until all data are sent. Repetition may be in burst mode or in
acknowledge mode.
7\. IWF2 closes the MAP dialogue with IWF1.
8\. IWF2 sends IDA to the HSS.
NOTE: In a mapping procedure, the IWFs correlates the MAP Dialogue ID of the
MAP request message and the Diameter Session-ID of the mapped Diameter request
message which is to be used in the subsequent mapping from Diameter Answer
message to corresponding MAP Ack message or vice versa.
