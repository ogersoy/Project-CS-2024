# 4 Detailed service description
The service provides a flexible way to provide multimedia message delivery and
the dynamic management of the media involved for the call participants. The
interface is very simple, not requiring the developer to manage the creation
of the call.
The Audio Call web service allows media to be added/dropped for any ongoing
call. This web service also allows interaction with other call control web
services (e.g. multimedia conference, third party call), enabling delivery of
multimedia to call participants in an ongoing call.
The underlying model of the service is based on the following entities:
  * **Call Session:** a call (uniquely identified) to which participants > can be added/removed.
  * **Call Participant:** each of the call parties (uniquely identified) > involved in the call session.
  * **Media:** the call can utilize multiple media types to support the > participants\' communication. In particular both audio and video > streams are available, including the specific stream direction > (i.e. incoming, outgoing, bidirectional).
NOTE 1: Call participants in a Call Session are anticipated to be uniquely
identifiable using their URI address.
There are several mechanisms which may be utilized for the message content:
  * Text, to be rendered using a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine.
  * Audio content (such as .WAV content), to be rendered by an audio > player.
  * VoiceXML, to be rendered using a VoiceXML browser.
  * Video, to provide video streaming to the user.
  * Capture media input from the end user
The service may provide one or more mechanisms, as determined by service
policy.
The service allows application control of the call participants' multimedia in
a call:
  * Allow multiple media types for each participant. In particular both > audio and video as well as chat and data.
  * Add and delete media types.
  * Control the specific media stream direction (i.e. incoming, > outgoing, bidirectional) for each media type.
  * Get the current media status of a single call participant or for all > the call participants in a call.
  * Control the media interactions for a call participant.
A service policy determines if multimedia application control is supported.

# 6 Sequence diagrams
## 6.1 Play audio and check status
Pattern: Request / response.
This example shows an audio message being played, and the different responses
to status requests that occur at different phases. Note that the last
response, a service exception, reflects the transient nature of results, and
that these results will expire.
## 6.2 Play audio and cancel
Pattern: Request / response.
The playing of a message may be ended by the requester, as shown.
## 6.3 Adding and Removing Media
This example shows how to add media, read media information, and remove media
for a participant on an existing call.
## 6.4 Play Media File and Collect Digits from End User
This example shows an application playing a media file and retrieving digits
from the end user.
Making call session should precede any operations for media interaction. Call
session can be created by TPC, CN, or MMC web services. In this case, the call
session for media interaction is created by invoking MakeCallSession request.
Collecting digits should be performed by StartPlayAndCollectNotification prior
to StartPlayAndCollectInteraction with the same call session identifier
generated by MakeCallSession.

## 6.5 Play Media and Retrieve media from End user
This example shows an application playing a media file, retrieving media from
the end user and recording it.
Making call session should precede any operations for media interaction. Call
session can be created by TPC, CN, or MMC web services. In this case, the call
session for media interaction is created by invoking MakeCallSession request.
Recording information should be performed by StartPlayAndRecordNotification
prior to StartPlayAndRecordInteraction with the same call session identifier
generated by MakeCallSession.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: PlayMedia
The PlayMedia interface allows the playing of media messages using different
forms of media content, and operations to monitor or cancel requests.
In all operations, a callSessionIdentifier is used to indicate the ongoing
call session to which the request applies. If the call session is not valid,
the Parlay X web service shall raise an exception, invalid input value. All
operations may also list the set of **CallParticipants** to which the
requested media shall be provided. The set of participant addresses is
restricted to a subset of the valid participant addresses contained within the
callSession identified.
### 8.1.1 Operation: PlayTextMessage
The invocation of **PlayTextMessage** requests to play a text identified by
**Text,** to the set of call participants that are provided and contained
within the **CallSessionIdentifier** specified. The text will be read through
a Text-to-Speech engine, according to the specified **Language**. The
invocation returns as soon as the request is received by the system, i.e. the
actual call is performed asynchronously. The **Correlator** , returned by the
invocation, can be used to identify the request, e.g. to get information on
the request status.
This operation is intended to play a message to all of the call participants
identified. If no call addresses are specified, the Parlay X Web Service shall
play the message to all call participants associated within the
**CallSessionIdentifier**. If call participants are specified, then only those
call participants specified within the call session shall be played the
message. The latter is to allow a message to be played to just one (or some)
of the participants, where not all the participants in the call session are to
receive the message.
All occurrences of invalid **CallSessionIdentifier** or **CallParticipants**
shall result in an invalid input value exception.

request addition of the media type(s) specified to all call participants in
the call session (i.e. associated with the **CallSessionIdentifier)**. If call
participants are specified, then only those call participants explicitly
specified shall have the media type(s) added. The latter is to allow media
type(s) to be added or changed for just one (or some) of the participants,
where not all the participants in the call session are to have exactly the
same set of media types.
The added media type has to be compatible with the the set of media types
supported by the participant's device, otherwise the operation will fail. The
resultant media details can be retrieved using **getMediaForParticipant** or
**getMediaForCall.** If a participant has already the requested media type and
direction, the operation shall fail and throw ServiceException SVC0290.

### 8.3.2 Operation: DeleteMediaForParticipants
The invocation of **deleteMediaForParticipants** requests to delete **media**
types from the media set used by all the call participants identified. If no
call participant addresses are specified, the requested media type(s) for all
call participants in the call session (i.e. associated with the
**CallSessionIdentifier)** shall be removed. If call participants are
specified, then only those call participants explicit specified shall have the
media type(s) removed. The latter is to allow media type(s) to be removed for
just one (or some) of the call participants, where not all the call
participants in the call are to have exact the same set of media types. The
resultant media details can be retrieved using **getMedia ForParticipant** or
**getMediaForCall**
If a call participant does not have the requested media type, the operation
shall fail and throw ServiceException SVC0291.
