# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 29.199-01 [4] apply.
**Policy** : An ordered combination of policy rules that defines how to
administer, manage, and control access to resources. Derived from RFC 3460 [5]
and RFC 3198 [6].
**Policy Rule** : A combination of conditions and actions to be performed if
the condition is true.
**Policy Action** : Action (e.g. invocation of a function, script, code,
workflow, etc) that is associated to a policy condition in a policy rule and
that is executed when its associated policy condition results in \"true\" from
the policy evaluation step.
**Policy Condition** : A condition is a Boolean predicate that yields true or
false.
**Policy Evaluation** : The process of evaluating the policy conditions and
executing the associated policy actions up to the point that the end of the
policy is reached.
**Policy Provisioning** : The act of describing, creating, updating, deleting,
provisioning, and viewing policies. A meta-model or representation scheme may
be used in this activity.
**Resource** : any component, function, or application that can receive and
process requests.
**Role** : a type of attribute that is used to select one or more policies for
a set of entities and/or components from among a much larger set of available
policies.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] and in 3GPP TS 29.199-01 [4] apply.
# 4 Detailed service description
The Policy Web Service is defined to offer provisioning and evaluation
functions for policies. This Specification is separated into four interfaces.
  * PolicyProvisioning interface includes the operation to create, modify, view, and delete policies.
  * PolicyEvaluation interface provides operations to request evaluation of policies.
  * PolicyEventNotificationManager interface provides functions for starting and ending subscription of the notification about events.
  * PolicyEventNotification interface is defined for delivering the notification to the application when the event occurs.
The Policy Web Service is defined to provide simple means for applications to
make use policies to satisfy two purposes as follows:
  * The first one is to provide the user defined policies for the 3^rd^ party applications who want to personalize their services by using their own preference expressed as policies at a high level. At this level, policies could be defined and managed by 3^rd^ party applications, and applied to any policy enabled service.
  * The second one is to protect resources in network from unauthorized requests based on policies, therefore enables the network operators and service providers to control the access to their resources. Network resources can be accessed in a secure and controlled way and network operator could impose constraints on the usage of their services.
The Policy Web Service is provided with the architecture as shown in figure
4-1. This Policy Web Service is focused on the easy and simplified way to
manage and evaluate policy rules. It can interact with OSA/Parlay Policy
Management SCF [7] or directly access network resource if necessary.

# 6 Sequence diagrams
## 6.1 Creation of a conditionList or actionList
Pattern: Request / Response
It provides the mechanism for creating unattached conditionList or actionList.
When the operation is invoked, the sequence diagram below shows both cases for
creating a conditionList and an actionList. As the result of creation, a
conditionID or actionID may be returned to the application. For deleting
created conditionList or actionList, Application should use the conditionID or
actionID.
Figure 6.1 : Sequence Diagram of creating a conditionList and an actionList
## 6.2 Creation of a Rule
Pattern: Request / Response
It provides the mechanism for creating the specified rule. An application
should assign the name for the new rule. As the result of the request, a
ruleID may be returned to the application and application should keep this ID
for management of the rule created.
Figure 6.2 : Sequence Diagram of creating a rule
## 6.3 Querying DomainRuleList
Pattern: Request / Response
It provides the mechanism for retrieving a domainList or ruleList. If an
application wants to request a ruleList in the specified domain, then it
should be requested with the name of domain or rule. This sequence diagram
below shows both cases.
Figure 6.3 : Sequence Diagram of querying a domainList or ruleList
## 6.4 Querying of a ConditionList/Conditions or ActionList/Actions
Pattern: Request / Response
This sequence diagram below shows how to retrieve a conditionList or
actionList, and the conditions or actions in the conditionList or actionList.
An application may request an unattached conditionLists or actionLists to
reuse conditions or actions in a conditionList or actionList.
Figure 6.4 : Sequence Diagram of querying a conditionList or actionList and
conditions or actions aggregated in the list
## 6.5 Policy Evaluation
Pattern: Request / Response
The following sequence diagram shows how to request the evaluation of a policy
rule. An application should create a signature in a domain before requesting
the evaluation. The name of signature should be clarified within a request for
evaluation.
Figure 6.5 : Sequence Diagram of requesting an evaluation
## 6.6 Policy Event Notification
Pattern: Application Correlated Multiple Notifications.
The application can request to be notified of the event which is related with
event types.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Description of Parlay X Web Services Part 22:
Policy for 3GPP2 cdma2000 networks
This annex is intended to define the OSA Parlay X Web Services Stage 3
interface definitions and it provides the complete OSA specifications. It is
an extension of OSA Parlay X Web Services specifications capabilities to
enable operation in cdma2000 systems environment. They are in alignment with
3GPP2 Stage 1 requirements and Stage 2 architecture defined in:
[1] 3GPP2 X.S0011-D: \"cdma2000 Wireless IP Network Standard \", Version 1.1
[2] 3GPP2 S.R0037-0: \"IP Network Architecture Model for cdma2000 Spread
Spectrum Systems\", Version 3.0
[3] 3GPP2 X.S0013-A: \"All-IP Core Network Multimedia Domain\"
These requirements are expressed as additions to and/or exclusions from the
3GPP Release 8 specification.\ The information given here is to be used by
developers in 3GPP2 cdma2000 network architecture to interpret the 3GPP OSA
specifications.

no additions or exclusions required.
CAMEL mappings are not applicable for cdma2000 systems.
