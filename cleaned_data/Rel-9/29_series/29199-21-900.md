# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 21 of the Stage 3 Parlay X Web Services
specification for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Multimedia multicast session management Web
Service aspects of the interface. All aspects of the Multimedia multicast
session management Web Service are defined here, these being:
  * Name spaces.
  * Sequence diagrams.
  * Data definitions.
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions.
  * Fault definitions.
  * Service policies.
  * WSDL description of the interfaces.
The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.

# 4 Detailed service description
The content management web service enables uploading content into the network
(or a third party content provider) and consuming content from the network (or
a third party content provider). This functional element stores and manages
the meta-data associated with content elements. It provides interfaces to
submit, modify and delete content entries. It also provides interfaces to
query for content items including content identifier, meta data, control data
and content upload date (matching specific criteria).
{width="4.216666666666667in" height="3.5430555555555556in"}The network
entities composed of content management web service are service portal, parlay
X gateway, content server, streaming server and end user. End user uses the
service portal that provides or consumes contents. The content server
functions as a content storage and a management system in the network.
Figure 4.1: Content management web service architecture
Figure 4.1 shows the architecture of content management web service. An
application 3 submits \'content1\'. The submit operation doesn\'t mean a
content provider to upload content in the network directly. Content management
web service uploads the meta-data of content to the network. And the content
server gets and stores the content from location which content exists. After
content1 is stored in the content server, the application 3 is notified of the
result of submitting the content using notifyApprovalStatus message. The
application 3 can modify/delete/read \'content1\'. An application 1 and an
application 2 query \'content1\'. They set up the notification for informing
them of the uploading of content which meets the application\'s criteria.
# 5 Namespaces
The ContentManagement interface uses the namespace:

The \'xsd\' namespace is used in the present document to refer to the XML
Schema data types defined in XML Schema(3GPP TS 29.199-1 [6]) . The use of the
name \'xsd\' is not semantically significant.

{width="3.495833333333333in" height="3.5416666666666665in"}Application can
handle content with submit, read, modify, delete, and query operations. When
an application submits a content, the application is notified of the result of
submitting using notifyApprovalStatus message.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: ContentManagement
### 8.1.1 Operation: submitContent
The application invokes the **submitContent** operation to submit a content
into the network. This operation doesn\'t mean a content provider to upload
content in the network directly. Content management web service uploads the
meta-data of the content to the network and content server gets and stores the
content from location which content exists. After completing this content
approval process, the application is notified of the result of submitting the
content using **notifyApprovalStatus** message.
**ContentMetaData** is the content description information about content
location, content name, content description, content provider, content
version, keywords and IsDerivative.
> **IsDerivative** field is the Boolean flag whether allows the manipulation
> of original content. For delivering content to end-user\'s terminal
> adaptively (e.g. MMS, multimedia stream, MBMS data), it is essential for
> network provider to manipulate content to support the content adaptation and
> multiple selection. If this flag is true, the manipulation of original
> content is permitted. If not present, default value is true.
**ContentMediaData** specifies the content type, length and file size.
**ContentControlData** specifies the content access restrictions, content
charging and content validity.
**Reference** specifies the application endpoint, interfaceName and correlator
that will be used to notify the application when the content is stored in the
network.
**Result** is the ContentIdentifier specified in the response message
associated with each submit operation. The application can use it to modify,
delete and read content.
