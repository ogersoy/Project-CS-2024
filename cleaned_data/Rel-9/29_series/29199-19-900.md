# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 19 of the Stage 3 Parlay X Web Services
specification for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Multimedia streaming control Web Service
aspects of the interface. All aspects of the Multimedia streaming control Web
Service are defined here, these being:
  * Name spaces.
  * Sequence diagrams.
  * Data definitions.
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions.
  * Fault definitions.
  * Service policies.
  * WSDL description of the interfaces.
The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

# 4 Detailed Service Description
The service provided to an end-user is consumption of streaming Multimedia.
The end-user has a terminal that is able to request a media stream, either
from a built-in player, or an installed application. The terminal can be any
terminal with streaming media playing capabilities, and the service should
allow a user to transfer between his terminals.
  * The basic scenario is where an individual is browsing the Internet and finds some interesting content that he/she wants to watch. The end-user is then either doing this through the operator's portal or accesses the content provider's site. In the first case, the request is then processed through the portal, and charged as the stream is set-up. In the second case, the content provider redirects the request to the operator, so that the terminal capabilities can be collected and charging is done, before the stream is started.
  * One scenario is an individual watching his favourite sports stream on his TV or PC at home, but he/she must leave the house of some reason, and still wants to continue the session on his mobile terminal. In that case he/she would transfer the ongoing session to the other terminal with other capabilities, since he already paid for the entire episode.
  * The other way is a similar case where an individual arrives at a destination with better viewing capabilities.
## 4.1 Overview
Figure 4.4.1 shows streaming content delivered to mobile terminals, but is not
restricted to any particular terminal type. The content is either on a
location accessible over the Internet or stored locally on an operator\'s
domain or the content provider\'s domain. The access to the content is done
through a smart router controlling the stream towards the terminal.
Transcoding of a stream is an optional feature that could allow users to
switch between different terminal and networks, while consuming content from a
streaming source.

## 6.1 Getting requests
The following diagram illustrates the scenario where incoming stream requests
are buffered at the operator. The content provider periodically retrieves
streaming requests and handles them. The following diagram illustrates the
scenario where incoming stream requests are buffered at the operator. The
content provider periodically retrieves streaming requests and handles them.
## 6.2 Charging refund
The following diagram illustrates the scenario where incoming stream requests
are sent to the content provider when received by the operator. In this
scenario the stream is cancelled before playing is completed and the content
provider refunds an amount previously requested.
## 6.3 Trans-coding update
The following diagram illustrates the scenario where the capabilities for a
terminal or a network changes, for example due to handover between GRPS and
3G. The contents provider is notified about this change and can change for
example transcoding of the stream.
## 6.4 Controlling multiple streams
The following diagram illustrates the scenario where the content provider
pauses an ongoing stream and temporarily plays another stream, for example an
advertisement. When the second stream ends the first original stream is
continued. From the end users point of view this should be perceived as one
uninterrupted stream.
## 6.5 Redirecting a stream
The following diagram illustrates the scenario where a stream is being
redirected to another device due to a user request. The contents provider
receives the request from the end-user and continues the stream to the new
device.
## 6.6 Multimedia Stream Control with Dynamic QoS
The following sequence diagram provides an example of how an application could
combine functionality from the Multimedia streaming control web service (this
specification) with the Application Driven QoS (ADQ) web service to provide
guaranteed media stream delivery.
Flow summary:
  1. ContentProvider receives a NotifyMediaStreamRequest which includes the content identifier, terminal capabilities and an estimated available bandwidth of the current network session.
  2. Based upon content requirements and current network bandwidth, the content provider may decide to provide a guaranteed QoS for content delivery by applying a temporary QoS session (addTemporaryQoSFeature on ADQ Web Service).
  3. The content provider will then continue to setup the media stream through the StartMediaStream operation, as for previous scenarios.
  4. At some point during the ongoing stream, the network / terminal capabilities change and the content provider is notified by the operator with the NotifySessionStatus operation.
  5. Based on the new session parameters (e.g. available bandwidth), the content provider may modify the guaranteed QoS parameters previously requested (modifyTemporaryQoSFeature).
  6. Upon stream completion, content provider will remove the previously requested QoS session (removeTemporaryQosFeature).

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: Streaming
### 8.1.1 Operation: startMediaStream
The startMediaStream operation is sent to the ParlayX server to specify how a
stream should be handled by the operator. The information included is media
server location, charging data and information about how to handle
transcoding. The operation is sent as a response to either a previous received
notifyMediaStreamRequest or to streaming requests received in a
getStreamingRequests response.

the initial notifyMediaStreamRequest or getStreamingRequest operation

in streaming session

charging information to be applied to media stream ChargingInformation
allowNetworkTranscoding xsd:boolean Yes Allows a content provider to specify
whether or not the network operator may apply further transcoding to the
content media stream

### 8.1.2 Operation: getStreamingRequests
The invocation of getStreamingRequests retrieves all the content requests
received that fulfil the criteria identified by contentProviderID. The method
returns only the list of content requests received since the previous
invocation of the same method, i.e. each time the method is executed the
content requests returned are removed from the server. Moreover, each content
request will be automatically removed from the server after a maximum time
interval as defined by a service policy. This operation allows the content
provider to poll for a list of pending streaming requests rather than receive
dynamic notification (notifyMediaStreamRequest). The operation returns a list
of pending MediaStreamRequest structures.

to an end-user account. For example, this could be as a result of a multimedia
stream failing before completion due to loss of network connectivity etc.
(This would have been notified to the content provider through invocation of
either a getMediaStreamStatus operation or a notifyMediaStreamStatus callback
operation) Content provider will specify the refund amount within the

The notification pattern with correlation is used in order to correlate the
notification events with the request.
Initial event registration operation which allows content provider\'s
application to subscribe to receive event notifications from the web service
relating to newly requested (i.e. notifyMediaStreamRequest) and ongoing
Multimedia streams (e.g. notifyMediaStreamStatus). Content provider will
provide a call-back address and correlator string (which may subsequently be
used to cancel notifications) within the reference parameter.
