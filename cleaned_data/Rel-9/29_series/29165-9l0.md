# 1 Scope
The objective of this document is to address the Inter-IMS Network to Network
Interface (II-NNI) consisting of Ici and Izi reference points between IMS
networks in order to support end-to-end service interoperability.
The present document will address the issues related to control plane
signalling (3GPP usage of SIP and SDP protocols, required SIP header fields)
as well as other interconnecting aspects like security,
numbering/naming/addressing and user plane issues as transport protocol, media
and codecs actually covered in a widespread set of 3GPP specifications. A
profiling of the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) is also
provided.
Charging aspects will be addressed as far as SIP signalling is concerned.

# 4 Overview
Interconnection between two different IM CN subsystems shall be guaranteed in
order to support end-to-end service interoperability. For this purpose, Inter-
IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN subsystem networks
is adopted, according to the assumptions coming from TS 23.002 [3] and TS
23.228 [4].
Aiming to support the delivery of IMS services between two separated IM CN
subsystems, protocol interconnection has to occur:
\- at a control plane level, in order that IMS procedures can be supported. In
this case the adopted reference point is the Ici; and
\- at a user plane level, where media streams are exchanged over the Izi
reference point.
The management of IP multimedia sessions is acted by using SIP. The transport
mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media transport is IPv4 (IETF
RFC 791 [2]) or IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [7]). The 3GPP profile of SIP defining the
usage of SIP within the IM CN subsystem is specified in TS 24.229 [5]. Example
call flows are provided in TR 24.930 [6].
The general interconnection model is shown in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Interconnection Model for IM CN subsystems
The possible functional entities involved in the signalling plane
interconnection (IBCF, I-CSCF, P-CSCF, BGCF and MSC Server enhanced for ICS)
and in the user plane interconnection (TrGW) are specified in TS 24.229 [5],
in TS 24.292 [121] and in TS 29.162 [8].
IP Version interworking is described within TS 29.162 [8].
# 5 Reference model for interconnection between IM CN subsystems
## 5.1 General
Figure 5.1 illustrates the architecture diagram given in TS 23.228 [4] showing
the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN
subsystem networks.
Figure 5.1.1: Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface between two IM CN
subsystem networks
The protocols over the two reference points Ici and Izi make up the Inter-IMS
Network to Network Interface.
The Ici reference point allows IBCFs to communicate with each other in order
to provide the communication and forwarding of SIP signalling messaging
between IM CN subsystem networks. The Izi reference point allows TrGWs to
forward media streams between IM CN subsystem networks.
IMS roaming performed by using II-NNI is considered, when the IBCFs are
inserted at the network borders.
Whenever the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface is used to interconnect
two IM CN subsystem networks belonging to different security domains, security
procedures apply as described in TS 33.210 [10].
## 5.2 Functionalities performed by entities at the edge of the network
### 5.2.1 Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF)
An IBCF provides application specific functions at the SIP/SDP protocol layer
in order to perform interconnection between IM CN subsystem networks by using
Ici reference point. According to TS 23.228 [4], IBCF can act both as an entry
point and as an exit point for a network.
The functionalities of IBCF are indicated in the TS 23.228 [4] and specified
in TS 24.229 [5]. They include:
\- network topology hiding;
\- application level gateway (for instance enabling communication between IPv6
and IPv4 SIP applications, or between a SIP application in a private IP
address space and a SIP application outside this address space);
\- controlling transport plane functions;
\- controlling media plane adaptations;
\- screening of SIP signalling information;
\- selecting the appropriate signalling interconnect; and
\- generation of charging data records.
Based on local configuration, the IBCF performs transit routing functions as
specified in TS 24.229 [5].
The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs IMS-ALG functionality.
### 5.2.2 Transition Gateway (TrGW)
According to TS 23.002 [3], the TrGW is located at the network borders within
the media path and is controlled by an IBCF. Forwarding of media streams
between IM CN subsystem networks is applied over Izi reference point.
The TrGW provides functions like network address/port translation and
IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6 network with
addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent routing
between the two IP domains without requiring any changes to end points.
NA(P)T-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (TCP and UDP
port numbers). The approach is similar to that one described also in TS 29.162
[8].
Further details are described in TS 23.228 [4].
# 6 Control plane interconnection
## 6.1 Definition of Inter-IMS Network to Network Interconnection
### 6.1.1 SIP methods and header fields
#### 6.1.1.1 General
The functional entity closest to the border of an II-NNI (see reference model
in clause 5) shall provide the capabilities specified for that network element
in Annex A.2 of TS 24.229 [5] with modifications as described in the following
subclauses.
#### 6.1.1.2 SIP methods
TS 24.229 [5] defines the methods allowing an IBCF to interconnect to an IBCF
placed in another IM CN subsystem.
The following SIP methods are supported on the II-NNI as defined in table 6.1.
The following table is based on Table A.5 and Table A.163 of TS 24.229 [5] and

#### 6.1.1.3 SIP header fields
##### 6.1.1.3.0 General
The IBCF shall provide the capabilities to manage and modify SIP header fields
according to section 5.10 and Annex A of TS 24.229 [5] with modifications as
described in the following sub-clauses.
##### 6.1.1.3.1 Trust and no trust relationship
The IBCF acting as exit point applies the procedures described in subclause
5.10.2 of TS 24.229 [5] before forwarding the SIP signalling to the IBCF
acting as entry point. The IBCF acting as entry point applies the procedures
described in subclause 5.10.3 of TS 24.229 [5].
Additionally, in case there is no trust relationship between the two IM CN
subsystems connected by II-NNI, the IBCF applies the procedures described in
subclause 4.4 of TS 24.229 [5], before forwarding the SIP signalling.
These procedures may be utilized on a per header field basis to realize
overall trust as well as per service level screening of header fields. Trust
relationships and trust domains may be defined by inter-operator agreements
for individual services and/or individual SIP header fields.
The management of the SIP header fields (if present) over II-NNI in case of a
presence or not of a trust relationship between the two interconnected IM CN
subsystems is wrapped up in the following table.

##### 6.1.1.3.2 Derivation of applicable SIP header fields from TS 24.229 [5]
For any method in Table 6.1, the SIP header fields applicable on the II-NNI
are detailed in the corresponding method tables for the UA role and proxy role
sending behaviour in Annex A of TS 24.229 [5]. Unless other information is
specified in the normative part of the present specification, the
applicability of header fields at the II-NNI can be derived for each method
from the corresponding tables in Annex A of TS 24.229 [5] as follows:
\- All header fields not present in the corresponding tables in Annex A of TS
24.229 [5] or marked as \"n/a\" in both the \"RFC status\" and \"profile
status\" columns for the UA role and proxy role sending behaviour of that
tables are not applicable at the II-NNI.
NOTE 1: Operators could choose to apply header fields for new SIP extensions
on an II-NNI based on bilateral agreements, but this is outside the scope of
the present specification.
\- All header fields which are marked as \"o\" in at least one of the \"RFC
status\" or the \"profile status\" profile columns for the sending behaviour
in the corresponding UA role and proxy role tables in Annex A of TS 24.229 [5]
and as \"n/a\" or \"o\" in the other such columns are applicable at II-NNI
based on bilateral agreement between operators.
\- All header fields which are marked as \"m\" in at least one of the \"RFC
status\" or the \"profile status\" columns for the sending behaviour in the
corresponding UA role or proxy role table in Annex A of TS 24.229 [5] and as
\"n/a\", \"o\", or \"m\" in the other such columns are applicable at the II-
NNI.
\- If conditions are specified, they are also applicable at the II-NNI and the
above rules are applicable to the \"n/a\", \"o\" and \"m\" values within the
conditions.
NOTE 2: In the above rules, the RFC profile columns are taken into account in
order to enable interworking with non-3GPP networks,
An informative summary of SIP header fields to be used over the II-NNI is
proposed in Annex A.
##### 6.1.1.3.3 Applicability of SIP header fields on a roaming II-NNI
The following SIP header fields are only applicable on a roaming II-NNI:
\- Authentication-Info
\- Authorization
\- P-Associated-URI
\- P-Called-Party-ID
\- P-Preferred-Service
\- P-Profile-Key
\- P-Served-User
\- P-Visited-Network-ID
\- Path
\- Proxy-Authenticate
\- Proxy-Authorization
\- Service-Route
\- WWW-Authenticate
##### 6.1.1.3.4 Applicability of SIP header fields on a non-roaming II-NNI
Void
#### 6.1.1.4 Notations of the codes
In the table 6.1 the status codes \"m\", \"o\", \"c\" and \"n/a\" have the
following meanings:
Table 6.3: Key to notation codes for SIP messages

#### 6.1.1.5 Modes of signalling
Overlap signalling may be used if agreement exists between operators to use
overlap and which method to be used, otherwise enbloc shall be used at the II-
NNI.
### 6.1.2 SDP protocol
#### 6.1.2.1 General
The functional entity closest to the border of an II-NNI (see reference model
in clause 5) shall provide the capabilities specified for that network element
in Annex A.3 of TS 24.229 [5].
### 6.1.3 Major capabilities
This subclause contains the major capabilities to be supported over the II-
NNI.
The table 6.1.3.1 specifies which capabilities are applicable for II-NNI. The
profile status codes within table 6.1.3.1 are defined in table 6.1.3.2.
For the \"Basic SIP\" capabilities part of table 6.1.3.1, the last column
\"Profile status over II-NNI\" specifies the general status of applicability
of the IETF RFC 3261 [13] main mechanisms described in the 2^nd^ column
\"Capability over the Ici\".
For the \"Extensions to basic SIP\" capabilities part, the last column
\"Profile status over II-NNI\" specifies the general status of applicability
of the RFC referenced in the 2^nd^ column \"Capability over the Ici\".
If necessary, the applicability of RFCs at the II-NNI level is further
detailed in the present Technical Specification.
The columns \"Reference item in TS 24.229 [5] for the profile status\" provide
informative references for comparison purposes into the UA and Proxy role
major capabilities tables in TS 24.229 [5], where the capabilities are defined
via additional references.

## 6.2 Control Plane Transport
### 6.2.1 General
The control plane transport of the II-NNI shall comply with subclause 4.2A of
TS 24.229 [5].
Support of SCTP as specified in IETF RFC 4168 [27] is optional for an IBCF
connected by II-NNI. Nevertheless this option is favourable if the operators
would like to improve reliability over the Ici.
# 7 User plane Interconnection
## 7.1 Media and Codec
For \"end-to-end\" media session involving the II-NNI, the SIP/SDP codec
negotiation procedure can be applied between IM CN subsystems using different
media codecs. It is possible that the end-to-end codec negotiation could fail
because no common codec could be supported by the UEs, in particular for voice
services.
To enhance interoperability, the IBCF, the MRFC, or other IMS network entities
can interfere with the end-to-end codec negotiation to offer additional
codec(s) available via transcoding, or to remove codecs. The IBCF can
configure an attached TrGW to transcode, and the MRFC can configure an
attached MRFP to transcode.
Codecs applicable at the NNI may be a subject of interworking agreements.
NOTE: Possible codecs which could be used at the II-NNI are described in TS
26.114 [11] and ETSI TS 181 005 [12].
However, to avoid that transcoding is performed several times, applicable
codecs at the NNI should be restricted as little as possible.
NOTE: Transcoding can be performed in an IMS network serving an SDP offerer or
in an IMS network serving an SDP answerer. To avoid that transcoding is
performed multiple times, inter-operator agreements can clarify if it is
preferred that IMS network serving an SDP offerer or IMS network serving an
SDP answerer modify an SDP offer to offer transcoding.
If the IBCF performs media transcoding control, it shall apply the related
procedures in TS 24.229 [5].
## 7.2 User Plane Transport
The user plane transport of the II-NNI may use the protocols listed in Table
7.2.1. The used protocols to transport media are negotiated by means of SDP
offer/answer.

# 8 Numbering, Naming and Addressing
## 8.1 Numbering, Naming and Addressing for SIP message
The following URI formats in SIP messages may be applied at the Ici as
standardized in TS 24.229 [5]:
ï‚Ÿ SIP URI defined in IETF RFC 3261 [13];
ï‚Ÿ tel URI defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14];
ï‚Ÿ IM URI defined in IETF RFC 3860 [15];
ï‚Ÿ PRES URI defined in IETF RFC 3859 [16].
According to TS 24.229 [5], the IBCF acting as an exit or entry point in the
IMS network supports these URI formats. These URI formats shall be supported
at the roaming II-NNI. The SIP URI format shall be supported at the non-
roaming II-NNI. The tel URI, IM URI and PRES URI formats may be supported at
the non-roaming II-NNI based on agreement between operators. Other URI formats
may be supported over the II-NNI depending on the operator agreements.
A global number as defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14] shall be used in a tel URI or
in the user portion of a SIP URI with the user=phone parameter when conveyed
via a non-roaming II-NNI in the Request-URI and in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field, except when agreement exists between the operators to also allow
other kinds of numbers.
NOTE 1: In a SIP URI the user portion of the Request-URI represents a
telephone number only if the SIP URI includes the user=phone parameter.
NOTE 2: Agreements can exist between operators to allow non-global number
(e.g. national service numbers. business trunking numbers, or private numbers)
at a non-roaming II-NNI. A SIP URI with such a number, a user=phone parameter,
and a phone-context parameter agreed between the operators can then be used.
NOTE 3: TS 24.229 [5] allows to restrict the number within a SIP Request-URI
with user=phone parameter at a non-roaming II-NNI to be a global number (i.e.
E.164 in international format) via an appropriate Application Server. Suitable
configuration by the operator is needed to achieve the desired modification of
the format.
NOTE 4: The allowed phone number formats in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field of a served user are configured by the operator. According to TS 23.003
[35], international E.164 format is used within a P-Asserted-Identity header
field.
NOTE 5: The global number format usage within a SIP Request-URI with the
user=phone parameter at a non-roaming II-NNI allows the terminating network to
find the called subscriber, via HSS interrogation, without any further number
translation and thus improves the success of the interconnection between IMS
operators.
The optional \"oli\" and \"cpc\" tel URI parameters associated with a tel URI
or a SIP URI with user=phone are described in TS 24.229 [5] and can be part of
the P-Asserted-Identity header field. Depending on operator agreements, those
URI parameters may be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI.
The \"sos\" SIP URI parameter associated with a URI in the Contact header
field of a REGISTER request or 200 OK response to REGISTER request is
described in TS 24.229 [5]. The \"sos\" SIP URI parameter shall be supported
at the roaming II-NNI.
The \"rn\" and \"npdi\" number portability parameters for the tel URI and the
SIP URI with user=phone as described within IETF RFC 4694 [75] can be part of
the Request-URI. Depending on operator agreements these parameters may be
exchanged over the non-roaming II-NNI.
NOTE 6: The \"rn\" and \"npdi\" parameters can be used to address the entry
point of the terminating operator depending on national rules for number
portability.
The \"isub\" tel URI parameter for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone
as described within IETF RFC 3966 [14] can be part of the Request-URI, To
header field and P-Asserted-Identity header field. Depending on operator
agreements, this URI parameter may be exchanged over the II-NNI.
## 8.2 Numbering, Naming and Addressing for SDP
The following URI format in the SDP exchange may be applied at the Ici as
standardized in TS 24.229 [5]:
ï‚Ÿ MSRP URI for a session of instant messages defined in IETF RFC 4975 [17].
This URI format shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI and may be supported
at the non-roaming II-NNI based on agreement between operators. Other URI
formats may be supported over the II-NNI depending on the operators\'
agreements.
# 9 IP Version
The network elements interconnected by means of the II-NNI may support IPv4
only, IPv6 only or both.
The support of one or both of the IP versions is an operator option and should
be based on bilateral agreement.
In case IPv4 and IPv6 networks are interconnected, the involved IBCFs and
TrGWs shall apply the IP version interworking procedures as indicated in TS
29.162 [8].
# 10 Security
The supported security mechanisms for IP signalling transport over II-NNI
interfaces are described in TS 33.210 [10].
# 11 Charging
The accounting information to be supported over the Ici is described in TS
32.260 [29]. It shall be configurable by the operator to use or not the
accounting mechanisms provided by the IBCF.
# 12 Supplementary services associated with the IMS multimedia telephony
communication service
## 12.1 General
In order to assure the end-to-end service interoperability through the Inter-
IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI), the associated supplementary
services of the multimedia telephony communication service may be supported on
the II-NNI between the two IMS networks.
The MMTel communication service is identified by means of the media feature
tag +g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel\". The
media feature tag can appear in the Contact header field, the Accept-Contact
header field and the P-Asserted-Service header field.
The support of each associated supplementary service is based on agreement
between operators.
If a supplementary service is supported, the related procedures from the TS
22.173 [30], the protocol details from the TS 24.173 [31] and specifications
referenced in the later specification shall be applied with the requirements
in the relevant subclause due to the crossing of the II-NNI.
## 12.2 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)
Service specific requirements in accordance with TS 24.616 [33] shall be
supported over the II-NNI.
The P-Asserted-Identity header field shall be supported at the II-NNI.
The INFO request and the 200 (OK) response to the INFO request containing the
\"application/vnd.etsi.mcid+xml\" MIME body defined in TS 24.616 [33] may be
supported at the II-NNI.
If a network terminating the dialog supports MCID, the terminating network
shall only deliver the MCID request in the \"application/vnd.etsi.mcid+xml\"
MIME body, as specified in the TS 24.616 [33], if an agreement to use the MCID
supplementary service according to the TS 24.616 [33] exists with the network
originating the dialog and if the INVITE request received by the terminating
network does not contain the information of the originating party.
NOTE: The IBCF and the AS in the terminating network interact to deliver the
MCID request only if an agreement to use the MCID supplementary service
exists, as specified in TS 24.616 [33] and TS 24.229 [5].
The originating network and the terminating network shall have a bilateral
agreement to support transportation of the minimum information specified in
subclause 4.5.2.5.0 of the TS 24.616 [33] between the networks.
## 12.3 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP) and Originating
Identification Restriction (OIR)
Service specific requirements in accordance with TS 24.607 [32] shall be
supported over the II-NNI.
The P-Asserted-Identity header field and the Privacy header field with values
\"id\", \"user\", \"none\", \"header\" and \"critical\" shall be supported at
the II-NNI.
NOTE 1: P-Asserted-Identity header fields are intended for end-to-end
operation. Removal of such header fields will impact the intended end-to-end
operation between the end users. Where a trust relationship exists on the
P-Asserted-Identity header field between the two IMS networks, this header
field cannot be altered when passing through the II-NNI according to TS 24.229
[5]. Where no trust relationship exists on the P-Asserted-Identity header
field between the two IMS networks, the P-Asserted-Identity header field will
be removed by the IBCF of the originating network prior passing through the
II-NNI according to the TS 24.229 [5]. The IBCF determines whether to remove
the P-Asserted-Identity header field according to procedures in TS 24.229 [5]
subclause 4.4.2 referencing IETF RFC 3325 [44].
The option tag \"from-change\" in the Supported header field should be
supported at II-NNI.
NOTE 2: The From header field cannot be altered when passing through the II-
NNI and will be passed transparently by the IBCF. If a request is received by
the terminating network and the application of the OIR service is required
with the value \"user\" for the Privacy header field then the From header
field will be anonymised in accordance with IETF RFC 3323 [34] by the
terminating network.
SIP based user configuration as described in TS 24.238 [100] shall be
supported at the roaming II-NNI.
## 12.4 Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP) and Terminating
Identification Restriction (TIR)
Service specific requirements in accordance with TS 24.608 [113] shall be
supported over the II-NNI.
The P-Asserted-Identity header field and the Privacy header field with values
\"id\", \"user\", \"none\", \"header\" and \"critical\" shall be supported at
the II-NNI.
NOTE: P-Asserted-Identity header fields are intended for end-to-end operation.
Removal of such header fields will impact the intended end-to-end operation
between the end users. Where a trust relationship exists on the P-Asserted-
Identity header field between the two IMS networks, this header field cannot
be altered when passing through the II-NNI according to TS 24.229 [5].
Where no trust relationship exists on the P-Asserted-Identity header field
between the two IMS networks, the P-Asserted-Identity header field will be
removed by the IBCF of the originating network prior passing through the II-
NNI according to the TS 24.229 [5]. The IBCF determines whether to remove the
P-Asserted-Identity header field according to procedures in TS 24.229 [5]
subclause 4.4.2 referencing IETF RFC 3325 [44].
The option tag \"from-change\" defined in IETF RFC 4916 [143], in the
Supported header field should be supported at II-NNI.
## 12.5 Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR)
Service specific requirements in accordance with TS 24.611 [114] shall be
supported over the II-NNI.

supported at the roaming II-NNI.
## 12.6 Communication DIVersion (CDIV)
Service specific requirements in accordance with TS 24.604 [117] shall be
supported over the II-NNI.
NOTE 1: The support of the Diversion header field not adopted in TS 24.604
[117] requires bilateral agreement between the operators.
Procedures as described in subclause 12.21.2 are used to provide
announcements.
The Privacy header field with a priv-value set to \"history\" included in the
hi-targeted-to-uri or as a standalone header field shall be supported at the
II-NNI.
The History-Info header field as described by TS 24.604 [117] and a \"cause\"
SIP URI parameter with cause values as defined by the IETF RFC 4458 [58] shall
be supported over the II-NNI.
NOTE 2: The networks can have an internal limit in the number of allowed
diversions, as described in TS 24.604 [117], section 4.5.2.6.1. To ensure
efficiency of this control operators can indicate in their bilateral
agreements their own number of allowed communication diversions, the parameter
that is used for counting, and the network behavior when the internal limit is
reached.
The response code 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded) shall be supported at the II-
NNI.
The MESSAGE request procedure for indication of communication diversion to the
diverting user as specified in TS 24.604 [117] and TS 24.229 [5] should be

###### ## Annex A (informative): Summary of SIP header fields
A summary of the SIP header fields to be used in case of interconnection by
using II-NNI is proposed in Table A.1.
The starting point is the sending behaviour described for proxy and UA roles
in Annex A of TS 24.229 [5]. In case of misalignment between Table A.1 and the
behaviour described in TS 24.229 [5], the behaviour in TS 24.229 [5] has the
precedence. In case a header field is not described in Table A.1 and it is
described in TS 24.229 [5], the description in TS 24.229 [5] is applicable
over II-NNI.
The notation of the codes used for the SIP headers listed in table A.1 has a
different meaning to the one proposed for the SIP messages. The definition of
these terms is provided in table A.2.

Table A.2: Key to notation codes for SIP header fields
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | Notation code | Meaning | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | m | The SIP header field is applicable at II-NNI. | | | | | | Supporting a SIP header field at the II-NNI means | | | that this header field is passed through the IBCF. | | | It does not imply that network elements inside the | | | serving and served networks or user equipment | | | connected to these networks shall support this | | | header field, where TS 24.229 [5] is applied. If | | | specified in TS 24.229, the IBCF modifies the SIP | | | header field. | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | o | The applicability of SIP header field at II-NNI | | | depends on bilateral agreement between the | | | operators. | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | n/a | It is impossible to use the SIP header field at the | | | II-NNI. This header field could be discarded by the | | | IBCF. | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
