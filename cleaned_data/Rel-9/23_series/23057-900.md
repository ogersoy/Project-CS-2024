# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the stage 2 and stage 3 description of the Mobile
Execution Environment (MExE). Stage 2 identifies the functional capabilities
and information flows needed to support the service described in stage 1.
The present document includes information applicable to network operators,
service providers and terminal, switch and database manufacturers.
The present document contains the core functions for a Mobile Execution
Environment (MExE) which are sufficient to provide a complete service.
MExE uses a number of technologies to realise the requirements of the stage 1
description (3GPP TS 22.057). The present document describes how the service
requirements are realised with the selected technologies. The TS is devised
into clauses each covering the aspects relating to particular MExE
technologies, it is intended that this specification will evolve along with
the MExE technologies. A generic clause of the specification covers areas of
MExE common to all technologies.
Implementation of this specification outside the UE (User Equipment) is
outside the scope of this specification.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**administrator:** administrator of the MExE device is the entity that has the
control of the third party trusted domain, and all resources associated with
the domain
NOTE 1: The administrator of the MExE device could be the user, the operator,
the manufacturer, the service provider, or a third party as designated by the
owner of the MExE device.
**best effort QoS (Quality of Service):** best effort QoS refers to the lowest
of all QoS traffic classes
NOTE 2: If the guaranteed QoS cannot be delivered, the bearer network delivers
the QoS which can also be called best effort QoS [28].
**certificate:** entity that contains the issuer\'s public key, identification
of the issuer, identification of the signer, and possibly other relevant
information
NOTE 3: Also, a certificate contains a signed hash of the contents. The signer
can be a 3rd. party other than the issuer.
**delivered QoS:** actual QoS parameter values with which the content was
delivered over the lifetime of a QoS session [28].
**End Entity:** user of PKI certificates and/or end user system that is the
subject of a certificate.
**fine grain:** refers to the capabilities of the Java security system to
allow applications, sections of code or Java classes to be assigned
permissions to perform a specific set of privileged operations
NOTE 4: The smallest programming element that can be given permission
attributes is a Java class [19].
**key pair:** key pairs are matching private and public keys
NOTE 5: If a block of data is encrypted using the private key, the public key
from the pair can be used to decrypt it. The private key is never divulged to
any other party, but the public key is available, e.g. in a certificate.
**Operator:** term operator as used in this specification refers to the term
Home Environment, defined as \"Home Environment: The home environment is
responsible for enabling a user to obtain UMTS services in a consistent manner
regardless of the user\'s location or terminal used (within the limitations of
the serving network and current terminal)\" in [44].
**negotiated QoS:** response to a QoS request, the network shall negotiate
each QoS attribute to a level that is in accordance with the available network
resources
NOTE 6: After QoS negotiation, the bearer network shall always attempt to
provide adequate resources to support all of the negotiated QoS profiles [31].
**personal certificate:** certificate loaded by the user or a user application
which is limited to the application that it is intended for, and is not a MExE
Certificate
NOTE 7: E.g. an e-mail application could load certificates for its usage.
Personal certificates are out of scope for MExE.
**phonebook:** dataset of personal or entity attributes
NOTE 8: The simplest form is a set of name-number pairs as defined by GSM
SIMs. A phonebook may also be supported on a (U)SIM.
**Mobile Execution Environment (MExE):** is defined in detail in the present
document, but the scope of MExE does not include the operating system, or the
manufacturer\'s execution environment
**MExE API:** consists of interfaces present in the MExE device and exposed to
MExE executables
NOTE 9: The APIs which are outside of the scope of this specification, are not
part of MExE API.
**MExE certificate:** used in the realisation of MExE security domains
NOTE 10: A MExE Certificate can be used to verify downloaded MExE executables.
Use of the word \"certificate\" in this document implies a MExE certificate.
Other varieties of certificate will be explicitly qualified as a e.g.
\"Personal Certificate\".
**MExE device:** UE (User Equipment) that supports MExE functionality in the
ME (Mobile Equipment)
NOTE 11: The implementation of MExE shall be in the same physical device as
the MT (Mobile Termination). Implementation of MExE functionality in the TE
(Terminal Equipment) outside of the physical device containing the MT (Mobile
Termination) is for further study.
**MExE executable:** is one or more applet, application, or content, which
conforms to the MExE specification and may execute on any MExE device,
conforming to the appropriate classmark
**MExE Java VM:** this is a standard Java virtual machine used to execute MExE
Java applets and applications
**MExE native library:** this is a downloaded native library that can be
accessed by MExE executables
**MExE Server:** node supporting MExE services in the MExE service environment
NOTE 12: The MExE server may be a web or WAP server providing services for
users to download MExE executables. MExE server is not necessarily a special
network element but may utilize the normal Internet service environment.
**MExE-(U)SIM:** (U)SIM that is capable of storing a security certificate that
is accessible using standard mechanisms
**MIDP application:** MIDP application, or \"MIDlet\", is one that uses only
the APIs defined by the MIDP and CLDC specifications.
**MIDlet suite:** collection of MIDP Applications, or MIDlets packaged
together and share resources within the context of a single Java Virtual
Machine
**owner:** owner of the MExE device
NOTE 13: An owner could be a user, operator (e.g. where the MExE device is
obtained as part of a subscription and the cost of the MExE device is
subsidised), service provider, or a third party (e.g. the MExE device is owned
by the user\'s company and this company wishes to control how the MExE device
is used)
**power up event:** abstract event that occurs when the MExE device is cold
started (i.e. switched on)
**QoS session:** Lifetime of PDP context, the period between the opening and
closing of a network connection whose characteristics are defined by a QoS
profile
NOTE 14: Multiple QoS sessions may exist, each with a different QoS profile
[28].
**QoS profile:** comprises of a number of QoS parameters
NOTE 15: A QoS profile is associated with each QoS session. The QoS profile
defines the performance expectations placed on the bearer network [28].
**requested QoS:** QoS profile is requested at the beginning of a QoS session
NOTE 16: QoS modification requests are also possible during the lifetime of a
QoS session [28] and [31].
**sandbox:** sandbox is a safe area to run Java code. Untrusted Java code
executing in a sandbox has access to only certain resources [18].
**service:** service (which may consist of an application or applet, and its
related content) is a set of functions offered to a user by an organisation,
and may be performed on the MExE device and/or remotely
**service name:** identifier associated with a service, which could be a
string, a fully qualified Java class name, a unique URI or other identifier
**session:** period between the launching of a MExE executable and its
execution termination
NOTE 17: A WAP-session is established between the mobile and the WAP Gateway.
The duration of a WAP-session can range from a second to years. The WAP-
session can be associated with a particular subscription in the WAP Gateway.

using a private key
NOTE 18: If the signature can be decrypted using the public key, then the
signature is valid.
**signed JAR file:** archives of Java classes or data that contain signatures
that also include a way to identify the signer in the manifest [42] (the
Manifest contains a file which has attributes defined in it)
**subscribed QoS:** network will not grant a QoS greater than that subscribed
NOTE 19: The QoS profile subscription parameters are held in the HLR. An end
user may have several QoS subscriptions. For security and the prevention of
damage to the network, the end user cannot directly modify the QoS
subscription profile data [31].
**user:** user of the MExE device
**valid (U)SIM application:** identification by the MExE ME that a valid SIM
card, or USIM application on the UICC, has been detected (e.g. through
insertion of (U)SIM card, power up of MExE device etc.)
NOTE 20: Whenever this specification refers to valid (U)SIM, it implies a
valid SIM card or USIM application on the UICC.
Further definitions specific to MExE are given in TS 22.057 [2].

# 4 MExE basic principles
## 4.1 Generic MExE aspects
Support of at least one MExE classmark is mandatory. A MExE device may also
include optional support for applications from any other MExE classmark (refer
to clause 4.3 \"Multiple Classmark support\").
This clause defines the common aspects of all MExE compliant devices,
independent of MExE technology.
Considering the wide and diverse range of current and future technology and
devices that (will) use wireless communication and provide services based
thereon a one-size-fits-all approach is unrealistic. Instead the present
document categorises devices by giving them different MExE classmarks. In this
specification the following MExE classmarks are defined:
\- MExE classmark 1 - based on WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) [6] \-
requires limited input and output facilities (e.g. as simple as a 3 lines by
15 characters display and a numeric keypad) on the client side, and is
designed to provide quick and cheap information access even over narrow and
slow data connections.
\- MExE classmark 2 - based on PersonalJava [3] - provides and utilises a run-
time system requiring more processing, storage, display and network resources,
but supports more powerful applications and more flexible MMIs.
\- MExE classmark 3 -- based on J2ME CLDC and MIDP environment [34] and [35]
-- supports Java applications running on resource-constrained devices.
\- MExE classmark 4 -- based on Common Language Infrastructure [50] Compact
Profile -- supports CLI based applications running on a broad range of
connected devices.
Content negotiation allows for flexible choice of formats available from a
server or adaptation of a service to the actual classmark of a specific client
device.
Bi-directional capability negotiation between the MExE Service Environment and
MExE device (including MExE classmark), supports the transfer of capabilities
between the client and the server.
## 4.2 High level architecture
The following architectural model shows an example of how standardised
transport mechanisms are used to transfer MExE services between the MExE
device and the MExE service environment, or to support the interaction between
two MExE devices executing a MExE service.
The MExE service environment could, as shown in figure 1 \"Generic MExE
architecture\", consist of several service nodes each providing MExE services
that can be transferred to the MExE device using mechanisms such as (but not
limited to) fixed/mobile/cordless network protocols, Bluetooth, infrared,
serial links, wireless optimised protocols, standard Internet protocols. These
service nodes may exist in the circuit switched domain, packet switched
domain, IP multimedia core network subsystem or in the internet space (e.g.
SMS service centres, multimedia messaging servers, internet servers etc.). The
MExE service environment may also include a proxy server to translate content
defined in standard Internet protocols into their wireless optimised
derivatives.
For the versatile support of MExE services, the wireless network shall provide
the MExE device with access to a range of bearer services on the radio
interface to support application control and transfer from the MExE service
environment. As MExE also applies to fixed and cordless environments, MExE
device may also access MExE services via non‑wireless access mechanisms.
Figure 1: Generic MExE architecture
## 4.3 Multiple classmark support
Support of multiple MExE classmarks on a MExE device is optional.
A given MExE Classmark identifies support by a MExE device for a defined level
of MExE functionality as defined by that classmark. Support of MExE classmarks
by a MExE device shall enable flexible support of MExE functionality. A MExE
device may support any multiple combinations of MExE classmarks.
The support of any other functionality by a MExE device is also possible, and
is out of scope of this specification.
NOTE: Some implementation issues may arise from the multiple support of
classmarks on a device, e.g.:
1) In conforming to all of the requirements, how are mandatory requirements in
one classmark compatible with optional requirements for another?
2) With KJava and pJava on one device, MIDP can be on top of a JavaVM. Which
of the classmarks will it be then? In conforming with both Classmark 2 and 3
requirements, are 2 VMs required in one device?
### 4.3.1 Classmark 1 service support in non-Classmark 1 MExE devices
Support of Classmark 1 executables in non-classmark 1 MExE devices is
optional.
To allow access to services designed for MExE Classmark 1 devices, MExE
devices other than Classmark 1 will need to support full or a subset of WAP
protocol as identified below. Due to the fast evolution of new technologies,
support of WAP in Classmarks other than Classmark 1 is not mandated by MExE
specification. However WAP is a possibility for the integrity of service
provisioning as well as quick access to information by feature rich devices
(e.g. Java devices).
If Classmark 1 services are supported by non-Classmark 1 devices, Classmark 1
services shall execute in the same manner as they execute in a MExE Classmark
1 device. For that purpose, a MExE non-Classmark 1 device shall comply with
data profile class (Class C) of WAP Class Conformance Requirement
Specification [6].
NOTE: A more specific reference to the WAP Class Conformance Requirement
Specification shall be supplied when available.
### 4.3.2 Classmark 2 service support in non-Classmark 2 MExE devices
Support of Classmark 2 executables in non-classmark 2 MExE devices is
optional.
If Classmark 2 services are supported by non-Classmark 2 devices, Classmark 2
services shall execute in the same manner as they execute in a MExE Classmark
2 device.
### 4.3.3 Classmark 3 service support in non-Classmark 3 MExE devices
Support of Classmark 3 executables in non-classmark 3 MExE devices is
optional.
If Classmark 3 services are supported by non-Classmark 3 devices, Classmark 3
services shall execute in the same manner as they execute in a MExE Classmark
3 device.
### 4.3.4 Classmark 4 service support in non-Classmark 4 MExE devices
Support of Classmark 4 executables in non-classmark 4 MExE devices is
optional. If Classmark 4 services are supported by non-Classmark 4 devices,
Classmark 4 services shall execute in the same manner as they execute in a
MExE Classmark 4 device.
# 5 Generic MExE functions (excluding security)
## 5.1 User profile
Support of the user profile is optional.
NOTE: The user profile is not yet specified in an interoperable way. Support
of the user profile will be defined when it has been fully specified in a
fully interoperable way.
The user profile (which may consist of sub user profiles for a user) contains
the characterisation of the MExE device as defined by the user and service
provider. Further, it is also possible for multiple users of a MExE device to
each have their own user profiles. The user profile is not unique to the MExE
device, and this clause identifies the usage and content of the user profile
from a MExE perspective only, and does not identify the generic support of
user profiles in general. Refer to TS 22.101 [14] for further details on the
user profile.
### 5.1.1 Location of, access to, and security of, the user profile
As multiple user profiles may be defined, the user is able to set up or
receive calls/connections associated with different user profiles
simultaneously by securely activating a user profile (with each user profile
being associated with at least one unique identifier). Refer to table 5
\"Security domains and actions\" in the Security clause 6.3 \"MExE executable
permissions\" for further details on user profile activation.
The user\'s characterisation of the MExE device in the user profile may be
modified at any time by the user and the service provider, and changes
affected at the earliest possible opportunity.
The security clause shall apply to all user profiles at all times, whether
activated or not
The user profile shall be securely managed by the MExE device, and stored in a
secure area of the MExE device (either (U)SIM or ME). The service provider may
also retain the user profile in the network for service optimisation. User
private data in the user profile may also be stored in the network, however
only with the user permission.
The support of more than one user profile is not mandatory.
### 5.1.2 Support of the user profile
The user profile acts as a repository (which is always available in the MExE
device) defining the MExE device behaviour.
MExE preferences and personalisation are supported in the user profile (e.g.
UMTS portability and support of VHE defined in [12] and other 22-series
specifications), which in turn is based on the Composite Capability/Preference
Profile (CC/PP) specification from W3C [16].
MExE preferences and personalisation may not only be recorded directly in the
user profile as supported by CC/PP (the direct referencing mechanism), but may
also be retrieved from a URL (the indirect referencing mechanism) [22].
Generally, the user profile\'s CC/PP framework provides the mechanism for the
standardised format of preferences, and its use of Resource Description
Framework (RDF) permits the interoperable encoding of MExE preferences and
personalisation. Future extensions will be supported by the W3C mechanism,
allowing for evolution and development of MExE preferences and
personalisation.
The set of preferences which are supported in the user profile consists of the
following:
\- user interface personalisation;
\- the user\'s personalisation of the user interface;
\- service personalisation and management;
\- the user\'s generic service management information.
The coding and presentation of the above characteristics in the user profile
is defined by the Composite Capability/Preference Profile (CC/PP)
specification from W3C [16], and referenced by the MExE capability negotiation
in clause 5.2 \"Capability and content negotiation\".
The following user preference information is supported by UAProf [17]. A MExE
device shall support the following property in table 1 \"Mandatory UAProf
properties\" of the UAProf schema for user preference information.
Table 1: Mandatory UAProf properties
* * *
Attribute Description Resolution\ Type Sample Values Rule
AcceptDownloadableSoftware Indicates the user\'s preference on whether to
accept downloadable software Locked Boolean \"Yes\", \"No\"
* * *
It is recommended that a MExE device supports the following UAProf properties
in table 2 \"Recommended UAProf properties\":
Table 2: Recommended UAProf properties
* * *
Attribute Description Resolution\ Type Sample Rule
CcppAccept-Language User\'s preference for document language. Property value
is a list of natural languages, where each item in the list is the name of a
language as defined by RFC 1766 [46]. Append Literal (Bag) \"zh-CN\", \"en
fr\"
PreferenceForFrames User\'s preference for displaying frames Locked Boolean
\"Yes\", \"No\"
WapPushMsgPriority User\'s settings for WAP Push message priorities Locked
Literal \"critical\", \"low\", \"none\"
* * *
Also, there is in UAProf [17] support for indicating MExE device\'s
capabilities related to UI features, e.g. capability for displaying images or
frames, as well as capability information about input and output methods.
### 5.1.3 User interface personalisation
Support of user interface personalisation as detailed in this clause is
optional.
The MExE device interface consists of the buttons, menus, screens and MMI as
designed and provided by the MExE device manufacturer; the nature of this MExE
device interface is naturally evolving, MExE device specific and proprietary
to the individual manufacturers of the industry. This interface is the one
normally seen by the user in normal operation of his MExE device. This
specification does not place any requirements or limitations on the individual
manufacturers\' MExE device interface.
The MExE MMI, in turn, is the interface available to the user to support MExE
services and functionality on the MExE device. The nature of the MExE MMI
interface, like the normal MExE device interface described above, is not
standardised in any way, to allow for manufacturer innovation, cater for
evolving market needs, and permit manufacturer differentiation. The MExE MMI,
depending on different manufacturer implementations, may consist of the normal
MExE device interface, the normal MExE device interface with modifications, a
different interface to the normal MExE device interface, or some combinations
thereof etc. MExE services operate within, and using the capabilities of, the
MExE MMI.
User interface personalisation consists of two parts. The first part refers to
the user\'s ability to request, and verify, the preferred changes to the user
interface; thus the user\'s preferences, as supported by the specific MExE
device, require to be recorded. The second part refers to the MExE device\'s
support of the user\'s preferences for the interface, within the capabilities
of an MExE device. By defining the user interface personalisation to consist
of two stages, the preferences which have been recorded by the user may be
transferred (as part of the user profile, e.g. CcppAccept-Language and/or
PreferenceForFrames), and thereby provide portability of the user\'s
preferences.
#### 5.1.3.1 MExE user interface personalisation
Personalisation of the user interface offers the MExE Service Environment and
or the user, the ability to inform the MExE device of the desired extent of
personalisation. All support of the user interface personalisation is
optional, not mandatory on any class of MExE device, and subject to the
capabilities of the MExE device. Depending on the capability of the MExE
device, the personalisation may be fully supported, partially supported,
interpreted or ignored.
Personalisation of the user interface is not restricted to modifying the
appearance of the MMI, but also the modification of MMI parameters (e.g.
programming of the voicemail number). The user\'s personalisation of the
interface is retained as part of the user profile.
#### 5.1.3.2 Support of MExE user interface personalisation
MExE user interface personalisation is supported via the preferences in the
user profile, which in turn is based on the Composite Capability/Preference
Profile (CC/PP) specification from W3C [16].
User interface personalisation may not only be reported in the CC/PP request
to the server (the direct referencing mechanism), but indeed the client may
point to a URL (the indirect referencing mechanism) from where the user
interface personalisation preferences may be retrieved.
Generally, the user profile\'s CC/PP framework provides the mechanism for the
standardised format of preferences, and its use of Resource Description
Framework (RDF) permits the interoperable encoding of user interface
personalisation. Future extensions will be supported by the W3C mechanism,
allowing for evolution and development of MExE user interface personalisation.
### 5.1.4 Virtual home environment
Virtual Home Environment (VHE) (see [11] and [12]) is defined as a concept for
personalised service portability across network boundaries and between
terminals. MExE is identified by VHE as one of the mechanisms which may be
used to support VHE.
The characteristics of the VHE (to reflect any user or home environment
modification of the user\'s VHE) shall be stored as part of the user profile.
## 5.2 Capability and content negotiation
Support of capability negotiation for all MExE devices is mandatory, while
support of content negotiation is optional.
Interaction between the MExE device and the MSE for WWW/WAP browsing and
service discovery shall be supported by the use of the hypertext transfer
protocol HTTP/1.1 [9], or an HTTP/1.1 derived protocol (e.g. WSP as defined in
Wireless Application Protocol [6]). Communication between the MExE device and
the MSE supports:
\- Capability negotiation
The MExE device connects to the MSE by using HTTP/1.1 or an HTTP/1.1 derived
protocol. Capability negotiation between the MExE device and the MSE only
takes place for the first time after the MExE device has connected to the MSE,
and the MSE is informed about the MExE device. Without this first initial
contact from the MExE device, the MSE has no knowledge of the MExE device.
After the first initial contact the MSE may connect to the MExE device by
using HTTP/1.1 or an HTTP/1.1 derived protocol.
Capability negotiation represents the mechanism by which the MExE device and
the MSE interact to inform each other of the specific mechanisms, capabilities
and support which each is able to provide or support within the scope of a
MExE service interaction. The capability negotiation normally takes place
prior to any content transfer between the two entities.
Capability negotiation is used by the MExE device to inform the MSE of its
capabilities. The MExE device may be informed by the MSE of its use of the
MExE device\'s capabilities. The MExE device may also spontaneously inform the
MSE of its capabilities (i.e. following a change in MExE support, such as
removal of MExE device from a docking station with its keyboard, mouse and
monitor). A subset of characteristics which may be transferred between the
MExE device and the MSE during the capability negotiation are identified in
clause 5.2.1 \"Capability negotiation characteristics\".
\- Content negotiation
Content negotiation represents the means by which the MExE device and the MSE
inform each other of the requested and available form of content. If needed,
the content negotiation may take place following capability negotiation
between the two. The methods for content negotiation are the basic HTTP/1.1.
or WSP methods explained in [9] and [6].
Content negotiation is used to select the best representation of an entity
when there are multiple representations of the entity available from the MSE.
The entity (e.g. a service, an image, etc) is located behind a URI, and the
application in the MExE device connects to the URI by using HTTP/1.1 or an
HTTP/1.1 derived protocol. The best representation of an entity can be decided
by the server (server-driven negotiation) or by the client application (agent-
driven negotiation).
Both the capability and the content negotiation has the same purpose: to
optimise the content according to client\'s capabilities. The term \"content
negotiation\" has been used e.g. in the HTTP specification and the HTTP/1.1.
and the WSP contain headers to perform the content negotiation. However, the
capability negotiation in MExE aims at extending the basic HTTP and WSP
methods for content negotiation by using CC/PP framework.
The content negotiation transferred between the MExE device and the MSE is
identified in clause 5.2.3 \"Client content capability report\" onwards.
### 5.2.1 User profile and capability negotiation relationship
The user profile contains the user\'s preferences. Support of the user\'s
preferences will depend on the capabilities of the MExE device. If the
capabilities change, then the degree of support of the user\'s preferences may
change too.
The capability negotiation between the MExE device and the MSE, as shown in
figure 2 \"Model of user profile and capability relationship\", contains those
user preferences which the MExE device is able to support.
In this way the MSE will serve a MExE device with the lowest common
denominator of the users preferences, the MExE device capabilities and the
provided service characteristics and support the user\'s preferences to the
maximum degree.
**Figure 2: Model of user profile and capability relationship**
### 5.2.2 Capability negotiation characteristics
The method for capability negotiation is based on the Composite Capability/
Preferences Profiles (CC/PP) specification made by W3C, [16]. The properties
and the actual schema, table 3\"UAProf properties supported by MExE\", is
based on the WAP UAProf specification [17]. The CC/PP framework is intended to
provide an efficient mechanism for enabling enhanced content and service
negotiation through a standardised format for user agent profiles. The use of
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [37] in CC/PP allows for interoperable
encoding of the profile metadata in XML[36] and supports multiple vocabularies
to provide for future extensibility. The WAP UAProf is based on the CC/PP
framework. The purpose of the UAProf outlined in this document is to specify:
\- an RDF based schema and vocabulary for CC/PP in the context of the WAP
UAProf that includes the class definitions and semantics of attributes
described in a user agent profile, and
\- guidelines for schema extensibility to support a composite profile that
enables future additions to the vocabulary and schema.
Not all capabilities have to be reported in the request to the server but
instead, the client may point to URL(s) where the server may fetch the
properties. An MSE may, or may not, use the client capability information.
The generic set of capabilities which may be negotiated between the client and
the server consists of the subsequently identified properties in the UAProf
schema, [17].
A MExE device shall support the properties in the UAProf schema for capability
negotiation defined in table 3 \"UAProf properties supported by MExE\" as
\"mandated properties\".
It is recommended that MExE device supports the properties defined in the
table 3\"UAProf properties supported by MExE\" as \"recommended properties\".
It is not required that a MExE device shall send all the \"recommended
properties\", when sending a request, however it should be possible for the
MExE device to send one or more of the \"recommended properties\", with user
permission.
The mandatory and recommended properties in table 3\"UAProf properties
supported by MExE\" are specified in WAP UAProf [17].
Support of the properties of the UAProf schema in this specification shall not
be limited to those listed in table 3 \"UAProf properties supported by MExE\".
A MExE device may support any other properties from WAP UAProf specification
[17].

Generally, the combination of user profile and MExE device logic will
determine the information sent in the capability negotiation from the MExE
device to the MExE Service Environment. As an example, for the support of
VideoInputEncoder information the user\'s profile controls if and when
VideoInputEncoder information may be sent to the MExE Service Environment
(e.g. never sent, always sent, only after user confirmation).
The capability negotiation process shall be used by the client to permit
transfer of capabilities from the client to the server. By transferring its
capabilities, the client will support efficient use of resources both over the
radio interface as well as in the client or server. Capability negotiation
shall be performed prior to transfer over the radio interface to verify as far
as possible the ability of the client to support any services to be
downloaded.
In order to transfer the capability information between the MExE device and
the MSE, CC/PP method is used with the schema defined in the WAP UAProf
working group.
### 5.2.3 Client content capability report
The client may perform content negotiation capabilities to the server by using
appropriate HTTP/1.1 or WSP request headers. The following methods are
available for content negotiation:
\- Client software (product): User-Agent header;
\- MIME media types: Accept header;
\- Character set: Accept-Charset header;
\- Content encoding: Accept-Encoding header;
\- Language: Accept-Language header.
There is no need for MExE to specify any tokens for content negotiation, as
these headers are already defined in HTTP and WSP. The formats for these
headers are specified in [9] and [6].
### 5.2.4 Server role in capability negotiation
The server may request the capabilities of a client whenever required, and
shall enquire of the client\'s capabilities prior to making each transaction
resulting in a set of transfers to the client; the characteristics which may
be reported in the client capability report are identified in the list above.
In server-driven negotiation the server signals to the client that the
response entity was selected from a set of available representation.
### 5.2.5 Client-driven negotiation
If the server cannot specify an optimal version for the client basing on the
CC/PP sent over to the server, the server may also indicate to client which
type of versions are available and let the client make the decision. This
method is already available in HTTP1.1. In client-driven negotiation the
client selects the best representation after having received an initial
response from the server.
## 5.3 Provisioning and management of services
Support of management of services as detailed in this clause is mandatory.
The MExE device shall be capable of supporting services in a standard (WAP or
Java) execution environment independently of the MExE device manufacturer.
Service provisioning provides a standardised method for a MExE device to
discover and install services. It includes download and installation of the
service\'s client application. Once discovered and delivered, services are
managed by the user, under the principles stated in 3GPP TS 23.227 [48].
Management of services provides the user with the capability to:
\- control the transfer of services;
\- install and configure services;
\- control the execution of services;
\- terminate or suspend executing services;
\- delete services;
on his MExE device.
### 5.3.1 Service discovery
A MExE user is able to request (or be informed about) the range of MExE
services available from the MExE server to which it is connected. To be able
to interactively discover the services via standard mechanisms such as WSP or
HTTP, a MExE device should feature a browser which is a common tool for
service discovery. The request, and transfer of information on MExE services
from the MExE server is supported by the use of the capability negotiation
mechanism.
All services available in the network continue to be available to the user, in
addition to MExE services.
An example of an alternative means of receiving information on MExE services,
is the use of an application on the MExE device which the user interrogates to
provide services information (from various sources), and which in turn then
obtains such information and presents it to the user. Such an example is not
subject to standardisation.
### 5.3.2 Service transfer
The standardisation of the transferral of MExE services to a MExE device is
outside the scope of this specification.
Examples of possible ways of supporting service transfer are from a MExE
server or from another user MExE device (e.g. using wireless and standard
protocols and mechanisms such as HTTP, FTP, proprietary protocols and
mechanisms, via a serial link, infrared, Bluetooth data exchange, etc.).
The above examples are not exhaustive. Regardless of the means of transfer,
all services are required to conform with the security requirements in clause
8 \"Security\".
### 5.3.3 Service installation and configuration
Installation of a service may result in changes to the MExE device user
interface using icons, browsers or menus as applicable depending on the
capability of the MExE device to support them. The name of the installed
service may be contained in the package in which it was received (i.e. a JAR
file or script), assigned by the user during configuration, or some other
means. After installation, the service may be configured. Configuration of the
service includes setting the user permissions that apply to the service (e.g.
blanket permission for call origination). Configuration may be performed
automatically based on the user profile.
The user controls whether a service transferred to the MExE device is
automatically configured and installed in the MExE device. If automatic
configuration and/or installation is enabled, the user is notified once it is
completed. In the event that there is no authorisation for the automatic
installation and/or configuration of a transferred service, the user is
notified.
Subsequent user modification of a service\'s configuration (e.g. by
modification of user profile settings) shall take effect at the earliest
possible opportunity thereafter.
### 5.3.4 Service management
The MExE device shall support the ability to determine which services are
transferred to, resident, installed or executing on the MExE device. The
information relating to the services shall include the name as a minimum and
the version number if available.
The user controls which services are permitted or denied to be transferred,
resident, installed, configured or executing on the MExE device via the user
profile, e.g. AcceptDownloadableSoftware. The user profile permits
characteristics such as security level, identification of specific services
etc. to manage services on the MExE device.
### 5.3.5 Service termination
A MExE device shall support the termination of services.
A service may terminate by itself, or be terminated by the provider of the
service or by the user. The user is in charge of the service, except when the
service provider may appropriately control the service as part of user
support.
The mechanism for terminating a service is out of scope of standardisation and
shall be provided on a service by service basis by the provider of the
service.
### 5.3.6 Service deletion
A MExE device shall support the deletion of services.
A service may be deleted (i.e. removed) from the MExE device with the
authorisation of the user. The deletion may be initiated by the authoriser of
the service or by the user.
## 5.4 User control of application connections
Support of the user control of application connections is mandatory and shall
follow the principles and requirements stated in 3GPP TS 23.227 [48].
This clause addresses the generic aspects of connection control supported by
both WAP and Java classmark MExE devices.
In order to allow the user to maintain control over connections on his MExE
device and the ability to initiate connections, the user shall be able to
terminate or suspend any active connection associated with an application in
the MExE environment of the MExE device. The user shall be able to obtain
information about all connections associated with applications on the MExE
device (e.g. requesting information, being informed by the MExE device etc.).
Behaviour of the application following termination or suspension of its
connection is undefined.
The specific support of connection control by WAP classmark MExE devices is
identified in subsequent clause 7.3.1 \"Call control\", the security aspects
of connection control are identified in clause 8 \"Security\", and the user
control of connection authorisation is identified in clause 5.1 \"User
profile\".
### 5.4.1 Journaling of network events
Support of the journaling of network events is mandatory.
To support the user in monitoring (potentially chargeable) network events
initiated by services in the MExE environment, the MExE device shall maintain
a record of network events initiated by MExE executables on the MExE device.
Network events for the purposes of journaling, are defined as events which
result in the origination of connections by a service in the MExE environment
of the MExE device. Examples of such events (any (potentially chargeable)
network event initiated by services in the MExE environment) are:
\- Sending an SMS message;
\- Sending an USSD message;
\- Initiating a circuit switched connection;
\- Initiating a packet switched connection;
\- Sending data over a packet switched connection.
The length, format and longevity of the journal is undefined and subject to
manufacturers\' discretion.
The journal shall be managed by the MExE device, and not be accessible by MExE
executables.
### 5.4.2 User notification
Support of user notification is optional.
It is recommended that the MExE device should clearly display an indicator
whenever network activity is in progress.
Ideally, this would be an icon on the phone\'s screen which is displayed
whenever the MExE device is sending/receiving SMS, USSD, data call, voice
call, or packets.
However, there are certain cases when this indicator need not be displayed,
especially if it is obvious by some other means that the MExE device is
performing network actions.
## 5.5 Quality of service
Support of Quality of Service is optional.
Quality of Service (QoS) [28] is seen by the end user as a measure of the
amount of network resources given to an application by the underlying network.
The network may employ a number of QoS mechanisms, but the end user / MExE
executable is not involved in these. The end user / MExE executable requires
an interface into the network QoS through a visible set of standard
parameters.
A QoS aware MExE executable may request a QoS from the network at the
beginning of a QoS session. Changes in the level of QoS provided shall be
notified to the end user / MExE executable. An end user may request a change
in the QoS through the MExE device MMI. A MExE executable may have several QoS
streams open simultaneously.
When the MExE execution environment supports QoS, the MExE executable shall be
able to dynamically request a change in the level of QoS at connection setup
request or subsequently during the connection. The end user / MExE executable
may receive a rejection to a QoS modification request, upon which the end user
/ MExE executable must be notified.
The end user\'s service level QoS subscription parameters are stored in the
network, they identify the maximum permissible QoS that a user may negotiate
with the network. Several QoS subscriptions may be possible for one user. MExE
is neither aware nor able to determine or modify the end user\'s service level
QoS subscriptions.
Clause 9 \"Quality of Service\" defines the necessary functions for a MExE
device to accommodate QoS management and provisioning. QoS management may be
available directly to the MExE executables themselves, or to the MExE
environment.
### 5.5.1 Introduction
Support of quality of service for MExE devices supporting bearers defined by
QoS as defined in this clause is optional.
QoS aware MExE executables may be executing on the MExE device. To ensure
correct operation with the QoS provisioning of the bearer network(s) the
associated API\'s and the MExE QoS manager shall be supported by MExE device
supporting bearers defined by QoS -- see figure 3 \"Logical MExE device QoS
manager elements\". Non QoS aware MExE executables shall operate with the
defined QoS by the user or the network.
Figure 3: Logical MExE device QoS manager elements
### 5.5.2 MExE QoS support
In the logical architecture depicted in figure 3 \"Logical MExE device QoS
manager elements\", a conceptual entity, a MExE QoS manager exists between the
MExE executable and the Network Control API. A QoS API for MExE executables is
provided and an API to the network is provided. The MExE QoS functions
accommodate standard methods of end to end QoS provisioning.
For a MExE device supporting bearers defined by QoS, it is recommended that
the MExE device shall support the following basic QoS operations:
\- The end user should be able to manage the QoS directly via the MMI.
For MExE devices supporting bearers defined by QoS, the MExE device shall
optionally support the following basic QoS operations:
\- a mapping between the QoS requirements of the MExE executable and the
network layer;
\- MExE executables shall be able to indicate and interpret QoS values of the
network via the MExE QoS Manager;
\- MExE executables shall be able to modify the QoS dynamically;
\- MExE executables shall be able to react to changes in the provided QoS;
MExE introduces two new elements to cater for QoS -- the MExE QoS manager and
the QoS API. The MExE QoS manager shall handle the fact that the network may
not have QoS capabilities.
### 5.5.3 MExE QoS manager
As a conceptual entity, the MExE QoS manager is responsible for:
\- Managing the QoS streams for MExE executables;
\- Notification of the negotiated and delivered QoS to the end user / MExE
executable.
The MExE QoS manager shall support the MExE QoS API according to the bearer
supported by the MExE device, and provide functions such as:
\- insert additional QoS signalling parameters;
\- add the functionality of the MExE QoS API at best effort, if the network
does not support it directly;
\- translate between the QoS parameters from the MExE executable and those of
the network;
\- monitor the QoS delivered by the network and manage QoS requests between
the MExE executable and the network;
\- be informed by the MExE executable of the requested QoS traffic class;
\- be informed by the MExE executable of the lowest QoS traffic class which
can be accepted by the MExE executable;
\- attempt to re-negotiate the QoS if it falls below the lowest QoS traffic
class.
The MExE QoS manager may request information from the network regarding the
QoS available.
The MExE QoS manager does not need to know the end user\'s subscribed QoS,
this is held within the network and used to validate a requested QoS level.
The MExE QoS manager may also be accessed through the MExE device\'s MMI.
### 5.5.4 Network control API
The network control API shall provide the QoS manager with access to the
network specific QoS control (e.g. as defined for GPRS/UMTS in [29] and [30]).
The MExE QoS manager may perform some QoS control, even if it is not provided
in the network control.
### 5.5.5 MExE QoS API
The MExE QoS API provides the MExE executable with an interface to the QoS
management. It does not require the MExE executable to have any knowledge of
the underlying network, or how QoS is implemented in the network.
The QoS API shall provide the MExE executable with a standard set of
parameters. Refer to [28] for details of these parameters (see note 1).
NOTE 1: The FLOWSPEC parameters, defined by the IETF Integrated Services
Working Group, provide the QoS information required by QoS capable network
elements.
Table 4 \"Example parameters\" shows the set of example parameters.
Table 4: Example parameters
* * *
Parameter Units Type Token Bucket Rate bytes /sec 32-bit IEEE floating point
number Token Bucket Size bytes 32-bit IEEE floating point number Peak Data
Rate bytes/sec 32-bit IEEE floating point number Minimum Policed Unit bytes
32-bit integer Maximum Packet Size bytes 32-bit integer Latency micro secs
32-bit integer Delay Variation micro secs 32-bit integer Service Type service
type
* * *
As a minimum the following three parameters shall be supported by the MExE QoS
manager:
\- Token Bucket Rate;
\- Token Bucket Size;
\- Peak Data Rate.
NOTE 2: The discussion of UMTS bearer service parameters as well as radio
access bearer parameters is still going on. Especially the bitrate parameters
and reliability parameter are under discussion [28].
If the MExE executable does not provide a full set of QoS parameters, then the
MExE QoS manager shall the provide QoS parameters based on information
available to it (e.g. from the MMI settings), see clause 5.5.6 \"Sources of
Bearer Service Parameters\".
### 5.5.6 Sources of bearer service parameters
A set of QoS parameters (QoS profile) specify the service provided to the user
by the network. At bearer service establishment or modification different QoS
profiles have to be taken into account. This is based on:
\- The MExE device capabilities;
\- The MExE device or the TE within the terminating network;
\- A QoS profile in the QoS subscription (describes the upper limits);
\- Default QoS profile (of the user or network);
\- A Network specific QoS profile characterising for example the current
resource availability or other network capabilities.
### 5.5.7 QoS streams
Several MExE executables may be executing in the MExE device, each with a
different QoS requirement. Also, a MExE executable may operate several QoS
streams, each with different parameter settings. The MExE QoS manager within
the MExE device shall be able to deal with each stream independently.
### 5.5.8 QoS security
Only the end user, MExE executable or the network using a QoS stream should be
able to modify the QoS of that stream.
## 5.6 Charging
Support of charging is outside the scope of MExE standardisation.
The following informative clauses provide a brief overview of the charging
possibilities enabled by MExE.
### 5.6.1 Generic charging support
The standard GSM/UMTS charging records contain information sufficient to
associate bearer usage and SMS/USSD messages with a subscriber.
Third party service providers and/or service providers may define charging
regimes for MExE services (e.g. on a MExE or WAP server).
# 6 Generic MExE Security
## 6.1 Introduction
In order to manage the MExE and prevent attack from unfriendly sources or
transferred applications unintentionally damaging the MExE device a security
system is required. This clause defines the MExE security architecture.
The basis of MExE security is:
\- a framework of permissions which defines the permissions transferred MExE
executables have within the MExE device;
\- the secure storage of these permissions (and permission type as defined in
clause 6.5 \"User permission types\");
\- conditions within the execution environment that ensure that MExE
executables can only perform actions for which they have permission.
The MExE permissions framework is defined in 3GPP TS 22.057 [2] and is as
follows (there is no implied hierarchy):
\- MExE Security Operator Domain (MExE executables authorised by the HPLMN
operator, as described in clause 6.3.1 \"MExE executable permissions for
operator, manufacturer and third party security domains\");
\- MExE Security Manufacturer Domain (MExE executables authorised by the ME
manufacturer, as described in clause 6.3.1 \"MExE executable permissions for
operator, manufacturer and third party security domains\");
\- MExE Security Third Party Domain (trusted MExE executables authorised by
trusted third parties, as described in clause 6.3.1 \"MExE executable
permissions for operator, manufacturer and third party security domains\");
\- MExE Untrusted Area. Untrusted MExE executables are not permitted to
execute in a security domain (i.e. Operator domain, Manufacturer domain or
Third Party domain) and execute in the Untrusted area, and have very reduced
privileges as described in clause 6.3.2. \"MExE executable permissions for
untrusted MExE executables\".
A MExE device shall support either all three security domains or no domains.
If the security domains are not supported, then all applications shall be
untrusted. The MExE device shall not support any subset of the three security
domains. Support of the MExE Untrusted area is mandatory.
## 6.2 MExE executable integrity
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the pre-verification of MExE executables at launch time
described in this clause is optional.
A potential threat is that MExE executables may be securely authenticated at
the time of download, but tampered with or corrupted prior to being launched.
Further a certificate may be compromised or expired. Authentication of a MExE
executable at the time of download does not ensure that the MExE executable
has not been modified when it is subsequently launched. Furthermore,
authentication of a MExE executable at the time of launch does not ensure that
the MExE executable is not modified during execution. Similarly, verification
of the certificate at the time of download may not ensure that the certificate
is valid at time of application launch, and verification of the certificate at
the time of launch does not ensure that the certificate remains valid during
execution.
Therefore, the MExE device shall ensure application integrity immediately
prior to application execution.
Application integrity is defined as the state in which:-
\- application code has not been modified since authentication; and
\- the certificate containing the root public key is checked and known to be
valid.
> The mechanism by which the device preserves integrity is an implementation
> detail, dependant on the application storage mechanism and access. Examples
> of mechanisms that contribute to such application integrity could include :
\- Storage of applications in a memory area that cannot be compromised on the
device;
\- Preventing launch of the application when the MExE device becomes aware
that the certificate is invalidated;
\- Full signature verification prior to each application invocation (see
clause 6.2.1 \"Full signature verification\");
\- Optimised pre-launch signature verification (see clause 6.2.2 \"Optimised
pre-launch signature verification\");
\- Periodic full signature verification by separate process during application
execution.
The list of examples is not exhaustive and any other mechanisms ensuring
application integrity may be equally considered.
A MExE device may furthermore ensure that the application code has not been
modified during application execution.
### 6.2.1 Full signature verification
Full signature verification assumes that the procedure of validation for
downloaded MExE executables and certificates is used. For more details see
clause 6.7 \"Certification and Authorization Architecture\".
### 6.2.2 Optimised pre-launch signature verification
This is an optional feature which is used to eliminate the potentially
excessive overhead of checking a signature again after initial full
certificate verification has already been performed.
To use this process the MExE device shall create a hash of the executable
object (executable object fingerprint) as if checking the signature. This
shall be stored in a protected verified application list, along with
indication of the domain permissions for the application. The hash used shall
be the same type as that used for signing the object. When launching an
application or downloading an applet, the hash shall be performed as for when
computing the signature. The verified application list shall then be checked;
if the hash value is present and the entry has not expired then the
application or applet may execute. If no list entry exists for this object, or
the entry has expired, the process shall then proceed with the full signature
verification. Note that the lists for applications and applets should be
separate and that an implementation determines management policy for the lists
(e.g., ageing policy, which entries to delete when trying to add a new entry
to a full list etc.). One restriction imposed that shall be enforced is that
the maximum number of uses for an entry before it is marked invalid is limited
to some maximum value.
In the event that a new CCM is received by the MExE device, all verified
application list entries shall be marked invalid unless some mechanism to
determine the validity of an authorising certificate entry for each
application is provided by the MExE device implementation.
## 6.3 MExE executable permissions
Support of MExE executable permissions as detailed in this clause is
mandatory.
### 6.3.1 MExE executable permissions for operator, manufacturer and third
party security domains
The following table 5 \"Security domains and actions\" specifies the
permissions of operator, manufacturer and third party security domains in the
order of restriction.
The actions listed in the security table 5 \"Security domains and actions\"
are generic actions. These actions can only be performed by MExE executables
via application programming interfaces (APIs) (which are intrinsically part of
the MExE implementation) The security restrictions shall apply to MExE
executables whether the API functionality is called directly or indirectly by
the MExE executable. Explicit user permission is required for all actions by
MExE executables in all domains. Types of user permission are defined in
clause 6.5 \"User permission types\".
Untrusted MExE executables are not permitted access to any actions which
access the phone functionality (phone functionality includes all the actions
in table 5 \"Security domains and actions\") except for the exceptions
identified in clause 6.3.2 \"MExE executable permissions for untrusted MExE
executables\".
Actions available using interfaces giving access to the phone functionality
(either in existence at the time of approval of this specification or not)
that are not listed in the security table 5 \"Security domains and actions\"
shall be categorised into one of the groups in the security table 5 \"Security
domains and actions\" by comparing its action against the groups in order as
they are listed in the table 5 \"Security domains and actions\". If an action
can be categorised into a more restrictive group near the top of the table,
then it shall not be again categorised into another, less restrictive, group
further down in the table. For example, if a new action eventually results in
forwarding a call, it shall be categorised into Network access. If the action
is totally new, it shall be categorised into some of the groups by comparing
its functionality to the group description below and by comparing with the
list of actions listed in the table within the group.
1\. Device core function access includes functions, which are an essential
part of the phone functionality .
2\. Support of core software download, which allows updating the ME radio,
characteristics and properties by changing the core software in the ME (e.g. a
new CODEC may be loaded into a ME, a new air interface, etc.)
3\. (U)SIM smart card low level access includes functions, which allow
communications at the transport service access point (send and receive
application protocol data unit).
4\. Network security access includes all functionalities which relate to CHV,
CHV2, UNBLOCK CHV and UNBLOCK CHV2 (verification, management, reading or
modifying), GSM authentication, GSM ciphering.
5\. Network property access includes functions, which enable the management of
operator-related data parameters and network settings.
6\. Network services access includes all functionalities which result in or
need interaction via the operator\'s network.
7\. User private data access includes all functionalities which relate to
management, reading or modifying of data that the user has stored in the MExE
device including user preferences.
8\. MExE security functions access includes all functionalities which, through
an API relate to certificate handling in the MExE device; end to end
encryption, signed content, hashing, access to public, private, secret keys
stored in the MExE device or in a smart card.
9\. Application access includes the functionalities which relate to launch
provisioned functionality, MExE executables, external executables ((U)SIM tool
kit application,...) usage.
10\. Lifecycle management includes the functionalities which are needed for
installing or removing MExE executables in the MExE device.
11\. Terminal data access includes the functions which relate to accessing
terminal data, i.e. not user data.
12\. Peripheral access includes the functionalities related to peripherals
other than user interface peripherals usage through a high level software
application interface.
13\. Input output user interface access includes the functionalities related
to the user interface and user notification means usage.

The lists in the groups in table 5 \"Security domains and actions\" are not
exhaustive, and other actions which are of the same category shall be included
in the group for the purposes of requesting user permission.
This clause identifies the permissions for MExE executables in the 3 security
domains (operator, manufacturer and Third Party). The permissions do not apply
to untrusted MExE executables which are not permitted to execute within the
domains.
### 6.3.2 MExE executable permissions for untrusted MExE executables
When the Security Domains are not supported then all executables are untrusted
and they execute in the untrusted area for which the executable permissions
are defined as follow in table 6 \"Executable permissions for untrusted MExE
executables\".
In order to facilitate untrusted MExE executables having some limited access
to MExE device functionality beyond their very limited privileges, some of the
access permissions in the previous table 5 \"Security domains and actions\"
are extended to untrusted MExE executables and described in table 6
\"Executable permissions for untrusted MExE executables\" as well as in clause
6.11 \"Separation of I/O streams\".
The untrusted MExE executables permitted to use these facilities shall be MExE
executables the user has downloaded him or herself, and not be MExE
executables that have been pushed to the user. MExE executables on the MExE
device due to the user having visited a particular Web site are considered to
be MExE executables that the user had downloaded him or herself.
Untrusted MExE executables shall not be permitted access to any other

NOTE: The functionality of \"Generate DTMF tones\" and \"Add Phonebook Entry\"
is not supported by the MIDP at the moment.
## 6.4 Handling of MExE executables when their valid root public key is not
available
This clause considers the effect on MExE executables when the root public key
of a secure domain (e.g. operator, manufacturer, third party) is no longer
available (e.g. when the UICC is being physically removed, or the root public
key is no longer valid).
### 6.4.1 Launching of MExE executables when their valid RPK is not available
It shall not be possible to launch a MExE executable to run in a security
domain unless the root public key of that security domain is available and
valid.
### 6.4.2 Currently executing secure MExE executables when their valid RPK is
no longer available
On detection that the valid root public key of a secure domain is no longer
present, the MExE device shall permit MExE executables currently executing in
the secure domain controlled by that root public key to continue executing.
Furthermore, if the same RPK is available again, the executable is allowed to
keep on executing. However, if a different RPK is validated, the currently
running MExE executables (under the old RPK) in that secure domain shall be
terminated.
## 6.5 User permission types
Support of user permission types is mandatory.
The term \"user permission\" is defined to mean that the user can give
permission for a specific action in one of the ways defined in table 7 \"User
Permissions\". Support single action permission is mandatory, but support of
blanket permission and session permission is optional.
Any request for user permission as described in table 7 \"User Permissions\"
must display a user friendly name identifying the signer of the corresponding
MExE executable, if available. The \"subject\" field of the certificate of the
signer (\"subject\" here refers to the \"subject\" fields of WTLS and X.509
certificates and an equivalent field for any other format of certificate)
shall be made available to the user upon request. If an application, for which
user permission is being sought, is untrusted, the fact that the application
is untrusted shall be at least visually indicated to the user, if the MExE
device is capable of visual indication, whenever user permission is sought.
Other means of indication are additionally permitted. If the MExE device is
not capable of visual indication, or is not designed for use by a human user,
other means of indication shall be used.
The MExE device shall allow user control of permissions relating to all action
groups listed in the table 5 \"Security domains and actions\" that are
required by the MExE executable and supported by the MExE device.
Multiple action group permissions may be controlled in a single user action on
the MExE device regardless of the permission type as listed in table 7 \"User
Permissions\". In such case, these action group permissions shall be made
explicit to the user.
Note that blanket permission cannot be used for uninstalled MExE executables
e.g. applets, WMLS.
Table 7: User Permissions
* * *
                             User Permissions
Permission Type Description Invocation Revocation blanket permission The user
gives blanket permission to the MExE executable for the specified action, and
the MExE executable subsequently uses the user\'s original permission for the
identified subsequent actions whenever the MExE executable is running.
Typically such permission would be given at MExE executable configuration or
run time. The blanket permission maybe revoked by the user at any time. The
user permission no longer applies once the MExE executable has been removed.
session permission The user gives permission to the MExE executable for the
specified action during a specific run time session of an MExE executable, and
the MExE executable subsequently uses the user\'s permission for the
identified subsequent actions whilst the MExE executable session is still
running. Typically such permission would be given at MExE executable run time.
The session permission maybe revoked by the user at any time. The user
permission no longer applies once the MExE executable run time session has
terminated. single action permission The user gives a single permission to the
MExE executable for the specified action; if the MExE executable subsequently
wishes to repeat the action it must again request the user\'s permission for
the identified subsequent action. Typically such permission would be given at
MExE executable run time. The user permission no longer applies once the
action has terminated.
* * *
## 6.6 Root Public keys
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the root public key management described in this clause is
optional.
The definition of the secure mechanism in this clause to mark as valid a root
public key certificate on the ME, is out of the scope of this specification.
### 6.6.1 Operator root public key
The ME may support secure storage for one or more certificates, each of which
contains an operator root public key. The ME shall support the use and
management of a certificate containing an operator root public key stored on
the MExE-(U)SIM and in the ME. The ME shall behave according to clause 6.6.1.2
\"ME actions on SIM insertion and/or power up\". For support of public key
management on the SIM and the USIM refer to 3GPP TS 51.011 [27] and 3GPP TS
31.102 [39] respectively. The certificate contains a root public key generated
either by the operator, or by a CA trusted by the operator.
If the MExE device does not contain a valid operator root public key, then the
certificate chain to MExE executable previously executing in the Operator
Domain will be invalid, and the MExE executables will be excluded from the
operator domain.
The user shall not be able to add or delete any type of operator public key
(root or contained in a certificate).
Optionally, the operator may install a corresponding disaster-recovery root
public key stored in the MExE device, enabling the operator to use a secure
mechanism (involving the disaster-recovery key) to replace the certificate
containing the standard operator root public key. It shall not be possible to
use the disaster recovery operator root public key to replace the operator
root public key unless both public keys are from the same operator.
There shall be no more than one valid operator root public key on the MExE
device at any one time. A valid operator root public key on the (U)SIM shall
always have precedence over any operator root public key on the ME. Any
operator root public key(s) on the ME shall be marked invalid when a valid
operator root public key is present on the (U)SIM.
An application signed by an operator shall not be able to execute in the
Operator Domain unless the root public key of that operator is installed in
the MExE device (either ME or MExE-(U)SIM) and is marked as trusted.
#### 6.6.1.1 Caching of root public keys
The ME shall behave as if it reads the operator root public key from the
secure area every time the ME needs the key to verify a signature. Examples of
the secure area include an area on a (U)SIM or a secure, persistent area on
the ME.
If the ME uses a mechanism for caching public keys, it shall do so in a way
that maintains the integrity of the secure area and is consistent with the
keys stored in the secure area. With the exception of improved performance,
the operation of the device using cached public keys must be indistinguishable
from that of a device that reads the key from the secure area every time it
uses the key for verification.
No cached version of a key may exist beyond the expiration or termination of
the key in the secure area. For example, if the ME caches a root public key
held on the (U)SIM, the ME shall purge the cache when the (U)SIM application
is stopped (or the SIM card is withdrawn).
#### 6.6.1.2 MExE device actions on detection of valid (U)SIM application
and/or power up
This clause defines the sequence of actions on identification by the MExE ME
that a valid SIM card, or USIM application on the UICC, has been detected
(e.g. through insertion of (U)SIM card, power up of MExE device etc.). More
specifically, these actions relate to the enabling or disabling of the
operator domain and the status of the operator applications on the ME.
The requirements in this clause ensure that the operator domain on the ME
belongs to the same operator as the operator that issued the valid (U)SIM
application (if detected) in the MExE device and, if there is an operator root
public key (ORPK) on the MExE-(U)SIM, that trusted operator applications on
the MExE device were verified using that ORPK.
The ME shall support the use and management of an Operator root public key
(ORPK) on the MExE-(U)SIM.
On power up the MExE device shall behave as dictated by figure 4 \"MExE device
behaviour on power up\" below.
**Figure 4: MExE device behaviour on power up**
Note that the procedure in Figure 4 \"MExE device behaviour on power up\"
checks for a match between the Operator ID on the (U)SIM and the Operator ID
from the ORPK in the ME. Currently, one mechanism for defining the Operator ID
on the (U)SIM is through use of the MCC+MNC. As an additional note, on
DCS1900, the MCC+MNC is 6 digits, but elsewhere it is 5 digits. The MExE
device needs to know how many digits to use. However, this is outside the
scope of this specification. The implementations of MExE devices need to
establish agreements on using the MCC+MNC as the Operator ID on the (U)SIM.
Likewise, the implementations of MExE devices need to establish agreements on
how to define the Operator ID belonging to the ORPK.
The ME shall only read the ORPK from the MExE-(U)SIM when required and shall
not store a ORPK from the MExE-(U)SIM on the ME in a manner inconsistent with
that detailed in clause 6.6.1.1 \"Caching of root public keys\".
When an operator root public key stored on the ME is marked as invalid, all
operator applications verified using that root public key or by certificates
verified by a chain that terminates with that root public key, shall cease
operation as soon as possible and shall be marked as untrusted.
Removal of the (U)SIM shall not cause the status (i.e. valid or invalid) of
any operator root public key on the MExE device to change.
### 6.6.2 Manufacturer root public key
The ME shall support secure storage for a certificate containing a
manufacturer root public key. The certificate contains a root public key
generated by the manufacturer of the MExE device, or by a CA trusted by the
manufacturer of the MExE device.
If the ME does not contain a valid manufacturer root public key, then the
certificate chain to MExE executable previously executing in the Manufacturer
Domain will be invalid, and the MExE executables will be excluded from the
manufacturer domain and marked as untrusted.
The user shall not be able to add or delete any type of manufacturer public
key (root or contained in a certificate).
The Manufacturer shall put a root public key and optionally its corresponding
disaster-recovery key in the ME at the time of manufacture, and use a
proprietary secure mechanism (e.g. using the disaster-recovery key) to replace
the certificate containing the manufacturer root public key. It shall not be
possible to use the disaster recovery manufacturer root public key to replace
the standard manufacturer root public key unless both public keys are from the
same manufacturer.
An application signed by a manufacturer shall not be able to run in the
Manufacturer Domain unless the root public key of that manufacturer is
installed in the ME and is marked as trusted.
The manufacturer, and only the manufacturer, may use a secure mechanism to
mark as valid/invalid a certificate containing the manufacturer root public
key on the ME. It shall only be possible to use this mechanism to mark a
certificate containing a new manufacturer root public key on the ME as valid,
when all manufacturer root public keys are marked as invalid.
There shall be no more than one valid manufacturer root public key on the ME
at any one time. Any other manufacturer root public key(s) on the ME device
shall be marked invalid when a different manufacturer root public key is
marked as valid on the ME.
### 6.6.3 Third party root public key
The ME shall support secure storage for at least one certificate containing a
third party root public key. The ME shall support the use and management of
certificates containing Third Party root public keys stored on the MExE-(U)SIM
and in ME. For support of public key management on the SIM and the USIM refer
to 3GPP TS 51.011 [27] and 3GPP TS 31.102 [39] respectively. The MExE device
may contain root public key (s) generated by CA(s) implicitly trusted by the
user. The user will be able to securely install (using a secure transport) or
remove Third Party root public keys at any time using a system administrative
tool.
The Manufacturer, Operator and Administrator may at their discretion, securely
install certificates containing Third Party root public key(s) on behalf of
the user, e.g. at the time of manufacture by the Manufacturer. See clause 6.10
\"Certificate management\" for details of Administrator control of Third Party
certificate download.
If a Third Party public key is deleted or becomes invalid, then the
certificate chain to MExE executables previously executing in the Third Party
Domain certified by that public key will become \"untrusted\".
There may be any number of Third Party root public keys on the MExE device.
The third party domain administrator, i.e. the Administrator (user or other
body) shall be able to enable and disable Third Party root public keys by
using CCM, see clause 6.10.1 \"Certificate configuration message (CCM)\". The
process of adding/removing public keys and enabling/disabling public key are
independent.
All third party certificates shall be subject to restrictions imposed by valid
certificate configuration messages.
See clause 6.10 \"Certificate management\" for the management of Third Party
root public keys.
## 6.7 Certification and authorisation architecture
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the certificate and authorisation architecture described
in this clause is optional.
In order to enforce the MExE security framework a MExE device is required to
operate an authentication mechanism for verifying downloaded MExE executables.
A successful authentication will result in the MExE executable being trusted;
and able to be executed in a security domain (as determined by the root public
key of its certification tree).
As the MExE device may want to authenticate content from many sources, a
public key based solution is mandatory. Before trusting MExE executables, the
MExE device will therefore check that the MExE executable was signed with a
private key, for which the MExE device has the corresponding public key. The
corresponding public key held in the MExE device must either be a root public
key (securely installed in the MExE device, e.g. at manufacture) or a signed
public key provided in a certificate. The MExE device must be able to verify
certificates, i.e. have the public key (as a root key or in a certificate)
corresponding to the private key used to sign the certificate. Support of
certificate chains is therefore mandatory.
The requirements on authorisation and certification are given in clause 6.7.1
\"Certification requirements\". An example authorisation and certification
process is described in clause 6.7.3 \"Example certification process\".
### 6.7.1 Certification requirements
A MExE device cannot verify certified MExE executables of a particular domain
unless it has a root public key for that particular domain.
Root public keys shall be securely installed in the MExE device, say, at the
time of manufacture.
It is recommended that a \"disaster recovery\" root public key be securely
installed on the MExE device, to be used to install new root public keys when
all other root public keys on the MExE device are invalid.
Third Party Domain root public keys will typically be installed along with and
integrated into the MExE device browser, as is done for PC-based browsers.
A MExE executable can only be verified if the MExE device contains a valid
root or certified public keys corresponding to the private key used to sign
the MExE executable.
A MExE device shall support at least one level of certificate under operator,
manufacturer or Third Party root public keys. The MExE device shall support at
least one level of certificate chain analysis in a signed content package, as
shown in figure 5 \"Trust hierarchy\".
A certificate (other than one containing a root public key) shall only be
considered valid if the signature on the certificate is verified by a valid
public key (root or contained in a certificate) already present on the MExE
device and if the certificate being verified has not expired.
Public keys shall not be shared between domains.
#### 6.7.1.1 MExE terminal requirements for certificate processing
A MExE device shall support the processing of X509 certificates profiled in
the \"WAP Certificate and CRL Profile\" [47] together with additional
requirements defined in the MExE specification, see clause 6.9.1.1 \"X509
version 3\". The certificate chain depth is still mandated to be one level
only, as mentioned in clause 6.7.1 \"Certificate requirements\" and indicated
in figure 5 \"Trust hierarchy\".
A MExE device shall support the SHA1WithRSA signature algorithm. The object
identifier value can be found in [49]. A MExE device may also support other
signature algorithms.
MExE devices may also support the processing of other certificate formats.
Figure 5: Trust hierarchy
The boxes below the root keys represent individual public key certificates.
The solid boxes represent the minimum MExE, and the dotted boxes represent
possible further support for public key certificates (either at the first or
subsequent levels).
### 6.7.2 Certification administration requirements
For control of third party certificates, the MExE device supports storage of a
certificate containing an administrator root public key as detailed in clause
6.13.1 \"Administrator root public key\".
This certificate is managed separately from the hierarchy of Figure 5 \"Trust
Hierarchy\" discussed in clause 6.7.1 \"Certification requirements\". The
administrator root public key in this certificate is primarily used for
designating an administrator of the third party certificates. Note, the
administrator root public key does not implicitly define a security domain,
and is used in complement with the root public keys of the operator,
manufacturer, and third party domains.
The relationship of the administrator certificate (and root public key) to the
management of third party certificates is detailed in part of clause 6.10
\"Certificate management\".
The relationship of the administrator certificate to the mechanism for
determining if a third party certificate is trusted is detailed in part of
clause 6.10.1 \"Certificate configuration message (CCM)\".
Mechanisms for designating an administrator are detailed in clause 6.13.2
\"Provisioned mechanism for designating administrative responsibilities and
adding third parties in a MExE device\".
### 6.7.3 Example certification process
The following processes might be followed in order to securely download a
Third Party application to a MExE device.
Root public keys for a number of Certification Authorities (CAs) are installed
in the MExE device, along with the MExE device browser, at manufacture. These
root public keys can be used to verify certificates for Third Party MExE
executables.
1\. A third party software developer generates a private and public key pair
(or obtains such a pair from a CA).
2\. The third party software developer obtains a certificate for the public
key from a CA. The certificate contains the developer public key, signed with
the private key of the CA.
3\. The 3rd party software developer adds all the certificates required in the
key chain in the JAR.
4\. The MExE device downloads a MExE executable of the third party software
developer.
5\. The MExE device verifies the certificate using the root public key,
contained in the browser, of the relevant CA, and extracts the third party
software developer public key and may store it in the certificate store for
future use.
6\. The MExE device verifies that the MExE executable was signed using the
private key corresponding to the third party software developer public key and
installs or rejects the MExE executable accordingly.
All downloaded applications shall follow the procedure described in clause
6.7.4 \"Certificate Chain Verification\" in order to verify the application
signature and the certificate chain. If the 3 security domains are not
supported, the procedure described in the next clause is optional.
### 6.7.4 Certificate Chain Verification
This clause presents the procedure of validation of any downloaded MExE
executable. It checks for the presence of the signature used to sign the
application as well as the presence and integrity of all the certificates
needed to successfully verify the signature. As a result, the application
under scrutiny is deemed trusted or untrusted, i.e. will be allowed execution
in one of the secure domains or in untrusted area, or otherwise the
application will not be allowed to be executed and will be deleted. In any
outcome of the verification, the user is notified about the result. The user
also may wish to see certificate details if the application is allowed to be
executed on the MExE device.
The MExE device shall follow \"certificate verification\" procedure as
described below. The procedure shall contain at least the following logical
phases (not necessarily in the order stated below):
**Signature and Certificate Verification Supported:** Checks whether signature
and certificate verification procedure is supported on the MExE ME.
**Executable with Signature and End Entity Certificate (note):** Checks
whether the executable contains a signature together with the corresponding
end entity certificate.
**Valid Application Signature (note):** This phase comprises the following
checks:
\- Check if the signature and the end entity certificate formats are supported
by the device. If this check fails, the application is classified as
untrusted.
\- Check if the signature algorithm is supported/known by the device. If this
check fails, the application is classified as untrusted.
\- Check if the signature can be cryptographically verified by using the
accompanying end entity certificate . If this check fails, the application is
not allowed execution and is deleted.
**Complete set of Intermediate Certificates Available (note):** Checks if all
the necessary intermediate certificates (certificates between the RPK and the
end entity certificate) are available.
**Valid RPK on (U)SIM/ME:** Checks if a valid RPK (not expired) exists on the
(U)SIM or on the ME that could verify a certificate chain originating from the
end entity certificate accompanying the application.
NOTE: These steps could include validation (e.g. expiration, revocation, etc.)
checking by means of e.g. OCSP, SCVP, CRL-Consultation, and etc. The use of
certificate revocation checking is recommended but is not mandated or defined
in this specification.
**Certificate Chain** **Cryptographically Verified:** Checks if all the
certificates from the end entity certificate to the RPK can be verified
cryptographically. Certificate verification shall be performed according to
the functional requirements given in clause 6.1 \"Basic Path Validation\" of
RFC 2459 [43] excluding revocation checking.
**Secure Domains Supported:** Checks whether MExE ME supports secure domains.
Only if all the above checks are successful, the downloaded application is
deemed trusted and is allowed to be executed in the designated trusted domain
(operator, manufacturer, trusted third party). Otherwise, the application is
either untrusted (execution in the untrusted area only is allowed) or deleted
(execution is not allowed at all) as per the figure 6 \"Certificate Chain
Verification Diagram\" and as explained above. The executable shall only be
designated into one of the trusted domains, and it shall be possible to verify
the certificate chain unambiguously to one and only one root public key.
The MExE ME shall allow for a \"user notification\" procedure as described
below.
It shall be possible to display certificate details to the user if requested,
however, since the terminal might not have a display or might not be meant for
a human user the methods presented in \"user notification\" section are not
discussed any further in this specification. Figure 6 \"Certificate Chain
Verification Diagram\" shows an example of the certificate chain verification
procedure.
Figure 6: Certificate Chain Verification Diagram
## 6.8 Usage of Signed Content
### 6.8.1 Signed packages used for installation
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the signed packages used for installation, described in
this clause, are optional.
The Java Archive (JAR) file format shall be supported on classmark 2 and 3
MExE devices for securely packaging objects that are to be downloaded and
installed on the ME. The method for securely packaging objects for MExE
classmark 1 devices may be referenced from the WAP specifications in a future
release of this specification. A MExE device may support other proprietary
means of downloading and installing objects.
The JAR file shall contain a manifest file that has at least the following
attribute:
MExE-Implementation-Type
The information contained within the manifest file is represented as so-called
\"name: value\" pairs, where \"name\" is represented by MExE-Implementation-
Type. Groups of name-value pairs are known as a \"section\", where sections
are separated from other sections by empty lines.
The MExE-Implementation-Type value shall be one of the following:-
\- \"**MExENativeLibrary** \"
in the case of a MExE Native Library (as described in 8.3.2 \"Installing MExE
native libraries\");
\- \"**TTPCertificate** \"
in the case of a certificate containing a 3^rd^ party root public key (as
described in 6.8.2 \"Installation of root certificates in a signed data
package\");
\- \"**ManufacturerCertificate** \"
in the case of a certificate containing a manufacturer root public key (as
described in 6.8.2 \"Installation of root certificates in a signed data
package\");
\- \"**OperatorCertificate** \"
in the case of a certificate containing an operator root public key (as
described in clause 6.8.2 \"Installation of root certificates in a signed data
package\");
\- \"**AdminCertificate** \"
in the case of an administrator certificate, which shall consist of a section
containing both the administrator certificate and a CCM (as described in
clause 6.8.2 \"Installation of root certificates in a signed data package\");
or
**\- \"OrdinaryTTPCertificate\"**
in the case of a certificate or certificate list containing 3rd party public
key(s). An example of a certificate list syntax can be found in [52]
**\- \"OrdinaryManufacturerCertificate\"**
in the case of a certificate or certificate list containing manufacturer
public key(s). An example of a certificate list syntax can be found in [52]
**\- \"OrdinaryOperatorCertificate\"**
in the case of a certificate or certificate list containing operator public
key(s). An example of a certificate list syntax can be found in [52]
\- \"**CCM** \"
in the case of a CCM (as described in clause 6.8.2 \"Installation of root
certificates in a signed data package\"); or
_\- -free-format-value-_
in the case of proprietary binaries or Java classes such as native DSP code,
provisioned functionality upgrades and patches (as described in clause 6.8.3
\"Installation of other signed data\").
Refer to [42] for full details of how to encode the \"name: value\" pairs and
\"section\" in a JAR manifest file.
See figure 7 \"Signed packages\". When a download of a JAR file is completed,
the system installer shall read the manifest to determine what types of files
are contained in the JAR, and install them appropriately.
Note that a signed package containing a library which does not have a manifest
attribute \"MExE-Implementation-Type: MExENativeLibrary\" shall be considered
to be some type of upgrade to libraries that are intrinsically part of the
MExE device implementation rather than a \"MExE native library\". E.g.
MExE-Implementation-Type: ManufacturerUpgrade (something.dll)
(Recommended behaviour for the server is that it uses the capability
information supplied from the MExE device to determine how to offer
appropriate upgrades.)
Figure 7: Signed packages
### 6.8.2 Installation of root certificates in a signed data package
Root certificates in a signed package (whose signature verifies as described
in clause 6.6 \"Root Public keys\" to the Manufacturer root, Operator root, or
the Administrator root), may be installed to the root public key store on the
MExE device. Note that the certificate thus packaged does not necessarily
belong to the manufacturer domain. The types of certificate that can be
present and installed by packages are given in table 8 \"Allowed certificate
types in signed packages\". The MExE device shall store the root public key as
indicated by the certificate type.
When a certificate containing an Administrator root public key is thus
contained in a signed package, the signed package (e.g. a JAR file in the case
of Java based MExE classmarks) shall contain two files: the Administrator root
public key and the CCM.
Table 8: Allowed certificate types in signed packages
* * *
Signature on Package Allowed Certificate types in package Administrator Third
Party Manufacturer Administrator, Manufacturer, Operator, Third Party Operator
Administrator, Operator, Third Party
* * *
### 6.8.3 Installation of other signed data
A signed package of proprietary binaries or Java classes such as native DSP
code, provisioned functionality upgrades and patches, whose signature verifies
as described in clause 6.6.2 \"Manufacturer root public key\" as belonging to
the Manufacturer Domain may be installed. The use of such binaries is outside
the scope of MExE, but the manufacturer shall be responsible for ensuring that
the integrity of MExE is not compromised.
Support of this feature is optional.
## 6.9 Certificate Format
### 6.9.1 Certificate extension for removal of network access
MExE defines the certificate extension (attribute) \" access-Restriction\". If
the access-Restriction extension is present in a certificate used to verify
the signature on a trusted application or in any certificate in the
certificate chain used to verify that signature, then the application shall
not be permitted the capabilities listed under \"network service access\" in
the security table, (table 5 \"Security domains and actions\"). This
restriction applies irrespective of any user permission for network service
access that may or may not be requested by the application and/or given by the
user.
The extension prevents the trusted applications of developers who do not need
network service access from writing applications that can perform network
service access.
The support of this extension in the operator domain is mandatory. The support
of this extension in the manufacturer and third party domains is optional.
The extension is defined for X.509 version 3 only. Support for WTLS, X9.68
certificate formats is for further study.
#### 6.9.1.1 X.509 version 3
The MExE certificate format as specified in clause 6.7.1.1 \"MExE terminal
requirements for certificate processing\" shall support the X.509 version 3
access-Restriction extension.
X509 version 3 provides a mechanism to define extensions. An Object identifier
(OID) is defined for each private extension as defined in X509 [26]. The
extension is defined to be within the ETSI Object Identifier (OID) name space.
This extension shall apply irrespective of the presence or otherwise of any
other X.509 key usage or extended key usage field.
Normal use of the \"critical\" flag for extensions apply. That is, if this
extension is marked as critical in the certificate used to verify the
signature on the application or in any certificate in the chain used to verify
the signature and this extension cannot be processed in the MExE device then
the certificate shall be considered invalid.
The syntax of the extension is defined in annex C \"Access restriction
certificate extension\".
## 6.10 Certificate management
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the certificate management described in this clause is
optional. The manufacturer may load initial third party certificates on the
ME. Downloaded certificates shall be verified by an existing trusted
certificate and placed in the domain defined by the root public key at the top
of the verification chain for the downloaded certificate.
The administrator root certificate shall be provided on the (U)SIM if support
for certificate storage on the (U)SIM exists (e.g. MExE-(U)SIM) or in the MExE
device. For (U)SIMs not having certificate storage the administrator root may
be downloaded using the root download procedure described in clause 6.13.4
\"Administrator root certificate download mechanism\".
The actions that may be performed for a given certificate are:
\- addition;
\- deletion;
\- mark un-trusted (un-trusted certificates cannot be used to verify
applications or other certificates. This process may be preferred to
certificate deletion as there is a chance that the certificate may become
trusted again in the near future);
\- mark trusted (marking as trusted is the process of allowing an untrusted
certificate to come into use again);
\- modify fine grain access permissions (proposed as a future enhancement).
The ability to perform these actions depend on the certificate type being
modified as well as the access level of the entity performing the operation.
Users may add a third party certificate as long as it is certified by an
existing trusted certificate. Using a provisioned functionality, users may
delete Third Party certificates.
The Administrator may mark trusted/untrusted Third-Party certificates using
Certificate Configuration Messages (see clause 6.10.1 \"Certificate
configuration message (CCM)\".
Users cannot add or delete any Operator or Manufacturer certificate containing
a root public key.
An example of public key infrastructure certificate management protocols can
be found in [33].
### 6.10.1 Certificate configuration message (CCM)
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the certificate configuration message described in this
clause is optional.
The MExE device shall use the CCM to determine the third party certificates
(and only the Third Party certificates) that are trusted for use on the MExE
device. The CCM shall only be used to enable or disable third party
certificates and can not be used to delete certificates. The CCM may be
periodically fetched or downloaded to a MExE device by the Administrator to
dynamically configure the third party list using the mechanisms defined in
clause 6.10.1.4 \"Authorised CCM download mechanisms\".
The Certificate Configuration Message shall be as shown in figure 8 \"Format
of a CCM\". This message is essentially a simplified version of a certificate
revocation list to satisfy a particular use case. More complex usage requires
a full certificate revocation list.
The MExE device may additionally support other means of enabling/disabling
root certificates.

Figure 8: Format of a CCM
**Version** = The CCM format version is 0. All other values are reserved for
future use.
**Certificate Advice** = enumerated { enable all present and future Third
Party certificates (0), disable all present and future Third Party
certificates (1), enable present list only (2),enable CCM list (3), disable
CCM list (4) }. All other values are reserved for future use.
**Issue and Expiry Timestamps** = Fields used to identify the issue and expiry
date of the CCM. The issue timestamp indicates a time before the current time
of day (GMT) when a CCM message must be considered invalid. The expiry
timestamp (GMT) identifies the time when a CCM is to be deemed no longer
valid. The receiver shall use these parameters to detect a replay attack. A
MExE device maintains information on the last valid CCM message received. A
replay attack is an attacker replaying a previous valid CCM message to a MExE
device in order to change the security settings. This is particularly
dangerous for CCM messages used to enable certificates. Administrators should
try and set the expiration time to be no longer than the next expected system
update time of CCM information. CCM messages used to enable-all (rather than
disable-all) certificates should be very short lived as the danger of these
being used in a replay attack should be considered serious.
The encoding of time (GMT) shall be coded as an OCTET SEQUENCE of seven octets
in length as follows:
* * *
Octet 0 1 2 3 4 5 Octet 6 Year Month Day Hour Minute Second
* * *
* * *
Element Size (bits) Range Year 16 (0 -- 65535)~10~ Month 8 (1 -- 12) ~10~ Day
8 (1 - 31)~10~ Hour 8 (0- 23)~10~ Minute 8 (0 -- 59)~10~ Second (see note) 8
(0 -- 60)~10~ NOTE: The second field range includes the value 60 in order to
accommodate leap seconds.
* * *
For example, 1^st^ January, 2001 00:00:30 would be encoded as: 07 d1 01 01 00
00 1E.
**SignerInfo** = one octet indicating the type of signer information for this
CCM. The only currently defined value is device-admin = 0. In this case, no
further signer information follows as it is implicit. All other values are
reserved for future use.
**Listlength** = The total length of the fingerprint list not including the
final CCM signature. Shall be zero when certificateAdvice = enable-all,
disable-all or enable present list.
**Hashtype** = enumerated { signature (0), MD5 (1), SHA-1 (2) } All other
values are reserved for future use.
The length of the Hashvalue field, number of octets output by the selected
hash type, is 16 for MD5 [23] or 20 for SHA-1 [24].
The list entries shall contain certificate _fingerprints_ in the form of
hashes of the encoded signed certificates. The full hash output for the
specified algorithm shall be used to generate the fingerprint. A list
generator shall check to insure that no two list entries match when creating a
list. For an X509v3 [26] or X9.68 (currently being drafted) certificate the
fingerprint hash shall be computed over the ASN.1 encoded signed certificate
object, first octet to last octet. For WTLS certificates the hash shall be
computed over the signed WTLS certificate in network transmission format,
first octet to last octet.
The signature type and length shall be indicated by the administrator
certificate, which shall be present on the MExE device. If no administrator
certificate is on the MExE device or if the signature is not verified, the
message shall be rejected.
Upon receipt of a valid certificate configuration message the MExE device
shall go through the third party certificate list, computing fingerprints if
they are not stored with the certificate and enabling or disabling each
certificate according to the following conditions:
* * *
\- certificateAdvice is enable-all all Third Party certificates shall be
enabled; \- certificateAdvice is disable-all all Third Party certificates
shall be disabled; \- certificateAdvice is enable present list only enable all
Third Party certificates currently on MExE device, do not enable any future
certificates (this option allows the list to be frozen at time of manufacture)
until Administrator changes; \- certificateAdvice is enable-list if its
fingerprint occurs in the CCM, it shall be enabled, otherwise it shall be
disabled; \- certificateAdvice is disable-list if its fingerprint occurs in
the CCM, it shall be disabled, otherwise it shall be enabled.
* * *
For future releases, the setting of fine grained permissions for each
certificate is expected to be supported.
An implementation shall keep track of the domain that authorised a given
executable. If a CCM message is received while MExE executables are currently
executing, the implementation shall check to ensure that any executables no
longer in the Third Party domain, have their permissions re-configured
appropriately and actions that are no longer permissible are terminated.
#### 6.10.1.1 CCM numbering convention
Bits are grouped into octets. The bits of an octet are shown horizontally and
are numbered from 0 to 7. Multiple octets are shown vertically and are
numbered from 0 to n.
#### 6.10.1.2 CCM order of transmission
Frames are transferred in units of octets, in ascending numerical octet order
(i.e., octet 0, 1, ..., n-1, n). The order of bit transmission is specific to
the underlying protocols used to transport the CCM.
#### 6.10.1.3 CCM field mapping convention
When a field is contained within a single octet, the lowest bit number of the
field represents the lowest-order value. When a field spans more than one
octet, the order of bit values within each octet progressively decreases as
the octet number increases. In that part of the field contained in a given
octet the lowest bit number represents the lowest-order value.
For example, a 16 bit number can be represented as shown in figure 9 \"Field
mapping convention\".
* * *
Bit  
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  
2^15^ 2^14^ 2^13^ 2^12^ 2^11^ 2^10^ 2^9^ 2^8^ 1^st^ Octet of field 2^7^ 2^6^
2^5^ 2^4^ 2^3^ 2^2^ 2^1^ 2^0^ 2^nd^ Octet of field
* * *
Figure 9: Field mapping convention
#### 6.10.1.4 Authorised CCM download mechanisms
The download of third party certificate lists by a remote administrator shall
be performed by using a secure mechanism as defined below. The download
mechanisms shall use HTTP over IP and/or the WAP Protocol. The URL from which
the CCM is downloaded shall be in the administrator certificate if the CCM was
not downloaded with the Administrator certificate. The format for storing the
URL information with the certificate shall be as shown in figure 10 \"CCM
Message URL storage format\":
{width="5.6194444444444445in" height="0.41875in"}
Figure 10: CCM Message URL storage format
Urltype= one byte, enumerated {WAP (0), HTTP (1)}. All other values are
reserved for future use.
CharacterSet = one byte, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigned
character set.
UrlLength = one byte unsigned integer, length of the URL in octets.
URL = a field where the format for storing the URL information in the
certificate shall be defined as part of the enhanced administrator mechanism.
When the administrator is changed, then the CCM shall also be changed. If
there is URL information with the certificate as described in figure 10 \"CCM
Message URL storage format\", then the new CCM shall be obtained using the
URL. If the Administrator certificate was downloaded in a JAR file, the CCM
shall be obtained from the same JAR file.
### 6.11 Separation of I/O streams
Support of the separation of I/O streams is mandatory.
Except for the MExE Classmark 3 executables (MIDlets) from the same MIDlet
Suite, there shall be strict separation of the user interface input and output
streams between different MExE executables, i.e. it shall not be possible for
one MExE executable to access the user interface input or output of another
MExE executable. In particular, it shall not be possible for an untrusted MExE
executable to access the user interface input and output destined for or
proceeding from a trusted MExE executable. (This requirement is to prevent a
long lived malicious MExE executable from eavesdropping upon on interfering
with the user to MExE executables communications, for instance PINs, of a
trusted MExE executable).
## 6.12 Core software download
Support of core software download is optional.
Core software download enables the MExE device radio, characteristics and
properties to be updated by changing the software in the MExE device. E.g. a
new CODEC may be loaded into a MExE device, a new air interface, etc. This
process could include the transfer of executable code and software patches
over the air.
This updating of core software (e.g. the Software Defined Radio (SDR) concept)
can in principle be generically supported within the MExE framework by a MExE
service that executes in the manufacturer security domain, and uses handset
manufacturer proprietary APIs. Possible scenarios for the support of this
functionality include:
\- A MExE service that can be transferred to, and executed in, the
manufacturer domain. The service would use manufacturer APIs to perform the
software update, radio re-configuration, etc.
\- A core software download application that executes in the manufacturers\'
domain that acts like a user agent in conjunction with a server to transfer
software as needed or requested by the user. The core software download
application uses manufacturer APIs to perform the software update, radio re-
configuration, etc.
Similar functionality may be supported by a downloaded MExE service using
manufacturer\'s OEM classes. All such OEM classes shall comply with the MExE
security requirements in table 5 \"Security domains and actions\" and table 6
\"Executable permissions for untrusted MExE executables\".
The support of core software download functionality in a MExE device shall
only be under the control of the MExE device manufacturer.
## 6.13 Administrator Concept
### 6.13.1 Administrator root public key
To help with the control of Third-Party certificates, the ME shall support
secure storage for a certificate containing an administrator root public key.
The ME shall support the use and management of a certificate containing an
Administrator root public key stored on the MExE-(U)SIM and in the ME. The ME
shall behave according to clause 6.13.3 \"Determining the administrator of the
MExE MS\". For support of public key management on the SIM and the USIM refer
to 3GPP TS 51.011 [27] and 3GPP TS 31.102 [39] respectively.
A secure mechanism may be used to mark as valid/invalid a certificate
containing the administrator root public key on the MExE device. It shall only
be possible to use this mechanism to mark a certificate containing a new
administrator root public key on the ME as valid, when all administrator root
public keys are marked as invalid.
There shall be no more than one valid administrator root public key on the
MExE device at any one time. A valid administrator root public key on the
(U)SIM shall always have precedence over any administrator root public key on
the ME. Any administrator root public key(s) on the ME shall be marked invalid
when a valid administrator root public key is present on the (U)SIM.
The MExE device shall support the administrator designation mechanism
explained in clause 6.13.2 \"Provisioned mechanism for designating
administrative responsibilities and adding third parties in a MExE device\"
and the secure downloading of CCMs explained in clause 6.10.1.4 \"Authorised
CCM download mechanisms\".
The user shall not be able to delete an administrator root public key or
certificate.
The system shall support a mechanism (as part of a provisioned functionality
and/or inherently part of the MExE implementation) allowing the owner of the
MExE device to manage the administrator root public key (including the
download of a new administrator root public key) as defined in clause
6.13.3.2.1 \"Administrator of the MExE device is the user\". This mechanism
shall be secure so that only the owner can use this functionality.
The administrator root public key can be downloaded to the MExE device as
described in clause 6.13.4 \"Administrator root certificate download
mechanism\".
If the Administrator root public key is stored in the (U)SIM, the ME shall
only read the Administrator root public key from the MExE-(U)SIM when required
and shall not store the Administrator root public key from the MExE-(U)SIM on
the ME in a manner inconsistent with that detailed in clause 6.6.1.1 \"Caching
of root public keys\".
See clause 6.10 \"Certificate management\" for the management of Administrator
root public keys.
The same root public key may be used for both the Administrator role and the
operator or manufacturer domain. This facility does not imply any increased
right of the manufacturer or operator to take the Administrator role.
If the same root public key is used for the operator domain and Administrator
role and this root public key is stored on the MExE-(U)SIM (see [27] and
[39]), there shall be separate entries relating to each use of the root public
key in the operator and administrator trusted certificate directory files.
These entries in the operator and Administrator trusted certificate directory
files may point to the same root public key in the certificate data file.
If the root public key to be shared is not stored on the (U)SIM, then
procedures relating to this are out of the scope of this specification.
### 6.13.2 Provisioned mechanism for designating administrative
responsibilities and adding third parties in a MExE device
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the administrator concept described in this clause is
optional.
All applications in the Third-Party security domain are to be signed by a key
which shall be verified back to a Third Party root public key on the MExE
device. The Third Party root public keys shall be managed (e.g. addition/mark
trusted/mark untrusted) by an administrator that is designated by the owner of
the MExE device using the MExE administrator provisioning mechanism. A
mechanism is required to be provided to enable the owner of the MExE device to
dynamically assign an administrator. The mechanism shall support the following
cases:
\- the user is the owner;
\- the owner is at a remote location. In this case the owner could be the
operator, a service provider or a third party;
\- the owner of the MExE-(U)SIM wants to be a temporary administrator.
### 6.13.3 MExE administrator determination mechanism
The administrator of the MExE device shall be determined by a two part logical
process with the first part shown in the flowchart in figure 11 \"MExE
administrator determination mechanism\". The second part of the logical
process is in figure 12 \"MExE administrator determination mechanism, for
MExE-(U)SIM supporting third party certificates\".
During power-up or MExE-(U)SIM insertion event, the provisioned mechanism
shall look for an administrator root public key that is stored on the
MExE-(U)SIM.
#### 6.13.3.1 Determining the administrator of the MExE device
If an administrator root public key cannot be found on the MExE-(U)SIM, the
provisioned mechanism shall look for one on the MExE device. This leads to the
following two cases:
\- administrator root public key is absent
if the administrator root public key is absent, then the user shall
automatically become the administrator of the MExE device.
\- administrator root public key is present
if an administrator root public key is present, this root public key shall be
used for all remote administration authentication, implying that the owner of
the administrator root public key is the administrator. Note that the owner of
the administrator root public key could be the user.
**Figure 11: MExE administrator determination mechanism**
#### 6.13.3.2 Determining the administrator of the MExE device, for
MExE-(U)SIM supporting third party certificates
The second part of the administrator determination mechanism is subsequently
defined (see figure 12 \"MExE administrator mechanism, for MExE-(U)SIM
supporting third party certificates \"), and shall be initiated after a power-
up or MExE-(U)SIM insertion event is processed.
The following clauses 6.13.3.2.1 \"Administrator of the MExE device is the
user\" and 6.13.3.2.2 \"Administrator of the MExE device is not the user\"
assume that Third Party certificates can be added using the MExE-(U)SIM,
however Third Party certificates may be added using a non-(U)SIM approach
(e.g. inserted at the time of manufacture, signed package download etc.).
##### 6.13.3.2.1 Administrator of the MExE device is the user
If the administrator is the user, then a check shall be made to determine
whether there is a MExE-(U)SIM. If a MExE-(U)SIM is present, then a check
shall then be made to determine whether there is a Third Party or an
Administrator certificate containing a root public key in the MExE-(U)SIM. The
second part of the administrator determination mechanism shall allow the MExE
device to determine (via a format) what type of certificate is present:
\- certificate present - third party (CP-TP)
If a Third Party certificate containing a root public key is present in the
MExE-(U)SIM then this certificate shall be considered by the MExE device as a
Third Party certificate, whilst that valid MExE-(U)SIM application is present
in the MExE device. The user shall be queried to allow or disallow the
certificate as a Third Party.
\- certificate present - administrator (CP-Admin)
If a temporary Administrator certificate containing a root public key is
present in the MExE-(U)SIM, the user shall be queried whether to allow the
certificate on the MExE-(U)SIM to take temporary control of the third party
domain. By temporary control, it is meant that once the card is removed the
administrator reverts back to the user administrator settings (i.e. the
Administrator becomes the User). The above mechanism implies that the previous
configuration settings for the administrator shall be saved, so that they may
be restored. If the user disallows the MExE-(U)SIM certificate, the Third
Party Domain shall not be able to use any of the network capabilities in the
third party domain as identified in the network access section of the security
table 5 \"Security domains and actions\".
If an administrator certificate is not present on the MExE-(U)SIM and the
administrator is the user, the user shall continue to be the administrator and
may make use of all functionality.
##### 6.13.3.2.2 Administrator of the MExE device is not the user
If the administrator is not the user, then a check is made to determine if
there is a MExE-(U)SIM. If a MExE-(U)SIM is present, then a check is made to
see if there is a Third Party or an Administrator certificate containing a
root public key in the MExE-(U)SIM.
If an Administrator certificate containing a root public key is present in the
MExE-(U)SIM, then a comparison is made of this certificate\'s root public key
with the Administrator root public key on the MExE device for the following
cases:
\- Case (a): they are the same;
\- Case (b): they are not the same, but the MExE device certificate is cross-
certified with the MExE-(U)SIM certificate (a cross-certificate exists on the
MExE device);
\- Case (c): they are not the same, but the MExE device certificate has a line
of trust back to the MExE-(U)SIM certificate domain;
\- Case (d): they are not the same.
If the owner of the public key in the certificate on the MExE-(U)SIM is to be
a temporary administrator (CP-Admin), then in cases (a), (b) and (c), the
temporary administrator shall be the owner of the CP-Admin root public key. In
case (d), the Third Party domain shall not use any of the network capabilities
in the third party domain as identified in the network access section of the
security table 5 \"Security domains and actions\".
If the certificate is to be a Third Party certificate containing a root public
key, then the certificate (CP-TP) shall be verified with the CCM and based on
the content and permissions of the CCM, the certificate shall be added to the
Third Party list or rejected.
**Figure 12: MExE administrator determination mechanism,\ for MExE-(U)SIM
supporting third party certificates**
### 6.13.4 Administrator root certificate download mechanism
MExE devices supporting (U)SIMs without certificates shall at least support
the following procedure to download the administrator root certificate.
1\. Upon sign-up with an administrator the user and administrator will make
contact.
2\. The administrator service centre will obtain any required information from
the user and inform the user by SMS or other means of the location of the
administrator root certificate.
3\. The user will initiate the download of the Administrator root certificate
using a signed package.
4\. Once the procedure is complete the MExE device shall compute the hash of
the received Administrator certificate containing root public key.
5\. The user will contact the administrator and enters on the MExE device at
least the first 8 bytes using decimal value of the hash of the Administrator
root public key information provided by the administrator . The MExE device
compares the beginning of computed hash value and the abbreviated hash value
entered by the user If these two values are the same ,the provisioning process
will be complete. If the two values are different this shall be indicated to
the user who should inform the administrator of this.
Alternative methods to download an administrator root certificate may be used
where appropriate but must insure that the certificate is received by the MExE
device unaltered.
# 7 MExE Classmark 1 (WAP environment)
## 7.1 Introduction
Classmark 1 MExE devices are based on Wireless Application protocol (WAP).
The Wireless Application Protocol is a standard to present and deliver
wireless information and telephony services on mobile phones as well as other
wireless terminals. Supporting mandatory features of WAP, WAP enabled devices
provide access to the World Wide Web based content for small mobile devices.
### 7.1.1 WAP MExE devices
Support of WAP in a MExE classmark 1 device as detailed in this clause is
mandatory.
WAP MExE devices shall be based on the WAP specifications [6]. In addition to
the base specifications in [6], further developments made in the WAP
specifications shall form part of this MExE specification.
WAP MExE devices shall implement the WAP version as specified in reference
[6], or a later version, under the condition that the version of WAP is
backward compatible with the version specified in reference [6].
The existing WAP specification covers security, creation and transfer of WAP
executables and content, access, and execution.
### 7.1.2 High level architecture
The WAP architecture provides a scalable and extensible environment for
application development for mobile communication devices. This is achieved
through a layered design of the entire protocol stack.
The key features of WAP include:
\- Markup language (WML) and a script language (WMLScript) designed to create
applications on the small displays of handheld devices. WML does not assume
that a QWERTY keyboard or a mouse is available for user input. Unlike the flat
structure of HTML documents, WML documents are divided into a set of well
defined units of user interactions. One unit of interaction is called a card,
and services are created by letting the user navigate back and forth between
cards from one or several WML documents. WML has a smaller set of markup tags
that makes it more appropriate to implement in handheld devices, than, say,
HTML.
\- Light-weight protocol stack to minimise the required bandwidth and to
guarantee that a maximum number of wireless network types can run WAP
applications. For example, GSM SMS/USSD, circuit switched data (CSD), and
GPRS.
\- A framework for Wireless Telephony Applications (WTA) allows access to
telephony functionality such as call control, phone book and messaging from
within WMLScript scripts. This allows operators to develop telephony
applications integrated into WML/WMLScript services.
Since WAP is based on a scalable layered architecture, each layer can develop
independently of the others. This makes it possible to switch onto new
bearers, to use new transport protocols, without major changes in the other
layers.
## 7.2 Non Security
### 7.2.1 WAP components
Mandatory and optional components of WAP are specified in the WAP
specifications. Services and applications shall be able to determine the
presence of optional parts of the functionality.
### 7.2.2 Services
WAP is a general purpose application based on World Wide Web (WWW)
technologies and philosophies. Many services can be provided to both WAP
clients and traditional WWW clients, from the same server. Services are
created based on the same information space. The major difference is the user
interface. The user interface of WAP services is realised by the Wireless
Markup Language, WML [6], and has a menu tree oriented structure, instead of
the traditional flat structure of HTML pages.
Typical WAP services provided to mobile phones may include (this list is not
exhaustive):
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+ | ‑ News | ‑ Telephony Services | | | | | ‑ Weather information | ‑ Time Tables | | | | | ‑ Package Tracking | ‑ Access to corporate databases | | | | | ‑ Stocks | ‑ Sports | +-----------------------+---------------------------------+
#### 7.2.2.1 User interface
The user interface of WAP services is realised by the Wireless Markup
Language, WML [6]. WML does not define the user interface itself, the
implementation of the browser defines how the WML data is presented to the
user (e.g. hyperlinks are blue and underlined). The script language, WMLScript
[6], may be used to enhance the standard browsing and presentation facilities
of WML with behavioural capabilities, and to access the device and its
peripheral functionality.
#### 7.2.2.2 Access points
Services may be hosted on standard HTTP servers and can be created with proven
technologies; CGI, Java Servlets. URLs are used to address services.
The WAP network topology is shown in figure 13 \"WAP network topology\".
{width="5.028472222222222in" height="3.3152777777777778in"}
**Figure 13: WAP network topology**
Mobile phones access services by sending a request with a URI to the WAP
gateway. The URI is used to identify the origin server on which the service is
available. The request is sent from the mobile phone by the WAP protocols over
one of the available bearer networks. The WAP Gateway is a WAP to HTTP/1.1
proxy that translates the WAP request into an HTTP/1.1 request (from binary
form to text). The HTTP/1.1 request is passed on to the server identified by
the URI.
The HTTP server may have multiple access points to various databases and other
services available in the infrastructure network. Once the request has been
serviced a response is sent back to the WAP Gateway, which in turn translates
it into a WAP response (from text to binary form) and sends it down to the
mobile phone.
Note that WAP does not specify anything \"behind\" the WAP Gateway. However it
is assumed that the origin server is an HTTP/1.1 server, and that the WAP
Gateway has access to the TCP/IP network on which the origin server is hosted.
#### 7.2.2.3 Transferring
The core of WSP [6] is a binary version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol -
HTTP/1.1 [9]. The core function of WSP is the same as for HTTP/1.1. A client
sends a request to the server using an appropriate request method with a URI
and information about the client. The server responds with a status code and
possibly (if success) the requested content.
There is a differentiation between an origin server and a WSP server. The
origin server is where the content is stored, and the WSP server is where the
WSP session terminates. The WSP server is also typically the WAP gateway.
In addition to the basic HTTP/1.1 function, WSP has some functions that can
not be found in HTTP/1.1, they are:
\- Session Establishment and Management\ Before a request is sent, the WSP
client can establish a session with the server. During session establishment
the client and server exchange static headers. The header are cached for the
duration of the session, thus they need to be sent in every single request
within the session. Static headers may be: Accept headers, User-agent header,
etc. In addition, capabilities such as supported optional protocol functions,
the maximum service data unit the protocol can handle, the maximum number of
simultaneously outstanding requests, supported header code pages, etc. can
also be exchanged during session establishment.
\- Header encoding\ WSP is using a compact binary header encoding to minimise
the number of bytes sent over the air.
\- Asynchronous transactions\ WSP allows for multiple asynchronous
transactions, that is, unordered transactions.
\- Transaction Abort\ WSP support abortion of an outstanding transaction.
\- Datagram transport\ WSP together with the helper protocol Wireless
Transaction Protocol, WTP [9], can run over a datagram transport such as SMS
or UDP. The WDP can also be used for non-IP bearers.
\- Push\ WSP supports the push of data from server to client. This can be done
within and outside of a session. It can be done with and without
acknowledgement from the client. Push of indications down to mobile phones is
an essential function many wireless applications.
##### 7.2.2.3.1 WSP and HTTP/1.1 Proxy Function
The WAP Architecture is a client-proxy-server architecture. The client is
typically a mobile phone, the data gateway is the WAP Gateway and the server
is the origin server (a standard HTTP server). The WAP Gateway translates the
binary WSP header into text formatted HTTP/1.1 headers and passes them on to
the origin server. In the opposite direction the WAP Gateway translates the
text formatted HTTP/1.1 header into binary WSP headers. If the WAP Gateway
receives a header it does not recognise it simply passes it on as an unknown
header. Unknown headers that are not part of the WSP Header Code page or
Extended code pages (negotiated at session establishment) are sent in plain
text for the client to interpret as best it can.
### 7.2.3 WAP charging support
The WAP protocol suite in [6], with upgrades as identified in this
specification, does not specify mechanisms for charging (e.g. charging
records) or subscription management. WAP is bearer independent and is running
as an application on top of the bearer network. However the WAP architecture
suggests that appropriate charging information can be collected in the WAP
Gateway; the point of convergence for all WAP traffic.
The WAP security protocol can be used for authentication of the subscriber.
### 7.2.4 CC/PP over WSP (Classmark 1)
In Classmark 1, according to the WAP User Agent Profile Specification [17],
the CC/PP description is encoded with WBXML [45] after which it is carried
over by WSP, [17].
## 7.3 Security
### 7.3.1 Call control
WAP telephony services are written in WML and WMLScript. The WAP Telephony API
(WTAI) exposes telephony functions to service authors as a set of libraries.
The WTAI function libraries can be accessed from WML as URIs, and from
WMLScript as script functions. The following libraries have been specified:
\- Public library\ This includes functions that are available in all networks,
and can be provided by any third party service provider; and not only the
network operator. The user must acknowledge the function before it is carried
out. Functions have been specified, which can be used e.g. to initiate a
mobile originated call, send DTMF tones and add phonebook entry.
\- Network Common library\ This includes functions that are available in all
networks, and can be provided only by the network operator. E.g. functions for
advanced call control, accessing the phonebook, and sending and reading
network text (SMS) have been specified.
\- Network Specific library\ Functions that are only available in certain
types of networks, and can be provided only by the network operator. For GSM,
e.g. functions for call reject, call hold, call transfer, multiparty, getting
location information and sending USSD have been specified.
The WML and WMLScript author uses the WTAI libraries to create web services
for mobile phones with telephony capabilities.
Call control shall be performed using WTA.
### 7.3.2 Local phonebook
WAP Telephony API (WTAI) is used to access the information stored in the
phonebook on the MExE device or the (U)SIM. Phonebook entries consist of name,
number and identity. Phonebook entries can be read, written, deleted, and
searched for.
# 8 MExE Classmark 2 (PersonalJava environment)
## 8.1 Introduction
Classmark 2 specifies Personal Java enabled devices with the addition of the
JavaPhone API.
The Personal Java[3] application environment is the standard Java environment
optimised for consumer electronic devices designed to support World Wide Web
content including Java applets. The Personal Java API is a feature level
subset of J2SE with some Java packages optional and some API modifications
necessary for the needs of small portable devices (for example an optimised
version of the Abstract Windowing Toolkit targeted to small displays).
JavaPhone[4] is a vertical extension to the Personal Java platform that
defines APIs for telephony control, messaging, address book and calendar
information, etc.
### 8.1.1 Classmark 2 MExE devices
Support of PersonalJava in a MExE classmark 2 device as detailed in this
clause is mandatory.
MExE Classmark 2 devices shall be based on the API for Personal Java, which
defines the required and optional components of Personal Java /JavaPhone APIs
that shall be used to realise a Classmark 2 compliant MExE device.
The APIs primarily define the functions available to a Personal Java based
MExE device such that services (specified in the form of Java classes and
interfaces) can control such a MExE device in a standardised way.
Many aspects of the MExE Classmark 2 API specification are optional. Services
and applications shall be able to determine the presence of optional parts of
the functionality. When optional parts of the functionality are implemented,
the API shall be supported.
### 8.1.2 High level architecture
Figure 14: Basic functional architecture of a PersonalJava MExE device
The functional architecture of a Java MExE classmark 2 device is shown in
figure 14 \"Basic functional architecture of a PersonalJava MExE device\".
Java applets, applications, and services access functionality via the MExE
PersonalJava API. The MExE PersonalJava API is based on a combination of
optional Java APIs and the Wireless Profile of the JavaPhone API [4]. The
JavaPhone API is based on the PersonalJava API [3].
## 8.2 Non Security
### 8.2.1 High level functions
#### 8.2.1.1 Optional Java packages
The use of Java encourages development of modular interfaces and minimal
required functionality. Additional functionality is provided by optional APIs
specified in terms of the Java language. Java packages are containers for the
highest level of functionality in the Java language. In some cases, optional
Java packages are specified in terms of Java classes and interfaces. Classes
and interfaces are elements contained inside packages.
The following table 9 \"Optional Java packages of the Wireless Profile of the
JavaPhone APIs\" specifies the defined optional Java packages of the Wireless
Profile of the JavaPhone APIs [4]. Within some of the packages, certain
classes and methods may be individually specified as optional by the JavaPhone
API specification.
Where a mandatory package is identified, it is implicit that any packages
called by that mandatory package are also mandatory.

#### 8.2.1.2 Required and optional PersonalJava APIs
MExE classmark 2 devices shall support the PersonalJava specification [3]. The
PersonalJava APIs provide a standardised and readily implementable execution
environment as a means for applications, applets, and content:
\- to access and personalise the user interface via the java.awt packages;
\- to utilise both Internet and Intranet connections via the java.net package.
#### 8.2.1.3 Required and optional JavaPhone APIs
The JavaPhone APIs extend the PersonalJava APIs to provide functionality
unique to telephony devices. MExE classmark 2 devices shall support the
Wireless Profile of the JavaPhone API specification [4]. MExE classmark 2
devices shall support all APIs specified as required by the Wireless Profile
in the JavaPhone API specification. All APIs that are optional in the Wireless
Profile shall be optional in MExE classmark 2 devices.
##### 8.2.1.3.1 Application installation
MExE classmark 2 devices shall support the following JAR file manifest entries
(as described in the JavaPhone specification) as described below:
\- Implementation-Title
the Implementation-Title shall be used in any textual description of the
application which is displayed in the UI element used to launch the
application. E.g. the text displayed with an icon.
\- Main-Icon
the use of icons to launch applications is optional, however if icons are used
as elements to launch the application, then the icon file within the JAR file
named by the Main-Icon attribute shall be displayed, and may be scaled if
desired.
\- Main-Class and Class-Path
when the application is launched, the MExE Java VM shall be supplied with the
classpath and shall call the main() method in the class named by the Main-
Class attribute.
##### 8.2.1.3.2 Power
MExE classmark 2 devices shall support the Power Monitor package
(javax.power.monitor) as specified by the JavaPhone API to access the power
level of the MExE device and receive notifications concerning changes in power
states.
Note that the Power Monitor package does not specify the minimum required
events that should be generated under certain circumstances. MExE classmark 2
device shall at least implement the following event generation:
\- BatteryCritical
shall be generated when the battery is at a critically low level.
\- BatteryNormal
shall be generated when the battery is no longer low.
All the other event generation should be supported by the implementation.
##### 8.2.1.3.3 Datagram recipient addressing
The syntax described in Concrete Addressing [4] specifies the format to be
used for raw text-only GSM SMS messages, UDP datagram via IP, and WAP datagram
via GSM SMS message(s).
As a minimum, the formats above shall be supported if the MExE device supports
the relevant bearer/transport combination.
NOTE: For the purposes of this clause, \"GSM SMS\" means SMS as defined by the
3GPP specifications including 3GPP TS 23.040.
#### 8.2.1.4 Required and optional MExE PersonalJava APIs
MExE classmark 2 devices shall not be required to support any other Java APIs.
MExE classmark 2 devices may optionally support any other Java APIs which
comply with the MExE security requirements in table 5 \"Security domains and
actions\", such as:
\- OCF SmartCard API OpenCard, available from [21]. If the MExE device
supports smartcards other than the (U)SIM, and the smartcard is open to 3^rd^
party applications, then the opencard.core.terminal section of the OpenCard
API may be used to access the card.
#### 8.2.1.5 Mandated services and applications
##### 8.2.1.5.1 Network protocol support
Support for network protocols in MExE classmark 2 devices is specified in the
following table 10 \"Support for network protocols\":
Table 10: Support for network protocols
* * *
Protocol Optional/Mandatory HTTP/1.1 [9] Mandatory HTTPS Mandatory Gopher
Optional ftp Optional mailto [25] Mandatory File Optional
* * *
### 8.2.2 CC/PP over HTTP (Classmark 2)
In Classmark 2 the CC/PP is carried over by using CC/PP over HTTP, [15] and
optionally CC/PP over WSP, [17].
### 8.2.3 Java charging support
MExE Java devices do not require any additional specific charging (e.g.
charging records) or subscription management. Java usage of network resources
is bearer independent and runs as applications on top of the bearer network.
## 8.3 Security
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the Java security described in this clause is optional.
### 8.3.1 PersonalJava security
There are two types of Java security [20]: sandbox, and fine grain.
The sandbox model [18] has just one domain; there is no concept of a _partly
trusted_ domain. The sandbox meaning of \"trusted\" means it is totally
unrestricted to access all system resources.
Using the sandbox system, each MExE security domain shall be implemented as
running in a sandbox, configured with different privileges corresponding to
those of the domain. If the security domains are not supported then the Java
sandbox security model shall be supported and it shall be configured for
untrusted MExE executables support only, as defined in clause 6.3 \"MExE
executable permissions\". Using the fine grain Java security system [19], each
MExE security domain will be a set of constraints within which a Java fine
grain security domain can be configured.
#### 8.3.1.1 Java applet certification in PersonalJava
Support for trusted applets is optional. Although a Java application shall be
executed in a trusted domain if its certification can be validated, a Java
Applet will not necessarily be executed in a trusted domain even if it does
have a valid signature. It will be up to the implementers to decide if
\"trusted\" Applets will be supported. (In certain implementations, all
Applets may be always executed as \"untrusted\".)
#### 8.3.1.2 Java application signature verification in PersonalJava
The verification of the certification of the application or applet shall be
performed as described in clause 6.6 \"Root Public keys\" and clause 6.13.2
\"Provisioned mechanism for designating administrative responsibilities and
adding third parties in a MExE MS\".
#### 8.3.1.3 Java loading native libraries in PersonalJava
The MExE Java VM may be able to load native libraries that are intrinsically
part of the MExE device implementation and MExE native libraries. The MExE
Java VM shall not load other native libraries.
### 8.3.2 Installing MExE native libraries
A signed native library whose signature verifies as describe in clause 6.6.2
\"Manufacturer root public key\" as belonging to the Manufacturer Domain may
be installed as a \"MExE native library\".
A MExE native library may be called by a MExE executable, and shall not
compromise the MExE security system.
Support of MExE native library signed package installation is optional.
# 9 MExE Classmark 3 (J2ME CLDC environment)
## 9.1 Introduction
Classmark 3 MExE devices are based on the Connected Limited Device
Configuration (CLDC) with the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP).
Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) is a version of the Java 2 platform targeted at
consumer electronics and embedded devices. CLDC consists of a virtual machine
and a set of APIs suitable for providing tailored runtime environments. The
J2ME CLDC is targeted at resource constrained connected devices (e.g. memory
size, processor speed etc.).
### 9.1.1 Classmark 3 MExE devices
Support of CLDC/MIDP in a MExE classmark 3 device as detailed in this clause
is mandatory.
MExE Classmark 3 devices are based on the J2ME Connected Limited Device
Configuration (CLDC) with the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP).
All APIs defined by CLDC and MIDP shall be supported by a MExE classmark 3
device.
### 9.1.2 High level architecture
{width="4.604166666666667in" height="1.957638888888889in"}
**Figure 15: Functional architecture of a Classmark 3 MExE device**
The functional architecture of a Classmark 3 MExE device is shown in figure 15
\"Functional architecture of a Classmark 3 MExE device\". The MExE API is
based on the combination of CLDC APIs and MIDP APIs. OEM specific APIs are
outside the scope of MExE specification. CLDC and MIDP APIs are defined in
J2ME [34] and [35].
### 9.1.3 High level functionality
J2ME CLDC and MIDP addresses a large market of resource-constrained devices
and is aimed to provide complete end-to-end solution for creating dynamically
extensible networked products and applications. It allows the use of Java
programming language as the standard platform for secure delivery of dynamic
content for the extensible next‑generation devices.
In order to fit into various types of the devices and support extensibility,
J2ME defines in _Configuration_ a minimum platform with a virtual machine
features and minimum libraries which are available on all devices of similar
class. In a _Profile_ J2ME addresses the specific demand of a certain category
of the devices allowing additional APIs. Profile is implemented on top of
configuration (see figure 15 \"Functional architecture of a Classmark 3 MExE
device\"). Classmark 3 MExE device shall be based on the following types of
configuration and profile: Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and
Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP).
## 9.2 Non Security
### 9.2.1 Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC)
Classmark 3 devices shall support CLDC specification [34].
CLDC provides only high level libraries without focus on any specific device
categories. Defining \"the lowest common denominator\" of Java technology all
features included in CLDC must be generally applicable to a wide variety of
the devices. CLDC does not address to a certain device category. Such features
are specified in a profile. CLDC does not define any optional features.
The classes provided by CLDC are either subset of J2SE (Standard Edition)
classes or CLDC specific classes which can be mapped onto J2SE. Classes
belonging to the packages: Java.io, Java.lang, Java.util are a subset of
corresponding Java2SE libraries, while classes specified in
Javax.microedition.io are specific CLDC classes, which, however, can be mapped
onto Java2SE.
Javax.microedition.io provides generic connection framework for supporting
input/output and networking in a generalized and extensible manner. The
framework is a functional subset of Java2SE classes which can be mapped to
common low-level hardware or to any Java2SE implementation. It does not
provide a set of different kinds of abstractions for different forms of
communications, but rather a set of related abstractions are used at the
application programming level.
The framework uses a hierarchy of Connection interfaces that group together
classes of protocols with the same semantics. The actual supported protocols
or implementation of the specific protocols is outside the scope of CLDC
Generic Connection Framework and is maintained at the profile level.
The basic set of available Connection interfaces is the following:
\- Connection;
\- ContentConnection;
\- Datagram;
\- DatagramConnection;
\- InputConnection;
\- OutputConnection;
\- StreamConnection;
\- StreamConnectionNotifier
### 9.2.2 Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP)
MExE classmark 3 devices shall support MIDP specification [35]. MIDP is based
on CLDC. Some of the features of CLDC are modified or extended by MIDP [35].
#### 9.2.2.1 Networking
While CLDC specifies only a generic Connector used for all types of
connections, MIDP extends connectivity support by providing support of the
subset of the HTTP protocol. HttpConnection API provides the additional
functionality to set request header, parse response headers and perform HTTP
specific functions. The API must support RFC 2396 [40] and RFC 2616 [41].
The MIDP does not provide support for datagrams. If a Datagram API is to be
implemented, the DatagramConnection interface defined in CLDC shall be used.
#### 9.2.2.2 MID Applications (MIDlet)
A MIDP application (or MIDlet) uses the APIs defined by the MIDP and CLDC
specifications. One or more MIDlets may be packed in one JAR file. Sharing of
data between MIDlets is controlled by the individual APIs (e.g. Record
Management System API).
Application Management Software provides an environment in which a MIDlet is
installed, started, stopped and uninstalled. Each JAR file can be accompanied
by an Application Descriptor (a text file consisting of name/value pairs),
which is used to manage MIDlet and is used by MIDlet for configuration
specific attributes. With the help of descriptor file, verification prior to
software download is done to ensure that the MIDlet is suited to the device:
Java Application Manager checks if the application already exists on the
device, verifies the version number (whether an update is needed or not) and
reading the JAR-file-size information ensures that there is sufficient amount
of memory on the device to save the file. The minimum attributes which the
Application Descriptor must contain are the following:
\- MIDlet-Name;
\- MIDlet-Version;
\- MIDlet-Vendor;
\- MIDlet-Jar-URL;
\- MIDlet-Jar-Size.
Mandatory and optional attributes are defined in [35]. If the mandatory
attributes are not identical in the descriptor file and in the manifest file,
the JAR file shall not be installed.
#### 9.2.2.3 MIDlet Suites
MIDlets may be packaged together in a single JAR file, forming a MIDlet suite.
MIDlets in a MIDlet suite share the classes in the JAR file and the persistent
storage is the MIDP Record Management System.
MIDlets in a MIDlet suite may be discovered, transferred, installed and
deleted together as a packaged set of MIDlets. The deletion of a MIDlet in a
MIDlet suite may result in the deletion of the entire MIDlet suite, in which
case the user shall be notified of the deletion of the MIDlet suite.
#### 9.2.2.4 Record Storage
The MIDP provides a mechanism for MIDlets to persistently store data and later
retrieve it. The persistent storage mechanism is called Record Management
System. Record stores are created in platform-dependent locations and are not
exposed to MIDlets. The record store maintains a version number, which is
incremented each time the content of the record store is modified. A record
store is shared between all MIDlets in a MIDlet suite.
### 9.2.3 Required and optional MExE APIs
Support of any other Java APIs besides CLDC and MIDP is not mandated in a
Classmark 3 MExE device. A Classmark 3 MExE device may optionally support any
other Java APIs which comply with the MExE security requirements.
### 9.2.4 Service discovery and management
A browser installed on a MExE device should support MIME type
text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor. This support allows the user to browse and
discover a Java application which can then be downloaded. Capability
negotiation information in the request header can determine which application
to present. MIDlets and MIDlet suites should be indicated to the user, and if
the MExE device has a display, may be presented as an icon and a tag or as a
textual tag only.
A JAD file can be downloaded and used to determine if the MIDlet is deemed
suitable for download and installation. If it is suitable, the JAR file can be
downloaded and installed. If not, the MExE device should be able to prompt the
user so that the user might choose to take such actions such as deletion of
some existing applications if there is not enough space to install the new
application. If the application chosen to be installed already exists on the
device, the user should be notified so that he could take further actions
either to download the chosen version or to retain the existing one.
The user should be able either to launch the MIDlet immediately or later.
### 9.2.5 Transfer of capability negotiation information in Classmark 3
In Classmark 3 the CC/PP is carried over by using CC/PP over HTTP, [15] and
optionally CC/PP over WSP, [17].
Also MIDP itself provides a simple mechanism for applications to indicate the
capabilities they require. The Java Application Descriptor File (JAD), which
is a file that can be stored and downloaded separately to the application
itself, contains information such as application name, version number, JAR
file size, data storage requirements etc. The Application Descriptor can
accompany the JAR file and can be used to ensure prior to the actual
application download that the application suits the MExE device. The JAD file
is described in more details in the clause 9.2.2.2 \" MID Applications
(MIDlet)\".
## 9.3 Security
If the 3 MExE security domains defined in clause 6.1 \"Generic security\" are
not supported, then the Java security described in this clause is optional.
### 9.3.1 CLDC security
A Java execution environment running on a Classmark 3 MExE device shall comply
with the security requirements defined in the CLDC specification [34]. That
is, it shall comply with both the low-level virtual machine security
requirements and the application-level security requirements.
The application-level CLDC security requirements define a sandbox security
model where Java classfiles are verified. Java APIs available to the
application are limited to those APIs which have been defined by the
configuration and profiles supported by the MExE device. Downloading and
management of the Java applications on the MExE device takes place at the
native level, no user-definable Java class loaders are provided and the set of
APIs available to a MIDlet is closed.
The low-level CLDC virtual machine security requirements define a Java
classfile pre-verification mechanism which takes place off- MExE device (e.g.
on the server prior to downloading) and inserts a special attribute called a
\"stack map\" into class files to facilitate runtime verification of the same
classfiles.
# 10 MExE classmark 4 (CLI Compact environment)
## 10.1 Introduction
Classmark 4 specifies CLI Compact Profile enabled devices.
The CLI [50] environment is a programming language neutral, OS and CPU
portable environment. The CLI can support applications and services written in
a wide range of programming languages, for example Visual Basic, ECMAScript
and C#. The CLI Compact Profile specifies a minimal set of class libraries,
supporting common runtime library features as well as web services
infrastructure, including HTTP[9], TCP/IP, XML[36] & SOAP[51]. Such devices
not only may have limited memory and CPU capability, but also limited (or no)
display.
### 10.1.1 High level architecture
**Figure 16: Basic functional architecture of a CLI MExE device**
The functional architecture of a CLI MExE classmark 4 device is shown in
Figure 16 \"Basic functional architecture of a CLI MExE device\". CLI based
applications and services access functionality via the MExE CLI Compact
Profile API. Additional CLI APIs and OEM specific APIs are outside the scope
of the MExE specification. The CLI Compact Profile APIs are defined in CLI
specified by ECMA [50].
## 10.2 Non security
Support of CLI Compact Profile in a MExE classmark 4 UE as detailed in this
clause is mandatory.
MExE Classmark 4 devices shall be based CLI Compact Profile specifications
[50]. The specifications define the runtime environment and APIs available to
a CLI based MExE device such that services (specified in the form of language
independent classes and interfaces) can control such a device in a
standardised way.
All mandatory components of the CLI compact profile shall be included.
Additional CLI APIs or OEM APIs may be available. It shall be possible for
services and applications to determine the presence of additional parts of the
functionality. When an additional optional CLI component is implemented, the
component shall be fully implemented.
### 10.2.1 High level functionality
CLI provides a language-neutral, CPU and OS portable, secure infrastructure
for executing applications and services that interoperate seamlessly with
highly available web services. The CLI Compact Profile provides a mobile
client-focussed subset of these services on a broad market of connected
devices. Using multiple programming languages for application and service
creation allows adoption of a large pool of programming talent, as well as
interoperability between existing service components.
Functionality is exposed to applications and services in the form of classes
and interfaces. Classes can be written in any supported language. APIs can be
exposed to the developer using the language syntax of choice. Classes and
interfaces are collected into namespaces, which aim to represent a coherent,
mutually-dependant set of functionality.
The following Table 11 \"CLI Compact Profile Namespaces\" specifies the
defined mandatory namespaces, i.e. the namespaces defined in the CLI Compact
Profile containing classes which are required for CLI Compact Profile
conformance.
**Table 11: CLI Compact Profile Namespaces**
* * *
**CLI Compact Profile Namespaces** **System** **System.Collections**
**System.Globalization** **System.IO** **System.Text** **System.Threading**
**System.Runtime.CompilerServices** **System.Reflection** **System.Net**
**System.XML**
* * *
The namespaces outlined in Table 11 define the core of the CLI programming
model. The System namespace defines data types, including simple data types
such as integers, collections such as arrays, and string data types with
methods for textual manipulation. System.Globalization enables applications to
adapt at runtime to user and cultural UI preferences by modifying list sorting
order, currency symbol selection, date and calendar formats, input methods,
and language presentation within text strings. The programming model supports
threads, with thread manipulation primitives defined in System.Threading.
System.Reflection enables programmatic inspection of application metadata such
as class structure, properties, and data types on method parameters.
System.Net includes support for transport-independent sockets, HTTP
connections, and infrastructure for consuming web services. System.XML enables
simple parsing and construction of XML objects.
### 10.2.2 Network protocol support
Support for network protocols in MExE classmark 4 devices is specified in the
following Table 12 \"Support for network protocols in Classmark 4 devices\":
**Table 12: Support for network protocols in Classmark 4 devices**
* * *
**Protocol** **Optionality** HTTP/1.1 [9] Mandatory HTTPS Mandatory SOAP [51]
Mandatory Gopher Optional ftp Optional mailto [25] Optional File Optional
* * *
### 10.2.3 Power Management
MExE Classmark 4 devices have no application or service accessible APIs to
detect the power level of the device. Classmark 4 applications or services may
be paused by the MExE device if power passes below a certain threshold. Such
an activity is implementation dependant.
### 10.2.4 CLI charging support
MExE CLI devices do not require any additional specific charging (e.g.
charging records) or subscription management. Use of network resources from a
CLI application or service is bearer independent and runs as applications on
top of the bearer network.
### 10.2.5 CC/PP over HTTP or WSP (Classmark 4)
In Classmark 4 the CC/PP is carried over by using CC/PP over HTTP [15] and
optionally CC/PP over WSP, [17].
## 10.3 Security
### 10.3.1 CLI Security
Support of CLI security in a MExE classmark 4 device, as detailed in this
clause, is mandatory.
The CLI specification includes a detailed algorithm to verify the safety and
integrity of CLI application code, known as \"application verification\" [50].
An application is either verified as \"safe\" or \"unsafe\". The result of the
application verification process is presented to the rest of the CLI runtime
environment before program execution. This is distinct from the certificate
and signature verification that MExE performs before executing an application
inside the MExE environment.
Applications that are verified as unsafe may contain code that could
potentially access the environment in an unauthorized manner. For example,
code that uses pointer arithmetic or accesses arrays using out-of-bounds
indices would be deemed unsafe. An unsafe application shall not be permitted
to execute in the MExE environment. Once an application is verified as safe,
this information is passed on to the rest of the CLI runtime environment,
which will then apply the MExE security policy, as specified under clause 6.1,
\"Generic Security\".
The CLI runtime environment may be able to load libraries that are
intrinsically part of the MExE device implementation. Such intrinsic libraries
may contain unsafe code, however other libraries containing unsafe code are
prohibited.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MExE profile of PKCS#15
# A.1 PKCS#15 certificate object attributes presentation
Details from PKCS#15[32] in this Annex A.1 \"PKCS#15 certificate object
attributes presentation\" are for information only.
## A.1.1 Object common attributes
> Label human readable label to describe the certificate
>
> Flags indicates whether the object is private (e.g. CHV authentication
> request), whether the object is read only.
>
> Authentication object identifier a cross-reference back to the
> authentication object, which describes the properties of a CHV, used to
> protect this object.
## A.1.2 Certificate common attributes
> identifier the identifier is used for correlation between the public key
> contained in the certificate and the associated private key.
>
> Authority indicates whether the certificate is for an authority (i.e. CA or
> AA) or not.
>
> Request identifier used to search a certificate : Issuer and serial number
> SHA-1 hash, or issuer public key SHA-1hash, or public key subject SHA-1

>
> Thumbprint used as secure way to verify that no one has tampered with a
> certificate: hash on to be signed certificate (internet). MExE uses the
> thumbprint to enable or disable a certificate through the certificate

## A.1.3 Certificate attributes
Type of certificate indicates the type of certificate: WTLS, X509, SPKI, PGP,
X9.68.
> Value direct value or indirect file path or URL.
MExE only supports storage of WTLS, X509, X9.68 certificates.
## A.1.4 Specific X.509 certificate attributes
For information see PKCS#15 [32].
# A.2 MExE profile of PKCS#15
**PKCS15CommonObjectAttributes.label** must be present. The value content is
unspecified.
**PKCS15CommonObjectAttributes.Flag** must be present. The value shall be
private, not modifiable by MExE device.
**PKCS15CommonObjectAttributes.Authentication** must be present. The value
shall be \"CHV1\". The certificates files are protected by CHV1, because MExE
need also IMSI to manage domains availability.
**PKCS15CommonCertificateAttributes.Id** must be present. The value content is
unspecified.
**PKCS15CommonCertificateAttributes.Authority** must be present if and only if
certificate is a CA certificate. The value is true.
**PKCS15CommonCertificateAttributes.RequestId** must be at least present if
certificate is an operator or third party root certificate. The value shall be
the same as the ones used in the issuer/authority key identifier field of the
certificates, provided by this issuer (as in RFC2459 document [43]). The aim
of this attribute is to give a easy way to search a key issuer of a received
certificate without reading all certificates content.
**PKCS15CommonCertificateAttributes.Thumbprint** must be at least present if
certificate is a third party root certificate. The value shall be the same as
the ones used in CCM. The aim of this attribute is to give a easy way to
search a certificate with reference included in CCM message.
Domain attribute presence and value shall be added as soon as it will be
available in PKCS#15 v1.1.
**PKCS15(type)CertificateAttributes.value** must be present Value is a
indirect file path (path, index, offset). Index and offset default value is 0.
Specific X509 attributes are not supported:
**PKCS15X509CertificateAttributes.subject** must not be present.
**PKCS15X509CertificateAttributes.issuer** must not be present.
**PKCS15X509CertificateAttributes.serialNumber** must not be present.
The MExE device shall recognise all optional present fields above. The MExE
device shall accept and ignore all unused fields or new field extensions.
# A.3 Coding and storage in MExE-(U)SIM
See detail of file hierarchy and file properties in (U)SIM document [27] and
[39].
Since the domain attribute is not available in PKCS#15 v1.0, MExE creates one
directory file for each trusted domain. If the domain attribute is available
in the next PKCS#15 versions, for future new domains, MExE may create a common
directory file. See abstract syntax definition and coding detail in PKCS#15
document [32].
The address of the certificate descriptor Elementary File is fixed.
According to PKCS#15 [32] clause 6.6 \"Certificates\" , the contents of a
certificate descriptor Elementary File must be the _value_ of the DER encoding
of a **SEQUENCE OF PKCS15Certificate** (i.e. excluding the outermost tag and
length bytes).
The address of the certificate data Elementary File is unspecified.
According to PKCS#15 [32] clause 6.6 \"Certificates\", the certificate data
value is coded according to the related certificate type (e.g. DER for X5.09,
base64 for SPKI and PGP, WTLS network format for WTLS, DER or PER for X9.68).

###### ## Annex D (informative): MExE executable life cycle
This is a conceptual description of the life cycle of a MExE executable. There
may be small deviations in a specific classmark.
The Unified Modelling Language (UML) [38] is used in the description. (This is
a brief description of the symbols. A rounded rectangle is a state. An arrow
is a transition between states. A dot is an initial state indicating the
starting state when the enclosing state is entered. A circle with a dot is a
final state. When a final state is activated the enclosing state ends.)
Figures in parenthesis are references to clauses in the specification.
# D.1 State of a MExE executable
The life cycle of MExE executables (clause 5.3 \"Provisioning and management
of services\") is described using a state machine. In a MExE device a MExE
executable can have the following states and transitions between states.
* * *
**State or Transition (= >)** **Description** Initial => Discovered The MExE
executable is discovered (clause 5.3.1 \"Service discovery\"). Discovered The
MExE executable is discovered and can be installed or executed without
installation. (Only executables useable on the MExE device should enter this
state.) Discovered => Resident The discovered executable is selected to be
installed and the executable is transferred (clause 5.3.2 \"Service
transfer\") to the MExE device for installation. Discovered => Uninstalled
Execution The discovered executable is selected to be executed without
installation. Discovered => final state The executable is undiscovered.
Resident The executable is stored in the MExE device. It has been transferred
or is pre-loaded. Verification This is the initial sub-state of the Resident
state. This is a composite state. There is a description of the Verification
state in D.4. Verification => Configuration The result of the verification
indicates that the executable can be installed in one of the Domains.
Configuration This is a sub-state of the Resident state. The executable can be
configured, manually or automatically (clause 5.3.3 \"Service installation and
configuration\"). Configuration => Released The service is released for
execution. Released This is a sub-state of the Resident state. The executable
is resident, configured and released for execution. This is a composite state
and there is a description of it in D.2. Released => Configuration The
executable is blocked for execution or an executable has changes security
domain (The user shall have the possibility to review the configuration before
the executable is released for execution with different privileges.). Resident
=> final state The Resident state is left when the service is deleted (clause
5.3.6 \"Service deletion\"). From the MExE device point of view the executable
does not exist any more. (The Integrity and Certification Validation (clause
6.10 \"Certificate management\") can also force a deletion) Uninstalled
Execution The executable is executed without installation. This is a composite
state. There is a description of the Uninstalled Execution state in D.3.
Uninstalled Execution => final state The Uninstalled Execution state is left
when the executable terminates by itself or when the user terminates the
executable (clause 5.3.5 \"Service termination\"). From the MExE device point
of view the executable does not exist any more. Uninstalled Execution =>
Resident This is a possible but unusual transition. A MExE executable that has
been used for uninstalled execution is installed without retransferring.
* * *
# D.2 Released state
A MExE executable in the Released state is resident, configured and released
for execution.
* * *
**State or Transition (= >)** **Description** Passive This is the initial
state. The executable can be invoked. Passive => Verification The MExE
executable is invoked. Verification (or Optimised Verification) The
verification can either be done according to the Verification state described
in D.4 or as an Optimised Verification described in (clause 6.2.2 \"Optimised
application signature verification\"). Verification => Executing The result of
the verification indicates that the executable may be executed. The Activated
state and its sub-state Executing are entered. Verification => final state The
MExE executable has changed its security state and it must not be executed.
Activated The MExE executable is activated. Executing This is a sub-state of
Activated. The executable executes (if it is not waiting for user permission).
Executing => final state The Executing state is left when the executable
terminates by itself. The Activated state is left and the Passive state is
entered. Waiting for user permission This is a sub-state to Executing. (If
there is support for multi-threaded applications, this state can be a state
concurrent to the Executing state.) The MExE executable is waiting for
permission to perform some action (clause 6.3.1 \"MExE executable permissions
for operator, manufacturer and third party security domains\"). Suspended This
is a sub-state of Activated. The execution is suspended (clause 5.3
\"Provisioning and management of services\"). Activated => Passive The
Activated state is left when the executable terminates by itself or when the
user terminates the executable (clause 5.3.5 \"Service termination\").
* * *
# D.3 Uninstalled Execution state
In the Uninstalled Execution state a MExE executable is executed without
installation.
* * *
**State or Transition (= >)** **Description** Transferring This is the initial
state of Uninstalled Execution. The MExE executable is transferred to the MExE
device. Transferring => Verification If the executable is signed the
Verification state is entered after the transferring is finished. Transferring
=> Executing If the executable is not signed the Executing state is entered.
(To allow streaming, this can be done before the transfer is finished.)
Verification This is a composite state. There is a description of the
Verification state in D.4. Verification => Executing The result of
verification indicates that the executable may be executed. Verification =>
final state The result of verification indicates that the executable must not
be executed and the Uninstalled Execution state is ended. Executing The MExE
executable is executing. Executing => final state The Executing state is left
when the execution terminates by itself (The Uninstalled Execution state is
left.) Waiting for user permission This is a sub-state to Executing. (If there
is support for multi-threaded applications, this state can be a state
concurrent to the Executing state.) The MExE executable is waiting for
permission to perform some action (clause 6.3.1 \"MExE executable permissions
for operator, manufacturer and third party security domains\"). Suspended The
execution is suspended (clause 5.3 \"Provisioning and management of
services\")
* * *
# D.4 Verification
The integrity and certification validation (clause 6.10 \"Certificate
management\") is done in the Verification state. The result of validation
determines the change of state.
* * *
**State** **Description** Validation This is the initial state. The integrity
and certification validation (clause 6.10 \"Certificate management\") is done.
Untrusted The executable is untrusted (clause 6.1 \"Generic security\")
Trusted in Operator Domain The executable is verified to belong to the
Operator Domain (clause 6.1 \"Generic security\"). Trusted in Manufacturer
Domain The executable is verified to belong to the Manufacturer Domain (clause
6.1 \"Generic security\"). Trusted in Third Party Domain The executable is
verified to belong to the Third Party Domain (clause 6.1 \"Generic
security\"). Deleted The executable is not permitted in any Domain and it is
deleted.

###### ## Annex E (informative): MExE conformance requirements
The table of Conformance Requirements define the minimum set of features that
a conformant MExE device must implement.
Legend:-
> M - Mandatory feature/requirement
>
> O - Optional feature
>
> N/A - Feature is not applicable: the MExE specification does not prevent
