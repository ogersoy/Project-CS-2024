# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 2 of the LoCation Services (LCS)
feature in UMTS, GSM and EPS (for E-UTRAN), which provides the mechanisms to
support mobile location services for operators, subscribers and third party
service providers.
The present document replaces the specifications TS 23.171 (Release 1999) and
the system and core network parts of GSM 03.71 (Release 1999). TS 43.059 [16]
replaces the radio access network parts of GSM 03.71 (Release 1999).
Location Services may be considered as a network provided enabling technology
consisting of standardised service capabilities, which enable the provision of
location applications. The application(s) may be service provider specific.
The description of the numerous and varied possible location applications
which are enabled by this technology are outside the scope of the present
document. However, clarifying examples of how the functionality being
described may be used to provide specific location services may be included.
This stage 2 service description covers the LCS system functional model for
the whole system, the LCS system architecture, state descriptions, message
flows, etc.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**CAMEL:** CAMEL is a network functionality, which provides the mechanisms of
Intelligent Network to a mobile user.
**Call Related:** any LCS related operation which is associated with an
established call in CS domain and a session via an active PDP context in PS
domain.
**Codeword:** access code, which is used by a Requestor or LCS Client in order
to gain acceptance of a location request for a Target UE. The codeword is part
of the privacy information that may be registered by a Target UE user.
**Current Location:** after a location attempt has successfully delivered a
location estimate and its associated time stamp, the location estimate and
time stamp is referred to as the \"current location\" at that point in time.
**Deferred location request:** location request where the location response
(responses) is (are) required after a specific event has occurred. The event
may or may not occur immediately.
**Global Navigation Satellite System:** Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) consists of three functional elements: Space Segment (satellites), User
Segment (receivers), and Control Segment (maintenance etc.). The GNSS receiver
calculates its own position based on the received time differences for several
satellites. GNSS include Global Positioning System (GPS) and GALILEO.
**Immediate location request:** location request where a single location
response only is required immediately
**Initial Location:** in the context of an originating emergency call the
location estimate and the associated time stamp at the commencement of the
call set-up is referred to as \"initial location\".
**Last Known Location:** current location estimate and its associated time
stamp for Target UE stored in the LCS Server is referred to as the \"last
known location\" and until replaced by a later location estimate and a new
time stamp is referred to as the \"last known location\".
**LCS (LoCation Services):** LCS is a service concept in system (e.g. GSM or
UMTS) standardization. LCS specifies all the necessary network elements and
entities, their functionalities, interfaces, as well as communication
messages, due to implement the positioning functionality in a cellular
network. Note that LCS does not specify any location based (value added)
services except locating of emergency calls.
**LCS Client:** software and/or hardware entity that interacts with a LCS
Server for the purpose of obtaining location information for one or more
Mobile Stations. LCS Clients subscribe to LCS in order to obtain location
information. LCS Clients may or may not interact with human users. The LCS
Client is responsible for formatting and presenting data and managing the user
interface (dialogue). The LCS Client may reside in the Mobile Station (UE).
**LCS Client Access barring list:** optional list of MSISDNs per LCS Client
where the LCS Client is not allowed to locate any MSISDN therein.
**LCS Client Subscription Profile:** collection of subscription attributes of
LCS related parameters that have been agreed for a contractual period of time
between the LCS client and the service provider.
**LCS Feature:** capability of a PLMN to support LCS Client/server
interactions for locating Target UEs.
**LCS QoS Class:** The QoS class determines the degree of adherence to the
quality of service information as required by the source of a location
request.
**LCS Server:** software and/or hardware entity offering LCS capabilities. The
LCS Server accepts requests, services requests, and sends back responses to
the received requests. The LCS server consists of LCS components, which are
distributed to one or more PLMN and/or service provider.
**LDR reference number:** the identity which is assigned and maintained by the
H-GMLC and circulated between the LCS Client, R-GMLC, H-GMLC, V-GMLC, MSC/SGSN
and UE. With the identity of the UE, the LDR reference number can unique
identify a Location Deferred Request. Notes: UE is involved only when the
event type of the deferred request is \"change of area\" or \"periodic
location\". In addition, in a Periodical Immediate/deferred LCS Service
Request, the LDR reference number is exclusive.
**Local Information:** information related to a given location, or general
information, which is made available in a given location.
**Local Service:** service, which can be exclusively provided in the current
serving network by a Value added Service Provider.
**Location (Based) Application:** location application is an application
software processing location information or utilizing it in some way. The
location information can be input by a user or detected by network or UE.
Navigation is one location application example.
**Location Based Service (LBS):** service provided either by teleoperator or a
3rd party service provider that utilizes the available location information of
the terminal. Location Application offers the User Interface for the service.
LBS is either a pull or a push type of service (see Location Dependent
Services and Location Independent Services). In ETSI/GSM documentation of
SoLSA, LBS is called \"Location Related Service\". ETSI and/or 3GPP -wide
terminology harmonization is expected here.
**Location Dependent Service:** service provided either by teleoperator or a
3rd party service provider that is available (pull type) or is activated (push
type) when the user arrives to a certain area. It doesn\'t require any
subscription in advance, but the push type activation shall be confirmed by
the user. The offered service itself can be any kind of service (e.g. a public
Xerox machine or the discount list in a store).
**Location Estimate:** geographic location of an UE and/or a valid Mobile
Equipment (ME), expressed in latitude and longitude data. The Location
Estimate shall be represented in a well-defined universal format. Translation
from this universal format to another geographic location system may be
supported, although the details are considered outside the scope of the
primitive services. The location estimate may include the velocity of the UE.
**Location Identifier:** information about the current location of the UE in
the network. Location is indicated in network terms, for example using the
global cell id in cellular networks, line-id in fixed broadband networks, the
(MAC) address of the WLAN AP or Location Object as defined by IETF RFC 4119
[40], (OMA-Location also uses this term, but OMA so far defines the Location
Identifier only for cellular access).
**Location Independent Service:** service provided either by teleoperator or a
3rd party service provider that is available and therefore can be activated
anywhere in the network coverage. It is activated by the user\'s request or by
other user\'s activated service, and therefore it requires a subscription in
advance (pull type). The offered service itself can be any kind of service
(e.g. MMS, SWDL, or LBS!).
**Location Retrieval Function (LRF):** this functional entity handles the
retrieval of location information for the UE including, where required,
interim location information, initial location information and updated
location information. The LRF may interact with a separate RDF or contain an
integrated RDF in order to obtain routing information. The LRF may interact
with a separate GMLC or contain an integrated GMLC in order to obtain location
information. The LRF may interact with or contain other types of location
server functions in order to obtain location information.
**Mobile Assisted positioning:** any mobile centric positioning method (e.g.
IPDL-OTDOA, E-OTD, GPS) in which the UE provides position measurements to the
network for computation of a location estimate by the network. The network may
provide assistance data to the UE to enable position measurements and/or
improve measurement performance.
**Mobile Based positioning:** any mobile centric positioning method (e.g.
IPDL-OTDOA, E-OTD, GPS) in which the UE performs both position measurements
and computation of a location estimate and where assistance data useful or
essential to one or both of these functions is provided to the UE by the
network. Position methods where an UE performs measurements and location
computation without network assistance data are not considered within this
category.
**Mobile Station:** mobile station (MS) consists of Mobile or User Equipment
(ME or UE) with a valid SIM or USIM attached. The abbreviation \"UE\" in this
specification refers both to MS and User Equipment, see below.
**MO-LR Short Circuit:** use of an MO-LR based procedure to provide a location
estimate directly from the UE to the serving SGSN or MSC using a Mobile Based
positioning method (e.g. GPS) according to the requested LCS QoS and that is
not obtained or verified by the RAN.
**Non-dialable call back number:** In case of a SIM-less emergency call, or a
non-registered (U)SIM emergency call, a non-dialable callback number shall be
used to identify the target UE. The format and structure of the non-dialable
callback number is according to national or regional regulations.
**Non-registered (U)SIM emergency call:** The emergency call where the U(SIM)
has not been authenticated and have not been registered in the VLR. Examples
of such cases could be emergency call from a blocked (U)SIM due to mistyped
PIN, or when the UE is in \"enter PIN\" mode, or the emergency call is
performed in another network with no roaming agreement with the home PLMN. Any
IMSI retrieved from such a (U)SIM cannot be trusted and so cannot be used to
identify the calling party.
**PLMN Access barring list:** optional list of MSISDN per PLMN where any LCS
Client is not allowed to locate any MSISDN therein except for certain
exceptional cases.
**Positioning (/location detecting):** positioning is a functionality, which
detects a geographical location and optionally, velocity (of e.g. a mobile
terminal).
**Positioning method (/locating method):** method or technical solution, which
is used to get an estimate of the target mobile\'s geographical location. For
example positioning methods based on radio cell coverage, GPS or Assisted GPS
methods, which are based on the Time-Of-Arrival (TOA) algorithm, and OTDOA or
E-OTD methods, which are based on the Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA)
algorithm. The positioning methods are further described in E-UTRAN Stage 2,
TS 36.305 [42], UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059
[16].
**Predefined area:** geographical area, which is not related to cell or radio
coverage. The mobile may take special action when it recognises it has entered
or left a predefined area.
**Privacy Class:** list of LCS Clients defined within a privacy exception
class to which permission may be granted to locate the target UE. The
permission shall be granted either on activation by the target UE or
permanently for a contractual period of time agreed between the target UE and
the service provider.
**Privacy Exception List:** list consisting of various types of privacy
classes (i.e. operator related, personal etc.). Certain types of classes may
require agreement between the service provider and the target UE.
**Privacy Profile Register, PPR: The PPR stores privacy information of the
target mobile**. The PPR also executes privacy checks and sends the privacy
check results to other network elements using the Lpp interface. PPR may be a
standalone network entity or the PPR functionality may be integrated in
H-GMLC.
**Prohibited area:** area where the mobile must not activate its transmitter.
The Prohibited area may be a Predefined area described above or related to
radio cell(s).
**Pseudo-external identity:** The pseudo-external identity is not the identity
of real external LCS client but the identity, which is used for notifying the
result of the enhanced privacy check. The pseudo-external identity shall keep
the compatibility with pre Rel-6 privacy mechanisms, which does not understand
privacy check result made by H-GMLC/PPR. Each operator defines its own the
pseudo-external identities.
**Pseudonym:** A fictitious identity, which may be used to conceal the true
identity (i.e. MSISDN and IMSI) of a target UE from the requestor and the LCS
client.
**Pseudonym mediation device** : Functionality that verifies pseudonyms to
verinyms.
**Request id:** identity which is used to identify the correspondence of a
location request to multiple responses when the Response method is ASYNC. Each
receiving GMLC (R-GMLC or V-GMLC or H-GMLC) allocates and maintains the
Request id to identify each ASYNC location request, and includes it in the
responses to the source entity of the location request (i.e. LCS client or
GMLC).
**Requestor** : the originating entity which has requested the location of the
target UE from the LCS client.
**Requestor Identity** : This identifier is identifying the Requestor and can
be e.g. MSISDN or logical name.
**Response method:** method how a GMLC, which receives a location request
message from another entity (i.e. LCS client or GMLC), responds to the
location request. There are two methods, synchronous (SYNC) and asynchronous
(ASYNC). When the requesting entity wishes multiple responses (either about
one or several target UE\'s location) to a single location request the
procedure is ASYNC and when the requesting entity wishes a single response the
procedure is SYNC. The source entity of the location request (i.e. LCS client
or GMLC) can choose a preferred method and informs the method to the receiving
GMLC. However, the selection of the method used is made by the receiving GMLC
and when the ASYNC method is selected the Request id is notified to the source
entity. The receiving GMLC can turn a SYNC request into an ASYNC procedure,
e.g. in an overload situation, and the source entity (i.e. LCS client or GMLC)
should be able to receive multiple responses even though the request was SYNC.
**Routing Determination Function (RDF):** The functional entity, which may be
integrated in a Location Server (e.g. GMLC) or in an LRF, provides the proper
PSAP destination address to the E-CSCF for routing the emergency request. It
can interact with a location functional entity (e.g. GMLC) to manage ESQK
allocation and management, and deliver location information to the PSAP.
**Service Area Identifier (SAI)** : information, which is used to identify an
area consisting of one or more cells belonging to the same Location Area, see
TS 25.413 [14]. Such an area is called a Service Area and can be used for
indicating the location of a UE to the CN. For this specification, only a
Service Area that is defined to be applicable to the PS and CS domains shall
be used.
**Service coverage** : a list of country codes where an LCS client offers its
location services. Country code in this context means E.164 country code for a
geographic area [35a].
**Service Type** : attribute of specific location based service provided by
the LCS client, as defined in TS 22.071 [4].
**Serving cell identity** : the Cell Global Identification (CGI), see TS
23.003 [17], of the cell currently used by the target UE, e.g. for an
emergency call in A-mode.
**SIM-less emergency call:** The emergency call that is originated from a UE,
which does not have a SIM or USIM.
**Subscription Profile:** profile detailing the subscription to various types
of privacy classes.
**Target area:** geographical area which is used for change of area type
deferred location request. The target area is defined by the LCS client and is
expressed as geographical area using a shape defined in TS 23.032 [11], as a
geographical area using local coordinate system, as an E.164 country code for
a geographic area [35a], as a PLMN identity or as a geopolitical name of the
area (e.g. London).
**Target UE:** UE being positioned.
**User Equipment:** term \'User Equipment\', or \'UE\', as defined in TR
21.905 [3]. UE in this specification may also refer to a Mobile Equipment or
User Equipment used for emergency calls, that do not have valid SIM or USIM.
**Velocity:** The speed of a UE and the direction in which it is travelling,
encoded as defined in TS 23.032 [11]. Velocity may be defined as either 2-D
(horizontal) velocity or 3-D (horizontal and vertical) velocity. Both 2-D and
3-D velocity may be reported either with or without uncertainty.
**Verinym** : True identity, i.e. MSISDN or IMSI, of the target UE.
Further UMTS related definitions are given in TS 22.101 [8].

# 4 Main concepts
A general description of location services and service requirements are given
in the specification TS 22.071 [4]. The positioning of the UE is a service
provided by the Access Network. In particular, all Access Networks (e.g.
UTRAN, GERAN, E-UTRAN), that facilitate determination of the locations of User
Equipments, shall be able to exchange location information with the core
network as defined in the present document (when connected to a Core Network).
Optionally, location information may also be communicated between GMLCs,
located in the same or a different PLMN, via the specified GMLC to GMLC
interface.
By making use of the radio signals the capability to determine the
(geographic) location of the user equipment (UE) or mobile station (UE) shall
be provided. The location information may be requested by and reported to a
client (application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached
to the Core Network. The location information may also be utilised internally
in the system; for example, for location assisted handover or to support other
features such as home location billing. The location information request may
ask for the velocity of the UE as part of the positioning information. The
position information shall be reported in standard, i.e. geographical co-
ordinates, together with the time-of-day and the estimated errors
(uncertainty) of the location of the UE according to specification TS 23.032
[11]. The velocity of the UE may be optionally returned in a format specified
in TS 23.032 [11].
It shall be possible for the majority of the UE (active or idle) within a
network to use the feature without compromising the radio transmission or
signalling capabilities of the GSM/UMTS/EPS networks.
The UE and the network may support a number of different positioning methods
and the UE may support or not support privacy invocation request and response.
The UE informs the core network and radio access network about its LCS
capabilities in this respect as defined in TS 24.008 [24] and TS 25.331 [25].
The uncertainty of the location measurement shall be network design
(implementation) dependent at the choice of the network operator, this is
further described in TS 25.305 [1], TS 36.305 [42], and TS 43.059 [16].
There are many different possible uses for the location information. The
positioning feature may be used internally by the GSM/UMTS/EPS network (or
attached networks), by value-added network services, by the UE itself or
through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The positioning feature
may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-
added\"), but the position service is not exclusively for emergencies.
There are regulatory requirements to support anonymity in location services in
some countries.
## 4.1 Assumptions
As a basis for the further development work on LCS in GSM, UMTS and EPS the
following assumptions apply:
\- positioning methods are Access Network specific, although commonalties
should be encouraged between Access Networks;
\- commercial location services are only applicable for an UE with a valid SIM
or USIM;
\- the provision of the location services in the Access Network is optional
through support of the specified method(s);
\- the provision of location services is optional in MSC, SGSN and MME;
\- LCS is applicable to any target UE whether or not the UE supports LCS, but
with restrictions on choice of positioning method or notification of a
location request to the UE user when LCS or individual positioning methods,
respectively, are not supported by the UE;
\- LCS shall be applicable for both circuit switched and packet switched
services;
\- the location information may be used for internal system operations to
improve system performance;
\- it shall be possible to accommodate future techniques of measurement and
processing to take advantage of advancing technology so as to meet new service
requirements;
\- it may be necessary to support LCS signalling between separate access
networks via the core network. For UMTS, the Iur interface should be used if
available;
\- Provide positioning procedures through the circuit-switched domain are also
applicable to GPRS UEs which are GPRS and IMSI attached;
\- it shall be possible for more than one LCS Client to request and obtain the
location of the same target UE at the same time.
## 4.2 Location Services Categories
Generally there are four categories of usage of the location service. These
are the Commercial LCS, the Internal LCS, the Emergency LCS and the Lawful
Intercept LCS. The definition of these services and their categories is
outside the scope of the present document.
\- The Commercial LCS (or Value Added Services) will typically be associated
with an application that provides a value-added service to the subscriber of
the service, through knowledge of the UE location (and optionally, velocity)
and if available, and at the operator\'s discretion, the positioning method
used to obtain the location estimate. This may be, for example, a directory of
restaurants in the local area of the UE, together with directions for reaching
them from the current UE location.
\- The Internal LCS will typically be developed to make use of the location
information of the UE for Access Network internal operations. This may
include; for example, location assisted handover and traffic and coverage
measurement. This may also include support certain O&M related tasks,
supplementary services, IN related services and GSM bearer services and
teleservices.
\- The Emergency LCS will typically be part of a service provided to assist
subscribers who place emergency calls. In this service, the location of the UE
caller and, if available, the positioning method used to obtain the location
estimate is provided to the emergency service provider to assist them in their
response. This service may be mandatory in some jurisdictions. In the United
States, for example, this service is mandated for all mobile voice
subscribers.
\- The Lawful Intercept LCS will use the location information to support
various legally required or sanctioned services.
## 4.3 Positioning methods
The LCS feature utilises one or more positioning methods in order to determine
the location of user equipment (UE). Determining the position of a UE involves
two main steps:
\- Radio signal measurements; and
\- Position estimate computation based on the measurements.
The positioning methods for UTRAN are further described in TS 25.305 [1].
### 4.3.1 Standard LCS Methods in UTRAN
The specification TS 25.305 [1] UTRAN Stage 2 specifies the locating methods
to be supported:
\- cell coverage based positioning method;
\- OTDOA positioning method;
\- A-GNSS based positioning methods;
\- U-TDOA positioning method.
For more details on these positioning methods, refer to TS 25.305 [1].
### 4.3.2 Standard LCS Methods in GERAN
The specification TS 43.059 [16] GERAN LCS Stage 2 specifies the locating
methods to be supported in GERAN:
\- cell coverage based positioning method;
\- Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD) positioning method;
\- A-GNSS based positioning methods;
\- Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (U-TDOA) positioning method.
### 4.3.3 Standard LCS Methods in E-UTRAN
Locating methods specified in TS 36.305 [42] applicable to E-UTRAN comprise:
\- uplink and downlink cell coverage based positioning methods;
\- OTDOA positioning method;
\- A-GNSS based positioning methods.
Hybrid positioning using multiple methods from the list of positioning methods
above is also supported..
In case of the Home eNodeB, applicable locating methods may be restricted,
e.g. when a Home eNodeB is connected via Home eNodeB GW.
## 4.4 Types of Location Request
### 4.4.1 Immediate Location Request
Request for location where the LCS Server replies immediately to the LCS
Client with the current location estimate if this could be obtained.
### 4.4.2 Deferred Location Request
Request for location contingent on some current or future events where the
response from the LCS Server to the LCS Client may occur some time after the
request was sent.
NOTE: Deferred Location Request is not supported for E-UTRAN Access in this
version of the TS.
#### 4.4.2.1 Types of event
a) UE available: Any event in which the MSC/SGSN has established a contact
with the UE. Note, this event is considered to be applicable when the UE is
temporarily unavailable due to inaction by the user, temporarily loss of radio
connectivity or IMSI detach and so on. Note that IMSI detach is only
applicable in the case the UE has previously been registered and information
is still kept in the node. The UE Available event only requires one response
and after this response, the UE Available event is concluded.
b) Change of Area: An event where the UE enters or leaves a pre-defined
geographical area or if the UE is currently within the pre-defined
geographical area. The LCS client defines the target area as a geographical
area, as an E.164 country code for a geographic area [35a], as a PLMN identity
or as a geopolitical name of the area. The LCS server may translate and define
the target area as the identities of one or more radio cells, location areas,
routing areas, country code or PLMN identity. The target UE must not give the
target UE user access to the area definitions and network identities. The
change of area event may be reported one time only, or several times. The area
event report must not be repeated more often than allowed by the LCS client.
The change of area event report shall contain an indication of the event
occurrence. The location estimate may be included in the report.
c) Periodic Location: An event where a defined periodic timer expires in the
UE and activates a location report or a location request.
d) Other events are FFS.
## 4.5 Concurrent Location Requests
The LCS Server is enabled to support concurrent location requests for the same
target UE. The following principles apply.
1\. Under certain conditions, an entity may combine concurrent location
requests by fully executing one request and using the ensuing location
estimate result(s) to satisfy the other request(s) without fully executing the
latter and as allowed by QoS requirements. The allowed conditions for each
type of entity are defined below:
a) An R‑GMLC may combine concurrent MT‑LR requests for the same target UE‑LCS
Client pair.
b) An H‑GMLC may combine concurrent MT‑LR requests for the same target UE if
privacy requirements can be fully resolved by the H‑GMLC (e.g. no notification
or verification needed for the UE for any MT‑LR that will not be fully
executed).
c) A V‑GMLC may combine concurrent MT‑LR and NI‑LR related location requests
for the same target UE provided it is clear and unambiguous for any MT‑LR that
will not be fully executed (e.g. from the contents of any MAP Provide
Subscriber Location request received from the H‑GMLC) that no outstanding
privacy related actions are required for the UE (e.g. no privacy notification
and/or privacy verification interaction with the UE and no privacy
subscription verification in the VLR, SGSN or MME).
d) An MSC, MSC server, SGSN or MME may combine concurrent MT‑LR, MO‑LR and
NI‑LR location requests once any needed privacy related actions (e.g. UE
notification and verification) have been performed for each MT‑LR.
e) A UE may combine concurrent MO‑LR requests for LCS Clients internal to or
associated with the UE.
2\. Except under the conditions permitted in (1), different concurrent
location requests shall be treated separately and shall not be visibly
combined or made dependent on one another by any entity within the LCS Server.
This means that the procedures defined here in clause 9 continue to apply to
each separate location request and do not visibly impact one another.
3\. Implementation limitations are allowed whereby an entity that, either
itself or in association with another entity, cannot support concurrent
location requests or more than a certain number of concurrent location
requests is allowed to reject or defer a new concurrent request or cancel one
or more existing requests. When concurrent location requests are supported,
each entity needs to ensure it correlates each location/position response with
the associated request.
4\. In support of principles 1, 2 and 3, an entity (e.g. GMLC, MSC, MSC
server, SGSN, MME, UE) that receives a new location request (e.g. MT‑LR,
MO‑LR, NI‑LR) while already supporting previous location requests for the same
target UE may reject the new location request, defer (i.e. queue) the new
request, cancel one or more previous requests (where a procedure for
cancellation has been defined), allow the new location request to proceed
concurrently with and separately from the previous requests if allowed on
applicable interfaces or, for the specific cases defined in principle 1,
combine the new request with one or more previous requests if this will not
impair or affect service support for the new request (e.g. privacy and QoS).
5\. In support of principle 4, LCS Client priority and any other relevant
priority information (e.g. UE subscription preferences) should be considered.
In particular, location requests associated with emergency services or lawful
interception clients should be given priority over other location requests.
# 5 General LCS architecture
## 5.1 LCS access interfaces
One or more LCS Clients may access a Location Server via its Le interface.
Location Servers, resident in the same or different PLMNs, may communicate
with each other, indirectly, via the Lg interface to their associated
MSC/SGSNs. Optionally, the Lr interface, as specified for direct GMLC to GMLC
messaging, may be used for this purpose. For EPS, Location Servers, resident
in the same PLMN, may communicate via the SLg interface to their associated
MME. A fuller description of the LCS architecture, together with a diagram
showing other LCS related interfaces, can be found in clause 6.
Figure 5.1: LCS Access Interfaces and Reference Points
## 5.2 LCS Functional diagram, high level functions
TS 22.071 [4] describes LCS services from the LCS client point of view. In the
present document, a more detailed description of LCS is given. The LCS
functional diagram shown in figure 5.2 depicts the interaction of the LCS
client and the LCS server within the PLMN. The PLMN uses the various LCS
components within the LCS server to provide the target UE Location Information
to the LCS client.
Figure 5.2: LCS capability server Functional Diagram
The following list gives the logical functional entities for the LCS. Two main
functional groupings are defined which encompass a number of smaller
functions.
The LCS Functional entities are grouped as follows:
\- the LCS Client functional group;
\- the LCS Server functional group consists of functions in the GSM, UMTS or
EPS PLMN supporting LCS:
\- client handling component;
\- system handling component;
\- subscriber handling component;
\- positioning component.
The functions of the LCS Client and the LCS Server in the PLMN are described
in more detail in this clause.
The allocation of LCS functions to network elements is specified in clause 6.
## 5.3 LCS Client functional group
An LCS client contains an LCS component with one or more client(s), which by
using location information can provide location, based services.
An LCS client is a logical functional entity that requests from the LCS server
in the PLMN location information for one or more than one target UE within a
specified set of parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS). The LCS Client
may reside in an entity (including the UE) within the PLMN or in an entity
external to the PLMN.
The specification of the LCS Client\'s internal logic and its relation to the
external use is outside the scope of the present document.
### 5.3.1 External Location Client Function (LCF)
The Location Client Function (LCF) provides a logical interface between the
LCS client and the LCS server.
This function is responsible for requesting location information for one or
more UEs, with a specified \"QoS\" and receiving a response, which contains
either location information or a failure indicator.
## 5.4 LCS Server functional group
The LCS server functional group consists of the functions that are needed for
GSM, UMTS and EPS to support Location Services.
### 5.4.1 Client handling component
#### 5.4.1.1 Location Client Control Function (LCCF)
The Location Client Control Function (LCCF) manages the external interface
towards LCF. The LCCF identifies the LCS client by requesting client
verification and authorization (i.e. verifies that the LCS client is allowed
to position the subscriber) through interaction with the Location Client
Authorization Function (LCAF). The LCCF handles mobility management for
location services (LCS) e.g., forwarding of positioning requests to VMSC, SGSN
or MME. The LCCF determines if the final positioning estimate satisfies the
QoS for the purpose of retry/reject. The LCCF provides flow control of
positioning requests between simultaneous positioning requests. It may order
the Location Client Co-ordinate Transformation Function (LCCTF) to perform a
transformation to local co-ordinates. It may also order a transformation of
local co-ordinates to network identities via the Location System Co-ordinate
Transformation Function (LSCTF). It also generates charging and billing
related data for LCS via the Location System Billing Function (LSBF).
#### 5.4.1.2 Location Client Authorization Function (LCAF)
The Location Client Authorization Function (LCAF) is responsible for providing
access and subscription authorization to a client. Specifically, it provides
authorization to a LCS client requesting access to the network and authorizes
the subscription of a client. LCAF provides authorization to a LCS client
requesting Location Information of a specific UE.
##### 5.4.1.2.1 Access Subfunction
An _Access_ _Subfunction_ enables LCS clients to access LCS services. This
subfunction provides verification and authorization of the requesting client.
When a LCS is requested, the Access Subfunction uses the information stored in
the LCS client _subscription profile_ to verify that:
\- the LCS client is registered; and
\- the LCS client is authorized to use the specified LCS request type;
\- the LCS client is allowed to request location information for the
subscriber(s) specified in the LCS request.
##### 5.4.1.2.2 Subscription Subfunction
The LCS client Subscription profile shall contain a minimum set of parameters
assigned on per LCS client basis for an agreed contractual period. The LCS
client profile shall contain the following set of access parameters:
\- LCS client identity;
\- allowed LCS request types (i.e. LIR, LDR or both) (see note);
\- maximum number of subscribers allowed in a single LCS request;
\- priority;
\- position override indicator;
\- state(s);
\- event(s) (applicable to LDR requests only);
\- local coordinate system;
\- LCS client access barring list (optional);
\- PLMN access barring list applicability.
NOTE: LIR = Location Immediate Request; and\ LDR = Location Deferred Request.
For certain authorized LCS client internal to the PLMN, a subscription profile
is unnecessary. These clients are empowered to access any defined service that
is not barred for an UE subscriber. This permits positioning of emergency
calls without the need for pre-subscription.
#### 5.4.1.3 Location Client Co-ordinate Transformation Function (LCCTF)
The Location Client Co-ordinate Transformation Function (LCCTF) provides
conversion of a location estimate expressed according to a universal latitude
and longitude system into an estimate expressed according to a local
geographic system understood by the LCF and known as location information. The
local system required for a particular LCF will be either known from
subscription information or explicitly indicated by the LCF. The LCCTF also
provides the conversion of a target area to either a shape as defined in TS
23.032 [11], a PLMN, or country code. This is performed only if target area
information is received from the LCS Client.
#### 5.4.1.4 Location Client Zone Transformation Function (LCZTF)
_The Location Client Zone Transformation Function (LCZTF) performs
transformations of a location (latitude and longitude) into a zone identity,
which in North America identifies a particular emergency services zone_.
### 5.4.2 System handling component
#### 5.4.2.1 Location System Control Function(LSCF)
The Location System Control Function (LSCF) is responsible for co-ordinating
location requests. This function manages call-related and non-call-related
positioning requests of LCS and allocates network resources for handling them.
The LSCF retrieves UE classmark information for the purpose of determining the
LCS capabilities of UE.
The LSCF performs call setup if required as part of a LCS e.g., putting the UE
on dedicated radio resources. It also caters for co-ordinating resources and
activities with regard to requests related to providing assistance data needed
for positioning. This function interfaces with the LCCF, LSPF, LSBF and PRCF.
Using these interfaces, it conveys positioning requests to the PRCF, relays
positioning data to the LCCF and passes charging related data to the LSBF.
The U-LSCF for UTRAN is further described in TS 25.305 [1], LSCF for GERAN is
described in TS 43.059 [16].
#### 5.4.2.2 Location System Billing Function (LSBF)
The Location System Billing Function (LSBF) is responsible for charging and
billing activity within the network related to location services (LCS). This
includes charging and billing of both clients and subscribers. Specifically,
it collects charging related data and data for accounting between PLMNs.
#### 5.4.2.3 Location System Operations Function (LSOF)
The Location System Operations Function (LSOF) is responsible for provisioning
of data, positioning capabilities, data related to clients and subscription
(LCS client data and UE data), validation, fault management and performance
management of LCS.
An LSOF may be associated with each entity.
#### 5.4.2.4 Location System Broadcast Function (LSBcF)
The Location System Broadcast Function (LSBcF) provides broadcast capability.
The LSBcF capability is only used when broadcast data is required for E-OTD,
OTDOA or A-GNSS positioning methods.
#### 5.4.2.5 Location System Co-ordinate Transformation Function (LSCTF)
The Location System Co-ordinate Transformation Function (LSCTF) provides the
conversion of an area definition, expressed in a geographic shape as defined
in TS 23.032 [11], to network identities recognised only within a PLMN (such
as Cell Identity, Location Area Identity). The area definition may convert to
more than one network identity such as a collection of Cell Global Identities.
#### 5.4.2.6 Location IMS -- Interworking Function (LIMS-IWF)
The Location IMS -- Interworking Function (LIMS-IWF) in the requesting network
provides the capability to route LCS service requests based on an IMS Public
User Identity (SIP-URI) to the home network of the target user. The LIMS-IWF
in the home network of the target user is responsible to determine the
appropriate HSS and to obtain the MSISDN associated with a IMS Public User
Identity from the HSS.
### 5.4.3 Subscriber handling Component
#### 5.4.3.1 Location Subscriber Authorization Function (LSAF)
The Location Subscriber Authorization Function (LSAF) is responsible for
authorizing the provision of a location service (LCS) for a particular mobile
station (UE with SIM/USIM). Specifically, this function validates that a LCS
can be applied to a given subscriber. In case LCF is in the UE then LSAF
verifies that the UE subscriber has subscribed to the requested LCS service.
LSAF also detects if the identity used to address the target UE is a
pseudonym. If the identity used is detected as a pseudonym, the LSAF can then
call the Location Subscriber Translation Function to perform the translation
to verinym.
#### 5.4.3.2 Location Subscriber Translation Function (LSTF)
The Location Subscriber Translation Function (LSTF) is responsible for the
mapping between pseudonyms and verinyms of the target UE.
#### 5.4.3.3 Location Subscriber Privacy Function (LSPF)
The Location Subscriber Privacy function is responsible performs all privacy
related authorizations. For a target UE it shall authorize the positioning
request versus the privacy options of the target UE, if any.
### 5.4.4 Positioning components
The positioning components Positioning Radio Co-ordination Function (PRCF),
Positioning Calculation Function (PCF), Positioning Signal Measurement
Function (PSMF) and Positioning Radio Resource Management (PRRM) are described
in documents specific to each Access Network type.
For location services for GSM and UMTS, the Access Network shall send the
result of the positioning to the core network in geographical co-ordinates as
defined in TS 23.032 [11]. For location services for EPS (for E-UTRAN access),
the E-SMLC shall determine the result of the positioning in geographical co-
ordinates as defined in TS 23.032 [11]. If requested and if available, the
positioning result may also include the velocity of the UE as defined in TS
23.032 [11]. The Access Network or E-SMLC shall map the cell(s) the Target UE
is associated with into geographical co-ordinates, but this mapping is not
standardized.
These entities are defined in TS 36.305 [42] for E-UTRAN, TS 25.305 [1] for
UTRAN and in TS 43.059 [16] for GERAN.
## 5.5 Information Flows between Client and Server

addition to the information flow specified here.
Any of the information flows here indicated may not be externally realized if
the information does not flow over an open interface.
### 5.5.1 Location Service Request
Via the Location Service Request, the LCS client communicates with the LCS
server to request for the location information of one or more than one UE

# 6 LCS Architecture
Figure 6.1 shows the general arrangement of the Location Service feature in
GSM, UMTS and EPS. This illustrates, generally, the relation of LCS Clients
and servers in the core network with the GERAN, UTRAN and E‑UTRAN Access
Networks. The LCS entities within the Access Network communicate with the Core
Network (CN) across the A, Gb, Iu and S1 interfaces. Communication among the
Access Network LCS entities makes use of the messaging and signalling
capabilities of the Access Network.
As part of their service or operation, the LCS Clients may request the
location information of UE. There may be more than one LCS client. These may
be associated with the GSM/UMTS/EPS networks or the Access Networks operated
as part of a UE application or accessed by the UE through its access to an
application (e.g. through the Internet).
The clients make their requests to a LCS Server. There may be more than one
LCS Server. The client must be authenticated and the resources of the network
must be co-ordinated including the UE and the calculation functions, to
estimate the location and optionally, velocity of the UE and result returned
to the client. As part of this process, information from other systems (other
Access Networks) can be used. As part of the location information returned to
the client, an estimate of the accuracy of the estimate and the time-of-day
the measurement was made may be provided.
NOTE 1: HSS includes both 2G-HLR and 3G-HLR functionality. LCS is included in
the overall network architecture in TS 23.002 [20].
NOTE 2: As one alternative the LCS client may get location information
directly from GMLC, which may contain OSA Mobility SCS with support for the
OSA user location interfaces. See TS 23.127 [26] and TS 29.198 [27, 28, 29 and
30].
NOTE 3: The PPR functionality may be integrated in GMLC
NOTE 4: The PMD functionality may be integrated in GMLC or PPR.
NOTE 5: The LIMS-IWF may optionally be located within the GMLC.
NOTE 6: LRF may interact with a separate GMLC or contain an integrated GMLC.
NOTE 7: the SLP, which may be an H-SLP, V-SLP or E-SLP, may optionally be
associated with an E-SMLC in order to share assistance data for support of
both control plane LCS and OMA SUPL for an operator who deploys both
solutions. Interaction between the E-SMLC and SLP is outside the scope of this
TS.

## 6.1 Schematic functional description of LCS operations
The allocation of LCS functional blocks to the Client, LCS server, Core
Network, Access Network and UE is based on the schematic functional
description below. The detailed functions and interactions are specified later
in the present document and in TS 36.305 [42] for E-UTRAN, TS 25.305 [1] for
UTRAN, in TS 43.059 [16] for GERAN and in corresponding Stage 3
specifications.
The operation begins with a LCS Client requesting location information for a
UE from the LCS server. The LCS server will pass the request to the LCS
functional entities in the core network. The LCS functional entities in the
core network shall then:
\- verify that the LCS Client is authorized to request the location of the UE
or subscriber;
\- verify that LCS is supported by the UE;
\- establish whether it is allowed to locate the UE or subscriber, for privacy
or other reasons;
\- establish which network element in the Access Network for GERAN or UTRAN,
or EPC for E‑UTRAN, should receive the Location request;
\- request the Access Network (via the A, Gb or Iu interface) for GERAN or
UTRAN, or the E-SMLC (via the SLs interface) for E‑UTRAN, to provide location
information for an identified UE, with indicated QoS;
\- receive information about the location of the UE from the Access Network or
E-SMLC and forward it to the Client;
\- send appropriate accounting information to an accounting function.
The Access Network LCS functional entities shall determine the position of the
target UE according to TS 36.305 [42] for E-UTRAN, TS 25.305 [1] for UTRAN and
TS 43.059 [16] for GERAN.
## 6.2 Allocation of LCS functions to network elements
Table 6.1 shows a summary of the Functional Groups and Functional Blocks for
Location services. Table 6.2 and figure 6.2 show the generic configuration for
LCS and the distribution of LCS functional blocks to network elements.
Different positioning methods, including network-based, mobile-based, mobile-
assisted and network-assisted positioning methods may be used. With this
configuration both the network and the mobiles are able to measure the timing
of signals and compute the mobile\'s location estimate. Depending on the
applied positioning method it is possible to utilise the corresponding
configuration containing all needed entities. For instance, if network-based
positioning is applied, the entities that are involved in measuring the
mobile\'s signal and calculating its location estimate are allocated to the
network elements of the access stratum. On the other hand, in case mobile-
based or network-assisted methods are used these entities should be allocated
to the UE.
LCS is logically implemented on the network structure through the addition of
one network node, the Mobile Location Centre (MLC). It is necessary to name a
number of new interfaces. The LCS generic architecture can be combined to
produce LCS architecture variants.
Table 6.1: Summary of Functional Groups and Functional Blocks for Location
services

Tables 6.2 and 6.2a and figure 6.2 illustrate the allocation of functional
entities in the reference configuration of LCS. It is assumed that the CS and
PS have either their own independent mobility management or use the joint
mobility management through the optional Gs interface.
It is also seen that LCS may take benefit of the Iur interface between RNCs,
when uplink radio information and measurement results are collected.
The functional model presented in the figure includes functional entities for
both CS and PS related LCS. In addition, it consists of all the entities
needed for different positioning methods, i.e. network based, mobile based,
mobile assisted, and network assisted positioning, exploiting either uplink or
downlink measurements. Similarly, the velocity of a UE may be calculated in
either the network or the UE. It is noted that the UE may use e.g. the GPS
positioning mechanism, but still demand e.g. auxiliary measurements from the
serving network. RAN specific functional entities are specified in TS 36.305
[42] for E‑UTRAN, TS 25.305 [1] for UTRAN and in TS 43.059 [16] for GERAN.

## 6.3 Functional description of LCS per network element
### 6.3.1 Access Network
The Access Network is involved in the handling of various positioning
procedures.
The LCS specific functionalities of the radio access network elements are
specified in TS 36.305 [42] for E-UTRAN, TS 25.305 [1] for UTRAN and TS 43.059
[16] for GERAN.
### 6.3.2 LCS Clients, LCS applications and Requestors
There are two classes of LCS Application - Internal applications and External
applications. Internal applications represent entities internal to the
GSM/UMTS/EPC that make use of location information for the (improved)
operation of the network. Internal LCS client can be identified by LCS client
internal ID. LCS client Internal ID distinguishes the following classes: (LCS
client broadcasting location related information, O&M LCS client in the HPLMN,
O&M LCS client in the VPLMN, LCS client recording anonymous location
information, LCS Client supporting a bearer service, teleservice or
supplementary service to the target UE). External applications represent
entities (such as Commercial or Emergency services) that make use of location
information for operations external to the mobile communications network.
External LCS client can be identified by LCS client external ID. The LCS
Applications interface to the LCS entities through their Location Client
functions (LCF). Location requests from the external LCS clients may be
originated by external entities (i.e. Requestor). LCS client should
authenticate the Requestor Identity but this is outside the scope of this
specification.
LCS client may indicate the type of the Requestor identity in the LCS service
request. The type of the Requestor identity can be one of the following:
\- Logical name
\- MSISDN (TS 23.003 [17])
\- E-mail address (RFC 2396 [33])
\- URL (RFC 2396 [33])
\- SIP URL (RFC 3261 [34])
\- IMS public identity (TS 23.228 [35])
The LCS Client, LCS applications and Requestors are outside the scope of the
present document.
### 6.3.3 Gateway Mobile Location Centre, GMLC
The Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC) contains functionality required to
support LCS. In one PLMN, there may be more than one GMLC.
A GMLC is the first node an external LCS client accesses in a PLMN (i.e. the
Le reference point is supported by the GMLC). The GMLC may request routing
information from the HLR via the Lh interface or HSS via the SLh/Lh interface.
After performing registration authorization, it sends positioning requests to
either VMSC, SGSN, MSC Server or MME and receives final location estimates
from the corresponding entity via the Lg or SLg interface. Information needed
for authorisation, location service requests and location information may be
communicated between GMLCs, located in the same or different PLMNs, via the Lr
interface. The target UE\'s privacy profile settings shall always be checked
in the UE\'s home PLMN prior to delivering a location estimate. In order to
allow location request from a GMLC outside the HPLMN while having privacy
check in the HPLMN, the Lr interface is needed.
The \"Requesting GMLC\" is the GMLC, which receives the request from LCS
client.
The \"Visited GMLC\" is the GMLC, which is associated with the serving node of
the target mobile.
The \"Home GMLC\" is the GMLC residing in the target mobile\'s home PLMN,
which is responsible for the control of privacy checking of the target mobile.
The Requesting GMLC can be the Visited GMLC, and either one or both of which
can be the Home GMLC at the same time.
### 6.3.3A Location Retrieval Function, LRF
Location Retrieval Function (LRF) may be collocated with the GMLC or separate
and is responsible for retrieving or validating location information,
providing routing and/or correlation info of an UE that has initiated an IMS
emergency session. The information is provided to the E-CSCF via the Ml
interface. For detail, refer to TS 23.167 [36a].
### 6.3.4 LCS support in the UE
The UE may be involved in the various positioning procedures. Specific UE
involvement is specified in each of the positioning procedures specified in TS
36.305 [42] in E-UTRAN, TS 25.305 [1] for UTRAN and TS 43.059 [16] for GERAN.
The UE interacts with the measurement co-ordination functions to transmit the
needed signals for uplink based LCS measurements and to make measurements of
downlink signals. The measurements to be made will be determined by the chosen
location method.
The UE may also contain LCS applications, or access a LCS application through
communication with a network accessed by the UE or an application residing in
the UE. This application may include the needed measurement and calculation
functions to determine the UE\'s location with or without assistance of the
GSM/UMTS/EPS LCS entities.
In GSM the positioning methods supported by the UE are signalled by the UE to
the core network and radio access network using Classmark3 in CS mode, as
specified in TS 24.008 [24].
In UMTS the UE capability to support different positioning methods is only
communicated within UTRAN, as specified in TS 25.331 [25].
In EPS the positioning methods supported by the UE may be signalled by the UE
to the core network using LPP by the initial location service invocation as
specified in TS 36.305 [42]. Also, in EPS the UE capabilities to support LCS
Notification for an MT-LR and LPP for positioning are exchanged at the initial
EPS attach procedure. The indication of the UE LPP capability will be
forwarded by MME to E-SMLC as specified in TS 29.171 [46].
The UE informs the core network about its capability to support privacy
invocation request and response using Classmark2 in CS mode and MS Network
Capability in PS mode, as specified in TS 24.008 [24].
The UE may also, for example, contain an independent location function (e.g.
Global Satellite Positioning Service GPS) and thus be able to report its
location, independent of the RAN transmissions. The UE with an independent
location function may also make use of information broadcast by the RAN that
assists the function.
The UE may support multiple simultaneous location sessions.
### 6.3.5 MSC/VLR
The MSC/VLR contains functionality responsible for UE subscription
authorization and managing call-related and non‑call related positioning
requests of LCS. The MSC is accessible to the GMLC via the Lg interface. The
LCS functions of MSC are related to charging and billing, LCS co-ordination,
location request, authorization and operation of the LCS services. If
connected to SGSN through the Gs interface, it checks whether the UE is GPRS
attached to decide whether to page the UE on the A/Iu or Gs interface.
The MSC/VLR may inform HLR/HSS about the UE\'s LCS Capabilities and may
include the IP address of the V-GMLC associated with the MSC/VLR in the MAP
UPDATE LOCATION message, during Registration and Inter MSC Update Location
procedures.
### 6.3.6 MSC Server
The MSC Server handles the same functionality as the MSC/VLR including
charging and billing, LCS co-ordination, location request, authorization and
operation of the LCS services. The MSC Server is accessible to the GMLC via
the Lg interface.
### 6.3.7 SGSN
The SGSN contains functionality responsible for UE subscription authorization
and managing positioning requests of LCS. The SGSN is accessible to the GMLC
via the Lg interface. The LCS functions of SGSN are related to charging and
billing, LCS co-ordination, location request, authorization and operation of
the LCS services.
The SGSN may inform HLR/HSS about the UE\'s LCS Capabilities for GPRS and may
include the IP address of the V-GMLC associated with the SGSN in the MAP
UPDATE GPRS LOCATION message, during Attach and Inter SGSN Routing Area Update
procedures.
The SGSN forwards the circuit-switched paging request received from the Gs
interface to the BSS/RNC.
### 6.3.8 Home Location Register, HLR
The HLR contains LCS subscription data and routing information. The HLR is
accessible from the GMLC via the Lh interface. For a roaming UE, HLR may be in
a different PLMN.
### 6.3.9 HSS
The HSS contains LCS subscription data and routing information. The HSS is
accessible from the GMLC via the Lh/SLh interface. For roaming UEs, HSS may be
in a different PLMN.
### 6.3.10 gsmSCF
The Lc interface supports CAMEL access to LCS and is applicable in CAMEL Phase
3 and later. The procedures and signalling associated with it are defined in
TS 23.078 [21] and TS 29.002 [18], respectively.
### 6.3.11 Privacy Profile Register, PPR
Privacy check may be done in the privacy profile register. The HLR or HSS
contains the address to the PPR. The PPR is accessible from the H-GMLC via the
Lpp interface. PPR may be a standalone network entity or the PPR functionality
may be integrated in H-GMLC.
### 6.3.12 Pseudonym Mediation Device, PMD
The pseudonym mediation device (PMD) functionality maps or decrypts the
pseudonym into the corresponding verinym (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN). PMD
functionality may be a standalone network entity or the PMD functionality may
be integrated in PPR, GMLC or other network entity. If PMD functionality is
not part of GMLC it may be accessed using the Lid interface. The detail of PMD
functionality is out of scope, and only the interface between GMLC and PMD
functionality is specified in this specification.
### 6.3.13 Mobility Management Entity, MME
The Mobility Management Entity (MME) contains functionality responsible for UE
subscription authorization and managing positioning requests of LCS. The MME
is accessible to the GMLC via the SLg interface. The LCS functions of MME are
related to charging and billing, LCS co-ordination, E-SMLC selection, location
request, authorization and operation of the LCS services.
The MME may inform HLR/HSS about the UE\'s LCS Capabilities for EPS and may
include the IP address of the V-GMLC associated with the MME in the Update
Location Request message, during Attach and Inter MME Tracking Area Update
procedures.
The MME selects an available E-SMLC to serve the location request for a UE.
The selection is based on network topology and should provide load balancing
between E-SMLCs. Other criteria for E-SMLC selection may include LCS Client
type and requested QoS.
### 6.3.14 Evolved Serving Mobile Location Centre, E-SMLC
The E-SMLC manages the overall co-ordination and scheduling of resources
required for the location of a UE that is attached to E-UTRAN. It also
calculates the final location and velocity estimate and estimates the achieved
accuracy. The E-SMLC interacts with the UE in order to exchange location
information applicable to UE assisted and UE based position methods and
interacts with the E-UTRAN in order to exchange location information
applicable to network assisted and network based position methods.
## 6.4 Addressing the target UE for LCS purposes
### 6.4.1 Verinyms for the target UE
It shall be possible to address and indicate the target UE using MSISDN and
SIP-URI. It may be possible in certain cases to address the target UE using IP
address when a static or dynamic IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) has been allocated
for the UE.
In the mobile terminated location request procedures in the PS domain (as well
as in the CS domain), the target UE is identified using either MSISDN or IMSI.
NOTE: It is recognized that IP-addressing of the target UE is only possible
when there is an active PDP context established between the target UE and the
external LCS client. Using the established PDP context, the LCS client can
request the target UE, as identified with the IP address it currently uses, to
initiate a Mobile originated location request. The actual signalling exchange
between the LCS Client/server and the target UE or the user of the target UE
is outside the scope of this specification. The resulting MO-LR is performed
as specified in this document.
### 6.4.2 Pseudonyms for the target UE
National regulations require support for the anonymity of the target mobile
user in some countries. It shall therefore be possible to address and indicate
the target UE using a pseudonym. The pseudonym may be the IMSI or MSISDN of
the target UE encrypted e.g. using the public key of the home operator. The
address of the network element that issued the pseudonym, i.e. the PMD
address, shall either be attached to the pseudonym, if required or this
address can be deduced from the pseudonym. The H-GMLC address may also either
be attached to the pseudonym or be deduced from the pseudonym. It is outside
the scope of this specification how the requestor and the LCS client will
receive and handle the pseudonym, but some examples are described in the
informative Annex E.
### 6.4.3 Non-dialable callback numbers
In case of a SIM-less emergency call, or in case of a non-registered (U)SIM
emergency call, a non-dialable callback number shall be used to identify the
target UE. The format and structure of the non-dialable callback number is
according to national or regional regulations. The non-dialable callback
number in North America shall, according to J-STD-036 [32], be the digits 911
+ the last 7 digits of IMEI expressed in decimal numbers.
NOTE: The use of non-dialable callback numbers in other parts of the world is
for further study. The non-dialable callback number should adopt random
numbering, if not otherwise unique.
## 6.5 Quality of Service Information
LCS Quality of Service information is characterised by 3 key attributes:
\- LCS QoS Class
\- Accuracy
\- Response Time
The use of quality of service to characterise location requests is optional
and if not requested the default shall be either network operator determined
or client negotiated.
### 6.5.1 LCS QoS Class
The LCS QoS Class defines the degree of adherence by the Location Service to
another quality of service parameter (Accuracy), if requested. The LCS Server
shall attempt to satisfy the other quality of service parameter regardless of
the use of QoS Class.
#### 6.5.1.1 Best Effort Class
This class defines the least stringent requirement on the QoS achieved for a
location request. If a location estimate obtained does not fulfil the other
QoS requirements, it should still be returned but with an appropriate
indication that the requested QoS was not met. If no location estimate is
obtained, an appropriate error cause is sent.
#### 6.5.1.2 Assured Class
This class defines the most stringent requirement on the accuracy achieved for
a location request. If a location estimate obtained does not fulfil the other
QoS requirements, then it shall be discarded and an appropriate error cause
sent.
# 7 Signalling and Interfaces
## 7.1 LCS signalling between Access and Core Networks for GERAN and UTRAN
access networks
For GERAN and UTRAN access networks, the core network sends location requests
to the access network, which then sends the corresponding responses back to
the core network.
Communication between access and core networks is accomplished through Iu
interface in UMTS whereas the A, Gb and Iu interfaces are used for the purpose
in GSM (see TS 25.305 [1] and TS 43.059 [16]).
### 7.1.1 Core network Location Request
The core network request for a location estimate of a target UE shall contain
sufficient information to enable location of the Target UE according to the
required QoS using any positioning method supported by the PLMN and, where
necessary, UE. For location services the core network may request the
geographical co-ordinates and velocity of the Target UE.
In Iu mode the core network may also request in which Service Area the Target
UE is located. The Service Area information may be used for routing of
corresponding Emergency calls, or for CAMEL services.
In A/Gb mode this corresponds to the usage of Cell ID in the core network. It
should be noted that the Service Area concept is different from the Localized
Service Area concept used for SoLSA services.
When the location of a Target UE in Idle Mode is requested, the core network
shall determine which RAN entity is associated with the Target UE.
### 7.1.2 Location Report
The access network reports the location of the Target UE to the core network
entities. The location report may contain the following information as defined
in the corresponding location request:
\- the geographical co-ordinates of the Target UE;
\- the positioning method used to obtain the location estimate if the access
network is either GERAN in the A/Gb mode, GERAN in the Iu mode or UTRAN in the
Iu mode.
\- the service area in which the Target UE is located;
\- achieved quality level of the location estimate;
\- velocity estimate of the Target UE, if available;
\- achieved quality level of the velocity estimate of the Target UE, if
available.
## 7.1a LCS signalling between Access and Core Networks for E-UTRAN access
networks
For E-UTRAN access networks, the MME sends location requests to the E-SMLC via
the SLs interface (see clause 7.8). The E-SMLC then sends core network
measurement requests, as described in clause 7.1a.1, to the access network via
the MME. The access network sends corresponding network measurement reports,
as described in clause 7.1a.2, back to the E-SMLC, again via the MME.
Communication between access and core networks is accomplished through S1
interface in E-UTRAN (see TS 36.305 [42].
### 7.1a.1 Core network Measurement Request
The core network request for network measurements shall contain sufficient
information to enable the desired measurements to be provided by the access
network.
The core network shall determine which RAN entities are associated with the
Target UE.
### 7.1a.2 Location Measurement Report
The access network reports measurements pertaining to the Target UE back to
the E-SMLC as defined in the corresponding core network measurement request.
## 7.2 Um, Uu and Uu-LTE Interfaces
The Um, Uu and Uu-LTE interfaces are used to communicate among the LCS
entities associated with the BSC, RNC, the UE and the stand-alone (Type A)
Location Measurement Units (LMU). The Um, Uu and Uu-LTE interfaces are also
used to communicate between the LCS entities in the core network and the UE.
NOTE: The Type A LMU does not apply to LTE.
The Um/Uu/Uu-LTE interfaces may pass measurement requests and results to and
from UE or the stand-alone LMU.
The Um/Uu/Uu-LTE interfaces may also pass location requests from internal or
external LCS Clients (Applications) at the UE. Note that these requests may
require the services of the LCS entities associated with the core network to
authenticate clients and subscriber subscriptions to aspects of the LCS.
The Um/Uu/Uu-LTE interfaces may also be used for broadcast of information that
may be used by the UE or stand-alone LMU for their LCS operations. This may,
for example, include timing information about nearby Node-B/BTS transmissions
that may assist the UE or LMU in making their measurements. In UTRAN code
information may be included.
The Um, Uu and Uu-LTE interfaces may also pass messages relating to changes or
reporting of the data associated with the Location System Operations Function
(LSOF) in the UE or the remote LMU.
UTRAN Stage 2 specification TS 25.305 [1] specifies LCS signalling over the Uu
interface and GERAN Stage 2 specification TS 43.059 [16] specifies LCS
signalling over the Um interface correspondingly. E-UTRAN Stage 2
specification TS 36.305 [42] specifies LCS signalling over the Uu-LTE
interface.
Message segmentation is specified in GERAN LCS Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
## 7.3 MAP Interfaces
The following interfaces are based on MAP in LCS.
\- Lh interface: interface between GMLC and HSS. This interface is used by the
GMLC to request the address of the H-GMLC, and/or the address of the visited
MSC or SGSN for a particular target UE whose location has been requested
\- Lg interface: interface between GMLC MSC and GMLC - SGSN. This interface is
used by the GMLC to convey a location request to the MSC or SGSN currently
serving a particular target UE whose location was requested. The interface is
used by the MSC or SGSN to return location results to the GMLC.
\- Lc interface: interface between GMLC and gsmSCF, CAMEL. This interface is
used to get location information for CAMEL based services.

information in order to route the location service request to the correct
VMSC, SGSN and MSC Server.
In case the service is used between the R-GMLC and the HSS, the H-GMLC address
of the target UE to be located is retrieved. The address of the V-GMLC
associated with the serving node and PPR may also be retrieved.

in TS 29.173 [45].
# 8 General network location procedures
## 8.1 State description for GMLC
### 8.1.1 GMLC states
#### 8.1.1.1 NULL State
In the NULL state, a particular location request from some LCS client either
has not been received yet or has already been completed. After a location
request is received from a LCS client, the GMLC remains in the NULL state
while the identity of the client and nature of its location request are
verified. While the NULL state exists conceptually, it need not be represented
explicitly in the GMLC.
#### 8.1.1.2 INTERROGATION State
In this state, the GMLC has sent an interrogation to the home HLR/HSS of the
UE to be located and is awaiting a response giving one or several of the
following addresses: the VMSC, MSC Server, SGSN address, MME address and IMSI
for this UE.
#### 8.1.1.3 LOCATION State
In this state, the GMLC has sent a location request to the VMSC, MSC Server,
SGSN or MME serving the UE to be located and is awaiting a response containing
a location estimate. Optionally, location information may also be communicated
between GMLCs, located in the same or a different PLMN, via the GMLC to GMLC
Lr interface
### 8.1.2 State functionality
#### 8.1.2.1 State Transitions
Figure 8.1: State Transitions in the GMLC
Moving from NULL to INTERROGATION state:
If the GMLC does not know any of the following addresses: VMSC, MSC Server,
SGSN, MME, V-GMLC address or IMSI when it receives a location service request
from some LCS client, it moves from the NULL state to the INTERROGATION state
and sends a request to the UE\'s home HLR/HSS for the VMSC/ MSC Server/ SGSN
/MME/ V-GMLC address and IMSI.
Moving from NULL to LOCATION state:
If the GMLC already knows one of the following addresses: VMSC, MSC Server,
SGSN, MME or UE IMSI, when it receives a location service request from some
LCS client (e.g. from information retained for an earlier location request for
the same UE), it moves from the NULL state to the LOCATION state and sends a
location request to either the VMSC, MSC Server, SGSN, or MME. Optionally, it
may send the location request to another GMLC via the Lr interface.
NOTE: It is for further study how GMLC selects if it shall send the location
request to VMSC, MSC server, SGSN, and/or MME in different cases. This should
be specified in the signalling procedures.
Moving from INTERROGATION to LOCATION state:
After the GMLC, in the INTERROGATION state, receives one or several of the
addresses VMSC, MSC Server, SGSN, MME, V-GMLC and IMSI from the home HLR/HSS,
it enters the LOCATION state and sends a location request to either the VMSC,
MSC Server, SGSN, MME or V-GMLC of the UE being located.
Moving from LOCATION to NULL state:
After the GMLC receives a location estimate response from the VMSC, MSC
Server, SGSN, MME or V_GMLC, it forwards the location estimate to the
requesting LCS client and re-enters the NULL state.
#### 8.1.2.2 INTERROGATION Timer Function
The GMLC runs a timer while in the INTERROGATION state to limit the amount of
time waiting for an interrogation response from the HLR/HSS. If the timer
expires before an interrogation response is received, the GMLC indicates a
location failure to the LCS client and re-enters the NULL state.
#### 8.1.2.3 LOCATION Timer Function
The GMLC runs a timer while in the LOCATION state to limit the amount of time
waiting for a location estimate response from the VMSC/ MSC Server /SGSN/MME.
If the timer expires before a response is received, the GMLC indicates a
location failure to the LCS client and re-enters the NULL state.
## 8.2 State description for VMSC and MSC Server
### 8.2.1 VMSC and MSC Server States
#### 8.2.1.1 LCS IDLE State
In this state, the VMSC/MSC Server location service is inactive for a
particular UE. The UE may be known in the VMSC/MSC Server (except for a USIM
less or SIM less Emergency call or where the UE information has been cancelled
or lost in the VMSC/MSC Server), but there may not be an active Mobility
Management to the UE.
#### 8.2.1.2 LOCATION State
In this state, the VMSC/MSC Server is awaiting a response from RAN after
requesting the location for a particular UE.
### 8.2.2 State Functionality
#### 8.2.2.1 State Transitions
Figure 8.2: State Transitions in the VMSC/MSC Server
**Moving from LCS IDLE to LOCATION state:**
After a request has been received to locate a particular UE and the UE
subscription options have been verified, a location request is sent to the RAN
of the UE to be located: the VMSC/MSC Server then enters the LOCATION state.
Before entering this state, the VMSC/MSC Server must have setup a Mobility
Management connection to the UE if none was previously active. The mobile is
paged and authenticated before positioning.
Moving from LOCATION to LCS IDLE state:
After the return of a location estimate result from RAN, the VMSC/MSC Server
shall re-enter IDLE state.
#### 8.2.2.2 LOCATION Timer Function
The VMSC/MSC Server runs a timer while in the LOCATION state to limit the
amount of time waiting for a location response from the RAN. If the timer
expires before such information is received, the VMSC/MSC Server indicates a
location failure to the original requesting entity and re-enters IDLE state.
## 8.3 LCS State description for SGSN
### 8.3.1 SGSN States
#### 8.3.1.1 LCS IDLE State
In this state, the SGSN location service is inactive for a particular UE. The
UE is known in the SGSN except in case where the UE data has been cancelled or
lost in the SGSN. There is not an active Mobility Management to the UE.
#### 8.3.1.2 LOCATION State
In this state, the SGSN is awaiting a response from the RAN after requesting
the location for a particular UE. In this state, a Mobility Management
connection to the target UE will be active.
### 8.3.2 State Functionality
#### 8.3.2.1 State Transitions
Figure 8.3: State Transitions in the SGSN
**Moving from LCS-IDLE to LOCATION state:**
After a request has been received to locate a particular UE and the UE
subscription options have been verified to allow this, the SGSN sends a
location request to the RAN. The SGSN then enters the LOCATION state. Before
entering this state, the SGSN must have setup a Mobility Management connection
to the UE if none was previously active. The mobile is paged and authenticated
before positioning.
**Moving from LOCATION to LCS IDLE state:**
After the return of a location estimate result from RAN, or if the Location
Timer described below expires, the SGSN shall re-enter IDLE state.
#### 8.3.2.2 LOCATION Timer Function
The SGSN runs a timer while in the LOCATION state to limit the amount of time
waiting for a location response from the RAN. If the timer expires before such
information is received, the SGSN indicates a location failure to the original
requesting entity and re-enters IDLE state.
## 8.4 Signalling connection for the Iu interface
When using the Iu interface, before SGSN/MSC server can request location
information of a target UE from RAN, an Iu signalling connection must have
been established between SGSN/MSC server and RAN. The SGSN/MSC server sends a
location request message to RAN, which determines the location of the target
UE related to this Iu signalling connection and sends a location report to
SGSN/MSC server over the same Iu signalling connection. On the Iu interface,
only one location request for a geographic location estimate can be ongoing at
any time.
## 8.5 Signalling connection for the A-interface
When using the A interface, before MSC can request location information of a
target UE from RAN, an A interface signalling connection must have been
established between MSC and RAN. The MSC sends a location request message to
RAN, which determines the location of the target UE related to this A
interface signalling connection and sends a location report to MSC over the
same A interface signalling connection. On the A interface, only one location
request can be ongoing at any time.
## 8.6 Gb interface mapping of target UE
The pre-requisite for LCS procedures on the Gb interface is that UE is in
\"ready state\". On the Gb interface, only one location request can be ongoing
at any time.
## 8.7 LCS State description for MME
### 8.7.1 MME States
An MME supports at least one location session for any UE at any one time. A
location session is invoked by the MME in order to obtain the location of the
UE or perform some other location related service such as transferring
assistance data to the UE.
#### 8.7.1.1 LCS IDLE State
In this state, the MME location service is inactive for a particular UE. The
UE is known in the MME and a mobility management connection for the UE may or
may not be active.
#### 8.7.1.2 LOCATION State
In this state, the MME is awaiting a response from an E-SMLC after requesting
a location service for a particular UE. In this state, the UE is known in the
MME and a Mobility Management connection to the UE is active.
### 8.7.2 State Functionality
#### 8.7.2.1 State Transitions
Figure 8.4: State Transitions in the MME
**Moving from LCS-IDLE to LOCATION state:**
After a request has been received for a particular location service for a
particular UE and the UE subscription options have been verified where
applicable to allow this, the MME sends a location request to an E-SMLC. The
MME then enters the LOCATION state. Before entering this state, the MME must
have setup a Mobility Management connection to the UE if none was previously
active.
**Moving from LOCATION to LCS IDLE state:**
After the return of a location result from the E-SMLC, or if the Location
Timer described below expires, the MME shall re-enter IDLE state.
#### 8.7.2.2 LOCATION Timer Function
The MME runs a timer while in the LOCATION state, whose value may depend on
the location service, to limit the amount of time waiting for a location
response from the E-SMLC. If the timer expires before such information is
received, the MME indicates a location failure to the original requesting
entity and re-enters IDLE state.
## 8.8 Signalling connection for the S1 interface
Before the MME can request location information of a target UE from the
E-SMLC, an S1 signalling connection must have been established between the MME
and E-UTRAN. The MME sends a location request message to E-SMLC, which
determines the location of the target UE related to this S1 signalling
connection and sends a location measurement report to the MME.
# 9 General Network Positioning Procedures
The generic network positioning procedure of providing the location
information of an UE subscriber can be partitioned into the following
procedures.
**Location Preparation Procedure**
This generic procedure is concerned with verifying the privacy restrictions of
the UE subscriber, reserving network resources, communicating with the UE to
be located and determining the positioning method to be used for locating the
UE subscriber based on the requested QoS and the UE and network capabilities.
**Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure**
This procedure is concerned with performing measurements by involving the
necessary network and/or UE resources. Depending on the positioning method to
be used for locating the UE the internals of this procedure can be positioning
method dependent. The procedure is completed with the end of the positioning
measurements.
**Location Calculation and Release Procedure**
This generic procedure is initiated after the measurements are completed and
is concerned with calculating the location and optionally, velocity of the UE
and releasing all network and/or UE resources involved in the positioning.
Each of the following procedures defines the support of a single location
request (MT‑LR, MO‑LR or NI‑LR) that may be immediate or deferred. Treatment
alternatives for a new location request when other concurrent locations
requests are already ongoing for the same target UE is not generally defined
in these procedures except in certain specific cases. For such general
treatment alternatives, refer to clause 4.5.
## 9.1 Mobile Terminating Location Request
The MT-LR procedures for the location request from the LCS client which does
not have the privacy override capability are described in the chapter 9.1.1.\
The MT-LR procedures for the location request from the LCS client which has
the privacy override capability (e.g. the request is come from the emergency
service provider) are described in the chapter 9.1.1A. In this case the H-GMLC
is not involved to the location procedures and the privacy check procedures in
H-GMLC/PPR are skipped.
It is noted that R-GMLC or the UE may handle the periodicity of location
requests as requested by the LCS client both in CS and PS domain.
### 9.1.1 Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain
Figure 9.1: General Network Positioning for a MT-LR
1) An external LCS client requests the current location and optionally,
velocity of a target UE from a GMLC. The LCS Client may also request a
deferred location request, i.e. based on event. The R-GMLC verifies the
identity of the LCS client and its subscription to the LCS service requested
and derives the MSISDN or IMSI or pseudonym of the target UE to be located and
the LCS QoS from either subscription data or data supplied by the LCS client.
For a call related location request, the LCS client includes the LCS client\'s
called party number, as dialled by the target mobile user, in the LCS service
request. For a session related location request, the LCS client includes the
APN-NI of the LCS client, as used by the target UE, in the LCS service
request. For a call/session related request the R-GMLC may verify that the
called party number or APN-NI is correct for the LCS client in question. The
LCS client\'s dialled number or APN-NI are checked in step 9 for the
call/session related class.\ The LCS request may carry also the Service
Identity and the Codeword and the service coverage information. The R-GMLC may
verify that the Service Identity received in the LCS request matches one of
the service identities allowed for the LCS client. If the service identity
does not match one of the service identities for the LCS client, the R-GMLC
shall reject the LCS request. Otherwise, the R-GMLC can map the received
service identity in a corresponding service type.\ If the location request is
originated by a Requestor, the Requestor Identity may be added to the LCS
service request. The LCS client should authenticate the Requestor Identity but
this is outside the scope of this specification. The LCS service request may
also contain the type of the Requestor identity if the requestor identity was
included.
If the H-GMLC address is not contained in the pseudonym or cannot deduced from
the pseudonym, the R-GMLC shall determine the verinym for the pseudonym. In
this case the R-GMLC may access to its associated PMD as described in
9.1.1.3.\ The R-GMLC verifies whether it stores the privacy profile of the
target UE. If the R-GMLC stores the UE\'s privacy profile, (this means the
R-GMLC is the H-GMLC of the target UE), then step 2, 3, 4 and 12 are skipped.\
If location is required for more than one UE, the steps following below may be
repeated and in that case the R-GMLC should verify whether the number of
Target UEs in the LCS request is equal or less than the Maximum Target UE
Number of the LCS client. If the Maximum Target UE Number is exceeded, the
R-GMLC should respond to the client with proper error cause. If periodic
location is requested, the steps following below may be repeated or the R‑GMLC
may forward the periodic location request to the UE, see clause 9.1.12.
2) If the R-GMLC already knows, (e.g. from a previous location request or an
internal lookup table), or is able to determine, (e.g. it is possible to use a
DNS lookup mechanism similar to IETF RFC 2916), the network address of H-GMLC
of the target UE, or in case the location service request contains the target
UE\'s pseudonym, which includes the target UE\'s Home-GMLC address, or a
pseudonym from which the target UE\'s Home-GMLC address can be deduced, then
this step and step 3 may be skipped.\ Otherwise, the R-GMLC sends a
SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_LCS message to the home HLR/HSS of the target UE to be
located with the IMSI or MSISDN of the UE.\ The details of the alternative
methods of retrieving H-GMLC address other than the sending
SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_LCS message to the HLR/HSS, (e.g. internal lookup table,
DNS lookup mechanism), are not in the scope of this specification.
Editor\'s note: The support for number portability with these alternative
solutions of retrieving H-GMLC address still needs further study and should be
in line with the general solution to support number portability in Rel-6.
3) The HLR/HSS verifies whether the R-GMLC is authorized to request UE
location information. If not, an error response is returned.\ Otherwise the
HLR/HSS returns one or several of the network addresses of the current SGSN
and/or VMSC/MSC server and/or current MME, the LCS capabilities of the serving
nodes if available , the V-GMLC address associated with the serving nodes, if
available and whichever of the IMSI and MSISDN that was not provided in step
2. The HLR/HSS returns the address of the H-GMLC. The HLR/HSS also returns the
address of the PPR, if available.
NOTE 1: HLR/HSS may prioritise between the MSC/VLR or SGSN or MME address sent
to the GMLC. The prioritisation might be based on information received from
SGSN and/or MSC/VLR and/or MME concerning the UE\'s capabilities for LCS.
Other priority criteria are for further study.
4) If R-GMLC finds out that it is the H-GMLC, the signalling steps 4 and 15
are skipped.\ If the R-GMLC did not receive the H-GMLC address in step 3 and
can not retrieve the H-GMLC address in some other way (e.g. DNS lookup), then
steps 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 are skipped and the R-GMLC directly
sends the PSL message to the serving node.\ Otherwise, the R-GMLC sends the
location request to the H-GMLC. If one or several of the network addresses of
the current SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC server and/or current MME, the LCS core
network signalling capabilities of the serving nodes, IMSI and MSISDN for the
target UE and the address of the V-GMLC and the PPR have been retrieved in
Step 3, the R-GMLC shall pass the information with the location request to the
H-GMLC. The R-GMLC shall also send the service coverage information to the
H-GMLC, if the information is available.
5) The H-GMLC verifies whether the R-GMLC is authorized to request UE location
information. If the R-GMLC is not authorized, an error response is returned.\
If the LCS service request contains the pseudonym of the target UE and the
H-GMLC cannot resolve the PMD address from the pseudonym, the H-GMLC itself
determines the verinym (MSISDN or IMSI) of the target UE. If the H-GMLC can
resolve the address of PMD from the pseudonym, the H-GMLC requests the verinym
from its associated PMD, see clause 9.1.1.3. In case H-GMLC knows that the PMD
functionality is integrated in PPR, it can include the information from the
LCS Identity Request in the LCS authorisation request to the PPR, see clause
9.1.1.1. In this case, if H-GMLC is not able to obtain the verinym of the
target UE, the H-GMLC shall cancel the location request.\ The H-GMLC performs
privacy check on the basis of the UE user\'s privacy profile stored in the
H-GMLC and the capabilities of the serving nodes (MSC/VLR and/or SGSN and/or
MME), if available. If the privacy profile of the target UE is stored in a PPR
and the H-GMLC received the network address of the PPR from R-GMLC or is able
to determine the PPR address (e.g. from a previous location request or an
internal lookup table), the H-GMLC shall ask the PPR to perform the privacy
check as described in the 9.1.1.1. If the privacy profile is stored in a PPR
but the network address of the PPR is not available, the H-GMLC shall send SRI
for LCS message to HLR/HSS in step 6 in order to get the PPR address and the
privacy check in this step shall be performed after step 7. Also if the key of
the UE user\'s privacy profile (i.e. MSISDN or IMSI) is not available, the
privacy check in this step shall be performed after step 7\. The H-GMLC/PPR
verifies LCS barring restrictions in the UE user\'s privacy profile in the
H-GMLC/PPR. In verifying the barring restrictions, barring of the whole
location request is assumed if any part of it is barred or any requisite
condition is not satisfied. If the location service request is to be barred,
GMLC shall terminate the request towards the R-GMLC or the LCS client with the
appropriate error code. As a result of the privacy check, the H-GMLC/PPR
selects one or two indicators of the privacy check related action and/or a
pseudo-external identity in the case of interaction with a pre Rel-6 serving
node. (The details of the indicator of the privacy check related action and
the pseudo-external identity are described in chapter 9.5.4 and Annex C). If
the requested type of location is \"current or last known location\" and the
requested maximum age of location information is available, the H-GMLC
verifies whether it stores the previously obtained location estimate of the
target UE. If the H-GMLC stores the location estimate and the location
estimate satisfies the requested accuracy and the requested maximum age of
location, the H-GMLC checks the result of the privacy check. In case the
result of the privacy check for call/session unrelated class is \"Location
allowed without notification\" then steps 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 may be skipped.
6) If the H-GMLC does not know IMSI for the particular MSISDN (e.g. from a
previous location request), and the VMSC/MSC server address, SGSN address or
MME address, the H-GMLC shall send a SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_LCS message to the
home HLR/HSS of the target UE to be located with the IMSI or MSISDN of this
UE. Also if the privacy profile is stored in a PPR but the network address of
the PPR was not available in the step 5, the H-GMLC shall send the SRI for LCS
message to HLR/HSS. Otherwise, this step and step 7 may be skipped.
7) The HLR/HSS then returns one or several of the network addresses of the
current SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC server and/or current MME, the LCS core network
signalling capabilities of the serving nodes , the V-GMLC address associated
with the serving nodes, if available and whichever of the IMSI and MSISDN that
was not provided in step (6) for the particular UE. The HLR/HSS may also
return the address of the PPR, if available.
NOTE 2: HLR/HSS may prioritise between the MSC/VLR or SGSN or MME address sent
to the GMLC. The prioritisation might be based on information received from
SGSN and/or MSC/VLR and/or MME concerning the UE\'s capabilities for LCS.
Other priority criteria are for further study.
NOTE 3: If ISR is active for LTE access, the HSS may return the address of
both the current MME and current SGSN.
8) If step 6 and step 7 were performed, the H-GMLC/PPR may do a new privacy
check, or if the privacy profile is stored in a PPR but the network address of
the PPR was not available in step 5 and the PPR address is obtained in step 7,
the H-GMLC shall ask the PPR to perform the privacy check as described in the
9.1.1.1.\ The H-GMLC shall forward a request for a deferred MT-LR only to an
SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC server. If neither was indicated by the HLR/HSS in step 7
in the case of a deferred MT-LR (e.g. if the HLR/HSS returned the current MME
but not a current SGSN or VMSVC/MSC sever), the H-GMLC shall return an error
to the R‑GMLC.\ Also if the location request is an immediate location request
and the service coverage information was sent from R-GMLC, the H-GMLC checks
the country codes of the serving node addresses. If the H-GMLC finds out the
current SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC server and/or current MME locates out of the
service coverage, the H-GMLC returns an appropriate error message to the
R-GMLC or the LCS client.\ In the cases when the H-GMLC did not receive the
address of the V-GMLC, or when the V-GMLC address is the same as the H-GMLC
address, or when both PLMN operators agree not to use the Lr interface, the
H-GMLC does not send the location request to the V-GMLC and step 10 is
skipped. In this case, the H-GMLC sends the location service request message
to the serving node.\ If the H-GMLC received the address of the V-GMLC from
the HLR/HSS and the V-GMLC address is different from the H-GMLC address, the
H-GMLC may send the location request to the V-GMLC. The location request shall
contain one or several of the network addresses of the current SGSN and/or
MSC/VLR and/or current MME, and the IMSI and MSISDN of the target UE. The
location request may also carry the requested action of the VPLMN as the
result of the privacy check in the H-GMLC (i.e. by using the indicator of the
privacy check related action as described in chapter 9.5.4 or by using the
pseudo-external identity as described in Annex C in the case of query to a pre
Rel-6 serving node). If the result of privacy check indicates that the
notification (and verification) based on current location is needed, the
H-GMLC shall send a location request to the V-GMLC indicating \"positioning
allowed without notification\" or, for backwards compatibility with a pre
Rel-6 serving node, a pseudo external identity representing the same privacy
notification and verification action required as for the \"positioning allowed
without notification\" procedure as described in Annex C and V-GMLC shall send
a Provide Subscriber Location message to the MSC/SGSN/MME indicating
\"positioning allowed without notification\" or, for backwards compatibility
with a pre Rel-6 serving node, a pseudo external identity representing the
same privacy notification and verification action required as for the
\"positioning allowed without notification\" procedure as described in Annex
C. The V-GMLC first authenticates that the location request is allowed from
this GMLC, PLMN or from this country. If not, an error response is returned.
Editor\'s Note: The restriction for a deferred MT-LR in the case of a current
MME may be removed in a later version of this TS.
9) If the GMLC (H-GMLC, R-GMLC or V-GMLC) receives only the MSC/VLR address,
the MT LR proceeds as the CS-MT-LR procedure described in clause 9.1.2.If the
GMLC receives only the SGSN address, the MT LR proceeds as the PS-MT-LR
procedure described in clause 9.1.6. If the GMLC receives only the MME
address, the MT LR proceeds as the EPC-MT-LR procedure described in clause
9.1.15. If the GMLC receives several of the following addresses, SGSN, VMSC,
MSC Server and/or MME, it has to decide where to send the location request. If
the requested MT-LR is known to be associated with a CS call, the CS-MT-LR
procedure shall be invoked. If the requested MT-LR is associated with a PS
session in UTRAN, the PS-MT-LR procedure shall be invoked. If the requested
MT-LR is associated with a PS session in E-UTRAN, the EPC-MT-LR procedure
shall be invoked. Otherwise, two or more of CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR and EPC-MT-LR
are applicable. If LCS Client indicated deferred location request, GMLC shall
indicate this together with applicable event type (e.g. UE available) in the
requested PS/CS-MT-LR, see 9.1.8.
NOTE 4: The order in which these procedures are invoked and whether one or
both procedures are used may depend on information in the LCS service request,
subscription information for the LCS client, possible priority information
returned by the HSS or information already stored in the GMLC (e.g. obtained
from previous location requests). The order may also depend on operator
preference for invoking or not invoking location estimation on a particular
access type when CSFB or ISR may be supported.
NOTE 5: If ISR is active for LTE access, the V-GMLC receives both an SGSN and
MME address. The VGMLC may then instigate both PS-MT-LR and EPC-MT-LR
procedures. This will lead to separate paging of the UE in its registered
TA(s) in association with the MME procedure and in its registered RA(s) in
association with the SGSN procedure. The UE would then respond to only one
paging request leading to continuation of only one of the MT-LR procedures and
a termination of the other. The V-GMLC will discover which is which from the
responses it later receives from the MME and SGSN for each MT-LR procedure.
10) The V-GMLC sends the location service response to the H-GMLC in accordance
with the requested LCS QoS Class. If the requested LCS QoS class was Assured,
V-GMLC sends the result only if the result has been indicated to fulfil the
requested accuracy, otherwise V-GMLC sends a LCS service response with a
suitable error cause. If the UE requested LCS QoS class was Best Effort,
V-GMLC sends whatever result it received with an appropriate indication if the
requested accuracy was not met. The location service response may contain the
information about the positioning method used. The V-GMLC may record charging
information.
11) If the privacy check in step 5 indicates that further privacy checks are
needed, or on the basis of the privacy profile, the H-GMLC shall perform an
additional privacy check or the H-GMLC may ask the PPR to perform the privacy
check as described in the 9.1.1.1 in order to decide whether the H-GMLC can
forward the location information to the LCS client or send a notification if
the result of the privacy check requires the notification and verification
based on current location. If the location request from the R-GMLC or the LCS
client contained the pseudonym, the H-GMLC shall use the pseudonym of the
target UE in the location response to the R-GMLC or the LCS client. One
example when this additional privacy check is needed is when the target UE
user has defined different privacy settings for different geographical
locations.
12) If the result of privacy checks in step 11 indicates that the notification
(and verification) based on current location is needed, the HGMLC shall send a
location request to the V-GMLC indicating \"notification only\" or, for
backwards compatibility with a pre Rel-6 serving node, a pseudo external
identity representing the same privacy notification and verification action
required as for the \"notification only\" procedure as described in Annex C.
Otherwise this step and steps 13, 14 may be skipped. If the H-GMLC received
the address of the V-GMLC from the HLR/HSS and the V-GMLC address is different
from the H-GMLC address in step 8, the H-GMLC may send the location request to
the V-GMLC. The location request shall contain one or several of the network
addresses of the current SGSN and/or MSC/VLR and/or current MME, and the IMSI
and MSISDN of the target UE.
NOTE: The use of pseudo external identities in this step implies that a second
positioning attempt is performed.
13) If the GMLC (H-GMLC, R-GMLC or V-GMLC) received only the MSC/VLR address
in step 9, the MT LR proceeds as the CS post positioning notification and
verification procedure described in clause 9.1.10 or clause 9.1.2 if pseudo
external identity is used. If the GMLC receives only the SGSN address in step
9, the MT LR proceeds as the PS post positioning notification and verification
procedure described in clause 9.1.11 or clause 9.1.6 if pseudo external
identity is used. If the GMLC receives only the MME address in step 9, the MT
LR proceeds as the EPC post positioning notification and verification
procedure described in clause 9.1.18. If the GMLC receives several of the
following addresses, SGSN, VMSC, MSC Server and/or MME, it has to decide where
to send the location request. If the requested MT-LR is known to be associated
with a CS call, the CS post positioning notification and verification
procedure shall be invoked. If the requested MT-LR is associated with a PS
session in UTRAN, the PS post positioning notification and verification
procedure shall be invoked. If the requested MT-LR is associated with a PS
session in E-UTRAN, the EPC post positioning notification and verification
procedure shall be invoked. Otherwise, CS and/or PS and/or EPC post
positioning notification and verification procedure are applicable.
14) The V-GMLC sends the location service response with an indication of the
result of notification and verification procedure performed in step 13 to the
H-GMLC.
15) The H-GMLC sends the location service response to the R-GMLC. The H-GMLC
may store the location information and its age. The location service response
may contain the information about the positioning method used and the
indication whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested
accuracy or not. The H-GMLC may record charging information.
16) R-GMLC sends the location service response to the LCS client. If the
location request from the LCS client contained the pseudonym and the R-GMLC
resolved the verinym from the pseudonym in the step 1, the R-GMLC shall use
the pseudonym of the target UE in the location response to the LCS client. If
the LCS client requires it, the R-GMLC may first transform the universal
location co-ordinates provided by the SGSN or MSC/MSC server or MME into some
local geographic system. The R-GMLC may record charging information both for
the LCS client and inter-network revenue charges from the SGSN or MSC/MSC
server or MME\'s network. The location service response from the R-GMLC to the
LCS client may contain the information about the positioning method used and
the indication whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested
accuracy or not.
The detailed CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR and EPC-MT-LR procedures in step 9 of figure
9.1 are described in clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.6 and 9.1.15. The detailed procedure
for deferred PS/CS-MT-LR is described in clause 9.1.8.
### 9.1.1A Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain for Emergency MT-LR
This clause describes how an emergency location request may be handled
similarly to a normal location request. This method should be restricted to
those countries where there is not a national requirement to provide location
for callers who are either roaming or making a SIM-less emergency call, or
making a non-registered (U)SIM emergency call. It is also appropriate to use
this method to provide location for lawful intercept services where allowed by
national regulation.
Figure 9.1A: Network Positioning for an Emergency MT-LR
1) An external LCS client which has the privacy override capability, (e.g.
Emergency service provider), requests the location of a target UE from a GMLC.
The R-GMLC verifies the identity of the LCS client and its subscription to the
LCS service requested and derives the MSISDN or IMSI of the target UE to be
located and the LCS QoS from either subscription data or data supplied by the
LCS client.
2) If the R-GMLC already knows IMSI for the particular MSISDN, (e.g. from a
previous location request) and the VMSC/MSC server address, SGSN address or
MME address, this step and step 3 may be skipped. Otherwise, the R-GMLC sends
a SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_LCS message to the home HLR/HSS of the target UE to be
located with the IMSI or MSISDN of this UE.
3) The HLR/HSS verifies whether the R-GMLC is authorized to request UE
location information. If not, an error response is returned.\ Otherwise the
HLR/HSS returns one or several of the network addresses of the current SGSN
and/or VMSC/MSC server and/or current MME and whichever of the IMSI and MSISDN
that was not provided in step 2. The HLR/HSS also returns the address of the
V-GMLC associated with the serving nodes, if available.
NOTE 1: HLR/HSS may prioritise between the MSC/VLR, SGSN or MME address sent
to the GMLC. The prioritisation might be based on information received from
SGSN and/or MSC/VLR and/or MME concerning the UE\'s capabilities for LCS.
Other priority criteria are for further study.
NOTE 2: If ISR is active for LTE access, the HSS may return the address of
both the current MME and current SGSN.
4) In the cases when the R-GMLC did not receive the address of the V-GMLC, or
when the V-GMLC address is the same as the R-GMLC address, or when both PLMN
operators agree not to use the Lr interface, the R-GMLC does not send the
location request to the V-GMLC and the step 6 is skipped. In this case, the
R-GMLC sends the location service request message directly to the serving
node.\ If the R-GMLC received the address of the V-GMLC from the HLR/HSS and
the V-GMLC address is different from the R-GMLC address, the R-GMLC sends the
location request to the V-GMLC. The location request shall contain one or
several of the network addresses of the current SGSN and/or MSC/VLR, the IMSI
and MSISDN of the target UE and the privacy override indicator. The V-GMLC
first authenticates that the location request is allowed from this GMLC, PLMN
or from this country. If not, the positioning request is rejected and an error
response is returned. Otherwise, it sets the privacy indicator to \"not
allowed\" and includes it with the POI in the Provide Subscriber Location
message.
5) If the GMLC receives only the MSC/VLR address, the MT LR proceeds as the
CS-MT-LR procedure described in clause 9.1.2. If the GMLC receives only the
SGSN address, the MT LR proceeds as the PS-MT-LR procedure described in clause
9.1.6. If the GMLC receives only the MME address, the MT LR proceeds as the
EPC-MT-LR procedure described in clause 9.1.15. If the GMLC receives several
of the following addresses, SGSN, VMSC, MSC Server and/or MME, it has to
decide where to send the location request. In any case the serving node checks
for POI applicability.
NOTE: The order in which these procedures are invoked and whether one or both
procedures are used may depend on information in the LCS service request,
subscription information for the LCS client, possible priority information
returned by the HLR/HSS or information already stored in the GMLC (e.g.
obtained from previous location requests).
6) The V-GMLC sends the location service response to the R-GMLC. The location
service response may contain the information about the positioning method
used. The V-GMLC may record charging information.
7) R-GMLC sends the location service response to the LCS client. If the LCS
client requires it, the R-GMLC may first transform the universal location co-
ordinates provided by the SGSN or MSC/MSC server into some local geographic
system. The location service response from the GMLC to the LCS client may
contain the information about the positioning method used. After receiving
(stage 3) acknowledgement from the LCS client, the R-GMLC may record charging
information both for the LCS client and inter-network revenue charges from the
SGSN or MSC/MSC server\'s network.
The detailed CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR and EPC-MT-LR procedures in step 5 of figure
9.1A are described in clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.6 and 9.1.15.
#### 9.1.1.1 LCS Authorisation request
If the UE subscribers LCS privacy information is kept in the PPR the GMLC
(H-GMLC) shall send a LCS Authorisation request to PPR, see figure 9.1B.
Figure 9.1B: LCS authorisation in PPR
1) The GMLC sends the LCS authorisation request to the PPR. The LCS
authorisation request carries the type of location information requested (e.g.
current location), the LCS client type, the UE subscriber\'s identity and
indication whether the request is call/session related or call/session
unrelated. The UE subscriber\'s identity can be one or both of MSISDN and
IMSI. If PMD functionality is integrated in PPR, the LCS authorization request
may carry the pseudonym of the target UE, instead of the verinym. In case GMLC
received the LCS client\'s called party number or the APN-NI of the target
mobile\'s session, GMLC shall request both call/session related and
call/session unrelated privacy checks in PPR. In case GMLC did not receive the
LCS client\'s called party number or the APN-NI of the target mobile\'s
session, GMLC requests only a call/session unrelated privacy check in PPR. For
a value added LCS client, the message shall carry the client\'s name, the
external identity of the LCS client and the requestor identity (if that is
both supported and available). Moreover the message may also carry the Service
Type and the Codeword. This message shall also carry the LCS capabilities of
the SGSN or VMSC/MSC server.
In case the additional privacy check was requested to be performed after the
positioning procedure the LCS Authorisation Request shall also include the
location estimate.
2) If the LCS authorization request contains the pseudonym of the target UE,
the PPR with PMD functionality seeks to determine the verinym of the target
UE. PPR performs the privacy check based on the target UE\'s privacy profile.
The result of that privacy check is sent to GMLC in the LCS Authorisation
response. If the location request is to be barred, the PPR shall send an
indication of this within the LCS Authorisation response and no other
indicators. If requested by the GMLC the PPR shall include two privacy check
results for the LCS Authorisation response, both call/session related and
call/session unrelated privacy check results. The response may also contain
information if an additional privacy check is needed when the GMLC has
received the location information of the target UE (e.g. if the target UE
allows its location information to be given to the LCS client only when it is
located in certain areas).
If the LCS authorisation request contains the pseudonym of the target UE and
the PPR has integrated PMD functionality, the PPR shall return the target
UE\'s IMSI and/or MSISDN corresponding to the pseudonym in the LCS
authorisation response.
If PPR received information that the visited MSC/SGSN is pre Rel-6 it shall
select a pseudo external ID which shall carry the response of the privacy
check. For more information on pseudo external Ids, see Annex C.
#### 9.1.1.2 LCS Privacy Profile Update
If the UE subscribers privacy information has been changed in the PPR the LCS
Privacy Profile Update shall be send to the GMLC (H-GMLC), see figure 9.1C.
Figure 9.1C: PPR notification to GMLC about LCS privacy profile change
1) In case subscriber changed his privacy profile information in the PPR the
LCS Privacy Profile Update shall be send to the GMLC (H-GMLC). The message
shall carry the identity of the UE subscriber.
2) GMLC acknowledges that it received the notification
#### 9.1.1.3 LCS identity request
The GMLC may request the verinym of the UE from the PMD, see figure 9.1D.
Figure 9.1D: LCS identity request
1) The GMLC sends the pseudonym to its associated PMD and requests the
corresponding verinym of the target UE from PMD.
2) The PMD shall map or decrypt (e.g. using the private key of the operator)
the target UE\'s pseudonym to the corresponding verinym, i.e. IMSI and /or
MSISDN, to be included in the Identity Response.
### 9.1.2 Circuit Switched Mobile Terminating Location Request (CS-MT-LR)
Figure 9.2 illustrates general network positioning for LCS clients external to
the PLMN. In this scenario, it is assumed that the target UE is identified
using either an MSISDN or IMSI.
Figure 9.2: Network Positioning for a CS-MT-LR
#### 9.1.2.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) Common PS and CS MT-LR procedure as described in 9.1.1.
2) The GMLC sends a PROVIDE_ SUBSCRIBER _LOCATION message to the MSC/MSC
server indicated by the HLR/HSS. This message carries the type of location
information requested (e.g. current location and optionally, velocity), the UE
subscriber\'s IMSI, LCS QoS information (e.g. accuracy, response time) and an
indication of whether the LCS client has the override capability. For a call
related location request, the message also carries the LCS client\'s called
party number. For a value added LCS client, the message shall carry the client
name, the external identity of the LCS client (or the pseudo external
identity) and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available). Also the message may carry the type of the LCS client name and
also the type of the Requestor identity if the requestor identity was
included. For a PLMN operator LCS client, the message shall carry the internal
identity of the LCS client. Moreover the message may also carry the Service
Type. If the result of the privacy check at H-GMLC/PPR indicated that the
codeword shall be sent to the UE user, the message may carry also the codeword
received from the LCS client. For a PLMN operator LCS client, the message
shall carry the internal identity of the LCS client. If the Requestor Identity
is provided, the GMLC shall send it as separate information. In addition, in
order to display the requestor identity in case of pre rel-5 network elements
(i.e. MSC and/or UE), the requestor identity may be also added to the LCS
client name by the GMLC. When the Requestor identity is added to the LCS
client name the practise described in the Annex D should be followed. The
message also shall carry the indicators of privacy related action which is
described in chapter 9.5.4 , if it is provided by H-GMLC.
3) If the GMLC is located in another PLMN or another country, the VMSC/MSC
server first authenticates that a location request is allowed from this PLMN
or from this country. If not, an error response is returned. If the PSL
message from the GMLC contains the indicators of privacy related action, the
VMSC/MSC server determines a required privacy related action as described in
Annex A.3. If the PSL message from the GMLC does not include the indicators of
privacy related action, the VMSC/MSC server then verifies LCS barring
restrictions in the UE user\'s subscription profile in the MSC server. In
verifying the barring restrictions, barring of the whole location request is
assumed if any part of it is barred or any requisite condition is not
satisfied. If LCS is to be barred without notifying the target UE and a LCS
client accessing a GMLC in the same country does not have the override
capability, an error response is returned to the GMLC.\ Otherwise, if the UE
is in idle mode, the Core Network performs paging, authentication and
ciphering. The MSC will page a GPRS attached UE either through A/Iu or Gs
interface, depending on the presence of the Gs interface (see Note 2). The UE
will inform the network about its LCS capabilities, as described in chapter
6.3.4. If the UE is instead in dedicated mode, the VMSC/MSC server will
already have UE classmark information. In GSM this is supported by controlled
early classmark sending.
NOTE 1: In GSM, if the target UE has an established circuit call other than
speech, the location request may be denied and an error response is then
returned to the GMLC. If the location request is allowed for a non-speech
circuit call, it shall be up to RAN to decide, on the basis of the applicable
position methods and requested QoS, whether positioning is possible.
NOTE 2: In some network mode of operation, a GPRS capable UE may not receive
the CS paging. In addition, upon receipt of a CS paging, a GPRS capable UE may
immediately answer to the Paging Request or delay the answer, as defined in TS
22.060 [35b] and TS 23.060 [15]. A GPRS UE in class B mode may also suspend
its GPRS traffic, sending a GPRS Suspension Request to the network.
4) If the location request comes from a value added LCS client and the
indication of requested privacy related action or the UE subscription profile
indicates that the UE must either be notified or notified with privacy
verification and the UE supports notification of LCS (according to the UE
Capability information), an LCS Location Notification Invoke message is sent
to the target UE indicating the type of location request from the LCS Client
(e.g. current location or \"current or last known location\") and the identity
of the LCS client, the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available) and whether privacy verification is required. Also the message may
indicate the type of the LCS client name and also the type of the Requestor
identity if the requestor identity was included. Moreover, the message may
carry also the service type and the codeword.\ Optionally, the VMSC/MSC server
may, after sending the LCS Location Notification Invoke message continue in
parallel the location process, i.e. continue to step 6 without waiting for a
LCS Location Notification Return Result message in step 5.
NOTE 3: It is for further study, if all available client identities are to be
included in the Privacy Notification message to be shown to the end-user.
5) The target UE notifies the UE user of the location request. If privacy
verification was requested, the target UE indicates to the UE user whether the
location request will be allowed or not allowed in the absence of a response
and waits for the user to grant or withhold permission. The UE then returns an
LCS Location Notification Return Result to the VMSC/MSC server indicating, if
privacy verification was requested, whether permission is granted or denied.
Optionally, the LCS Location Notification Return Result message can be
returned some time after step 4, but before step 9. If the UE user does not
respond after a predetermined time period, the VMSC/MSC server shall infer a
\"no response\" condition. The VMSC/MSC server shall return an error response
to the GMLC if privacy verification was requested and either the UE user
denies permission or there is no response with the UE subscription profile
indicating barring of the location request in the absence of a response.
6) The MSC/MSC server sends a Location Request message to RAN. This message
includes the type of location information requested and requested QoS and, in
GSM, the UE\'s location capabilities.
#### 9.1.2.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
7) RAN determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method, as specified in UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and
GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
#### 9.1.2.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
8) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained, RAN returns it to the MSC/MSC server in a Location Report message.
RAN shall in its response include an indication whether the obtained location
estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not. The information about the
positioning method used may be returned with the location estimate. If a
location estimate could not be obtained, RAN returns a Location Report message
containing a failure cause and no location estimate.
9) The MSC/MSC server returns the location information, its age and obtained
accuracy indication to the GMLC, if the VMSC/MSC server has not initiated the
Privacy Verification process in step 4. If step 4 has been performed for
privacy verification, the VMSC/MSC server returns the location information
only, if it has received a LCS Location Notification Return Result indicating
that permission is granted. In these cases, the information about the
positioning method used may be sent with the location information. If a LCS
Location Notification Return Result message indicating that permission is not
granted is received, or there is no response, with the requested privacy
action or the UE subscription profile indicating barring of location in the
absence of a response, the VMSC/MSC server shall return an error response to
the GMLC. If RAN did not return a successful location estimate, but the
privacy checks in steps 4 - 5 were successfully executed, the VMSC/MSC server
may return the last known location of the target UE if this is known and the
LCS client is requesting the current or last known location. The MSC/MSC
server may then release the Mobility Management connection to the UE, if the
UE was previously idle, and the MSC/MSC server may record charging
information.
10) Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain as described in 9.1.1.
### 9.1.3 CS-MT-LR without HLR Query
Figure 9.3 illustrates current or last known location requests for an
emergency services call, where an emergency services client (i.e., a Public
Safety Answering Point) identifies the target UE and the serving GMLC using
correlation information that were previously provided to it by the VMSC. In
North America, this correlation information is provided by either an NA-ESRK,
or an MSISDN and NA-ESRD. In E.U. it is provided through the ISUP/BICC IAM
message with location number parameter set to MSC number and the calling party
number parameter set to MSISDN. The signalling used to provide the correlation
information to the PSAP is out of scope of this TS, but is presumed to occur
on the signalling for the call. This allows the requesting V-GMLC to request
location from the VMSC without first querying the home HLR of the target UE.
This scenario therefore supports location of emergency callers from roamers or
SIM-less emergency calls, or non-registered (U)SIM emergency calls, and
requires that the initial location, as well as UE and VMSC identifying
information had been pushed to the GMLC as per 9.1.5 (or 9.1.5.A for North
America). In North America, additional requirements are found in [32].
Figure 9.3: Positioning for a Emergency Services MT-LR without HLR Query
1) Same as step 1 in figure 9.1 but with the LCS client (PSAP) identifying
first the target UE and the serving V-GMLC by previously supplied correlation
information for the emergency call.
2) The GMLC may determine the VMSC from correlation information received from
the PSAP, or from stored information for the target UE (e.g. from a prior
location estimate delivery from the VMSC/MSC server). In North America, the
GMLC determines the VMSC using the NA-ESRK or NA-ESRD - with use of the NA-
ESRK taking priority over that of the NA‑ESRD. The
MAP_PROVIDE_SUBSCRIBER_LOCATION message sent to the VMSC carries the MSISDN
and, if provided, the IMSI and IMEI for the target UE, as well as the required
QoS and an indication of a location request from an emergency services client.
The VMSC identifies the target UE using the IMSI or MSISDN and, if provided,
the IMEI. In case of a SIM-less emergency call, or non-registered (U)SIM
emergency call, the IMEI shall be always sent and the MSISDN may be populated
with a non-dialable callback number as specified in clause 6.4.3.
3) The MSC verifies that UE privacy is overridden by the emergency services
provider and that positioning is not prevented for other reasons (e.g.
unreachable UE, inapplicable call type to the UE). The VMSC then sends a
Location Request to the RAN, as for a normal MT-LR.
4) RAN performs positioning as for a normal CS-MT-LR.
5) RAN returns a location estimate to the VMSC as for a normal CS-MT-LR.
6) Same as step 9 for a normal CS-MT-LR.
7) Same as step 10 for a normal CS-MT-LR.
### 9.1.4 CS-MT-LR and PS-MT-LR for a previously obtained location estimate
Every time the location estimate of a target UE subscriber is returned by the
RAN to the VMSC, MSC Server or SGSN, the corresponding entity may store the
location estimate together with a time stamp. The MSC/MSC server may store
this information in the subscriber\'s MSC server record. Also when the
location estimate of a target UE subscriber is returned to the H-GMLC, the
H-GMLC may store the location estimate together with the age in the
subscriber\'s record.
The time stamp is the time at which the location estimate is stored at the
corresponding entity i.e. after the RAN returns the location estimate to the
VMSC, MSC Server or SGSN. The time stamp indicates the \"age\" of the location
estimate.
#### 9.1.4.1 Initial Location
In the context of an originating emergency call the location estimate and the
associated time stamp at the commencement of the call set-up is referred to as
_\"initial location\"_.
#### 9.1.4.2 Current Location
After a location attempt has successfully delivered a location estimate and
its associated time stamp, the location estimate and time stamp is referred to
as the _\"current location\"_ at that point in time.
#### 9.1.4.3 Last known Location
Depending on national regulations, the current location estimate and its
associated time stamp may be stored in MSC/VLR, MSC Server, SGSN, or in H-GMLC
and until replaced by a later location estimate and a new time stamp is
referred to as the _\"last known location\"_. The last known location may be
distinct from the initial location - i.e. more recent.
#### 9.1.4.4 Security and Privacy
The collection and/or the release of the last known and initial location
estimate of the target UE may not be allowed by national option. The handling
of security and privacy of the target UE with regard to returning the last
known or initial location estimate of the target UE shall be the same as when
the target UE is reachable for positioning. (i.e. the requesting LCS client is
authorized and the privacy of the target UE is secured before the VMSC/MSC
server check the MSC server status of the target UE (i.e. whether the UE is
marked as attached or detached in the MSC server). A similar status check
apply for SGSN and MSC Server.
#### 9.1.4.5 Failing to locate the target UE
In case of a \"Detached\" or \"Not Reachable\" target UE, the last known
location and a time stamp stored at the VLR, MSC Server or SGSN, may be
returned to a LCS client requesting location information if the LCS client
specifically requested the current or last known location. This does not apply
to a value added LCS client where the target UE subscribes to notification of
the location request: if the notification cannot be performed, the VMSC, MSC
Server or SGSN shall reject the location request.
NOTE: Due to CAMEL, the MSC/MSC server/VLR may already be storing other
location information parameters like location number, service area identity
and MSC server number in the subscriber\'s MSC server record.
When a request for location information is received at the VMSC, MSC Server or
SGSN, the request shall indicate whether the \"last known location of the
target UE\" should be returned in case of a \"detached\" or \"not reachable\"
target UE.
If the VLR, MSC Server or SGSN has a valid copy of the subscriber\'s permanent
data and the target UE\'s privacy settings are such that positioning is
allowed, then the following two cases can occur.
##### 9.1.4.5.1 Target UE is \"Not Reachable\"
If the target UE is marked as \"attached\" in the VLR, MSC Server or SGSN, the
corresponding entity orders paging of the target UE. If paging fails, due to
target UE being \"not reachable\" then the corresponding VMSC, MSC Server or
SGSN shall check whether the LCS client has requested \"last known location\"
in case of \"not reachable\" target UE.
If such a request exists and notification to the target UE does not apply for
a value added LCS client, the VMSC, MSC Server or SGSN shall include the last
known location together with the time stamp available in its response to the
request for location information.
An indicator of \"last known location\" returned shall be marked at the CDR at
VMSC, MSC Server or SGSN correspondingly.
##### 9.1.4.5.2 Target UE is \"Detached\"
If the target UE is marked as \"detached\" in the VLR, MSC Server or SGSN, the
corresponding entity shall check whether the LCS client has requested \"last
known location\" in case of \"detached\" target UE.
If such a request exists and notification to the target UE does not apply for
a value added LCS client, the VMSC, MSC Server or SGSN includes the \"last
known location\" together with the time stamp available in its response to the
request for location information.
An indicator of \"last known location\" returned shall be marked at the CDR at
VMSC, MSC Server or SGSN.
##### 9.1.4.5.3 Target UE is Reachable but Positioning Fails
If the target UE is reachable (e.g. paging succeeds), but the VMSC, MSC Server
or SGSN is unable to obtain a current location estimate, then the
corresponding entity shall check whether the LCS client has requested \"last
known location\".
If such a request exists and notification to the target UE either does not
apply or was successfully executed for a value added LCS client, the VMSC, MSC
Server or SGSN includes the \"last known location\" together with the time
stamp available in its response to the request for location information. An
indicator of \"last known location\" returned shall be marked at the CDR at
VMSC.
##### 9.1.4.5.4 MSC Server or SGSN Target UE is \"Purged\"
If the target UE is marked as \"Purged\" in HLR/HSS, then an indication
\"Absent Subscriber\" is returned to the GMLC.
### 9.1.5 Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR)
Figure 9.4 illustrates how the initial position for an emergency service call
is determined when the subscriber initiates the emergency call.
Figure 9.4: Positioning for a NI-LR Emergency Service Call
#### 9.1.5.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) An initially idle UE requests radio connection setup indicating a request
for an Emergency Service call to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN.
2) RAN shall convey the CM service request to the core network. (Before having
a CM connection there must be a radio connection.) The UE may identify itself
using a TMSI, IMSI or IMEI.
3) The emergency call procedure is applied. The VMSC/MSC server determines
based on the serving cell the appropriate emergency services client. The
VMSC/MSC server, RAN and UE continue the normal procedure for emergency call
origination towards that emergency services client. Depending on local
regulatory requirements, the sending of call setup information into the PSTN
may be delayed until either the UE\'s location has been obtained or the
location attempt has failed or a PLMN defined timer has expired before
location was obtained. If the serving cell serves an area that contains the
service domain of multiple emergency services clients, the VMSC/MSC server may
delay call setup and invoke location based routing procedures described in
section 9.1.5A. Call setup information sent into the PSTN may include the UE
location (if already obtained) plus information that will enable the emergency
service provider to request UE location at a later time (e.g. NA-ESRD or NA-
ESRK in North America, or the ISUP/BICC IAM message with location number
parameter set to MSC number and the calling party parameter set to MSISDN, in
E.U.).
4) At any time after step 2, the VMSC/MSC server may initiate procedures to
obtain the UE\'s location and optionally, velocity. These procedures may run
in parallel with the emergency call origination. The VMSC/MSC server sends a
Location Request message to RAN associated with the UE\'s current location
area (see step 6 for a MT-LR). This message includes the QoS required for an
emergency call.
#### 9.1.5.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
5) RAN determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method, as specified in UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and
GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
#### 9.1.5.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
6) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained, RAN returns it to the VMSC/MSC server in a Location Report. As a
national option, Cell ID positioning accuracy is allowed. RAN shall in its
response include an indication whether the obtained location estimate
satisfies the requested accuracy or not. The information of the positioning
method used may be returned with the location estimate. If a location estimate
could not be obtained, the RAN returns a location response containing a
failure cause and no location estimate.
7) Depending on local regulatory requirements, the VMSC/MSC server may send a
MAP Subscriber Location report to a GMLC associated with the emergency
services provider to which the emergency call has been or will be sent. This
message shall carry any location estimate returned in step 6 including the
indication received from RAN whether the obtained location estimate satisfies
the requested accuracy or not, the age of this estimate and may carry the
MSISDN, IMSI and IMEI of the calling UE, the information about the positioning
method used and the serving cell identity or SAI of the UE. In case of a SIM-
less emergency call, or a non-registered (U)SIM emergency call, the IMEI shall
be always sent and the MSISDN may be populated with a non-dialable callback
number as specified in clause 6.4.3. In North America, any NA-ESRD and any NA-
ESRK that may have been assigned by the VMSC/MSC server shall be included. In
the E.U. the VMSC/MSC Server shall provide the identity of the PSAP to which
the emergency call was connected. The message shall also indicate the event
that triggered the location report. If location failed (i.e. an error result
was returned by RAN in step 6), an indication of failure rather than a
location estimate may be sent to the GMLC: the indication of failure is
conveyed by not including a location estimate in the MAP Subscriber Location
Report. The MSC/MSC server may record charging information.
8) The GMLC acknowledges receipt of the location information. The GMLC shall
store the location information for later retrieval by the emergency services
LCS client.
9) The GMLC may optionally forward the information received in step 8 to the
emergency services LCS client. The GMLC may also record charging information.
The client is expected to obtain the location information by requesting it
from the GMLC. The information about the positioning method used may be sent
with the location information from the GMLC to the LCS client.
10) At some later time, the emergency services call is released.
11) The MSC/MSC server sends another MAP Subscriber Location Report to the
GMLC. This message may include the same parameters as before except that there
is no position estimate and an indication of emergency call termination is
included.
12) The GMLC acknowledges the MSC/MSC server notification and may then delete
all information previously stored for the emergency call per national
regulation.
### 9.1.5A NI-LR using Location Based Routing -- applicable to North American
Emergency Calls only
Figure 9.4A illustrates positioning for an emergency service call using
location based routing.
Figure 9.4A: Positioning for a NI-LR Emergency Service Call using Location
Based Routing
#### 9.1.5A.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) An initially idle UE requests radio connection setup indicating a request
for an Emergency Service call to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN.
2) RAN shall convey the CM service request to the core network. (Before having
a CM connection there must be a radio connection.) The UE may identify itself
using a TMSI, IMSI or IMEI.
3) The VMSC/MSC server determines that the serving cell serves an area that
contains portions of multiple emergency services zones. Therefore, the
VMSC/MSC server delays call setup and initiates procedures to obtain the UE\'s
location for routing the emergency call to the emergency services LCS client.
The VMSC/MSC server sends a Location Request message to RAN associated with
the UE\'s current location area. This message includes the type of location
information requested, the UE\'s location capabilities and a QoS with low
delay and low horizontal accuracy.
#### 9.1.5A.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
4) RAN determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method, as specified in UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and
GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
#### 9.1.5A.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
5) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained, RAN returns it to the VMSC/MSC server. If a location estimate could
not be obtained, the RAN returns a location response containing a failure
cause and no location estimate. If a failure is received, the VMSC/MSC server
initiates emergency call setup using the normal NI-LR procedures.
6) The VMSC/MSC server sends a MAP Subscriber Location Report to a GMLC
associated with the emergency services provider to which the emergency call
will be sent. This message shall carry any location estimate returned in step
5, the age of this estimate and may carry the MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI of the
calling UE, the information about the positioning method used and the serving
cell identity or SAI of the UE. In case of a SIM-less emergency call, or a
non-registered (U)SIM emergency call, the IMEI shall be always sent and the
MSISDN shall be populated with a non-dialable callback number as specified in
clause 6.4.3. The message shall also indicate the event that triggered the
location report. Any NA-ESRD and NA-ESRK that was assigned by the VMSC/MSC
server shall be included. The message shall also include an indication that
the VMSC/MSC server supports the capability to replace an NA-ESRK or NA-ESRD
value with the one assigned by the GMLC. The VMSC/MSC server and GMLC may
record charging information.
7) The GMLC translates the location estimate into a zone identity and assigns
either a NA-ESRK or a NA-ESRD, which was requested by the VMSC/MSC server. The
GMLC shall include either the NA-ESRK value or the NA-ESRD value in the MAP
Subscriber Location Report ack and send it to the VMSC/MSC server. The GMLC
stores either the assigned NA-ESRD or the assigned NA- ESRK and any NA-ESRD
that was sent by the VMSC/MSC server in step 6.
#### 9.1.5A.4 Location Preparation Procedure
8) The emergency call procedure is applied. The VMSC/MSC server, RAN and UE
continue the normal procedure for emergency call origination towards the
appropriate emergency services client. Call setup information sent into the
PSTN may include the UE location plus information that will enable the
emergency service provider to request UE location at a later time (NA-ESRD or
NA-ESRK in North America). The NA-ESRK or NA-ESRD used shall be the one
received from the GMLC. If a NA-ESRK or NA-ESRD is not received from the GMLC
then the VMSC/MSC server shall employ default routing for the call using a
default NA-ESRK, default NA-ESRD or other default number as in 9.1.5.1 step 3.
9) At any time after step 8, the emergency services LCS client may request
location information.
10) At any time after step 6, the GMLC may send a MAP Provide Subscriber
Location message to the VMSC/MSC server. This message includes a QoS with
higher delay and higher horizontal accuracy required for an emergency call. In
case of a SIM-less emergency call, or a non-registered (U)SIM emergency call,
the IMEI shall be included in the message.
If the GMLC is capable of determining whether the initial location satisfies
the higher accuracy requirements for an emergency call, then the GMLC may not
need to request for a higher accuracy location.
11) The VMSC/MSC server sends a Location Request message to RAN. This message
includes the type of location information requested, the UE\'s location
capabilities and requested higher accuracy QoS.
#### 9.1.5A.5 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
12) same as step 4.
#### 9.1.5A.6 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
13) same as step 5.
14) The VMSC/MSC server returns the location information and its age, the
information about the positioning method used and the serving cell identity or
SAI of the UE to the GMLC. The GMLC shall replace the previously stored low
accuracy location information with the higher accuracy information for later
retrieval by the emergency services LCS client. The VMSC/MSC server and GMLC
may record charging information.
15) The GMLC may forward the information received in the previous step to the
emergency services LCS client. The client is expected to have requested this
information from GMLC before. The information about the positioning method
used may be sent with this location information from the GMLC to the LCS
client.
16) same as step 10 for normal NI-LR.
17) same as step 11 for normal NI-LR.
18) same as step 12 for normal NI-LR.
### 9.1.6 Packet Switched Mobile Terminating Location Request (PS-MT-LR)
Figure 9.5 illustrates the general network positioning for LCS clients
external to the PLMN for packet switched services. In this scenario, it is
assumed that the target UE is identified using an MSISDN or IMSI.
Figure 9.5: General Network Positioning for Packet Switched MT-LR
#### 9.1.6.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) Common PS and CS MT-LR procedure as described in 9.1.1.
2) GMLC sends a Provide Subscriber Location message to the SGSN indicated by
the HLR/HSS. This message carries the type of location information requested
(e.g. current location and optionally, velocity), the UE subscriber\'s IMSI,
LCS QoS information (e.g. accuracy, response time) and an indication of
whether the LCS client has the override capability. For a session related
location request, the message also carries the APN-NI to which the user has
established the session. For a value added LCS client, the message shall carry
the client name, the external identity of the LCS client (or the pseudo
external identity) and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available), optionally the message may also carry the Service Type. Also the
message may carry the type of the LCS client name and also the type of the
Requestor identity if the requestor identity was included. If the result of
the privacy check at H-GMLC/PPR indicated that the codeword shall be sent to
the UE user, the message may carry also the codeword received from the LCS
client. For a PLMN operator LCS client, the message shall carry the internal
identity of the LCS client. If the Requestor Identity is provided, the GMLC
shall send it as separate information. In addition, in order to display the
requestor identity in case of pre rel-5 network elements (i.e. SGSN and/or
UE), the requestor identity may be also added to the LCS client name by the
GMLC. When the Requestor identity is added to the LCS client name the practise
described in the Annex D should be followed. The message also shall carry the
indicators of privacy related action which is described in chapter 9.5.4 , if
it is provided by H-GMLC.
3) If the GMLC is located in another PLMN or another country, the SGSN first
authenticates that a location request is allowed from this PLMN or from this
country. If not, an error response is returned. If the PSL message from the
GMLC includes the indicators of privacy related action, the SGSN determines a
required privacy related action as described in Annex A.3. If the PSL message
from the GMLC does not include the indicators of privacy related action, the
SGSN then verifies LCS barring restrictions in the UE user\'s subscription
profile in the SGSN. In verifying the barring restrictions, barring of the
whole location request is assumed if any part of it is barred or any requisite
condition is not satisfied. If LCS is to be barred without notifying the
target UE and a LCS client accessing a GMLC in the same country does not have
the override capability, an error response is returned to the GMLC.\
Otherwise, if the UE is in idle mode, the SGSN performs paging. The paging
procedure is defined in TS 23.060 [15].
4) Security functions may be executed. These procedures are defined in TS
23.060 [15].
5) If the location request comes from a value added LCS client and the
indicators of privacy related action or the UE subscription profile indicates
that the UE must either be notified or notified with privacy verification and
the UE supports notification of LCS, a notification invoke message is sent to
the target UE indicating the type of location request from the LCS Client
(e.g. current location or \"current or last known location\") and the identity
of the LCS client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available), whether privacy verification is required. Also the message may
indicate the type of the LCS client name and also the type of the Requestor
identity if the requestor identity was included. Moreover, the message may
carry also the service type and the codeword. Optionally, the SGSN may after
sending the LCS Location Notification Invoke message continue in parallel the
location process, i.e. continue to step 7 without waiting for a LCS Location
Notification Return Result message in step 6.
6) The target UE notifies the UE user of the location request and, if privacy
verification was requested, waits for the user to grant or withhold
permission. The UE then returns a notification result to the SGSN indicating,
if privacy verification was requested, whether permission is granted or
denied. Optionally, this message can be returned some time after step 5, but
before step 10. If the UE user does not respond after a predetermined time
period, the SGSN shall infer a \"no response\" condition. The SGSN shall
return an error response to the GMLC if privacy verification was requested and
either the UE user denies permission or there is no response with the UE
subscription profile indicating barring of the location request.
7) The SGSN sends a Location Request message to the RAN. This message includes
the type of location information requested, the requested QoS and any other
location information received in paging response.
#### 9.1.6.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
8) If the requested location information and the location accuracy within the
QoS can be satisfied based on parameters received from the SGSN and the
parameters obtained by the RAN e.g. cell coverage and timing information (i.e.
RTT or TA), the RAN may send a Location Report immediately. Otherwise, the RAN
determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method in UTRAN Stage 2 TS 25.305 [1] and in GERAN Stage 2
TS 43.059 [16]. If the position method returns position measurements, the RAN
uses them to compute a location estimate. If there has been a failure to
obtain position measurements, the RAN may use the current cell information
and, if available, RTT or TA value to derive an approximate location estimate.
If an already computed location estimate is returned for an UE based position
method, the RAN may verify consistency with the current cell and, if
available, RTT or TA. If the location estimate so obtained does not satisfy
the requested accuracy and sufficient response time still remains, the RAN may
instigate a further location attempt using the same or a different position
method. If a vertical location co‑ordinate is requested but the RAN can only
obtain horizontal co-ordinates, these may be returned.
#### 9.1.6.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
9) When location information best satisfying the requested location type and
QoS has been obtained, the RAN returns it to the SGSN in a Location Report
message. RAN shall in its response include an indication whether the obtained
location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not. The information of
the positioning method used may be returned with the location information. If
a location estimate could not be obtained, the RAN returns a Location Report
message containing a failure cause and no location estimate.
10) The SGSN returns the location information, its age and obtained accuracy
indication to the GMLC, if the SGSN has not initiated the Privacy Verification
process in step 5. If step 5 has been performed for privacy verification, the
SGSN returns the location information only, if it has received a LCS Location
Notification Return Result indicating that permission is granted. In these
cases, the information about the positioning method used may be sent with the
location information. If a LCS Location Notification Return Result message
indicating that permission is not granted is received, or there is no
response, with the requested privacy action or the UE subscription profile
indicating barring of location, the SGSN shall return an error response to the
GMLC. If the SGSN did not return a successful location estimate, but the
privacy checks were successfully executed, the SGSN may return the last known
location of the target UE if this is known and the LCS client is requesting
the current or last known location. The SGSN may record charging information.
11) Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain as described in 9.1.1.
### 9.1.6A PS-MT-LR without HLR Query
Figure 9.5A illustrates current or last known location requests for an
emergency services call, where an emergency services client (i.e., a Public
Safety Answering Point) identifies the target UE and the serving GMLC using
correlation information that was previously provided to it by the IMS Core.
The signalling used to provide the correlation information to the PSAP is out
of scope of this TS, but is presumed to occur on the signalling for the call.
The correlation information may be used by the GMLC to retrieve other
information previously provided to it by the IMS Core as per TS 23.167 [36a]
and/or SGSN as described in clause 9.1.7. This allows the requesting V‑GMLC to
request location from the SGSN without first querying the home HLR of the
target UE. This scenario therefore supports location of emergency calls from
roamers or SIM-less emergency calls, or non-registered (U)SIM emergency calls,
and requires that the initial location, as well as UE and SGSN identifying
information had been pushed to the GMLC as per clause 9.1.7 or as per TS
23.167 [36a].
Figure 9.5A: Positioning for a Emergency Services PS-MT-LR without HLR Query
1) Same as step 1 in figure 9.1 but with the LCS client (PSAP) identifying
first the target UE and the serving V‑GMLC by previously supplied correlation
information for the emergency call.
2) The GMLC may determine the SGSN by associating the correlation information
received from the PSAP with other information received previously from the
SGSN using a PS‑NI‑LR and/or from the IMS core. The
MAP_PROVIDE_SUBSCRIBER_LOCATION message sent to the SGSN carries, if
available, the MSISDN or the IMSI and, if available, the IMEI for the target
UE, as well as the required QoS and an indication of a location request from
an emergency services client. The SGSN identifies the target UE using the
IMSI, MSISDN and/or the IMEI. In case of a SIM-less emergency call, or non-
registered (U)SIM emergency call, the IMEI shall be always sent.
3) The SGSN verifies that UE privacy is overridden by the emergency services
provider and that positioning is not prevented for other reasons (e.g.
unreachable UE). The SGSN then sends a Location Request to the RAN, as for a
normal PS‑MT‑LR.
4) RAN performs positioning as for a normal PS‑MT‑LR.
5) RAN returns a location estimate to the SGSN as for a normal PS‑MT‑LR.
6) The SGSN returns the location information, its age and obtained accuracy
indication to the GMLC. The information about the positioning method used may
be sent with the location information. If the RAN did not return a successful
location estimate, the SGSN may return the last known location of the target
UE if this is known and the LCS client is requesting the current or last known
location.
7) The GMLC sends the location service response to the LCS client (PSAP).
NOTE: The SGSN determined by the GMLC in step 2 must be the current SGSN for
the UE. In the event of handover to a new SGSN, this may require updating of
the GMLC using the PS‑NI‑LR procedure in clause 9.1.7. Before any handover has
occurred, this may require using the cell ID or SAI for the UE provided by the
IMS Core.
### 9.1.7 Packet Switched Network Induced Location Request (PS-NI-LR)
At any time after detecting an emergency situation (i.e. after emergency
Attach or Service Request for emergency, PDP context activation towards
emergency APN), the SGSN may initiate the Packet Switched Network Induced
Location Request (PS‑NI‑LR) procedure. At any time after the handover or
relocation of an emergency PDP context from an old to a new SGSN, where the
old SGSN indicates that a PS‑NI‑LR is still needed, the new SGSN may initiate
a PS‑NI‑LR to the GMLC indicated by the old SGSN. At any time after the
handover or relocation of an emergency PDP context from an old to a new SGSN,
where the old SGSN indicates that a PS‑NI‑LR is not needed but provides a GMLC
address, the new SGSN may initiate a PS‑NI‑LR procedure to transfer its
address to the GMLC indicated by the old SGSN in order to support a later
PS‑MT‑LR. The procedure is illustrated in figure 9.6.
{width="6.608333333333333in" height="3.234027777777778in"}
Figure 9.6: Network Induced Location Request for the PS Domain
1) The SGSN sends a Location Request message to the RAN. This message
indicates the type of location information requested and requested QoS. If the
location of the UE is not required (e.g. the SGSN is only sending its address
to the GMLC), the SGSN skips both this step and steps 2 and 3.
#### 9.1.7.1 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
2) If the requested location information and the location accuracy within the
QoS can be satisfied based on parameters received from the SGSN and the
parameters obtained by the RAN e.g. cell coverage and timing information (i.e.
RTT or TA), the RAN may send a Location Report immediately. Otherwise, the RAN
determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method. If the position method returns position
measurements, the RAN uses them to compute a location estimate. If there has
been a failure to obtain position measurements, the RAN may use the current
cell information and, if available, RTT or TA value to derive an approximate
location estimate. If an already computed location estimate is returned for an
UE based position method, the RAN may verify consistency with the current cell
and, if available, RTT or TA value. If the location estimate so obtained does
not satisfy the requested accuracy and sufficient response time still remains,
the RAN may instigate a further location attempt using the same or a different
position method. If a vertical location co-ordinate is requested but the RAN
can only obtain horizontal co-ordinates, these may be returned.
#### 9.1.7.2 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
3) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained, the RAN returns a Location Report to the SGSN with an indication
whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or
not. This message carries the location estimate that was obtained. If a
location estimate was not successfully obtained, a failure cause is included
in the Location Report.
4) The SGSN may determine the GMLC and emergency services client using the SAI
or cell identity, the location estimate if obtained or information received
from a previous SGSN in the case of SRNS relocation, RAU or handover. The SGSN
shall send a MAP Subscriber Location Report to the GMLC carrying the MSISDN of
the UE, the identity of the LCS client, the event causing the message
(PS‑NI‑LR), and, if these were obtained in steps 1 to 3, the location estimate
and its age and the indication received from RAN whether the obtained location
estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not. The serving cell identity or
SAI of the UE may also be sent. The SGSN may include its own address. If the
UE was not authenticated, the IMEI shall be included. The SGSN may record
charging information.
5) The GMLC shall acknowledge receipt of the location estimate provided that
it serves the identified LCS client and the client is accessible.
6) The GMLC may transfer the location information to the LCS client either
immediately or upon request from the client. The GMLC may store the
information received in step 4: e.g. may store the UE identity and the address
of the SGSN. The GMLC may record charging information.
NOTE: Determination of the GMLC in step 4 must ensure a match with any GMLC
used by the IMS Core to assist with location retrieval for, and/or routing of,
the IMS Emergency call.
### 9.1.8 Mobile Terminating Deferred Location Request -- UE available event
Figure 9.6a illustrates the procedures for a Deferred Location Request, where
the Location Report is returned based on a UE available event.
Figure 9.6a: General Network Positioning for a Deferred MT-LR with UE
available event
#### 9.1.8.1 Deferred Location Request Procedure
1) The LCS Service Request shall contain an indication of the requested event
i.e. UE available.
2) LCS service request handling between GMLCs as described in clause 9.1.1.
The information received by the R-GMLC is transferred to the H-GMLC. The
H-GMLC assigns a LDR reference number to this LCS Service request and
transfers the information to the V-GMLC, including the LDR reference number
and the H-GMLC address.
3) The V-GMLC sends the UE available event to MSC/SGSN in the Provide
Subscriber Location request (deferred) and includes the LDR reference number
and the H-GMLC address in the request.
NOTE: It shall be possible to issue the deferred location requests for the UE
available event, even in case there is an ongoing previous MT-LR for the same
UE.
4) If the SGSN/MSC cannot support the deferred location request for the
specified event (for temporary or permanent reasons), or if either the
security or privacy check related actions fail, then a Provide Subscriber
Location return error shall be returned with a suitable cause. If the SGSN/MSC
can support the deferred location request for the specified event, a Provide
Subscriber Location ack. shall be returned to the V-GMLC without a location
estimate. The SGSN/MSC may record charging information for an accepted
deferred location request.
5) V-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response to H-GMLC to notify whether the
request was successfully accepted or not. The V-GMLC may record charging
information for an accepted deferred location request.
6) H-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response to R-GMLC to notify whether the
request was successfully accepted or not. When the H-GMLC returns the LCS
Service Response to the R-GMLC, the LDR reference number assigned by the
H-GMLC shall be included. The H-GMLC may record charging information for an
accepted deferred location request.
7) The R-GMLC then returns the LCS Service Response with LDR reference number
to the LCS Client to notify whether the request was successfully accepted or
not. The R-GMLC may record charging information for an accepted deferred
location request.
#### 9.1.8.2 Location Report Procedure
8) Immediately following step 3, the SGSN/MSC shall verify if the requested
event is already satisfied (e.g. UE available inferred from a current
transaction) or can be invoked immediately (e.g. by paging the UE and
receiving a page response). If the requested event is not already satisfied,
the SGSN/MSC waits until it has occurred or until some maximum time has
expired.
In case the SGSN/MSC receives an indication that the UE has moved to another
SGSN/MSC, while it is waiting for the requested event to happen, SGSN/MSC
shall immediately send a Subscriber Location Report to the V-GMLC. The report
shall include the reference number and H-GMLC address that were included in
the Provide Subscriber Location request and the information that the MT-LR
must be reinitiated against the new SGSN/MSC. It shall also include the
address of the new SGSN/MSC, if available. If the V-GMLC is associated with
the new MSC/SGSN, it re-issues the location request to the new MSC/SGSN.
Otherwise the V-GMLC forwards the responses to the H-GMLC. If the H-GMLC
already knows (e.g. from a previous location request or an internal lookup
table), or is able to determine, (e.g. it is possible to use a DNS lookup
mechanism similar to IETF RFC 2916), the network address of the V-GMLC, it
reinitiates the MT-LR to the new SGSN/MSC through the new V-GMLC. Otherwise,
the H-GMLC shall then issue a SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_LCS message to get the
address of the V-GMLC associated with the new SGSN/MSC and reinitiate the MT-
LR with the new SGSN/MSC through the new V-GMLC, see step 12.
9) When the requested event is detected, the SGSN/MSC shall proceed with the
location request as described in 9.1.2/9.1.6. If an LCS Location Notification
Invoke message is sent to the target UE as defined in step 4 of clause 9.1.2.1
and step 5 of clause 9.1.6.1, the type of location request shall indicate
current location and the deferred location event type shall be omitted.
If either security or privacy check related actions fail, the SGSN/MSC shall
send a Subscriber Location Report with the reference number and H-GMLC address
that was included in the Provide Subscriber Location with appropriate error
cause indicating termination of the deferred location request.
10) When location information has been obtained from the RAN, the SGSN/MSC
returns the Subscriber Location Report. The report shall include the reference
number that was included in the Provide Subscriber Location, the H-GMLC
address, an indication that this is a response to a previously sent deferred
location request and may also include the indication whether the obtained
location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not (provided that this
indication is obtained from RAN with the location estimate). The SGSN/MSC may
record charging information.
If the location information could not be obtained, or the SGSN/MSC for some
other reason decides to not wait any longer for the requested event to occur
(ex. timer expires), the Subscriber Location Report with the reference number
and H-GMLC address that was included in the Provide Subscriber Location will
be returned with an appropriate error cause indicating termination of the
deferred location request.
11) V-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response to the H-GMLC with an indication of
the event occurrence and the LDR reference number. The LCS Service Response is
sent in accordance with the requested QoS Class, as described in clause 9.1.1
for common MT-LR.
12) In case the LCS Service Response indicates to H-GMLC that the mobile has
moved to another SGSN/MSC, the H-GMLC shall send the deferred MT-LR with UE
available event to the V-GMLC (previous or new), which forwards the request to
the new SGSN/MSC, as described in step 2 onwards.
13) The H-GMLC performs the privacy check as described in clause 9.1.1.
14) The H-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response to R-GMLC. When the H-GMLC
returns the LCS Service Response to the R-GMLC, the LDR reference number that
was sent to the R-GMLC in step 6 shall be included.
15) The R-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response with the LDR reference number to
the LCS Client.
#### 9.1.8.3 Combined Periodical/Deferred Mobile Terminating Location Request
with UE available event
Figure 9.6b illustrates the procedures for a Combined Periodical/Deferred
Mobile Terminating Location Request with UE available event, where the
response to the LCS client is returned periodically and based on the event.
This clause is applicable only to the case, when the R‑GMLC handles the
periodicity of the location requests. The case when the UE handles the
periodicity of location reporting, as specified in clause 9.1.12, is
independent of this clause.
NOTE: In the description below, it is assumed that the LCS client issues the
Periodical/Deferred MT-LR with only the location estimate type of \"current
location\".
Figure 9.6b: General Network Positioning for a Combined Periodical/Deferred
MT-LR
1) When a R-GMLC receives a LCS Service Request from a LCS client, the R-GMLC
verifies the identity of the LCS client as described in 9.1.1, then the R-GMLC
transfers the periodical request to the H-GMLC.
2) The H-GMLC starts the periodical timer and assigns a LDR reference number
for this periodical request, and initiates the common LCS procedures as
described in 9.1.1.
3) The V-GMLC sends a Deferred Location Request to the SGSN/MSC by means of
Provide Subscriber Location as described in 9.1.2/9.1.6. In addition, the
Deferred Location Request includes the reference number assigned by the H-GMLC
and the event that shall trigger the sending of Subscriber Location Report.
4) If the SGSN/MSC cannot support the deferred location request for the
specified event or the LCS client is not allowed to position the requested UE
according to subscription information, a Provide Subscriber Location error is
returned to the V-GMLC. If the SGSN/MSC can support the deferred location
request for the specified event and the privacy checks are satisfied, a
Provide Subscriber Location ack shall be returned to the V-GMLC without a
location estimate. The SGSN/MSC may record charging information for an
accepted deferred location request.
5) The V-GMLC then returns the LCS Service Response to the LCS Client via
H-GMLC and R-GMLC to notify whether the request was successfully accepted or
not. The V-GMLC, H-GMLC and R-GMLC may record charging information for an
accepted deferred location request. When the H-GMLC returns the LCS Service
Response to the LCS Client via R-GMLC, the LDR reference number assigned by
the H-GMLC shall be included.
6) When the periodical timer expires, if the H-GMLC is still waiting for the
event, the H-GMLC shall send a LCS Service Response to the LCS client via
R-GMLC, indicating that the location is not available at that moment. The LDR
reference number that was sent to the LCS Client in step 5 shall be included
in the response.
7) When the requested event is detected, the SGSN/MSC will proceed with the
location request as described in 9.1.2/9.1.6. If an LCS Location Notification
Invoke message is sent to the target UE as defined in step 4 of clause 9.1.2.1
and step 5 of clause 9.1.6.1, the type of location request shall indicate
current location and the deferred location event type shall be omitted.
8) When location information has been obtained from the RAN, the SGSN/MSC
returns the Subscriber Location Report. The report shall include the reference
number included in the previously sent Provide Subscriber Location and an
indication that this is a response to a previously sent deferred location
request. The SGSN/MSC may record charging information.
If the location information could not be obtained, or the SGSN/MSC for some
other reason decides to not wait any longer for the requested event to occur
(ex. timer expires), the Subscriber Location Report with the reference number
included in the previously sent Provide Subscriber Location will be returned
with an appropriate error cause indicating termination of the deferred
location request.
9) The V-GMLC then returns the LCS Service Response to the LCS Client via
H-GMLC and R-GMLC as in 9.1.2/9.1.6. When the H-GMLC returns the LCS Service
Response to the LCS Client via R-GMLC, the LDR reference number that was sent
to the LCS Client in step 5 shall be included.
10) When the timer expires, if the H-GMLC is not waiting for the event, the
H-GMLC initiates the common LCS procedures as described in 9.1.1. The H-GMLC
should use the same LDR reference number assigned in the step 2, should NOT
assign a new LDR reference number.
11) Same as step 3.
12) Same as step 4.
13) Same as step 5.
14) If the requested event is already satisfied, the SGSN/MSC will proceed
with the location request as described in 9.1.2/9.1.6. If an LCS Location
Notification Invoke message is sent to the target UE as defined in step 4 of
clause 9.1.2.1 and step 5 of clause 9.1.6.1, the type of location request
shall indicate current location and the deferred location event type shall be
omitted.
15) Same as step 8.
16) Same as step 9.
#### 9.1.8.4 Cancellation of a Deferred Location Request -- UE available event
Figure 9.6c: Cancellation of a Deferred MT-LR -- UE available event procedure
1) The LCS Client requests the cancellation of a previously requested Deferred
Location Request. The LDR reference number that was included in the previous
LCS Service Response sent by the GMLC shall be included in the request to
indicate which outstanding LDR should be cancelled.
2) The R-GMLC sends the cancellation request to H-GMLC, including the LDR
reference number. The cancellation could be initiated by the R-GMLC itself for
some reasons (e.g. the expiry of the validity timer specified by the start
time and stop time; or the expiry of an implementation dependent timer
specified by the Operator as a default value in the R-GMLC when the stop time
is undefined or exceeds the maximum allowed value).
3) The H-GMLC forwards the LCS Cancel Service Request to V-GMLC with the LDR
reference number which is received from the R-GMLC, and the H-GMLC address.
The H-GMLC may itself initiate the cancellation procedure, e.g. if an
implementation dependent timer in the H-GMLC expired, or when the UE\'s
privacy profile stored in the H-GMLC or in the PPR was changed. For every
outstanding Deferred Location Request against that UE, the H-GMLC shall
perform or ask the PPR to perform a new privacy check based on the updated
privacy profile. If the privacy check passes, i.e. the LCS Client is still
allowed to position the target UE, the handling of the outstanding Deferred
Location Request should be continued. Otherwise, if the privacy check does not
pass, i.e. the Location estimate of the target UE is not allowed to be
provided to the LCS Client, the H-GMLC shall initiate a cancellation
procedure.
NOTE: The H-GMLC shall know that the UE subscriber\'s privacy profile has been
changed in the PPR when the LCS Privacy Profile Update has been sent from PPR
to H-GMLC as described in 9.1.1.2.
4) The V-GMLC will indicate this cancellation request in the Provide
Subscriber Location toward the SGSN/MSC. The Provide Subscriber Location shall
include the H-GMLC address, and the reference number specified by LCS Client
in the LCS Cancel Service Request.
5) When the SGSN/MSC completes the cancellation procedure, it notifies it to
the V-GMLC in the Provide Subscriber Location Ack (with no location estimate
included).
6) The V-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to H-GMLC.
7) H-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to R-GMLC. H-GMLC may send the
LCS Cancel Service Response to R-GMLC, even if the R-GMLC/LCS client has not
requested the cancellation, see step 3.
8) The R-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to the LCS Client.
### 9.1.9 Deferred Location Request Procedure for the change of area event
Figure 9-6d illustrates the procedures for a Deferred Location Request where
the Location Report is returned to the network by the UE following a change of
area event. An area event occurs when the UE leaves, enters or is within a
target area as defined by geographical area, PLMN identity, country code or
geopolitical name of the area. Details of the target area are contained in the
LCS Service Request message, see clause 5.5.1.
The PLMN operator may choose to use another mechanism (such as SIM Application
Toolkit) for the transfer and detection mechanism of the Area Definition and
change of area event information to the UE. In this case, the GMLCs handle
steps 2 to 7 and 11 to 14 differently from that shown below. An alternative
mechanism is detailed in Annex F
Figure 9.6d: Deferred MT-LR procedure for the Area event
1) The LCS Service Request contains the change of area type deferred location
request information, i.e. details of the target area and the nature of the
event, whether the event to be reported is the UE being inside, entering into
or leaving the target area. The LCS service request may specify the validity
time, i.e. start time and stop time, for the deferred location request and
R-GMLC may cancel the deferred location request as described in clause
9.1.9.1. In addition, when validity time of a pending area event request in
the target UE expires, the UE shall delete the pending deferred location
request. The LCS Service Request shall contain an indication of the minimum
interval time between area event reports, if applicable. The LCS service
request shall contain the information whether the deferred area event may be
reported one time only, or several times. If the change of area event is
reported one time only, the Location Service request shall be completed after
the first area event has occurred. If the target area is expressed by local
coordinate system or geopolitical name, the R-GMLC shall convert the target
area to geographical area expressed by a shape defined in TS 23.032 [11]. In
addition to the target area definition, the LCS Client may include the country
code of the target area in the area event request.
2) LCS service request handling between GMLCs as described in clause 9.1.1.
The information received by the R-GMLC is transferred to the H-GMLC. If
indication of the requested location estimate is included in the area event
request, the H-GMLC should record this indication and any relevant parameters
such as QoS. The H-GMLC assigns a LDR reference number to this LCS Service
request then transfers the information to the V-GMLC, including the LDR
reference number and the H-GMLC address.
If the H-GMLC notices that the current visited PLMN does not serve the target
area, it may generate a modified deferred LCS service request in order to get
notified when the target UE enters a PLMN that serves the target area. The
modified target area event is that the target UE enters one of the PLMNs that
serve the original target area. Note that the new area event may include
multiple PLMNs (identified by PLMN IDs) if there are more than one PLMN that
serves the original target area, based on the stored PLMN list and the
corresponding estimated coverage. The H-GMLC then generates a new location
request with the new defined area event and the same rest of the information
in the original request.
The new location request is sent to the target UE via the current V-GMLC. The
H-GMLC keeps the original area event location service request pending for as
long as determined by the validity time of the request. When the UE enters one
of the pre-defined PLMNs, it sends an area event location report to H-GMLC.
The H-GMLC then sends the original area event location service request to the
UE via the new V-GMLC. If the H-GMLC cannot derive a list of PLMNs that may
cover the target area, and the current visited network does not cover the
target area, the H-GMLC may reject the request.
3) If the received target area is expressed by a shape defined in TS 23.032
[11], V-GMLC converts the target area into an Area Definition consisting of
the corresponding list of cell identities, location areas or routing area. If
the V-GMLC is not able to translate the target area into network identities,
it shall reject the request and send an LCS service response to H-GMLC with
the appropriate error cause.\ If the received target area is expressed by
country code or PLMN identity, the V-GMLC shall use the country code or PLMN
identity as the Area Definition.\ The V-GMLC sends the Area Definition to
MSC/SGSN in the Provide Subscriber Location request (deferred) and includes
the LDR reference number and the H-GMLC address in the request.\ The message
shall define whether the event to be reported is the UE being inside, entering
into or leaving the area. The message shall also include the validity period
of the location request, the minimum interval time between area event reports,
the information whether the deferred area event may be reported one time only
or several times, if applicable.
4) The MSC/SGSN verifies the UE capabilities with regard to the change of area
event. If either the MSC/ SGSN or the UE does not support the deferred
location request for the change of area event (for temporary or permanent
reasons), a Provide Subscriber Location return error shall be returned with a
suitable cause in step 7.\ If the UE is in idle mode, the core network
performs paging, authentication and ciphering. If privacy
notification/verification is requested, the MSC/SGSN sends an LCS Location
Notification Invoke message to the target UE with a location type indicating
activation of a deferred location request, a deferred location event type
containing the change of area types requested and an indication as to whether
privacy verification is required. LCS Location Notification is further
specified in clauses 9.1.2 and 9.1.6. If privacy verification was requested,
the UE returns an LCS Location Notification Return Result to the MSC/SGSN
indicating whether permission is granted or denied. If a previous deferred
location request is ongoing in the UE and the MSC/SGSN proceeds with the
current deferred request, the UE may return an LCS Location Notification
Return Error response to the MSC/SGSN indicating that the new request cannot
be supported.
5) The MSC/SGSN sends the LCS Area Event Invoke to the UE carrying the Area
Definition, other area event information, the LDR reference number and the
H-GMLC address. The message shall also define whether the event to be reported
is the UE being inside, entering into, leaving the area. The message shall
also include the validity period of the location request, the minimum interval
time between area event reports and the information whether the deferred area
event may be reported one time only, or several times, if applicable.
6) If the LCS Area Event Invoke is successfully received by the UE and the UE
supports the change of area type deferred location request, the UE sends
acknowledgement to MSC/SGSN and begins monitoring for the change of area
event. The UE shall determine whether it is inside, entering into or leaving
the target area by comparing the current serving cell identity, location area,
routing area, PLMN identity or country code to the Area Definition received
from the MSC/SGSN. In case of soft handover, it is sufficient if one of the
cells belongs to the target area. In case the Area Definition consists of a
location or routing area, PLMN or country identity the UE shall check for the
area event during the normal location or routing area update procedure. The
change of area event detection mechanism must not influence on the normal UE
cell selection and reselection procedures.\ If the UE does not support the
deferred location request (for temporary or permanent reasons), it shall send
the LCS Area Event Invoke ack. with the appropriate error cause. If a previous
deferred location request is still ongoing in the UE, the UE may return an LCS
Area Event Return Error response to the MSC/SGSN indicating that the new
request cannot be supported.
7) If either the MSC/ SGSN or the UE does not support the deferred location
request for the change of area event (for temporary or permanent reasons), a
Provide Subscriber Location return error shall be returned to the V-GMLC with
a suitable cause. If both of the SGSN/MSC and UE supports the deferred
location request for the change of area event, a Provide Subscriber Location
ack. shall be returned to the V-GMLC without a location estimate. MSC/SGSN
shall include the result of the notification/verification in the response to
the V-GMLC, if the notification/verification is needed. The response message
shall include the LDR reference number and the H-GMLC address. The change of
area event invoke result shall be also included, if necessary. After sending
the Provide Subscriber Location ack to the V-GMLC, the deferred location
request shall be completed in the MSC/SGSN. The SGSN/MSC may record charging
information for an accepted area event request.
8) to 10) V-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response via H-GMLC and R-GMLC to the
LCS Client to notify whether the request was successfully accepted or not.
When the H-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response to the R-GMLC, the LDR
reference number assigned by the H-GMLC shall be included, then the R‑GMLC
shall transfer the LDR reference number to the LCS Client in the LCS Service
Response. After sending the LCS Service Response to the H-GMLC, the deferred
location request shall be completed in the V-GMLC. The V-GMLC or R-GMLC may
record charging information for an accepted area event request.
11) UE detects that the requested area event has occurred.
12) Before sending the LCS Area Event Report the UE shall establish either a
CS radio connection or PS signalling connection as specified in clauses 9.2.1
and 9.2.2. The UE sends the LCS Area Event Report to the VMSC/SGSN including
the original LDR reference number and the H-GMLC address. The report shall
also include the result of the notification/verification procedure, if the
notification/verification is needed.
When the MSC/SGSN receives the report and it can handle this report, an
acknowledgement as a response should be sent to the UE. If the UE does not
receive any response from the MSC/SGSN after sending the report, i.e. the
current MSC/SGSN does not support the deferred location request for the area
event (for temporary or permanent reasons), the UE may re-send the report more
times. If the UE always does not receive the response, the UE shall stop
sending the report, then record a corresponding flag to indicate that a report
has been sent unsuccessfully. When the UE performs location update and detects
the LAI or RA is changed, if the flag has been set, the UE shall send the
report to the corresponding MSC/SGSN, and the flag will be cleared upon a
success of the sending.\ If the UE was requested to report the change of area
event one time only, the deferred location request shall be completed. In case
multiple reports were requested, the UE must not send a repeated LCS Area
Event Report more often than the requested minimum interval indicated in the
LCS Area Event Invoke.
Editor\'s Note: It could be useful to have MSC/SGSN repeat the notification
procedure with the target UE after the UE has reported the change of area
event, but this is for further study.
13) The MSC/SGSN sends the subscriber location report to its associated V-GMLC
with an indication of the event occurrence, the LDR reference number, the
H-GMLC address and may also include the indication whether the obtained
location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not (provided that this
indication is obtained from RAN with the location estimate). V-GMLC sends an
acknowledgement to MSC/SGSN in step 13b and the MSC/SGSN may record charging
information.
14) The V-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response to the H-GMLC with an indication
of the event occurrence, the LDR reference number and the H-GMLC address. The
LCS Service Response is sent in accordance with the requested QoS Class, as
described in clause 9.1.1 for common MT-LR. The LDR reference number and the
H-GMLC address will be used to identify the source of the original deferred
location request in the case that the UE has relocated before the area event
occurred. The V-GMLC may record charging information.
15) In case the UE moves to another PLMN of the PLMN identities list,
according to the PLMN identity the UE shall determine whether the Area
Definition of the target area is available. If it is not available, the UE
shall report that it has roamed into a new PLMN, including the new PLMN
identity and the LDR reference number. The H-GMLC shall transfer the original
area event request to the V-GMLC of the new PLMN. The procedure should be
continued as described in step 2 and onwards where the Area Definition of the
new PLMN shall be downloaded to the UE. Otherwise, the UE monitors the area
event in the new PLMN, does not inform the H-GMLC that it has entered into a
new PLMN.
16) The H-GMLC performs the privacy check as described in clause 9.1.1.
17) If the H-GMLC finds the indication of the requested location estimate is
stored, the H-GMLC should generate a new immediate LCS Service Request with
the QoS specified in the original request. Then the H-GMLC sends the new
request as described in clause 9.1.1 to the V-GMLC and waits the result the
location request, the subsequent procedures in clause 9.1.1 are continued.
The H-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response to R-GMLC with the LDR reference
number. If the location estimate of the target UE is requested in the request
and the location estimate was successfully obtained, the H-GMLC shall put the
obtained location estimate into the LCS Service Response. If the location
estimate of the target UE is requested in the request but the location
estimate could not be obtained, the H-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response
without the location estimate. Unless multiple reports were requested, the
deferred location request shall be completed in the H-GMLC after sending the
LCS Service Response to the R-GMLC. The H-GMLC may record charging
information.
18) The R-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response to the LCS client. Unless
multiple reports were requested, the deferred location request shall be
completed in the R-GMLC after sending the LCS Service Response to the LCS
client. The R-GMLC may record charging information.
#### 9.1.9.1 Cancellation of a Deferred Location Request -- Change of Area
event
Figure 9-7b illustrates the procedure for cancelling the Deferred Location
Request for the change of area event.
Figure 9.7b: Cancellation of a Deferred MT-LR with change of area event
procedure
1) The LCS Client requests the cancellation of a previously requested Deferred
Location Request. The LDR reference number that was included in the previous
LCS Service Response sent by the GMLC shall be included in the request to
indicate which outstanding LDR should be cancelled.
2) The R-GMLC sends the cancellation request to H-GMLC, including the LDR
reference number. R-GMLC may itself initiate the cancellation for some other
reason, e.g. the expiry of the validity timer specified by the start time and
stop time; or the expiry of an implementation dependent timer specified by the
Operator as a default value in the R-GMLC when the stop time is undefined or
exceeds the maximum allowed value.
3) The H-GMLC forwards the LCS Cancel Service Request to V-GMLC with the LDR
reference number which is received from the R-GMLC, and the H-GMLC address.
The H-GMLC may itself initiate the cancellation procedure, when the UE\'s
privacy profile stored in the H-GMLC or in the PPR was changed. For every
outstanding Deferred Location Request against that UE, the H-GMLC shall
perform or ask the PPR to perform a new privacy check based on the updated
privacy profile. If the privacy check passes, i.e. the LCS Client is still
allowed to position the target UE, the handling of the outstanding Deferred
Location Request should be continued. Otherwise, if the privacy check does not
pass, i.e. the Location estimate of the target UE is not allowed to be
provided to the LCS Client, the H-GMLC shall initiate a cancellation
procedure.
NOTE: The H-GMLC shall know that the UE subscriber\'s privacy profile has been
changed in the PPR when the LCS Privacy Profile Update has been sent from PPR
to H-GMLC as described in 9.1.1.2.
4) The V-GMLC sends the Provide Subscriber Location request to SGSN/MSC,
indicating a cancellation of a deferred location request and including the LDR
reference number specified by the LCS Client in the LCS Cancel Service Request
and the H-GMLC address received from the H-GMLC.
5) The SGSN/MSC sends the LCS Area Event Cancellation, including the LDR
reference number and the H-GMLC address, request to UE.
6a) The UE cancels the Area event deferred location request and sends the LCS
Area Event cancellation ack., with no area event information included to
VMSC/SGSN.
6b) While the UE is monitoring for the area event to occur, the UE may cancel
or terminate the deferred location request for the change of area on its own
behalf by sending the LCS Area Event report with the LDR reference number, an
indication of the cancellation and an appropriate error cause.
7) The SGSN/MSC sends the cancellation acknowledgement to the V-GMLC in the
Provide Subscriber Location Ack, with the LDR reference number and the H-GMLC
address.
8) The V-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to H-GMLC with the LDR
reference number and the H-GMLC address.
9) H-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to R-GMLC with the LDR
reference number. H-GMLC may send the LCS Cancel Service Response to R-GMLC,
even if the R-GMLC/LCS client has not requested the cancellation, see step 3.
10) R-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to the LCS Client.
### 9.1.10 Circuit Switched Post Positioning Notification and Verification
Procedure
Figure 9.10 illustrates the post positioning notification and verification
procedure.
Figure 9.10: CS Post Positioning Notification and Verification Procedure
1) Common PS and CS MT-LR procedure as described in 9.1.1.
2) The GMLC sends a PROVIDE_ SUBSCRIBER _LOCATION message to the MSC/MSC
server with an indication of \"notification only\". This message carries the
UE subscriber\'s IMSI. For a call related location request, the message also
carries the LCS client\'s called party number. For a value added LCS client,
the message shall carry the client name, the external identity of the LCS
client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and available).
Also the message may carry the type of the LCS client name and also the type
of the Requestor identity if the requestor identity was included. For a PLMN
operator LCS client, the message shall carry the internal identity of the LCS
client. Moreover the message may also carry the Service Type. If the result of
the privacy check at H-GMLC/PPR indicated that the codeword shall be sent to
the UE user, the message may carry also the codeword received from the LCS
client. For a PLMN operator LCS client, the message shall carry the internal
identity of the LCS client. If the Requestor Identity is provided, the GMLC
shall send it as separate information. In addition, in order to display the
requestor identity in case of pre Rel-5 network elements (i.e. MSC and/or UE),
the requestor identity may be also added to the LCS client name by the GMLC.
When the Requestor identity is added to the LCS client name the practice
described in the Annex D should be followed.
3) If the UE is in idle mode, the Core Network performs paging, authentication
and ciphering. The MSC will page a GPRS attached UE either through A/Iu or Gs
interface, depending on the presence of the Gs interface.
4) An LCS Location Notification Invoke message is sent to the target UE
indicating a location type of notification and verification only, the identity
of the LCS client, the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available) and whether privacy verification is required. Also the message may
indicate the type of the LCS client name and also the type of the Requestor
identity if the requestor identity was included. Moreover, the message may
carry also the service type and the codeword.4).
5) The target UE notifies the UE user of the location request. If privacy
verification was requested, the target UE indicates to the UE user whether the
location report will be allowed or not allowed in the absence of a response
and waits for the user to grant or withhold permission. The UE then returns an
LCS Location Notification Return Result to the VMSC/MSC server indicating, if
privacy verification was requested, whether permission is granted or denied.
If the UE user does not respond after a predetermined time period, the
VMSC/MSC server shall infer a \"no response\" condition. The VMSC/MSC server
shall return an error response to the GMLC if privacy verification was
requested and either the UE user denies permission or there is no response
with the UE subscription profile indicating barring of the location request in
the absence of a response.
6) The VMSC/MSC server returns the indication of successful notification and
verification result, if it has received a LCS Location Notification Return
Result indicating that permission is granted. If a LCS Location Notification
Return Result message indicating that permission is not granted is received,
or there is no response, with the requested privacy action or the UE
subscription profile indicating barring of location in the absence of a
response, the VMSC/MSC server shall return an error response to the GMLC. The
MSC/MSC server may then release the Mobility Management connection to the UE,
if the UE was previously idle, and the MSC/MSC server may record charging
information.
7) Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain as described in 9.1.1.

Figure 9.11: PS Post Positioning Notification and Verification Procedure
1) Common PS and CS MT-LR procedure as described in 9.1.1.
2) The GMLC sends a Provide Subscriber Location message to the SGSN with an
indication of \"notification only\". This message carries the UE subscriber\'s
IMSI. For a session related location request, the message also carries the
APN-NI to which the user has established the session. For a value added LCS
client, the message shall carry the client name, the external identity of the
LCS client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available), optionally the message may also carry the Service Type. Also the
message may carry the type of the LCS client name and also the type of the
Requestor identity if the requestor identity was included. If the result of
the privacy check at H-GMLC/PPR indicated that the codeword shall be sent to
the UE user, the message may carry also the codeword received from the LCS
client. For a PLMN operator LCS client, the message shall carry the internal
identity of the LCS client. If the Requestor Identity is provided, the GMLC
shall send it as separate information. In addition, in order to display the
requestor identity in case of pre Rel-5 network elements (i.e. SGSN and/or
UE), the requestor identity may be also added to the LCS client name by the
GMLC. When the Requestor identity is added to the LCS client name the practice
described in the Annex D should be followed.
3) The SGSN determines a required privacy related action as described in Annex
A.3 based on the indicators of privacy related action in the PSL message from
the GMLC. If the UE is in idle mode, the SGSN performs paging. The paging
procedure is defined in TS 23.060 [15].
4) Security functions may be executed. These procedures are defined in TS
23.060 [15].
5) A notification invoke message is sent to the target UE indicating a
location type of notification and verification only, the identity of the LCS
client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and available),
whether privacy verification is required. Also the message may indicate the
type of the LCS client name and also the type of the Requestor identity if the
requestor identity was included. Moreover, the message may carry also the
service type and the codeword.
6) The target UE notifies the UE user of the location request and, if privacy
verification was requested, waits for the user to grant or withhold
permission. The UE then returns a notification result to the SGSN indicating,
if privacy verification was requested, whether permission is granted or
denied. If the UE user does not respond after a predetermined time period, the
SGSN shall infer a \"no response\" condition. The SGSN shall return an error
response to the GMLC if privacy verification was requested and either the UE
user denies permission or there is no response with the UE subscription
profile indicating barring of the location request.
7) The SGSN returns the indication of successful notification and verification
result, if it has received a LCS Location Notification Return Result
indicating that permission is granted. If a LCS Location Notification Return
Result message indicating that permission is not granted is received, or there
is no response, with the requested privacy action or the UE subscription
profile indicating barring of location, the SGSN shall return an error
response to the GMLC.
8) Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain as described in 9.1.1.
### 9.1.12 Deferred Location Request Procedure for the Periodic Location Event
This clause describes the procedures for a Deferred Location Request where a
Location Report is returned to the network each time the periodic reporting
event occurs within the UE.
#### 9.1.12.1 Instigation of an MT-LR Request for Periodic Location
Figure 9.12: Deferred MT-LR Initiation Procedure for Periodic Location
1) The LCS Service Request contains the periodic location request information,
such as time interval between successive location reports and total number of
reports.
2) LCS service request handling between GMLCs as described in clause 9.1.1.
The information received by the R-GMLC is transferred to the H-GMLC. The
R-GMLC also indicates whether MO-LR Short Circuit is allowed.\ The H-GMLC
assigns a LDR reference number to this LCS Service Request and may include a
list of PLMNs and possibly associated radio access technologies (e.g. GSM,
UMTS), either prioritized or non-prioritized, in which subsequent MO-LR TTTP
requests must be made by the UE (according to the procedure in clause
9.1.12.2) and an indication for each PLMN (and possibly associated radio
access technology) as to whether the PLMN supports periodic location in the
RAN. If no list is included by the H-GMLC, subsequent MO-LR TTTP requests are
restricted to the current serving PLMN only. The H-GMLC then transfers the
information to the V-GMLC, including the LDR reference number, any reporting
PLMN list and the H-GMLC address.
NOTE 1: Any preference for using MO-LR Short Circuit needs to consider the
list of PLMNs in which subsequent MO-LR TTTP requests will be made (if this
was included by the H-GMLC) since this agreement applies to all of these
PLMNs.
3) The V-GMLC conveys the periodic location request to MSC/SGSN in the Provide
Subscriber Location request including the LDR reference number, any reporting
PLMN list and the H-GMLC address in the request, as well as an indication of
whether MO-LR Short Circuit is permitted.
4) The MSC/SGSN verifies the UE capabilities with regard to the support of
location service related call independent supplementary services (e.g.
notification for LCS). If either the UE does not support any location service
related call independent supplementary service or the MSC/SGSN does not
support the deferred location request for the periodic location event (for
temporary or permanent reasons), a Provide Subscriber Location return error
shall be returned with a suitable cause in step 7.\ If the UE is in idle mode,
the core network performs paging, authentication and ciphering. If privacy
notification/verification is requested, the MSC/SGSN sends an LCS Location
Notification Invoke message to the target UE with a location type indicating
activation of a deferred location request, a deferred location event type
indicating periodic location and an indication as to whether privacy
verification is required. LCS Location Notification is further specified in
clauses 9.1.2 and 9.1.6. If privacy verification was requested, the UE returns
an LCS Location Notification Return Result to the MSC/SGSN indicating whether
permission is granted or denied. If a previous deferred location request is
ongoing in the UE and the MSC/SGSN proceeds with the current deferred request,
the UE may return an LCS Location Notification Return Error response to the
MSC/SGSN indicating that the new request cannot be supported.
NOTE 2: There is no UE capability information directly indicating support of a
periodic deferred location request. However, if the UE supports at least one
location service related call independent supplementary service (such as
notification for LCS), the MSC/SGSN can assume support for a periodic deferred
location request and attempt to request it in step 5. If the UE does not
recognize this request, it may return a Facility Rejected indication in step 6
(as defined in TS 24.008 [24]) to the MSC/SGSN. The return of at least this
minimal indication of non-support (as opposed to the UE ignoring the request
and sending back nothing) is ensured by support of at least one location
service related call independent supplementary service.
5) The MSC/SGSN sends an LCS Periodic Location Invoke to the UE containing the
periodic location related parameters (reporting interval and total number of
reports) and other relevant information (QoS, LCS Client External ID, H-GMLC
address, LDR reference number, any reporting PLMN list and use of MO-LR Short
Circuit).
6) If the LCS Periodic Location Invoke is successfully received by the UE and
the UE supports the periodic location according to the request received in
step 5, the UE sends an acknowledgement to MSC/SGSN including the MO-LR Short
Circuit indication if received in step 5. If the MO-LR Short Circuit
indication is received in step 5 and the UE does not support MO-LR Short
Circuit (for temporary or permanent reasons), the UE sends the LCS Periodic
Location Invoke Ack without the MO-LR Short Circuit indication indicating to
the MSC/SGSN that MO-LR Short Circuit will not be used. If a previous deferred
location request is still ongoing in the UE, the UE may return an LCS Periodic
Location Return Error response to the MSC/SGSN indicating that the new request
cannot be supported.
7) If either the MSC/SGSN or the UE does not support the periodic location
request (for temporary or permanent reasons), a Provide Subscriber Location
return error shall be returned to the V-GMLC with a suitable error cause.\ If
both of the MSC/SGSN and UE supports the periodic location request, a Provide
Subscriber Location Ack. shall be returned to the V-GMLC. The MSC/SGSN shall
include an MO-LR Short Circuit indication in the response to the V-GMLC, if
the use of MO-LR Short Circuit was requested and accepted by the UE in step 6.
8) to 10) The V-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response via H-GMLC and R-GMLC to
the LCS Client to notify whether the periodic location request was
successfully accepted or not. When the H-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response
to the R-GMLC, the LDR reference number assigned by the H-GMLC shall be
included, and the R GMLC may transfer the LDR reference number to the LCS
Client in the LCS Service Response.
NOTE 3: If the R-GMLC receives an error response in step 9 indicating that the
MT-LR request for periodic location cannot be supported (for temporary or
permanent reasons), the R-GMLC may invoke periodic location using the common
MT-LR procedure defined in clause 9.1.1.
#### 9.1.12.2 Reporting of Periodic Location
Once the periodic location reporting has been successfully instigated using
the procedure in figure 9.12 (or 9.8a in case the UE subscriber or an
application in the UE is the instigator), the UE is responsible for sending
location estimates periodically to the LCS Client using MO-LR TTTP procedure
illustrated in figure 9.13 below. This procedure begins immediately or, in the
case of MO-LR short circuit, almost immediately after the procedure in figure
9.12 (or 9.8a) and continues until the specified number of reports for this
request is attained or the procedure is cancelled by the UE, R‑GMLC or H‑GMLC
using the procedure specified in clause 9.1.12.3.
Figure 9.13: Reporting of Periodic Location
1) to 2) If the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a radio connection setup
and sends a CM Service Request indicating a request for call independent
supplementary service to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN (CS domain). If the UE is
in dedicated mode, the UE sends a CM Service Request on the already
established radio connection. The VMSC/MSC server instigates authentication
and ciphering if the UE was in idle mode or returns a CM Service Accept if the
UE was in dedicated mode.
For PS domain, in UMTS, if the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a PS
signalling connection and sends a Service Request indicating signalling to the
SGSN via RAN. If the UE already has PS signalling connection, the UE does not
need to send the Service Request. Security functions may be executed. These
procedures are described in TS 23.060 [15]. In GSM this signalling step is not
needed.
3) The UE sends an LCS MO-LR Invoke to the VMSC/MSC Server (CS domain) or to
the SGSN (PS domain) for a transfer of the location estimate to a third party
LCS client. This message includes the identity of the LCS client and the
H-GMLC address received by the UE during execution of the procedure described
in clause 9.1.12.1 (or clause 9.2.3).\ The LCS MO-LR Invoke also includes the
LDR Reference Number. The presence of the LDR Reference Number indicates that
the transfer and its attributes (e.g. use of MO-LR Short Circuit) have been
previously authorized by the R-GMLC, H-GMLC and V-GMLC, using the procedure
described in clause 9.1.12.1 (or clause 9.2.3).\ This message also includes a
location estimate if MO-LR Short Circuit was requested and has been
acknowledged by the UE. If MO-LR Short Circuit has been acknowledged and the
UE was not able to obtain a location estimate, the LCS MO-LR Invoke shall
still be sent when the reporting event occurs indicating that no location
estimate is available.\ If MO-LR Short circuit has not been agreed or was not
requested, the LCS MO-LR Invoke message does not include any location estimate
or error indication, but includes QoS information and optional periodic
location information (reporting interval and number of reports), as well as an
optional request for location update notification (see steps 13 and 14).
4) to 6) If MO-LR Short Circuit is not used (i.e. no location estimate or no
error indicating unavailability of a location estimate is included in step 3),
the MSC/SGSN obtains a location estimate by sending a Location Request to RAN
associated with the target UE in step 4. The Location Request includes the LCS
QoS. If supported by the serving RAN and included by the UE in step 3, the
Location Request can include periodic location information (e.g. reporting
interval and number of reports). In step 5, RAN determines the positioning
method and instigates the particular message sequence for this method, as
specified in UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been obtained,
RAN returns it to the MSC/SGSN in a Location Report message in step 6.
7) If a location estimate has been received from the UE in step 3 (i.e. use of
MO-LR Short Circuit) or was successfully obtained in step (6), the MSC/SGSN
sends a MAP Subscriber Location Report to its associated V-GMLC with an
indication of the periodic event occurrence, the LDR reference number, the
H-GMLC address and may also include the indication whether the obtained
location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not (provided that this
indication is obtained from RAN or the UE with the location estimate). If no
location estimate was obtained in step 3 or 6 (e.g. positioning failure or
time out), a report indicating this shall be returned.
8) The V-GMLC sends an acknowledgement to the MSC/SGSN and the MSC/SGSN may
record charging information.
9) The V-GMLC sends an LCS Service Response to the H-GMLC with an indication
of the periodic event occurrence, the LDR reference number and the location
estimate if this was successfully obtained. If the location estimate could not
be obtained, the V-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response without the location
estimate. The LDR reference number will be used by the H-GMLC to identify the
source of the original periodic location request. The V-GMLC may record
charging information.
10) The H-GMLC may perform a privacy check as described in clause 9.1.1.
11) The H-GMLC sends an LCS Service Response to the R-GMLC with an indication
of the periodic event occurrence, the LDR reference number and the location
estimate if this was successfully obtained. If the location estimate could not
be obtained, the H-GMLC sends the LCS Service Response without the location
estimate. If this is the final location report, the periodic location request
shall be completed in the H-GMLC. The H-GMLC may record charging information.
12) The location information is passed to the LCS Client. If this is the final
location report, the periodic location request shall be completed in the
R-GMLC. The R-GMLC may record charging information.
13) to 14) If periodic reporting in the RAN was instigated in step 4 and
location update notification was requested in step 3, an LCS Location Update
is sent to the UE to indicate successful transfer of the first location
estimate (or possibly transfer of a location failure report) towards the LCS
Client. The UE acknowledges this. The UE may employ the LCS Location Update
ack. to cancel the procedure (see Note 2).
15) to 24) If periodic reporting in the RAN was instigated in step 4, RAN
obtains a new location estimate in step 15 and transfers this to the MSC/SGSN
in step 16 after the reporting interval has transpired. The MSC/SGSN transfers
the location estimate to the LCS client in steps 17 to 22. Steps 17 to 22 are
as in steps 7 to 12. An LCS Location Update is then sent to the UE in step 23
and acknowledged in step 24 if requested in step 3. Steps 23 and 24 are as in
steps 13 and 14. Steps 15-24 are repeated at the periodic location interval
(as the RAN provides each new location estimate to the MSC/SGSN) until the
number of reports is attained, or until there is a request from the RAN to
hand the UE over to a different MSC/SGSN. Following transfer of the final
location estimate to the LCS Client, the transfer and acknowledgment of an LCS
Location Update in steps 23 and 24, if requested in step 3, could be omitted
as an implementation option.
25) The MSC/SGSN returns an LCS MO-LR Return Result to the UE indicating that
the location estimate (or location estimates in case of periodic reporting in
RAN was instigated at step 4 has been successfully transferred to the LCS
client or not.
26) The MSC/SGSN may release the CM, MM or GMM and radio connection to the UE,
if the UE was previously idle.\ The UE is responsible for restarting the
procedure at step 1 or 3 if the total number of location reports has not yet
been reached. In the case of restarting at step 3, the CM, MM/GMM and radio
connections would not be released.
NOTE 1: In case of periodic reporting in the RAN is used, the LCS MO-LR TTTP
invoke request sent by the UE in step 3 could include, besides the periodic
reporting interval, a number of reports less than or equal to the remaining
number of reports for the whole procedure. When a smaller number of reports
was requested, the target UE would be responsible for reissuing further MO-LR
requests, after periodic reporting from the RAN was completed, until the
overall number of reports was attained.
NOTE 2: After each location estimate (or possibly location failure report) has
been transferred to the LCS client (e.g. after step 12, 22), the MSC/SGSN
sends an LCS Location Update Invoke message to the UE indicating that the
location estimate (or possibly location failure report) has been successfully
transferred if this was requested by the UE in step 3. The UE acknowledges the
receipt of the LCS Location Update Invoke message and a cancellation of
location could be included if the UE subscriber wishes to cancel the periodic
location procedure at that point. In the event that the UE cancels the
procedure, the MSC/SGSN shall notify the V-GMLC, H-GMLC, R-GMLC and LCS Client
using the procedure in clause 9.1.12.4.
If the UE moves out of coverage of the PLMN(s) in which the location reports
are allowed or if a conflict with the PLMNs preferred by the UE for other
services prevents access to the PLMN(s) for periodic location, the UE
terminates the procedure and stops sending LCS MO-LR Invoke. The UE may
determine the need for termination if it is unable to instigate an MO-LR TTTP
request for some period of time (e.g. some multiple of the required periodic
location interval).\ If any LCS MO-LR Invoke TTTP request is rejected by the
current serving PLMN with a cause indicating that the procedure cannot be
supported (for temporary or permanent reasons) -- e.g. MO-LR Short Circuit was
initially agreed, but can no longer be supported or cannot be supported in the
new PLMN -- and the UE is unable to instigate the procedure in any other PLMN
allowed when the procedure was originally started, the UE terminates the
procedure and stops sending LCS MO-LR Invoke TTTP requests.
#### 9.1.12.3 LCS Client cancellation of a Deferred Location Request --
Periodic Location Event
Figure 9.14 illustrates the procedure for cancelling the Deferred Location
Request for the periodic location event when cancellation is requested by the
LCS Client.
Figure 9.14: LCS Client cancellation of a Deferred MT-LR for Periodic Location
1) The LCS Client requests the cancellation of a previously requested Deferred
Location Request. The LDR reference number that was included in the previous
LCS Service Response sent by the R-GMLC shall be included in the request to
indicate which outstanding LDR should be cancelled.
2) The R-GMLC sends the cancellation request to H-GMLC, including the LDR
reference number. The R‑GMLC may itself initiate the cancellation for some
other reason, e.g. whenever the R-GMLC infers from the absence of periodic
location reports that the service may have been terminated.
3) The H-GMLC may send a SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_LCS message to the home HLR/HSS
of the UE with the IMSI or MSISDN of this UE. This may be needed if the UE may
no longer be served by the original V‑PLMN or by the original SGSN or VMSC/MSC
server.
4) The HLR/HSS returns the current SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC server for the UE and
the V-GMLC address.
5) The H-GMLC forwards the LCS Cancel Service Request to V-GMLC with the LDR
reference number which is received from the R-GMLC, the H-GMLC address and the
SGSN or VMSC/MSC server address (e.g. received from the HLR/HSS). The H-GMLC
may itself initiate the cancellation procedure, when the UE\'s privacy profile
stored in the H-GMLC or in the PPR was changed. For every outstanding Deferred
Location Request against that UE, the H-GMLC shall perform or ask the PPR to
perform a new privacy check based on the updated privacy profile. If the new
privacy check passes, i.e. the LCS Client is still allowed to position the
target UE, the handling of the outstanding Deferred Location Request should be
continued. Otherwise, if the new privacy check does not pass, i.e. the
location estimate of the target UE is not allowed to be provided to the LCS
Client, the H-GMLC shall initiate a cancellation procedure. If the H-GMLC
cannot complete the new privacy check (e.g., because it requires information,
such as UE location, not currently available to the H-GMLC), then the H-GMLC
may initiate a cancellation procedure according to H-PLMN privacy policy.
NOTE: The H-GMLC shall know that the UE subscriber\'s privacy profile has been
changed in the PPR when the LCS Privacy Profile Update has been sent from PPR
to H-GMLC as described in clause 9.1.1.2.
6) The V-GMLC sends the Provide Subscriber Location request to MSC/SGSN,
indicating a cancellation of a deferred location request and including the LDR
reference number specified by the LCS Client in the LCS Cancel Service Request
and the H-GMLC address received from the H-GMLC. The V-GMLC shall transfer the
location cancellation even when the V-GMLC was not involved in establishing
the periodic location request -- e.g. if the target UE is now served by
another V-PLMN.
7) The MSC/SGSN sends the LCS Periodic Location Cancellation request,
including the LDR reference number and H-GMLC address, to the UE. If the
periodic reporting is via the serving RAN as described in step 4 of figure
9.13, the periodic location cancellation request is also sent to RAN.
8) The UE stops the periodic location reporting and returns the LCS Periodic
Location cancellation ack. to the MSC/SGSN. Return of an LCS Periodic Location
cancellation ack. shall apply even when the UE has no knowledge of the
periodic location procedure being cancelled (e.g. UE was powered off during
the procedure).
9) The MSC/SGSN sends the cancellation acknowledgement to the V-GMLC in the
Provide Subscriber Location Ack, with the LDR reference number and the H-GMLC
address.
10) The V-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to H-GMLC with the LDR
reference number and the H‑GMLC address.
11) H-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to R-GMLC with the LDR
reference number.
12) R-GMLC sends the LCS Cancel Service Response to the LCS Client.
#### 9.1.12.4 UE cancellation of a Deferred Location Request -- Periodic
Location Event
Figure 9.15 illustrates the procedure for cancelling the Deferred Location
Request for the periodic location event when cancellation is requested by the
UE. If a network entity (e.g. H-GMLC, V-GMLC, SGSN/MSC) cancels the Deferred
Location Request, the procedure in clause 9.1.12.3 for LCS Client cancellation
shall be used to cancel towards the UE and the procedure in this clause shall
be used to cancel towards the LCS Client.
Figure 9.15: UE cancellation of a Deferred MT-LR for Periodic Location
1) to 2) If the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a radio connection setup
and sends a CM Service Request indicating a request for call independent
supplementary service to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN (CS domain). If the UE is
in dedicated mode, the UE sends a CM Service Request on the already
established radio connection. The VMSC/MSC server instigates authentication
and ciphering if the UE was in idle mode or returns a CM Service Accept if the
UE was in dedicated mode.
For PS domain, in UMTS, if the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a PS
signalling connection and sends a Service Request indicating signalling to the
SGSN via RAN. If the UE already has PS signalling connection, the UE does not
need to send the Service Request. Security functions may be executed. These
procedures are described in TS 23.060 [15]. In GSM this signalling step is not
needed.
3) The UE sends an LCS MO-LR Invoke to the VMSC/MSC Server (CS domain) or to
the SGSN (PS domain) for cancellation of a transfer of location to a third
party LCS client. This message includes the identity of the LCS client, the
H-GMLC address, a termination cause (e.g. subscriber terminates the procedure)
and the LDR Reference Number. The presence of the LDR Reference Number
indicates that the cancellation is for a previously authorized periodic
location request.
4) to 7) The cancellation request shall be transferred in succession from the
MSC/SGSN to the V-GMLC, H‑GMLC, R‑GMLC serving the LCS client and finally may
be transferred to the LCS client (e.g. if the LCS Client originated the
periodic location request or was informed of a periodic location request
originated by the UE as in clause 9.2.3).
8) to 11) The response transferred back to the MSC/SGSN acknowledges the
cancellation.
12) The MSC/SGSN returns the acknowledgment to the UE in a LCS MO-LR Return
Result message.
13) The UE may instigate release of the CM, MM/GMM and radio connections.
### 9.1.13 IW-MT-LR Procedure
Figure 9.16 describes the IW-MT-LR procedure.
{width="6.018055555555556in" height="4.709722222222222in"}
Figure 9.16: IW-MT-LR in I-WLAN
NOTE 1: Even though figure 9.16 does not specify the specific services with
IW-MT-LR, this flow can be applicable for both immediate and triggered
services (e.g. periodic or change of area event case).
1\. A WLAN UE selects a WLAN AN and establishes the WLAN connection and is
authenticated in I-WLAN. The WLAN AN may send the current location of WLAN AN
to the WLAN UE. The WLAN AN may send its location to the AAA. The tunnel may
be established with between WLAN UE and one of PDGs in PLMN.
2\. An external LCS client sends the LCS request to the GMLC. An external LCS
client requests the current location, e.g. immediate location request, from a
GMLC. The LCS Client may also request a triggered location request, e.g.
periodic or change of area event. The GMLC verifies the identity of the LCS
client and its subscription to the LCS service requested and derives the
MSISDN or IMSI or pseudonym of the target UE to be located and the LCS QoS
from either subscription data or data supplied by the LCS client.
The LCS request may carry also the Service Identity and the Codeword. The GMLC
may verify that the Service Identity received in the LCS request matches one
of the service identities allowed for the LCS client. If the service identity
does not match one of the service identities for the LCS client, the GMLC
shall reject the LCS request. Otherwise, the GMLC can map the received service
identity in a corresponding service type.
If the location request is originated by a Requestor, the Requestor Identity
may be added to the LCS service request. The LCS client should authenticate
the Requestor Identity but this is outside the scope of this specification.
The LCS service request may also contain the type of the Requestor identity if
the requestor identity was included.
The GMLC performs privacy check on the basis of the UE user\'s privacy profile
stored in the GMLC or PPR.
3\. Steps 3 and 4 may be skipped if the GMLC already has the address of the
AAA server. Steps 3 to 6 may be skipped if the GMLC has alternative access to
the UE\'s IP address (e.g. using dynamic DNS or from a previous interaction
with the UE) or is able to instigate step 7 without knowing this address (e.g.
using MT-SMS or WAP Push in the case of SUPL). GMLC requests the address of
AAA server and WLAN UE capability to the HSS. In this case, the capability
information of the WLAN UE refers to capability information of the terminal
relevant to positioning such as whether the terminal supports the OMA SUPL
(OMA AD SUPL [38], OMA TS ULP [39]) or whether it supports another location
procedures.
4\. HSS returns the address of AAA server of the target WLAN UE and the
capability of the WLAN UE to GMLC.
5\. If the target WLAN UE supports the OMA SUPL, GMLC queries AAA to obtain
the address of WLAN UE. GMLC may request the location of WLAN UE.
6\. If its location is available and the quality of position meets the LCS QoS
requested by GMLC, then AAA responds with available location information of
the WLAN UE to the GMLC. Otherwise, GMLC retrieves the address of WLAN UE from
AAA. If there is no tunnel is available between the PDG and the WLAN UE, the
AAA will return an indication that UE is not reachable.
7\. GMLC initiates positioning procedure. This shall use SUPL procedures based
on OMA SUPL (OMA AD SUPL [38], OMA TS ULP [39]). If the tunnel between the
WLAN UE and the PDG is available and the GMLC has obtained the UE IP address,
GMLC generates an SUPL initiation message, and transmits it to the WLAN UE by
using the address of WLAN UE over available IP connection between the WLAN UE
and the PDG. If the tunnel between the WLAN UE and the PDG is not available or
if the GMLC did not obtain the UE IP address, GMLC sends an SUPL initiation
message using the UE IP address if available or by other means (e.g. MT-SMS or
WAP Push).
8\. The location information obtained will be transferred to external LCS
client.
NOTE 2: The GMLC may, as an implementation option, cache the results received
in step 4 and/or step 6 in order to avoid further queries when a location
request is received for the same target UE at a later time and the AAA server
address and/or WLAN UE address, respectively, has not changed.
### 9.1.14 IW-MT-LR Procedure without HLR/HSS or AAA Query
Figure 9.17 illustrates current or last known location requests for an
emergency services call, where an emergency services client (i.e. a Public
Safety Answering Point) requests updated location information for the target
UE. In order to support location of emergency call s from UICC-less terminals,
TS 23.167 [36a] specifies that the IMS core shall push information identifying
the terminal to the PSAP and GMLC during establishment of the emergency call.
NOTE 1: In some regions, based on regional specifications, the GMLC may use
correlation information that was previously provided to it by the IMS Core to
identify the target UE.
The IMS core also sends the correlation information to the PSAP during the
call establishment as described in TS 23.167 [36a]. Using the correlation key
the PSAP may request the initial or updated location information from the
GMLC. The management of this regional correlation information (e.g. ESQK in
North America) and support of the Le interface to the external LCS Client may
be handled by a separate functional entity from the GMLC, e.g. a RDF as
defined in TS 23.167 [36a].
{width="5.522916666666666in" height="3.357638888888889in"}
Figure 9.17: IW-MT-LR without an HLR/HSS or AAA Query
1\. The WLAN UE selects a WLAN AN and establishes the WLAN connection and may
be authenticated in I-WLAN. The tunnel is established between the WLAN UE and
a PDG in PLMN.
2\. The WLAN UE establishes an emergency services call as described in TS
23.167 [36a]. The UE determines its own location if possible. The UE may
include the identifier of access node (e.g., MAC address of the AP), if
available, as location identifier in the session request and possibly other
readily available location information, e.g. GPS based coordinates or the
street address of the UE or the AP as provided by the user of the UE. If the
UE is not able to determine its own location, the UE may, if capable, request
the location information from the IP‑CAN or SLP. The case when the UE requests
its own location information or enhanced location information from the SLP
using OMA-SUPL is described in clause 9.2.5. The IP-CAN may return a
representation of the location information to the UE. During this step, the
IMS core may push the WLAN UE\'s identification and the location information
provided by the UE to the LRF (GMLC) along with correlation information, if
applicable. The GMLC may record this information but in some regions only for
the duration of the call as the case may be. The correlation information may
be regionally specific (e.g. as is the case for support of location for an
emergency call in the CS domain in clause 9.1.3). The IMS core shall also send
the correlation information to the PSAP/ emergency centre during the call
establishment as specified in TS 23.167 [36a].
NOTE 2: The mechanism used by the UE to obtain location information from the
I‑WLAN IP‑CAN is out of scope. One method that could be used is the mechanism
defined by IEEE 802.11k Task Group for carrying location information (per RFC
3825) from one IEEE 802.11 station/AP to another IEEE 802.11 station/AP.
3\. An external LCS client associated with the emergency centre PSAP sends a
location request to the GMLC for the initial location or an updated location
for the WLAN UE. The request may include the address and the identification of
the WLAN UE and in some regions may include correlation information that
enables the GMLC to associate the request with the information stored in step
2.
4\. If initial location was requested the procedure continues from step 5. If
updated location was requested the GMLC initiates a positioning procedure
where either the UE or GMLC determines the position of the UE. GMLC/SLP shall
request the UE to establish a so called user plane connection with the
GMLC/SLP and use the OMA SUPL mechanism specified by OMA (OMA AD SUPL [38],
OMA TS ULP [39]) to transport location related assistance data and location
information between the UE and GMLC/SLP. The UE may send the identifier of the
access node (e.g. MAC address of the AP) to the GMLC and GMLC, possibly using
an external database, maps this location identifier to the corresponding
geographical information, e.g. coordinates or street address. GMLC may return
this geographical information to the UE.
NOTE 3: The location information obtained based on the mapping of an
identifier of access node (e.g. MAC address of the AP) to location information
stored in a database may not be correct, e.g. the location of the AP might be
changed without any updates to the database.
5\. GMLC sends the initial location information, if so requested, or the
updated location information obtained in step 4 to the external LCS client.
### 9.1.15 EPC Mobile Terminating Location Request (EPC-MT-LR)
Figure 9.18 illustrates the general network positioning for LCS clients
external to the PLMN for EPC services. In this scenario, it is assumed that
the target UE is identified using an MSISDN or IMSI.
Figure 9.18: General Network Positioning for EPC-MT-LR
#### 9.1.15.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) Common PS and CS MT-LR procedure as described in clause 9.1.1.
2) GMLC sends a Provide Subscriber Location message to the MME indicated by
the HLR/HSS. This message carries the type of location information requested
(e.g. current location and optionally, velocity), the UE subscriber\'s IMSI,
LCS QoS information (e.g. accuracy, response time) and an indication of
whether the LCS client has the override capability. For a session related
location request, the message also carries the APN-NI to which the UE user has
established the session. For a value added LCS client, the message shall carry
the client name, the external identity of the LCS client and the Requestor
Identity (if that is both supported and available), optionally the message may
also carry the Service Type. Also the message may carry the type of the LCS
client name and also the type of the Requestor identity if the requestor
identity was included. If the result of the privacy check at H-GMLC/PPR
indicated that the codeword shall be sent to the UE user, the message may
carry also the codeword received from the LCS client. For a PLMN operator LCS
client, the message shall carry the internal identity of the LCS client. If
the Requestor Identity is provided, the GMLC shall send it as separate
information. The message also shall carry the indicators of privacy related
action which is described in clause 9.5.4, if it is provided by H-GMLC.
3) If the GMLC is located in another PLMN or another country, the MME first
authenticates that a location request is allowed from this PLMN or from this
country. If not, an error response is returned. Secondly the MME checks if the
UE is detached or suspended and in either such case an error response is
returned. If the PSL message from the GMLC includes the indicators of privacy
related action, the MME determines a required privacy related action as
described in clause A.3. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state, the MME performs a
network triggered service request as defined in TS 23.401 [41] in order to
establish a signalling connection with the UE and assign a specific eNodeB.
4) If the location request comes from a value added LCS client and the
indicators of privacy related action indicates that the UE must either be
notified or notified with privacy verification and the UE supports
notification of LCS, a notification invoke message is sent to the target UE
indicating the type of location request from the LCS Client (e.g. current
location or \"current or last known location\") and the identity of the LCS
client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and available),
whether privacy verification is required. Also the message may indicate the
type of the LCS client name and also the type of the Requestor identity if the
requestor identity was included. Moreover, the message may carry also the
service type and the codeword. Optionally, the MME may after sending the NAS
Location Notification Invoke message continue in parallel the location
process, i.e. continue to step 6 without waiting for a LCS Location
Notification Return Result message in step 5.
5) The target UE notifies the UE user of the location request and, if privacy
verification was requested, waits for the user to grant or withhold
permission. The UE then returns a notification result to the MME indicating,
if privacy verification was requested, whether permission is granted or
denied. Optionally, this message can be returned some time after step 4, but
before step 9. If the UE user does not respond after a predetermined time
period, the MME shall infer a \"no response\" condition. The MME shall return
an error response to the GMLC if privacy verification was requested and either
the UE user denies permission or there is no response with the UE privacy
profile received from the GMLC indicating barring of the location request.
6) The MME selects a E-SMLC as described in clause 6.3.13 and sends a Location
Request message to the selected E-SMLC. Once an MME has selected an E-SMLC it
must continue to use that E-SMLC for the duration of the session. The Location
Request includes the type of location information requested, the requested
QoS, identity of serving cell and UE location capabilities. If this step is
performed after the MME receives the NAS Location Notification Return Result
in step 5, the Location Request message contains the identity of the serving
cell obtained from the S1-AP message that carries the NAS Location
Notification Return Result.
NOTE: If the UE is in connected mode and step 6 is performed without receiving
NAS Location Notification Return Result in step 5, the MME may not have the
most current serving cell identity if there was an intra-eNodeB handover.
#### 9.1.15.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
7) If the requested location information and the location accuracy within the
QoS can be satisfied based on parameters received from the MME, e.g. cell
identity, the E-SMLC may send a Location Response immediately. Otherwise, the
E-SMLC determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method as described in clause 9.3a. If the position method
returns position measurements, the E-SMLC uses them to compute a location
estimate. If there has been a failure to obtain position measurements, the
E-SMLC may use the current cell identity to derive an approximate location
estimate. If an already computed location estimate is returned for an UE based
position method, the E-SMLC may verify consistency with the current cell. If
the location estimate so obtained does not satisfy the requested accuracy and
sufficient response time still remains, the E-SMLC may instigate a further
location attempt using the same or a different position method. If a vertical
location co ordinate is requested but the E-SMLC can only obtain horizontal
co-ordinates, these may be returned.
#### 9.1.15.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
8) When location information best satisfying the requested location type and
QoS has been obtained, the E-SMLC returns it to the MME in a Location Response
message. E-SMLC shall in its response include an indication whether the
obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not. The
information of the positioning method used may be returned with the location
information. If a location estimate could not be obtained, the E-SMLC returns
a Location Response message containing a failure cause and no location
estimate.
9) The MME returns the location information, its age and obtained accuracy
indication to the GMLC, if the MME has not initiated the Privacy Verification
process in step 4. If step 4 has been performed for privacy verification, the
MME returns the location information only, if it has received a NAS Location
Notification Return Result indicating that permission is granted. In these
cases, the information about the positioning method used may be sent with the
location information. If a NAS Location Notification Return Result message
indicating that permission is not granted is received, or there is no
response, with the requested privacy action or the UE subscription profile
indicating barring of location, the MME shall return an error response to the
GMLC. If the MME did not return a successful location estimate, but the
privacy checks were successfully executed, the MME may return the last known
location of the target UE if this is known and the LCS client is requesting
the current or last known location. The MME may record charging information.
10) Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain as described in clause 9.1.1.
### 9.1.16 EPC-MT-LR without HLR Query
Figure 9.19 illustrates current or last known location requests for an
emergency services call, where an emergency services client (i.e., a Public
Safety Answering Point) identifies the target UE and the serving LRF using
correlation information that was previously provided to it by the IMS Core.
The signalling used to provide the correlation information to the PSAP is
defined in TS 23.167 [36a]. The correlation information may be used by the LRF
to retrieve other information previously provided to it by the IMS Core as per
TS 23.167 [36a] and/or MME as described in clause 9.1.17. This allows the V
GMLC associated with the LRF to request location from the MME without first
querying the home HLR of the target UE. This scenario therefore supports
location of emergency calls from roamers or SIM-less emergency calls, or non-
registered (U)SIM emergency calls, and requires that the initial location, as
well as UE and MME identifying information had been pushed to the GMLC/LRF as
per clause 9.1.17 or as per TS 23.167 [36a].
Figure 9.19: Positioning for a Emergency Services EPC-MT-LR without HLR Query
1) Same as step 1 in figure 9.1 but with the LCS client (PSAP) identifying
first the target UE and the serving LRF by previously supplied correlation
information for the emergency call.
2) The LRF/GMLC may determine the MME by associating the correlation
information received from the PSAP with other information received previously
from the MME using an EPC NI LR as in clause 9.1.17 and/or from the IMS core
as in TS 23.167 [36a]. The Provide Subscriber Location message sent to the MME
carries, if available, the MSISDN or the IMSI and, if available, the IMEI for
the target UE, as well as the required QoS and an indication of a location
request from an emergency services client. The MME identifies the target UE
using the IMSI, MSISDN and/or the IMEI. In case of a SIM-less emergency call,
or non-registered (U)SIM emergency call, the IMEI shall be always sent.
3) The MME sends a Location Request to the E-SMLC, as for a normal EPC MT LR.
4) E-SMLC performs positioning as for a normal EPC MT LR.
5) E-SMLC returns a location estimate to the MME as for a normal EPC MT LR.
6) The MME returns the location information, its age and obtained accuracy
indication to the LRF/GMLC. The information about the positioning method used
may be sent with the location information. If the E-SMLC did not return a
successful location estimate, the MME may return the last known location of
the target UE if this is known and the LCS client is requesting the current or
last known location.
7) The LRF sends the location service response to the LCS client (PSAP).
NOTE: The MME determined by the LRF/GMLC in step 2 must be the current MME for
the UE. In the event of handover to a new MME, this may require updating of
the GMLC using the EPC NI LR procedure in clause 9.1.17.
### 9.1.17 EPC Network Induced Location Request (EPC-NI-LR)
At any time after detecting an emergency situation (i.e. after emergency
Attach, UE requested emergency PDN Connectivity), the MME may initiate the EPC
Network Induced Location Request (EPC NI LR) procedure. The procedure is
illustrated in figure 9.20.
Figure 9.20: Network Induced Location Request for EPC
1) For the emergency call invocation from the user, the UE performs emergency
attach if not attached or requests emergency PDN connection if already normal
attached. As part of the Attach procedure, the UE support of LPP indication is
provided by the UE to the MME. When an emergency attach or emergency PDN
connection establishment is detected, the MME initiates the EPC-NI-LR
procedure.
2) The MME selects a E-SMLC as described in clause 6.3.13 and sends a Location
Request message to the selected E-SMLC. Once an MME has selected an E-SMLC it
must continue to use that E-SMLC for the duration of the session. The Location
Request includes the type of location information requested, the requested
QoS, identity of serving cell and UE capability to support LPP.
NOTE: If the UE is in connected mode and step 2 was not performed immediately
after step 1, the MME may not have the most current serving cell identity if
there was an intra-eNodeB handover.
#### 9.1.17.1 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
3) If the requested location information and the location accuracy within the
QoS can be satisfied based on parameters received from the MME, e.g. cell
identity, the E-SMLC may send a Location Response immediately. Otherwise, the
E-SMLC determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method as described in clause 9.3a. If the position method
returns position measurements, the E-SMLC uses them to compute a location
estimate. If there has been a failure to obtain position measurements, the
E-SMLC may use the current cell identity to derive an approximate location
estimate. If an already computed location estimate is returned for an UE based
position method, the E-SMLC may verify consistency with the current cell
identity. If the location estimate so obtained does not satisfy the requested
accuracy and sufficient response time still remains, the E-SMLC may instigate
a further location attempt using the same or a different position method. If a
vertical location co-ordinate is requested but the E-SMLC can only obtain
horizontal co-ordinates, these may be returned.
#### 9.1.17.2 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
4) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained, the E-SMLC returns a Location Response to the MME with an indication
whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or
not. This message carries the location estimate that was obtained. If a
location estimate was not successfully obtained, a failure cause is included
in the Location Response.
5) The MME may determine the GMLC and emergency services client using the cell
identity or the location estimate or according to some fixed association for
the MME. The MME shall send a Subscriber Location Report to the GMLC carrying
the IMEI and if available the IMSI and MSISDN of the UE, the event causing the
message (EPC NI LR), and, if these were obtained in steps 2 to 4, the location
estimate and its age and the indication received from E-SMLC whether the
obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or not. The
serving cell identity of the UE may also be sent if available. The MME shall
include its own address. The MME may record charging information.
6) The GMLC shall acknowledge receipt of the location estimate provided that
the associated LRF serves the emergency services LCS client and the client is
accessible. These conditions would normally be fulfilled if the LRF either
already has created, or expects to later create, a record for the UE for the
emergency services session as described in clause 9.8.4.
7) The LRF associated with the GMLC treats the received location estimate as
described in clause 9.8.4: e.g. may use the location information to assist
routing of the emergency session to the PSAP/emergency centre and/or may
transfer the location information to the emergency services LCS client
immediately or upon request from the client. The LRF/GMLC may store the
information received in step 5: e.g. may store the UE identity and the address
of the MME. The LRF/GMLC may record charging information.
NOTE: Determination of the GMLC in step 5 must ensure a match with any
LRF/GMLC used by the IMS Core to assist with location retrieval for, and/or
routing of, the IMS Emergency call as described in clause 9.8.4.
### 9.1.18 EPC Post Positioning Notification and Verification Procedure
Figure 9.21 illustrates the post positioning notification and verification
procedure.
Figure 9.21: EPC Post Positioning Notification and Verification Procedure
1) Common PS and CS MT-LR procedure as described in clause 9.1.1.
2) The GMLC sends a Provide Subscriber Location message to the MME with an
indication of \"notification only\". This message carries the UE subscriber\'s
IMSI. For a session related location request, the message also carries the
APN-NI to which the user has established the session. For a value added LCS
client, the message shall carry the client name, the external identity of the
LCS client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and
available), optionally the message may also carry the Service Type. Also the
message may carry the type of the LCS client name and also the type of the
Requestor identity if the requestor identity was included. If the result of
the privacy check at H-GMLC/PPR indicated that the codeword shall be sent to
the UE user, the message may carry also the codeword received from the LCS
client. For a PLMN operator LCS client, the message shall carry the internal
identity of the LCS client. If the Requestor Identity is provided, the GMLC
shall send it as separate information.
3) The MME first checks if the UE is detached or suspended. If this is the
case, an error response is returned. The MME determines a required privacy
related action as described in Annex A.3 based on the indicators of privacy
related action in the PSL message from the GMLC. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE
state, the MME performs a network triggered service request as defined in TS
23.401 [41] in order to establish a signalling connection with the UE and
assign a specific eNodeB.
4) A notification invoke message is sent to the target UE indicating a
location type of notification and verification only, the identity of the LCS
client and the Requestor Identity (if that is both supported and available),
whether privacy verification is required. Also the message may indicate the
type of the LCS client name and also the type of the Requestor identity if the
requestor identity was included. Moreover, the message may carry also the
service type and the codeword.
5) The target UE notifies the UE user of the location request and, if privacy
verification was requested, waits for the user to grant or withhold
permission. The UE then returns a notification result to the MME indicating,
if privacy verification was requested, whether permission is granted or
denied. If the UE user does not respond after a predetermined time period, the
MME shall infer a \"no response\" condition. The MME shall return an error
response to the GMLC if privacy verification was requested and either the UE
user denies permission or there is no response with the UE subscription
profile indicating barring of the location request.
6) The MME returns the indication of successful notification and verification
result, if it has received a NAS Location Notification Return Result
indicating that permission is granted. If a LCS Location Notification Return
Result message indicating that permission is not granted is received, or there
is no response, with the requested privacy action or the UE subscription
profile indicating barring of location, the MME shall return an error response
to the GMLC.
7) Common MT-LR procedure in PS and CS domain as described in clause 9.1.1.
## 9.2 Mobile Originating Location Request
### 9.2.1 Mobile Originating Location Request, Circuit Switched (CS-MO-LR)
The following procedure shown in figure 9.7 allows an UE to request either its
own location and optionally, velocity, location assistance data or broadcast
assistance data message ciphering keys from the network. Location assistance
data may be used subsequently by the UE to compute its own location throughout
an extended interval using a mobile based position method. The ciphering key
enables the UE to decipher other location assistance data broadcast
periodically by the network. The MO‑LR after location update request may be
used to request ciphering keys or GNSS assistance data using the follow-on
procedure described in TS 24.008 [24]. The procedure may also be used to
enable an UE to request that its own location be sent to an external LCS
client.
Figure 9.7: General Network Positioning for CS-MO-LR
#### 9.2.1.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) If the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a radio connection setup and
sends a CM service request indicating a request for a call independent
supplementary services to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN.
2) RAN shall convey the CM service request to the core network. If the UE is
in dedicated mode, the UE sends a CM Service Request on the already
established radio connection.
3) The VMSC/MSC server instigates authentication and ciphering if the UE was
in idle mode or returns a Direct Transfer CM Service Accept if the UE was in
dedicated mode. The UE will inform the network about its LCS capabilities, as
described in chapter 6.3.4.
4) The UE sends a LCS CS-MO-LR Location Services invoke to the VMSC/MSC
server. Different types of location services can be requested: location
estimate of the UE, location estimate of the UE to be sent to an external LCS
client, location assistance data or broadcast assistance data message
ciphering keys. If the UE is requesting its own location estimate or that its
own location be sent to an external LCS client, this message carries LCS
requested QoS information (e.g. accuracy, response time, LCS QoS Class), the
requested maximum age of location and the requested type of location (e.g.
\"current location\", \"current or last known location\"). If the UE is
requesting that its location be sent to an external LCS client, the message
shall include the identity of the LCS client and may include the address of
the GMLC through which the LCS client should be accessed. In addition, a
Service Identity indicates which MO-LR service of the LCS Client is requested
by the UE may be included. The message also may include a pseudonym indicator
to indicate a pseudonym should be assigned by the network and transferred to
the LCS Client as the UE\'s identity. If the UE is instead requesting location
assistance data or ciphering keys, the message specifies the type of
assistance data or deciphering keys and the positioning method for which the
assistance data or ciphering applies. For an LCS CS-MO-LR Location Services
invoke, the VMSC/MSC server shall assign a GMLC address, i.e. V-GMLC address,
which is stored in the VMSC/MSC server. If a V-GMLC address is not available,
the VMSC/MSC server may reject the location request. The VMSC/MSC server
verifies in the UE\'s subscription profile that the UE has permission to
request its own location, request that its location be sent to an external LCS
client or request location assistance data or deciphering keys (whichever
applies). If the UE is requesting positioning and has an established call, the
VMSC/MSC server may reject the request for certain non-speech call types.
5) In case the requested type of location is \"current or last known
location\" and the requested maximum age of location information is sent from
UE, the VMSC/MSC server verifies whether it stores the previously obtained
location estimate of the target UE. If the VMSC/MSC server stores the location
estimate and the location estimate satisfies the requested maximum age of
location, this step and steps 6 and 7 may be skipped. Otherwise the VMSC/MSC
server sends a Location Request message to RAN associated with the Target UE.
The message indicates whether a location estimate or location assistance data
is requested and, in GSM, includes the UE\'s location capabilities. If the
UE\'s location is requested, the message also includes the requested QoS. If
location assistance data is requested, the message carries the requested types
of location assistance data.
#### 9.2.1.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
6) If the UE is requesting its own location, RAN determines the positioning
method and instigates the particular message sequence for this method, as
specified in UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
If the UE is instead requesting location assistance data, RAN transfers this
data to the UE as described in subsequent clauses in TS 25.305 [1] and TS
43.059 [16] UE.
#### 9.2.1.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
7) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained or when the requested location assistance data has been transferred
to the UE, RAN returns a Location Report to the VMSC/MSC server with an
indication whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested
accuracy or not. This message carries the location estimate or ciphering keys
if this was obtained. If a location estimate or deciphering keys were not
successfully obtained or if the requested location assistance data could not
be transferred successfully to the UE, a failure cause is included in the
Location Report.
8) If the location estimate was successfully obtained, the VMSC/MSC server
shall send a MAP Subscriber Location Report to the V-GMLC assigned in the step
4, carrying the MSISDN/IMSI of the UE, the event causing the location estimate
(CS‑MO-LR) and the location estimate, its age, obtained accuracy indication
and the LCS QoS Class requested by the target UE. In addition, the MAP
Subscriber Location Report may include the pseudonym indicator, the identity
of the LCS Client, the GMLC address and the Service Identity specified by the
UE, if available.
9) Upon receipt of the MAP Subscriber Location Report, the V-GMLC shall
determine whether the UE requests transfer of its location estimate to an
external LCS Client. If the identity of the LCS Client is not available, this
step and steps 10 to 14 are skipped. Otherwise, the V-GMLC shall send the MO-
LR Location Information to the H-GMLC (the V-GMLC may query the HLR/HSS of the
UE to obtain the address of the H-GMLC), carrying the MSISDN/IMSI of the UE,
the event causing the location estimate (CS‑MO-LR), the location estimate and
its age and the identity of the LCS Client. The pseudonym indicator and/or the
GMLC address specified by the UE may also be included if available.
10) If the pseudonym indicator is included in the MO-LR Location Information,
the H-GMLC assigns or asks the PMD to assign a pseudonym to the UE. If the
identity of the LCS Client and the GMLC address access to the LCS Client are
available, the H-GMLC shall send the MO-LR Location Information to the
specified GMLC. If the identity of the LCS Client is available but the GMLC
address access to the LCS Client is not available, the H-GMLC determines
whether the specified LCS Client is accessible. If yes, the H-GMLC shall send
the Location Information to the LCS Client, then the H-GMLC itself act as the
specified GMLC, this step and step 13 are skipped. If not, according to the
LCS Client identity, the H-GMLC shall determine a GMLC that can access the LCS
Client, and send the MO-LR Location Information to the GMLC, carrying the
MSISDN or the pseudonym of the UE, the identity of the LCS client, the event
causing the location estimate (CS‑MO-LR), location estimate and its age.
11) If the identified LCS Client is not accessible, this step and step 12 are
skipped. Otherwise the GMLC transfers the location information to the LCS
client, carrying the MSISDN/IMSI or the pseudonym of the UE, the event causing
the location estimate (CS-MO‑LR), the Service Identity, if available, and the
location estimate and its age, in accordance with the LCS QoS Class requested
by the target UE. If the UE requested LCS QoS class was Assured, GMLC sends
the result to the LCS client only if the result has been indicated to fulfil
the requested accuracy. If the UE requested LCS QoS class was Best Effort,
GMLC sends whatever result it received to the LCS client with an appropriate
indication if the requested accuracy was not met.
12) If the LCS Client does not support MO-LR (for temporary or permanent
reasons) or can not handle the location estimate of the UE, e.g. the LCS
Client does not know the Service Identity, or the UE does not register to the
LCS Client, the LCS Client have no corresponding data of the UE, the LCS
Client shall return the Location Information ack message to the GMLC or the
H-GMLC (in case the LCS Client received Location Information is sent from
H-GMLC) with a suitable error cause. Otherwise, the LCS Client handles the
location estimate according to the Service Identity, sends the GMLC or the
H-GMLC the Location Information ack message signalling that the location
estimate of the UE has been handled successfully.
13) If the identified LCS Client is not accessible, the GMLC sends MO-LR
Location Information Acknowledgement to the H-GMLC with an appropriate error
cause. Otherwise, the GMLC shall send MO-LR Location Information
Acknowledgement to the H-GMLC. The message shall specify whether the location
estimate of the UE has been handled successfully by the identified LCS Client,
and if not, the corresponding error cause obtained in step 12. The GMLC may
record charging information both for the LCS Client and inter-operator revenue
charges.
14) In case the H-GMLC receives the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement
from the GMLC, it shall forward the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement
from the GMLC to the V-GMLC, and record charging information both for the UE
and inter-working revenue charges.
In case the H-GMLC receives the Location Information Acknowledgement from the
LCS Client, it shall send MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement to the
V-GMLC. The message shall specify whether the location estimate of the UE has
been handled successfully by the identified LCS Client, and if not, the
corresponding error cause obtained in step 12. The H-GMLC shall record
charging information both for the UE and inter-working revenue charges.
15) In case the V-GMLC receives the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement
from the H-GMLC, the V-GMLC shall record charging information both for the UE
and inter-working revenue charges and send the MAP Subscriber Location Report
Acknowledgement to the VMSC/MSC server, carrying the information specifies
whether the location estimate of the UE has been handled successfully by the
identified LCS Client, and if not success, the corresponding error cause
obtained in step 14.
In case the V-GMLC receives the MAP Subscriber Location Report from the
VMSC/MSC server and it is not required to send to any LCS Client, the V-GMLC
shall record charging information for the UE and response the MAP Subscriber
Location Report Acknowledgement to the VMSC/MSC server.
16) The VMSC/MSC server returns a CS-MO-LR Return Result to the UE carrying
any location estimate requested by the UE including the indication received
from RAN whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested
accuracy or not, ciphering keys or an indicator whether a location estimate
was successfully transferred to the identified LCS client. If the location
estimate was successfully transferred to the identified LCS Client, the CS-MO-
LR Return Result message shall specify whether the location estimate of the UE
has been handled successfully by the identified LCS Client, and if not, the
corresponding error cause obtained in step 15.
17) The VMSC/MSC server may release the CM, MM and radio connections to the
UE, if the UE was previously idle, and the VMSC/MSC server may record charging
information.
### 9.2.2 Mobile Originating Location Request, Packet Switched (PS-MO-LR)
The following procedure shown in figure 9.8 allows an UE to request either its
own location and optionally, velocity; location assistance data or broadcast
assistance data message ciphering keys from the network. Location assistance
data may be used subsequently by the UE to compute its own location throughout
an extended interval using a mobile based position method. A ciphering key
enables the UE to decipher other location assistance data broadcast
periodically by the network. The PS‑MO‑LR may be used to request ciphering
keys or GNSS assistance data. The procedure may also be used to enable an UE
to request that its own location be sent to an external LCS client.
Figure 9.8: General Network Positioning for packet switched MO-LR
#### 9.2.2.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) In UMTS, if the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a PS signalling
connection and sends a Service request indicating signalling to the SGSN via
the RAN. If the UE already has PS signalling connection, the UE does not need
to send Service request. Security functions may be executed. These procedures
are described in TS 23.060 [15]. In GSM this signalling step is not needed.
2) The UE sends a LCS PS-MO-LR Location Services invoke message to the SGSN.
Different types of location services can be requested: location estimate of
the UE, location estimate of the UE to be sent to an external LCS client,
location assistance data or broadcast assistance data message ciphering keys.
If the UE is requesting its own location or that its own location be sent to
an external LCS client, this message carries LCS requested QoS information
(e.g. accuracy, response time, LCS QoS Class), the requested maximum age of
location and the requested type of location (e.g. \"current location\",
\"current or last known location\"). If the UE is requesting that its location
be sent to an external LCS client, the message shall include the identity of
the LCS client and may include the address of the GMLC through which the LCS
client should be accessed. In addition, a Service Identity indicates which MO-
LR service of the LCS Client is requested by the UE may be included. The
message also may include a pseudonym indicator to indicate a pseudonym should
be assigned by the network and transferred to the LCS Client as the UE\'s
identity. If the UE is instead requesting location assistance data or
ciphering keys, the message specifies the type of assistance data or
deciphering keys and the positioning method for which the assistance data or
ciphering applies. For an LCS PS-MO-LR Location Services invoke, the SGSN
shall assign a GMLC address, i.e. V-GMLC address, which is stored in the SGSN.
If a V-GMLC address is not available, the SGSN may reject the location
request. The SGSN verifies the subscription profile of the UE and decides if
the requested service is allowed or not.
3) In case the requested type of location is \"current or last known
location\" and the requested maximum age of location information is sent from
UE, the SGSN verifies whether it stores the previously obtained location
estimate of the target UE. If the SGSN stores the location estimate and the
location estimate satisfies the requested maximum age of location, this step
and steps 4 and 5 may be skipped. Otherwise the SGSN sends a Location Request
message to the RAN associated with the Target UE\'s location. The message
indicates whether a location estimate or location assistance data is
requested. If the UE\'s location is requested, the message also includes the
requested QoS. If location assistance data is requested, the message carries
the requested types of location assistance data. The message carries also
location parameters received in the Service Invoke message.
#### 9.2.2.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
4) If the UE is requesting its own location, the actions described in UTRAN
Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] or GERAN stage 2 TS 43.059 [16] are performed. If the
UE is instead requesting location assistance data, the RAN transfers this data
to the UE as described in subsequent clauses. The RAN determines the exact
location assistance data to transfer according to the type of data specified
by the UE, the UE location capabilities and the current cell.
#### 9.2.2.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
5) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained or when the requested location assistance data has been transferred
to the UE, the RAN returns a Location Report to the SGSN with an indication
whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or
not. This message carries the location estimate or ciphering keys if this was
obtained. If a location estimate or deciphering keys were not successfully
obtained or if the requested location assistance data could not be transferred
successfully to the UE, a failure cause is included in the Location Report.
6) If the location estimate was successfully obtained, the SGSN shall send a
MAP Subscriber Location Report to the V-GMLC assigned in the step 2, carrying
the MSISDN/IMSI of the UE, the event causing the location estimate (PS-MO‑LR)
and the location estimate, its age, obtained accuracy indication and the LCS
QoS Class requested by the target UE. In addition, the MAP Subscriber Location
Report may include the pseudonym indicator, the identity of the LCS Client,
the GMLC address and the Service Identity specified by the UE, if available.
7) Upon receipt of the MAP Subscriber Location Report, the V-GMLC shall
determine whether the UE requests transfer of its location estimate to an
external LCS Client. If the identity of the LCS Client is not available, this
step and steps 8 to 12 are skipped. Otherwise, the V-GMLC shall send the MO-LR
Location Information to the H-GMLC (the V-GMLC may query the HLR/HSS of the UE
to obtain the address of the H-GMLC), carrying the MSISDN/IMSI of the UE, the
event causing the location estimate (PS‑MO-LR), the location estimate and its
age, and the identity of the LCS Client. The pseudonym indicator and/or the
GMLC address specified by the UE may also be included if available.
8) If the pseudonym indicator is included in the MO-LR Location Information,
the H-GMLC assigns or asks the PMD to assign a pseudonym to the UE. If the
identity of the LCS Client and the GMLC address access to the LCS Client are
available, the H-GMLC shall send the MO-LR Location Information to the
specified GMLC. If the identity of the LCS Client is available but the GMLC
address access to the LCS Client is not available, the H-GMLC determines
whether the specified LCS Client is accessible. If yes, the H-GMLC shall send
the Location Information to the LCS Client, then the H-GMLC itself act as the
specified GMLC, this step and step 11 are skipped. If not, according to the
LCS Client identity, the H-GMLC shall determine a GMLC that can access the LCS
Client, and send the MO-LR Location Information to the GMLC, carrying the
MSISDN or the pseudonym of the UE, the identity of the LCS client, the event
causing the location estimate (PS‑MO-LR), location estimate and its age.
9) If the identified LCS Client is not accessible, this step and step 10 are
skipped. Otherwise the GMLC transfers the location information to the LCS
client, carrying the MSISDN/IMSI or the pseudonym of the UE, the event causing
the location estimate (PS-MO‑LR), the Service Identity, if available, and the
location estimate and its age, in accordance with the LCS QoS Class requested
by the target UE. If the UE requested LCS QoS class was Assured, GMLC sends
the result to the LCS client only if the result has been indicated to fulfil
the requested accuracy. If the UE requested LCS QoS class was Best Effort,
GMLC sends whatever result it received to the LCS client with an appropriate
indication if the requested accuracy was not met.
10) If the LCS Client does not support MO-LR (for temporary or permanent
reasons) or can not handle the location estimate of the UE, e.g. the LCS
Client does not know the Service Identity, or the UE does not register to the
LCS Client, the LCS Client have no corresponding data of the UE, the LCS
Client shall return the Location Information ack message to the GMLC or the
H-GMLC (in case the LCS Client received Location Information is sent from
H-GMLC) with a suitable error cause. Otherwise, the LCS Client handles the
location estimate according to the Service Identity, sends the GMLC or the
H-GMLC the Location Information ack message signalling that the location
estimate of the UE has been handled successfully.
11) If the identified LCS Client is not accessible, the GMLC sends MO-LR
Location Information Acknowledgement to the H-GMLC with an appropriate error
cause. Otherwise, the GMLC shall send MO-LR Location Information
Acknowledgement to the H-GMLC. The message shall specify whether the location
estimate of the UE has been handled successfully by the identified LCS Client,
and if not, the corresponding error cause obtained in step 10. The GMLC may
record charging information both for the LCS Client and inter-operator revenue
charges.
12) In case the H-GMLC receives the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement
from the GMLC, it shall forward the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement
from the GMLC to the V-GMLC, and record charging information both for the UE
and inter-working revenue charges.
In case the H-GMLC receives the Location Information Acknowledgement from the
LCS Client, it shall send MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement to the
V-GMLC. The message shall specify whether the location estimate of the UE has
been handled successfully by the identified LCS Client, and if not, the
corresponding error cause obtained in step 10. The H-GMLC shall record
charging information both for the UE and inter-working revenue charges.
13) In case the V-GMLC receives the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement
from the H-GMLC, the V-GMLC shall record charging information both for the UE
and inter-working revenue charges and send the MAP Subscriber Location Report
Acknowledgement to the SGSN, carrying the information specifies whether the
location estimate of the UE has been handled successfully by the identified
LCS Client, and if not success, the corresponding error cause obtained in step
12.
In case the V-GMLC receives the MAP Subscriber Location Report from the SGSN
and it is not required to send to any LCS Client, the V-GMLC shall record
charging information for the UE and response the MAP Subscriber Location
Report Acknowledgement to the SGSN.
14) The SGSN returns a Service Response message to the UE carrying any
location estimate requested by the UE including the indication received from
RAN whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy or
not, ciphering keys or an indicator whether a location estimate was
successfully transferred to the identified LCS client. If the location
estimate was successfully transferred to the identified LCS Client, the
Service Response message shall specify whether the location estimate of the UE
has been handled successfully by the identified LCS Client, and if not, the
corresponding error cause obtained in step 13. The SGSN may record charging
information.
### 9.2.3 MO-LR Request for Periodic Location Transfer to a Third Party
The following procedure shown in figure 9.8a allows a UE to instigate a
periodic transfer of location to an external LCS client. The procedure would
be executed once after which it would be followed by the procedure described
in clause 9.1.12.2.
Figure 9.8a: Deferred MO-LR Initiation for Periodic Location in CS and PS
domain
1) to 2) If the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a radio connection setup
and sends a CM Service Request indicating a request for call independent
supplementary service to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN (CS domain). If the UE is
in dedicated mode, the UE sends a CM Service Request on the already
established radio connection. The VMSC/MSC server instigates authentication
and ciphering if the UE was in idle mode or returns a CM Service Accept if the
UE was in dedicated mode.
For PS domain, in UMTS, if the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a PS
signalling connection and sends a Service Request indicating signalling to the
SGSN via RAN. If the UE already has PS signalling connection, the UE does not
need to send the Service Request. Security functions may be executed. These
procedures are described in TS 23.060 [15]. In GSM this signalling step is not
needed.
3) The UE sends an LCS MO-LR Invoke for periodic transfer of location to a
third party LCS client. The UE shall include the periodic location related
parameters (reporting interval and total number of reports). The UE shall also
include the identity of the LCS client and may include the address of the GMLC
through which the LCS client can be accessed. The UE may include a request for
use of MO-LR Short Circuit (e.g. if the UE supports UE based positioning). The
absence of an H-GMLC assigned LDR reference number in this case indicates that
the request has not yet been authorized.
4) to 7) The request to initiate periodic location shall be transferred in
succession from the MSC/SGSN to the V‑GMLC, H-GMLC, R-GMLC serving the LCS
client and finally may be transferred to the LCS client. The periodic location
parameters (reporting interval and number of reports) are included as well as
any request for use of MO-LR Short Circuit. Any entity (MSC/SGSN, V‑GMLC,
H‑GMLC, R‑GMLC and, if notified, LCS Client) is enabled to accept or refuse
the request. In addition, if the request was accepted, any entity is free to
reject use of MO-LR Short Circuit. If the request is accepted, a LDR reference
number is assigned by the H‑GMLC.
8) to 11) The response transferred back to the MSC/SGSN shall indicate
acceptance or rejection and whether MO‑LR short circuit (if requested) has
been accepted. The response also includes the LDR reference number assigned by
the H-GMLC and the H-GMLC address. The H-GMLC may include in the response a
list of PLMNs and possibly associated radio access technologies, either
prioritized or non-prioritized, in which subsequent location estimates must be
obtained and an indication for each PLMN (and possibly each associated radio
access technology) of whether periodic location in the RAN is supported. If no
list is included, subsequent locations are restricted to the current serving
PLMN only
12) The MSC/SGSN returns the result of the request to the UE in a LCS MO-LR
Return Result message including the LDR reference number, the H-GMLC address
any reporting PLMN list and an indication whether MO-LR Short Circuit is
allowed (if requested by the UE in step 3.
13a) The UE may instigate release of the CM, MM/GMM and radio connections --
e.g. if the request was rejected or if the MSC/SGSN provided a list of PLMNs
that did not include the serving PLMN (or if the serving PLMN was included in
a prioritized list with a lower priority). Assuming the request was accepted,
the UE may then initiate reporting of the first location estimate using the
procedure described in clause 9.1.12.2 and beginning at step 1.
13b) If the request was accepted and the serving PLMN can be used for
subsequent location, the UE may initiate reporting of the first location
estimate by sending an MO-LR request indicating transfer of location to the
LCS Client using the procedure described in clause 9.1.12.2 and beginning at
step 3.
NOTE: If the UE receives a response in step 12 indicating that the MO-LR
request for periodic location transfer to a third party cannot be supported
(for temporary or permanent reasons), the UE may periodically invoke the MO-LR
procedure for location transfer to a third party defined in clause 9.2.1 for
the CS domain (CS-MO-LR) and in clause 9.2.2 for the PS domain (PS-MO-LR).
### 9.2.4 MO-LR Request for Periodic Self Location
The following procedure shown in figure 9.8b allows an UE to request its own
location periodically if the RAN serving the target UE supports periodic
location. This procedure is useful if a UE only supports UE-assisted
positioning or has no positioning capability.
Figure 9.8b: MO-LR for Periodic Self Location with Periodic Positioning in the
RAN
1) to 2) If the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a radio connection setup
and sends a CM Service Request indicating a request for call independent
supplementary service to the VMSC/MSC server via RAN (CS domain). If the UE is
in dedicated mode, the UE sends a CM Service Request on the already
established radio connection. The VMSC/MSC server instigates authentication
and ciphering if the UE was in idle mode or returns a CM Service Accept if the
UE was in dedicated mode.
For PS domain, in UMTS, if the UE is in idle mode, the UE requests a PS
signalling connection and sends a Service Request indicating signalling to the
SGSN via RAN. If the UE already has PS signalling connection, the UE does not
need to send the Service Request. Security functions may be executed. These
procedures are described in TS 23.060 [15]. In GSM this signalling step is not
needed.
3) The UE sends an MO-LR invoke requesting periodic self location. The request
includes the required QoS, the periodic location interval and the total number
of reports.
4) The MSC/SGSN sends a location request to the RAN containing the QoS and
periodic location information received in step 3.
5) RAN determines the positioning method and instigates the particular message
sequence for this method, as specified in UTRAN Stage 2, TS 25.305 [1] and
GERAN Stage 2, TS 43.059 [16].
6) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained, RAN returns it to the MSC/SGSN.
7) The MSC/SGSN sends an LCS Location Update invoke to the UE containing the
first location estimate.
8) The UE acknowledges receipt of the first location estimate. If the UE
wished to cancel the periodic location procedure at that point, an additional
parameter (e.g. flag or cause value) is included in this message.
9-12) As steps 5-8 for the second location estimate and thereafter repeated at
the periodic location interval until the total number of reports is attained.
13) After the final location estimate has been transferred in step 12, the
MSC/SGSN returns an MO-LR return result to the UE to indicate completion of
the periodic location request in step 3. As an implementation option, the
final location estimate may be returned in the MO-LR return result in step 13
rather than in an LCS Location Update in step 11.
14) The MSC/SGSN instigates clearing of the CM, MM/GMM and radio connections.
NOTE: If the UE receives a response in step 13 indicating that the MO-LR
request for periodic self location cannot be supported (for temporary or
permanent reasons), the UE may periodically invoke the MO‑LR procedure for
self location defined in clause 9.2.1 for the CS domain (CS-MO-LR) and in
clause 9.2.2 for the PS domain (PS-MO-LR).
### 9.2.5 WLAN UE Originated Procedure in I-WLAN
Figure 9.8c describes the MO-LR procedure for LCS for I-WLAN.
Figure 9.8c: WLAN UE Originated Procedure in I-WLAN
1\. The WLAN UE selects a WLAN AN and establishes the WLAN connection and is
authenticated in I-WLAN. The tunnel is established with between WLAN UE and
one of PDGs in PLMN.
2\. WLAN UE initiates positioning procedure by establishing a so called user
plane connection with the GMLC/SLP and shall use the OMA SUPL mechanism
specified by OMA (OMA AD SUPL [38], OMA TS ULP [39]) to transport location
related assistance data and location information between the UE and GMLC/SLP.
The UE may receive assistance data and determine its own location and send its
location information to the GMLC/SLP or the UE sends measurement results to
the GMLC/SLP. In case GMLC/SLP determines the location of the UE, the GMLC/SLP
shall send the location information to the WLAN UE. The UE may also send the
identifier of the access node (e.g., MAC address of the AP) to the GMLC and
GMLC, possibly using an external database, maps this location identifier to
the corresponding geographical information, e.g. coordinates or street address
and returns the result to the UE.
3\. The location information obtained is transferred to external LCS client if
requested by WLAN UE. The estimated position of a WLAN UE can be stored in the
GMLC after WLAN UE originated positioning procedure for future uses subject to
the privacy settings of the WLAN UE. If there is an LCS request from an
external LCS Client, the stored location information can be delivered to the
external LCS client if the stored location information satisfies LCS QoS
requested.
### 9.2.6 Mobile Originating Location Request, EPC (EPC-MO-LR)
The following procedure shown in figure 9.8d allows an UE to request either,
its own location and optionally, velocity or location assistance data.
Location assistance data may be used subsequently by the UE to compute its own
location throughout an extended interval using a mobile based position method.
The EPC MO LR may be used to request GNSS assistance data. The procedure may
also be used to enable an UE to request that its own location be sent to an
external LCS client.
Figure 9.8d: General Network Positioning for packet switched MO-LR
#### 9.2.6.1 Location Preparation Procedure
1) If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state, the UE performs a UE triggered service
request as defined in TS 23.401 [41] in order to establish a signalling
connection with the MME and assign a specific eNodeB.
2) The UE sends a NAS PDU containing an MO-LR Request inside an RRC UL
Information Transfer message to the eNodeB. The MO-LR Request may optionally
include an LPP positioning message. The eNodeB forwards the MO-LR Request
(including any embedded LPP message) to the MME inside an S1AP Uplink NAS
Transport message. Different types of location services can be requested:
location estimate of the UE, location estimate of the UE to be sent to an
external LCS client or location assistance data. If the UE is requesting its
own location or that its own location be sent to an external LCS client, this
message carries LCS requested QoS information (e.g. accuracy, response time,
LCS QoS Class), the requested maximum age of location and the requested type
of location (e.g. \"current location\", \"current or last known location\").
If the UE is requesting that its location be sent to an external LCS client,
the message shall include the identity of the LCS client and may include the
address of the GMLC through which the LCS client should be accessed. In
addition, a Service Identity indicates which MO-LR service of the LCS Client
is requested by the UE may be included. The message also may include a
pseudonym indicator to indicate a pseudonym should be assigned by the network
and transferred to the LCS Client as the UE\'s identity. If the UE is instead
requesting location assistance data, the embedded LPP message specifies the
type of assistance data and the positioning method for which the assistance
data applies. For an LCS EPC-MO-LR requesting location transfer to an external
LCS Client, the MME shall assign a GMLC address, i.e. V-GMLC address, which is
stored in the MME. If a V-GMLC address is not available, the MME may reject
the location request. The MME verifies the subscription profile of the UE and
decides if the requested service is allowed or not.
3) The MME selects a E-SMLC as described in clause 6.3.13 and sends a Location
Request message to the selected E-SMLC. The Location Request message conveys
any embedded LPP message in the MO-LR Request. Once an MME has selected an
E-SMLC it must continue to use that E-SMLC for the duration of the session.
The Location Request message indicates whether a location estimate or location
assistance data is requested. If the UE\'s location is requested, the message
also includes the requested QoS. If location assistance data is requested, the
embedded LPP message will convey the requested types of location assistance
data. The message carries also other location parameters received in the MO-LR
Request message, the current cell identity obtained from S1-AP message that
carries the NAS MO-LR Request, and the UE capability to support LPP.
#### 9.2.6.2 Positioning Measurement Establishment Procedure
4) If the UE is requesting its own location, the actions described in clause
9.3a are performed. If the UE is instead requesting location assistance data,
the E-SMLC transfers this data to the UE as described in clause 9.3a.1. The
E-SMLC determines the exact location assistance data to transfer according to
the type of data specified by the UE, the UE location capabilities and the
current cell.
#### 9.2.6.3 Location Calculation and Release Procedure
5) When a location estimate best satisfying the requested QoS has been
obtained or when the requested location assistance data has been transferred
to the UE, the E-SMLC returns a Location Response to the MME with an
indication whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested
accuracy or not. This message carries the location estimate if this was
obtained. If a location estimate was not successfully obtained, or if the
requested location assistance data could not be transferred successfully to
the UE, a failure cause is included in the Location Response.
6) If the UE did not request transfer of its location to an external LCS
Client in step 2, steps 6 to 13 are skipped. Otherwise, if the location
estimate was successfully obtained, the MME shall send a Subscriber Location
Report to the V-GMLC assigned in the step 2, carrying the MSISDN/IMSI of the
UE, the event causing the location estimate (EPC-MO LR) and the location
estimate, its age, obtained accuracy indication and the LCS QoS Class
requested by the target UE. In addition, the Subscriber Location Report may
include the pseudonym indicator, the identity of the LCS Client, the GMLC
address and the Service Identity specified by the UE, if available.
7) This step is the same as step 7 for a PS-MO-LR in clause 9.2.2.3 except
that the V-GMLC receives a Subscriber Location Report instead of a MAP
Subscriber Location Report.
8) This step is the same as step 8 for a PS-MO-LR in clause 9.2.2.3.
9) This step is the same as step 9 for a PS-MO-LR in clause 9.2.2.3.
10) This step is the same as step 10 for a PS-MO-LR in clause 9.2.2.3.
11) .This step is the same as step 11 for a PS-MO-LR in clause 9.2.2.3.
12) .This step is the same as step 12 for a PS-MO-LR in clause 9.2.2.3.
13) If the V-GMLC receives the MO-LR Location Information Acknowledgement from
the H-GMLC, the V-GMLC shall record charging information both for the UE and
inter-working revenue charges and send the Subscriber Location Report
Acknowledgement to the MME, carrying the information specifies whether the
location estimate of the UE has been handled successfully by the identified
LCS Client, and if not success, the corresponding error cause obtained in step
12.
If the V-GMLC receives the Subscriber Location Report from the MME and it is
not required to send to any LCS Client, the V-GMLC shall record charging
information for the UE and response the Subscriber Location Report
Acknowledgement to the MME.
14) The MME returns a NAS MO-LR Response message to the UE carrying any
location estimate requested by the UE including the indication received from
E-SMLC whether the obtained location estimate satisfies the requested accuracy
or not, or an indicator whether a location estimate was successfully
transferred to the identified LCS client. If the location estimate was
successfully transferred to the identified LCS Client, the MO-LR Response
message shall specify whether the location estimate of the UE has been handled
successfully by the identified LCS Client, and if not, the corresponding error
cause obtained in step 13. The MME may record charging information.
## 9.3 LCS signalling procedures specified in UTRAN and GERAN Stage 2
The signalling procedures in UTRAN and GERAN are defined in TS 25.305 [1] and
TS 43.059 [16] respectively.
## 9.3a LCS signalling procedures applicable to E-UTRAN
### 9.3a.1 UE Assisted and UE Based Positioning and Assistance Delivery
The following procedure depicts a positioning service transaction that is used
by the E-SMLC to support UE based positioning, UE assisted positioning and
delivery of assistance data. A single location request from the MME may invoke
one or more transactions, in which each transaction may perform a single
positioning service (e.g. UE assisted positioning, UE capability retrieval).
RAN positioning procedures related to E-SMLC and UE communication are
specified in TS 36.355 [47].
Figure 9.8e: UE Assisted and UE Based Positioning and Assistance Delivery
Procedure
**Precondition:** A Correlation identifier allocated by MME had been passed to
the E‑SMLC when the location session (i.e. EPC‑MT‑LR, EPC‑MO‑LR, or ECP‑NI‑LR)
was initiated. The Correlation identifier must be assigned such that it can be
used to identify the E‑SMLC serving the location session.
1\. The E-SMLC sends a Location Information message to the MME carrying a
Downlink Positioning Information and the Correlation identifier which may
request location information from the UE, provide assistance data to the UE or
query for the UE capabilities.
2\. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state (e.g. if the S1 connection was previously
released due to data and signalling inactivity), the MME performs a network
triggered service request as defined in TS 23.401 [41] in order to establish a
signalling connection with the UE.
3\. The MME forwards the Downlink Positioning Information to the serving
eNodeB in a NAS Transport message conveyed by the S1-AP Transport Message. The
MME includes a Routing identifier, in the NAS transport message, representing
the Correlation identifier associated with the location session between the
MME and E-SMLC.
4\. The eNodeB forwards the Downlink Positioning Information and Routing
identifier to the UE by NAS Transport Message.
5\. The UE stores any assistance data provided in the Downlink Positioning
Information and performs any positioning measurements and location computation
requested by the Downlink Positioning Information.
6\. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state, the UE instigates a UE triggered service
request as defined in TS 23.401 [41] in order to establish a signalling
connection with the MME.
7\. The UE returns any location information obtained in step 5 or returns any
capabilities requested in step 4 to the eNodeB in an Uplink Positioning
Information included in the NAS Transport message. The Uplink Positioning
Information may alternatively carry a request for further assistance data. The
UE shall also include the Routing identifier in the NAS Transport Message
received in step 4.
8\. The eNodeB forwards the Uplink Positioning Information and Routing
identifier to the MME in a NAS Transport message.
9\. The MME forwards the Uplink Positioning Information and the Correlation
identifier to the E-SMLC, based on the received Routing identifier, in a
Positioning Response. Steps 6 to 9 may be repeated if the UE needs to send
multiple messages to respond to the request received in Step 4. Steps 1 to 9
may be repeated to send new assistance data, and to request further location
information and further UE capabilities.
NOTE: The DL Positioning Information messages can be asynchronous. Once the
E-SMLC sends at least one DL Positioning Information message towards the UE
(steps 1-4), the UE can then send zero or more UL Positioning Information
messages towards the E-SMLC (steps 6-9). The UE includes the same Routing
identifier in each subsequent message.
### 9.3a.2 Network Assisted and Network Based Positioning Procedure
The following procedure is used by the E-SMLC to support network assisted and
network based positioning. RAN positioning procedures related to E-SMLC and
eNodeB communication are specified in TS 36.455 [48].
Figure 9.8f: Network Assisted and Network Based Positioning Procedure
**Precondition:** A Correlation identifier allocated by the MME had been
passed to the E‑SMLC when the location session (i.e. EPC‑MT‑LR, EPC‑MO‑LR, or
EPC‑NI‑LR) was initiated.
1\. The E-SMLC sends a Location Information message to the MME carrying
Network Positioning Information and Correlation identifier which may request
location information for the UE from the E-UTRAN.
2\. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state (e.g. if the S1 connection was previously
released due to data and signalling inactivity), the MME performs a network
triggered service request as defined in TS 23.401 [41] in order to establish a
signalling connection with the UE.
3\. The MME sends a Network Positioning Information message conveyed in a
S1-AP Transport Message to the serving eNodeB for the UE. The MME includes a
Routing identifier in the S1-AP Transport Message, representing the E-SMLC
associated with the location session.
4\. The eNodeB obtains any location information for the UE requested in step
3.
5\. The eNodeB returns a Network Positioning Information message to the MME,
conveyed in a S1-AP Transport Message, containing the location information
obtained in step 4. The eNodeB shall also include the Routing identifier in
the S1-AP Transport Message received in step 3.
6\. The MME returns the Network Positioning Information received in step 5 to
the E-SMLC based on the received Routing identifier. Steps 1 to 6 may be
repeated to request further location information and further E-UTRAN
capabilities.
NOTE: The Network Positioning Information messages can be asynchronous. Once
the E-SMLC sends at least one Network Positioning Information message towards
the eNodeB (steps 1-3), the eNodeB can then send zero or more Network
Positioning Information messages towards the E-SMLC (steps 5-6). The eNodeB
includes the same Routing identifier in each subsequent message.
### 9.3a.3 Obtaining Non-UE Associated Network Assistance Data
The following procedure is used by the E-SMLC to support network assisted and
network based positioning. This procedure is not associated with a UE location
session. It is used in a MME LCS stateless manner to obtain network assistance
data from an eNodeB. RAN positioning procedures related to E-SMLC and eNodeB
communication are specified in TS 36.455 [48].
Figure 9.8g: Obtaining Network Assisted Data
1\. The E-SMLC sends a Location Information message to the MME carrying a
Network Positioning Information which may request eNodeB position related
information from the E-UTRAN. The target eNodeB identity and E-SMLC identity
are included for MME routing purposes.
2\. The MME sends a Network Positioning Information message to the eNodeB,
conveyed in a S1-AP Transport Message. The MME includes a Routing identifier
that represents the E-SMLC identity in a S1-AP Transport Message. This Routing
identifier is not dynamically retained at the MME (i.e., the MME remains LCS
stateless).
3\. The eNodeB obtains position information related to the eNodeB.
4\. The eNodeB returns a Network Positioning Information message to the MME,
conveyed in a S1-AP Transport Message containing the location information
obtained in step 3. The eNodeB also includes the Routing identifier in a S1-AP
Transport Message received in step 2.
5\. The MME returns the Network Positioning Information received in step 4 to
the E-SMLC. The MME determines the E SMLC from the Routing identifier received
in step 4. Steps 4 and 5 may be repeated, using the same Routing identifier if
the eNB has multiple messages to respond to the request in Step 2. Steps 1 to
5 may be repeated to request further location information and further E-UTRAN
capabilities.
NOTE: The Network Positioning Information messages can be asynchronous. Once
the E-SMLC sends at least one Network Positioning Information message towards
the eNodeB (steps 1-2), the eNodeB can then send zero or more Network
Positioning Information messages towards the E-SMLC (steps 4-5).
## 9.4 Exception Procedures
The procedures in this clause apply to all variants of an MT-LR, NI-LR and MO-
LR where a Location Request message has been sent either to RAN, for a UE with
GERAN or UTRAN access, or to an E-SMLC, for a UE with E-UTRAN access, in order
to request some location service (e.g. provision of a location estimate for a
target UE or transfer of assistance data to a target UE).
### 9.4.1 Procedures in the VMSC /MSC server
After the VMSC /MSC server has requested a location service for a particular
UE from RAN, certain events may occur that may temporarily or permanently
interfere with the location service attempt. For each such event notified to
the VMSC /MSC server, the VMSC /MSC server shall employ one of the following
error recovery actions.
**Restart** **the** **Location** **Service**
This action shall be employed for any event that temporarily impedes a
location service attempt and cannot be delayed until the location service
attempt is complete. When such an event is notified to the VMSC /MSC server,
it shall immediately cancel the location service attempt and the associated
signalling dialogue with RAN, if this still exists by sending a \"stop
reporting\" message to RAN. The \"stop reporting\" message shall contain the
reason for the location procedure cancellation in A/Gb mode or the indication
about the type of location request to cancel (e.g. direct) in Iu mode.
After aborting the location request dialogue with RAN, the VMSC /MSC server
may queue the location service request until the event causing the restart has
terminated (if not already terminated). The VMSC /MSC server may optionally
wait for an additional time period (e.g. if the queuing delay is minimal) to
ensure that any resources allocated in and by RAN have time to be released.
The VMSC /MSC server may then send another location service request to RAN
associated with the target UE.
**Abort** **the** **Location** **Service**
This action shall be employed for any event that permanently impedes a
location service attempt, such as loss of the dedicated signalling channel to
the target UE. When such an event is notified to the VMSC /MSC server, it
shall cancel the current location service attempt and the associated
signalling dialogue with RAN, if still existing, by sending a \"stop
reporting\" message to RAN. The \"stop reporting\" message shall contain the
reason for the location procedure cancellation in A/Gb mode or the indication
about the type of location request to cancel (e.g. direct) in Iu mode. The
VMSC /MSC server shall then return an error response to the client or network
entity from which the location request was originally received. The VMSC /MSC
server shall also release all resources specifically allocated for the
location attempt.
The following table indicates the appropriate error recovery procedure for
certain events. For events not listed in the table, the VMSC /MSC server need
take no action.
Table 9.1: LCS Error Recovery Procedures in the VMSC /MSC server for certain
Events
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Event | VMSC /MSC server Error Recovery | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Release of radio channel to the | Abort | | UE | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Any error response from RAN | Abort | | except for SRNC relocation or | | | inter-MSC handover | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | In Iu mode inter RNC hard | Abort on Iu level | | handover, SRNC relocation and | | | inter- MSC or MSC server | Restart after process is | | handover | completed | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | In A/Gb mode inter-MSC Handover | Restart after handover is | | and inter-BSC handover | completed | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | InterSystem handover | Restart after handover is | | | completed | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
If RAN is in an overload condition, it may reject a location request by
indicating congestion. The VMSC /MSC server may reduce the frequency of future
location service requests until rejection due to overload has ceased.
### 9.4.2 Void
### 9.4.3 Procedures in the SGSN
After the SGSN has requested a location service for a particular UE from RAN,
certain events may occur that may temporarily or permanently interfere with
the location service attempt. For each such event notified to the SGSN, the
SGSN shall employ one of the following error recovery actions.
**Restart the Location Service**
This action shall be employed for any event that temporarily impedes a
location service attempt and cannot be delayed until the location service
attempt is complete. When such an event is notified to the SGSN, it shall
immediately cancel the location service attempt and the associated signalling
dialogue with RAN, if this still exists by sending a \"stop reporting\" (Iu
mode) or \"location abort\" (A/Gb mode) message to RAN. The \"stop
reporting\"/\"location abort\" message shall contain the reason for the
location procedure cancellation.
After aborting the location request dialogue with RAN, the SGSN may queue the
location service request until the event causing the restart has terminated
(if not already terminated). The SGSN may optionally wait for an additional
time period (e.g. if the queuing delay is minimal) to ensure that any
resources allocated in and by RAN have time to be released. The SGSN may then
send another location service request to RAN associated with the target UE.
**Abort the Location Service**
This action shall be employed for any event that permanently impedes a
location service attempt, such as loss of the radio channel to the target UE.
When such an event is notified to the SGSN, it shall cancel the current
location service attempt and the associated signalling dialogue with RAN, if
still existing, by sending a \"stop reporting\"/\"location abort\" message to
RAN. The \"stop reporting\"/\"location abort\" message shall contain the
reason for the location procedure cancellation. The SGSN shall then return an
error response to the client or network entity from which the location request
was originally received. The SGSN shall also release all resources
specifically allocated for the location attempt.
The following table indicates the appropriate error recovery procedure for
certain events. For events not listed in the table, the SGSN need take no
action.
Table 9.2: LCS Error Recovery Procedures in the SGSN for certain Events

### 9.4.3a Procedures in the MME
After the MME has requested a location service for a particular UE from an
E-SMLC, certain events may occur that may temporarily or permanently interfere
with the location service attempt. For each such event notified to the MME,
the MME shall employ one of the following error recovery actions.
**Abort the Location Service:**
This action shall be employed for any event that permanently impedes a
location service attempt, such as loss of the radio channel to the target UE
or handover to a different MME. When such an event is notified to the MME, it
shall cancel the current location service attempt and the associated
signalling dialogue with the E-SMLC by sending a \"location abort\" message to
the E-SMLC. The \"location abort\" message shall contain the reason for the
location procedure cancellation. The MME shall then return an error response
to the client or network entity (e.g. GMLC) from which the location request
was originally received. The MME shall also release all resources specifically
allocated for the location attempt.
The following table indicates the appropriate error recovery procedure for
certain events. For events not listed in the table, the MME need take no
action.
Table 9.2a: LCS Error Recovery Procedures in the MME for certain Events
* * *
Event MME Error Recovery UE Detach Abort Inter MME Tracking Area Update Abort
E-UTRAN to UTRAN Routing Area Update Abort Inter MME and inter RAT handover
Abort RRC or S1 connection release not due to User Inactivity (NOTE) Abort
NOTE: The MME can determine the reason for an S1 connection release requested
by the eNodeB from the Cause IE included in the UE Context Release Request
message - see TS 36.413 [49].
* * *
**Release S1 Connection and Preserve the Location Service**
This action shall be employed when the MME receives a UE Context Release
Request from the serving eNodeB where the cause IE indicates user inactivity.
The MME shall release the S1 connection but shall preserve and retain
associated context information for the location service.
### 9.4.4 Void
### 9.4.5 Handover handling
#### 9.4.5.1 VMSC /MSC server procedure for Inter-VMSC /MSC server Handover
When a location estimate is required for a target UE with an established call
in a state of inter-VMSC /MSC server handover, the serving location area ID
shall be used by the visited MSC /MSC server to identify the correct RAN to
serve the location request. All location request related messages shall be
sent via MAP/E interface piggy-backed in MAP_FORWARD_ACCESS_SIGNALLING and MAP
PROCESS_ACCESS_SIGNALLING between the visited and serving MSCs /MSC servers.
#### 9.4.5.2 Handling of an ongoing handover while a request for positioning
arrives
If during an ongoing handover procedure a request for location information
arrives, the request shall be suspended until the handover is completed. On
completion of the handover, the location preparation procedure shall continue.
#### 9.4.5.3 Handover handling in Iu mode
In case of hard handovers in Iu mode, e.g. inter RNC hard handover, or Serving
RNC relocation, and inter- MSC, MSC Server or SGSN handovers, the ongoing
positioning process is aborted on Iu level. In soft handovers where the
Serving RNS and Iu are relocated, any ongoing positioning process is also
aborted on Iu level. The MSC, MSC Server or SGSN shall restart the Iu aborted
location requests with the new Serving RNC. The new SGSN, however, shall not
restart the location request after inter SGSN Routing Area Update or inter
SGSN relocation. During intra and inter RNC soft and softer handovers the
existing RRC connection can normally be used without any need to abort the on-
going positioning process on Iu level.
#### 9.4.5.4 Handover of an IMS Emergency Call with EPS/GPRS Access
Handover of the PS bearer for an established or not yet established IMS
emergency call may occur within the PS domain (i.e. intra E-UTRAN, intra
UTRAN, E-UTRAN to UTRAN, UTRAN to E-UTRAN or E-UTRAN to HRPD) as defined in TS
23.401 [41], TS 23.402 [44] and TS 23.060 [15]. Handover of an already
established IMS emergency call may also occur from the PS domain to the CS
domain using SRVCC as defined in TS 23.216 [43]. When such an event occurs in
a context where location support for the emergency call is required on the
source side, continuity of location support may be required on the target
side. In this case, the location solution employed on the source and target
access sides may stay the same or may change. In addition, some
reconfiguration of the associated location server or servers (e.g. GMLC, LRF,
E-SLP) may be needed whether or not the solution changes. Table 9.2a
summarizes the support of all possible handover scenarios. Note that in all
cases, the LRF that was originally assigned to the IMS emergency call as
described in clause 9.8.4 must be retained after handover in order to avoid
any impact to the emergency centre/PSAP. However, other location server
changes (e.g. addition or removal of a GMLC) may occur following handover as
summarized in Table 9.2a.

Details concerning the interactions between the LRF, GMLCs, E-SLPs and any
1xRTT location servers to support the reconfiguration requirements in Table
9.2a are outside the scope of this TS. Support of location continuity by other
entities is defined below in association with Figure 9.8h.
Figure 9.8h: Support of Location Continuity for Handover of an IMS Emergency
Call
1\. Following the request for an emergency call, the UE establishes an
emergency PDN connection for E-UTRAN access as defined in TS 23.401 [41] or an
emergency PDP context for UTRAN PS access as defined in TS 23.060 [15]. The UE
may then establish an IMS emergency call as defined in TS 23.167 [36a] during
which an LRF is assigned and a source location server (e.g. GMLC) may be
chosen as described in clause 9.8.4
2\. At some later time, the serving MME or SGSN (hereafter referred to as the
source SGSN or MME) may receive a request from an associated GMLC (hereafter
referred to as the source GMLC) for the location of the UE if the location
solution defined in this TS is used on the source access side.
3\. If step 2 occurs or if support for an NI-LR is required, the source SGSN
or MME starts a location session with the serving RNC or an E-SMLC, in each
case respectively, to obtain the location of the UE.
4\. A request is later sent to the source SGSN or MME from the serving eNodeB
(for E-UTRAN access) or serving RNC (for UTRAN access) for a handover to a
particular target eNodeB (for handover to E-UTRAN) or target RNC (for handover
to UTRAN PS) or target MSC server (for handover to UTRAN CS or GERAN CS) or
target cell associated with a particular 1xRTT MSC (for handover to 1xRTT) or
HRPD target cell (for handover to HRPD).
5\. For handover to E-UTRAN, UTRAN PS, UTRAN CS or GERAN CS, the source MME or
SGSN sends a Handover Request message to the target MME, SGSN, MSC server or
MSC server (hereafter referred to as the target serving node) in each case
respectively as defined in TS 23.401 [41], TS 23.060 [15] or TS 23.216 [43].
For handover from E-UTRAN to 1xRTT, the source MME initiates a handover to a
target 1xRTT IWS using single radio voice call continuity procedures as
described in TS 23.216 [43]. For handover from E-UTRAN to HRPD, this step does
not occur.
6\. The rest of the handover preparation and execution procedure is completed
as defined in TS 23.401 [41], TS 23.402 [44], TS 23.060 [15] or TS 23.216
[43].
7\. The location session started in step 3 may terminate normally before step
6 is complete. If not, the source SGSN or MME shall abort the session once
step 6 is complete. This may lead to provision of a location estimate for the
UE to the source SGSN or MME.
8a. If the location solution defined in this TS is used on the source side and
step 2 occurred, the source SGSN or MME returns a Provide Subscriber Location
response to the source GMLC carrying any location estimate obtained previously
for the UE. Depending on configuration information in the source SGSN or MME
(e.g. which may be related to the source and target serving node identities,
the location capabilities of the UE and whether the UE is roaming or not), the
Provide Subscriber Location response may, except for handover to HRPD, convey
the identity of the target serving node.
8b. If the location solution defined in this TS is used on the source side but
steps 2 and 8a do not occur, the source SGSN or MME may depending on
configuration information in the source SGSN or MME (e.g. as in step 8a) send
a Subscriber Location Report to the source GMLC carrying the UE identity
(IMSI, MSISDN and/or IMEI), an event type indicating handover and, except for
handover to HRPD, the identity of the target serving node.
9\. The source GMLC acknowledges the message in step 8b if this occurs.
10\. Steps 10 and 11 only apply when the target side supports a 3GPP access
type (e.g. do not apply to 1xRTT or HRPD). Depending on configuration
information in the target serving node (e.g. which may be related to the
source and target serving node identities, the location capabilities of the UE
and whether the UE is roaming or not), the target serving node may after
handover in step 6 is complete send a Subscriber Location Report to a GMLC on
the target side if the location solution defined in this TS will be used on
the target side. The Subscriber Location Report carries the UE identity (IMSI,
MSISDN and/or IMEI), an event type indicating handover and the identity of the
target serving node. If the target serving node is an MSC, it will send the UE
identity as received from source MME/SGSN in Handover Request message in step
5. If the MSC does not receive MSISDN from source MME/SGSN, MSISDN may be
populated with a non-dialable callback number as specified in clause 6.4.3.
However, no location estimate is included. The target serving node may
determine the address of the target GMLC from configuration information.
11\. The target GMLC acknowledges the message in step 10.
12\. Reconfiguration of the LRF and the source and target location servers may
occur as summarized in Table 9.2a which may involve removal of a source GMLC
or E-SLP, assignment of a new target GMLC or E-SLP and/or updating of
information in the LRF and in the source/target location server(s). The
details of this step are outside the scope of this TS.
13\. If the LRF needs a location estimate for the UE after handover has
occurred, it may instigate an MT-LR request via either the target GMLC if the
location solution defined in this TS will be used on the target side or a
target E‑SLP if the location solution defined in OMA SUPL [38], [39] will be
used. This will involve a repetition of step 2 on the target side if the
location solution defined in this TS is used. Steps 2 to 12 may also be
repeated on the target side to support a further handover if the previous
handover was to either E-UTRAN or UTRAN PS.
## 9.5 Privacy
### 9.5.1 Privacy Override Indicator (POI)
The POI is used to determine whether the privacy settings of the subscriber to
be positioned shall be overridden by the request for location services. The
POI is applicable only to Emergency service and Lawful intercept service. The
assignment of a POI value with an \"override\" or \"not override\" value in
the LCS client profile is done during the LCS client provisioning. The type of
LCS client requesting location information (i.e. emergency, law-enforcement
etc.) shall determine the value of the POI assigned to the LCS client profile.
POI is not sent to the MME.
There are two distinct cases regarding the handling of the privacy override
indicator.
**Procedure A:** If the subscriber to be positioned is in the same country as
the GMLC or if the subscriber to be positioned is in a different country than
the GMLC and an appropriate bilateral agreement exists between operators, then
the POI shall override the subscriber\'s privacy options, as allowed by
regulatory requirements.
**Procedure B:** Otherwise the POI shall not override the subscriber\'s
privacy options.
### 9.5.2 Privacy Procedures
The privacy profile of the UE subscriber (SLPP) may for GSM and UMTS be stored
in HLR/HSS and/or in H-GMLC/PPR. The privacy profile of the UE subscriber
(SLPP) shall for EPS be stored in H-GMLC/PPR. If the privacy profile data are
stored in SLPP of H-GMLC/PPR, then the pseudo external identities, if
required, shall be contained in the SLPP of the HLR/HSS. Also if the privacy
profile data are stored in H-GMLC/PPR, H-GMLC/PPR sends the indicators of
privacy related action or the pseudo external identities to the serving nodes
in order to inform the results of the privacy check procedures in H-GMLC/PPR.
The SLPP stored in the HLR/HSS shall be downloaded to the VMSC, MSC Server and
SGSN together with the rest of his subscription information in the existing
operation INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA. It will be deleted with the existing
operation DELETE_SUBSCRIBER_DATA.
In case of an Emergency Services location request, based on the location of
the VMSC/MSC Server/SGSN and the R-GMLC, the V -GMLC evaluates whether to
accept or ignore the received POI, according to the definition in clause
9.1.5. If privacy override is not allowed, then the V-GMLC rejects the
request.
In case the privacy override i s allowed, the POI is transferred from the GMLC
to the VMSC/MSC Server/SGSN in the location request. Based on the location of
the GMLC the VMSC/MSC Server/SGSN evaluates whether to accept or ignore the
received POI according to the definition in clause 9.5.1.
If the POI is accepted the location requested is unconditionally performed.
Otherwise the VMSC/MSC Server/SGSN evaluates the privacy options in the UE
subscriber\'s subscription profile (assuming this is held in the VLR/MSC
Server/SGSN) or evaluates the received privacy related action indicators. If
the corresponding register does not contain the UE subscription profile, LCS
will rely on the existing GSM recovery mechanisms to obtain the profile.
If local regulatory requirements mandate it, any MT-LR for an emergency
services LCS client and any NI-LR for an emergency services call origination
shall be allowed by the VMSC/MSC Server/SGSN/MME.
If the location request is allowed by the privacy options the location request
is performed. Otherwise, if the location request is barred by the privacy
options, the location request is refused an error response is returned to the
LCS client with a cause code indicating that the request was rejected by the
subscriber.
### 9.5.3 UE Privacy Options
The UE privacy options in the SLPP apply to an CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR or NI-LR/PS-
NI-LR and either indicate that no CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR or NI-LR/PS-NI-LR is
allowed for the UE (except as may be overridden by the POI or local regulatory
requirements) or define the particular classes of LCS client for which an CS-
MT-LR/PS-MT-LR or NI‑LR/PS-NI-LR for location are allowed, with the following
classes being possible:
[Editor\'s note: An e-mail comment pointed out that there are different cases
still to be covered in the description of the classes: 1. the LCS Client
identity is included in SLPP or 2. the LCS Client identity is NOT included in
SLPP. Also some GMLC restriction conditions need to be mentioned.]
a) Universal Class - allow positioning by all LCS clients;
b) Call/Session related Class
c) Call/Session-unrelated Class
d) PLMN operator Class
Moreover the SLPP may contain the service types allowed by the subscriber.\
All UE privacy options of above four classes are commonly used for both CS and
PS domain.\ The privacy classes are selected according to the rules described
in the ANNEX A. If more than one privacy class are subscribed in the UE\'s
SLPP, the looser privacy setting shall be selected. ANNEX A applies also in
case service types privacy checking are subscribed together with one or more
other privacy classes.
NOTE 1: If a privacy option setting in a domain is updated, the same
modification will be applied to the other domain.
NOTE 2: The options for each privacy class and the service type are described
in the subsequent chapters independently from the options of the other privacy
classes. The combination of the privacy class and service type options are
described in the rules of Annex A
#### 9.5.3.1 Universal class
When the user of the UE subscribes to the \"Universal Class\" the CS-MT-LR/PS-
MT-LR or NI-LR/PS-NI-LR positioning is allowed by all LCS clients.
If the UE subscribes to the universal class, any CS-MT-LR or NI-LR shall be
allowed by the VMSC/MSC Server and any PS-MT-LR or PS-NI-LR shall be allowed
by the SGSN.
If the UE subscribes to the universal class and H-GMLC/PPR knows that the
serving node supports the indicator of privacy check related action,
H-GMLC/PPR sends the indicators for call/session unrelated class, which
indicates \"Location allowed without notification\". If the UE subscribes to
the universal class and H-GMLC/PPR knows that the serving node does not
support the indicator of privacy check related action, H-GMLC/PPR may sends
the appropriate pseudo external identity as described in Annex C.
#### 9.5.3.2 Call/Session related class
When the user of the UE subscribes to the \"Call/Session related Class\" the
CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR or NI-LR/PS-NI-LR positioning is allowed in the
following cases:
Allow positioning by specific identified value added LCS client or groups of
value added LCS Client to which the UE originated a call in CS domain or a
value added LCS client with which the UE has a session via an active PDP
context in PS domain indicated by a specific APN-NI. For each identified LCS
client or group of LCS Clients, one of the following subscription options
shall apply:
* location request allowed only from GMLCs identified in the SLPP;
* location request allowed only from a GMLC in the home country;
* location request allowed from any GMLC (default case).
For each identified value added LCS client or group of LCS Clients in the
privacy exception list, one of the following subscription options shall apply:
* positioning allowed without notifying the UE user (default case);
* positioning allowed with notification to the UE user;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user or if there is no response to the notification;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user.
For all value added LCS clients sending a call related CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-
MT-LR that are not identified in the privacy exception list, one of the
following subscription option shall apply:
* positioning not allowed;
* positioning allowed without notifying the UE user (default case);
* positioning allowed with notification to the UE user;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user or if there is no response to the notification;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user.
NOTE 2: The usage of Call/Session related Class in the IM subsystem is FFS.
##### 9.5.3.2.1 Call/session-related class in the CS-domain
If the UE subscribes to the call/session-related class, an CS-MT-LR may be
allowed if both of following conditions are met:
\- The UE previously originated a call in CS domain that is still established
and the called party number dialled by the UE matches the called party number
received from the GMLC.
\- The identity of the LCS client or LCS client group supplied by the GMLC
matches the identity of any LCS Client or LCS Client group contained in the
UE\'s SLPP and any other GMLC restrictions associated with this LCS Client
identity in the SLPP are also met
If these conditions are satisfied, the CS-MT-LR shall be allowed if the UE
user subscribes to either location without notification or location with
notification. If the UE user subscribes to location with notification and
privacy verification, the CS-MT-LR shall be allowed following notification to
the UE if the UE user either returns a response indicating that location is
allowed or returns no response but subscribes to allowing location in the
absence of a response. In all other cases, the CS-MT-LR shall be restricted.
##### 9.5.3.2.2 Call/session-related class in the PS-domain
If the UE subscribes to the call/session-related class, a PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR
may be allowed if all of the following conditions are met:
\- The UE previously originated a PDP/EPS Bearer-context towards the network
where the external client is located and that this context is still
established.
\- The APN-NI negotiated between the UE and SGSN/MME matches the APN-NI
received from the GMLC.
\- The identity of the LCS client or LCS client group supplied by the GMLC
matches the identity of any LCS Client or LCS Client group contained in the
UE\'s SLPP and any other GMLC restrictions associated with this LCS Client
identity in the SLPP are also met.
If these conditions are satisfied, the PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed if
the UE user subscribes to either location without notification or location
with notification. If the UE user subscribes to location with notification and
privacy verification, the PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed following
notification to the UE if the UE user either returns a response indicating
that location is allowed or returns no response but subscribes to allowing
location in the absence of a response. In all other cases, the PS-MT-LR/EPC-
MT-LR shall be restricted.
##### 9.5.3.2.3 Call/session-related class when LCS client not in SLPP
If the UE subscribes to the call/session related class, a CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR
or EPC-MT-LR from an LCS client that is NOT contained in the SLPP of the
target UE shall be allowed or restricted according to the following
conditions:
\- For any non-matched LCS client, the CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR or EPC-MT-LR shall
be allowed, if the UE user subscribes to either location without notification
or location with notification.
If the UE user subscribes to location with notification and privacy
verification, the CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR or EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed following
notification to the UE if the UE user either returns a response indicating
that location is allowed or returns no response but subscribes to location in
the absence of a response. In all other cases, the CS-MT-LR, PS-MT-LR or EPC-
MT-LR shall be restricted.
#### 9.5.3.3 Call/Session-unrelated class
When the user of the UE subscribes to the \"Call/Session unrelated Class\" the
CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR or NI-LR/PS-NI-LR positioning is allowed in the
following cases:
Allow positioning by specific identified value added LCS Clients or groups of
value added LCS Client with the following restrictions allowed for each
identified value added LCS Client or group of value added LCS Clients:
* location request allowed only from GMLCs identified in the SLPP;
* location request allowed only from a GMLC in the home country;
* location request allowed from any GMLC (default case).
For each identified value added LCS client in the privacy exception list, one
of the following subscription options shall apply:
* positioning allowed without notifying the UE user (default case);
* positioning allowed with notification to the UE user;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user or if there is no response to the notification;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user.
For all value added LCS clients sending a non-call/session related CS-MT-
LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR that are not identified in the privacy exception list,
one of the following subscription option shall apply:
* positioning not allowed (default case);
* positioning allowed with notification to the UE user;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user or if there is no response to the notification;
* positioning requires notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE user.
##### 9.5.3.3.1 Call/session-unrelated class when LCS client identities match
If the UE subscribes to the call/session-unrelated class, an CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-
LR/EPC-MT-LR may be allowed by the MSC/MSC server, SGSN or MME if the identity
of the LCS client or LCS client group supplied by the GMLC matches the
identity of any LCS Client or LCS Client group contained in the UE\'s SLPP and
any other GMLC restrictions associated with this LCS Client identity in the
SLPP are also met.
If the LCS client is correctly matched in this way and any GMLC restrictions
are satisfied, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed if the UE user
subscribes to either location without notification or location with
notification. If the UE user subscribes to location with notification and
privacy verification, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed
following notification to the UE if the UE user either returns a response
indicating that location is allowed or returns no response but subscribes to
location in the absence of a response. In all other cases, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-
LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be restricted.
##### 9.5.3.3.2 Call/session-unrelated class when LCS client identities do not
match
If the UE subscribes to the call/session-unrelated class, an CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-
LR/EPC-MT-LR from an LCS client that is not contained in the UE\'s SLPP shall
be allowed or restricted according to the following conditions. For any non-
matched LCS client, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed if the UE
user subscribes to location with notification. If the UE user subscribes to
location with notification and privacy verification, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-
LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be allowed following notification to the UE if the UE user
either returns a response indicating that location is allowed or returns no
response but subscribes to location in the absence of a response. In all other
cases, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR/EPC-MT-LR shall be restricted.
#### 9.5.3.4 PLMN operator class
When the user of the UE subscribes to the \" PLMN operator Class\" the CS-MT-
LR/PS-MT-LR or NI-LR/PS-NI-LR positioning is allowed in the following cases:
Allow positioning by specific types of client within or associated with the
VPLMN, with the following types of client identified:
* clients providing a location related broadcast service;
* O&M client in the HPLMN (when the UE is currently being served by the HPLMN);
* O&M client in the VPLMN;
* clients recording anonymous location information without any UE identifier;
* clients enhancing or supporting any supplementary service, IN service, bearer service or teleservice subscribed to by the target UE subscriber.
If the UE subscribes to the PLMN class, an NI-LR/PS-NI-LR or CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR
shall be allowed if the client within the VPLMN, for an NI-LR/PS-NI-LR, or the
client identified by the GMLC, for an CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR, either matches a
generic type of client contained in the UE\'s SLPP or is otherwise authorized
by local regulatory requirements to locate the UE. If H-GMLC/PPR knows that
the serving node supports LCS capability set 4 or later, then H-GMLC/PPR will
send the indicators for call/session unrelated class, which indicates
\'location allowed without notification\'. If H-GMLC/PPR is notified that the
serving node does not support the LCS capability set 4 or later, then it will
not send any indicator.
#### 9.5.3.5 Service type checking
If the SLPP contains service types, a CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR may be allowed if the
service type supplied by the LCS client matches the identity of any service
type contained in the UE\'s SLPP and any other GMLC restrictions associated
with this service type in the SLPP are also met.
If the service type is correctly matched in this way and any GMLC restrictions
are satisfied, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR shall be allowed if the UE user
subscribes to either location without notification or location with
notification. If the UE user subscribes to location with notification and
privacy verification, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR shall be allowed following
notification to the UE if the UE user either returns a response indicating
that location is allowed or returns no response but subscribes to location in
the absence of a response. In all other cases, the CS-MT-LR/PS-MT-LR shall be
restricted.
#### 9.5.3.6 Matching of LCS client identities
In evaluating privacy where any address \"A\" associated with the LCS client
(e.g. LCS client ID or GMLC address) needs to be compared with a corresponding
address \"B\" in the target UE\'s SLPP, a match shall be determined if a match
is found for each of the following components of each address:
a) numbering plan;
b) nature of address indicator;
c) corresponding address digits for all digits in \"B\" (the digits or initial
digits in \"A\" must match all the digits in \"B\", but \"A\" may contain
additional digits beyond those in \"B\").
All addresses shall be transferred to the MSC/VLR, MSC server or SGSN in
international format, except for the called party number received from the
GMLC during a Call-Related CS MT-LR when the LCS client was reached via IN or
abbreviated number routing (e.g. toll-free number or emergency call routing).
In these cases it is up to the GMLC to use the valid national specific number
of the visited country.
In evaluating privacy where an APN-NI associated with the LCS client notified
by the GMLC needs to be compared with a corresponding APN-NI that is used to
set up the associated PDP context, a match shall be determined if a match is
found for each component of APN-NI.
### 9.5.4 Indicator of privacy check related action
When the client type indicates value added service and the serving node
supports LCS capability set 4 or later, H-GMLC/PPR shall select indicators for
privacy check related action and the indicators shall be included in the
Provide_Subscriber_Location request towards the serving node. The indication
is sent to the serving node directly from the H-GMLC or via V-GMLC. There
shall be an indicator for the call/session unrelated. For GSM and UMTS there
shall be an optional indicator for the call/session related and it shall be
sent only if call/session related identity, i.e. the number dialled by UE or
APN-NI, is sent to the serving node. For EPS, there shall be an optional
indicator for the session related and it shall be sent only if session related
identity, i.e. APN-NI, is sent to the serving node.
The possible values of the indicator of privacy check related action for
call/session unrelated case shall be:
\- Location allowed without notification
\- Location allowed with notification
\- Location with notification and privacy verification; location allowed if no
response
\- Location with notification and privacy verification; location restricted if
no response
\- Location not allowed (only applicable when the indicator for call/session
related case is sent, or the POI is included in the provide subscriber
location request)
The possible values of the indicator of privacy check related action for
call/session related case shall be:
\- Location allowed without notification
\- Location allowed with notification
\- Location with notification and privacy verification; location allowed if no
response
\- Location with notification and privacy verification; location restricted if
no response
If both indicators are sent but indicating different actions and the
call/session related criteria met in the serving node then an action according
to the indicator with the looser action according to the definition in Annex A
shall be chosen as shown in Annex A.3.
If the UE subscribes service types, then the result of the service type
checking may be included in any of the privacy check indicators, as it is
described in annex A.3.
If the UE subscribes either to PLMN class or to the universal class,
H-GMLC/PPR sends the indicator for call/session unrelated class with the value
of \"Location allowed without notification\".
## 9.6 Mobile Originating Location
An UE may subscribe to any of the following classes of mobile originating
location:
a) Basic Self Location;
b) Autonomous Self Location;
c) Transfer to Third Party.
An MO-LR shall be allowed by the serving node (VMSC/MSC Server/SGSN/MME) if
the type of request is supported by the appropriate subscription according to
the following table.
Table 9.3: Required UE Subscription Options for MO-LR Requests
* * *
Type of MO-LR Request Required UE Subscription UE requests own location Basic
Self Location UE requests location assistance data Autonomous Self Location UE
requests transfer of own location to another LCS Client Transfer to Third
Party
* * *
## 9.7 CM Procedures
### 9.7.1 Location request for a mobile in idle-mode
When a request for location information is received at the serving node the
LCS-layer shall order paging of the UE subscriber. In case of first
unsuccessful paging, normal paging procedures should apply. After successful
paging the LCS-layer shall invoke the location preparation procedure.
### 9.7.2 Location request for a mobile in dedicated-mode
When a request for location information is received at the serving node, if
the UE is already busy on CM level, the LCS-layer shall attempt to establish a
parallel transaction to the existing one. If successful, the LCS-layer shall
invoke the location preparation procedure.
## 9.8 Interworking with the IMS
### 9.8.1 Standard Location Request using a SIP-URI
An external LCS Client shall use the same interface to the LCS Server
regardless of the target UE\'s identity.
If a location request from an external LCS client uses a SIP-URI as the target
UE\'s identity, the requesting GMLC shall invoke a LIMS-IWF (Location IMS
Interworking Function) to route the request to the user\'s home network. This
routing mechanism may use standard technologies like pre-configuration of
destination addresses or DNS lookups to determine the address of a LIMS-IWF in
the home network of the user. The interface between two LIMS-IWF in different
networks shall be Lr.
If the LIMS-IWF in the home network is not co-located with the home GMLC, it
shall use the same interface towards the home GMLC as the requesting GMLC,
i.e. the Lr interface. The LIMS-IWF in the home network has to determine the
HSS serving the user. This may be done e.g. by a Dh SLF query or the HSS
address is known to the LIMS-IWF through configuration. The LIMS-IWF retrieves
the MSISDN from the HSS through Sh Pull and use MAP Send Routing Info for LCS
to get the home GMLC IP address from the HLR/HSS. Afterwards the LIMS-IWF in
the home network can forward the LCS service request (including the target
UE\'s MSISDN) on the Lr interface to the home GMLC.
The following figure shows the principle call flow when a GMLC receives a
location request where the target UE\'s identity is an IMS Public User
Identity (SIP-URI).
Figure 9.9: MT-LR procedure for IMS Public User Identities
1\. An external LCS Client requests the current location of a target UE from a
R-GMLC using the Public User Identity (SIP-URI) associated with the target UE.
2\. The R-GMLC selects a LIMS-IWF in the requesting network. The LIMS-IWF
address may be pre-configured or DNS is used for this purpose. The R-GMLC
forwards the LCS service request to the requested LIMS-IWF via Lr interface.
3\. The LIMS-IWF in the requesting network determines the LISM-IWF address in
the home network. This may be done by using a pre-configured address or by
DNS. The requesting LIMS-IWF forwards the LCS service request to the home
LIMS-IWF via Lr interface.
4\. The home LIMS-IWF queries the SLF via Dh interface to get the HSS address
(using the Dh interface to retrieve the HSS address is an option).
5\. The home LIMS-IWF retrieves the HSS address from the SLF via Dh SLF
Response.
6\. The home LIMS-IWF queries the HSS via Sh PULL (including the SIP-URI) to
get the user\'s MSISDN.
7\. The home LIMS-IWF retrieves the user\'s MSISDN from the HSS via Sh PULL
Response.
8\. The LIMS-IWF uses MAP Send Routing Info for LCS to get the H-GMLC address
from the HLR/HSS.
9\. The LIMS-IWF retrieves the H-GMLC address from the HLR/HSS.
10\. The LCS service request is forwarded to the H-GMLC through Lr interface.
11\. The H-GMLC performs the privacy check.
12\. The H-GMLC queries the HLR/HSS using MAP Send Routing Info for LCS to get
the V-GMLC address.
13\. The H-GMLC retrieves the V-GMLC address from the HLR/HSS.
14\. The H-GMLC forwards the LCS service request to the V-GMLC.
15\. The standard MT-LR procedure is performed.
16\. The LCS service response is send from the V-GMLC to the H-GMLC.
17\. The H-GMLC performs the privacy check.
18\. The LCS service response is send from the H-GMLC to home LIMS-IWF.
19\. The LCS service response is send from the home LIMS-IWF to the requesting
LIMS-IWF.
20\. The LCS service response is send from the requesting LIMS-IWF to the
R-GMLC.
21\. The LCS service response is send from the R-GMLC to the external LCS
Client.
### 9.8.2 Standard Location Request using a TEL-URL
IF a location request from an external LCS client uses a TEL-URL as the target
UE\'s identity, the requesting GMLC shall convert the TEL-URL into a MSISDN,
use this MSISDN in the location request as the target UE\'s address and
continue with the MT-LR procedure for the PS domain.
### 9.8.3 Mobile Originated Location Requests in the IMS
Mobile Originated Location Requests will not specifically require IMS
interworking and therefore are not covered within this specification.
### 9.8.4 IMS Emergency Location Procedure
A common procedure to support location and PSAP/Emergency Centre selection for
any type of access network is shown in TS 23.167 [36a] \"Retrieving Location
information for Emergency Session\". The procedure may be used dependent on
the access type and the requirements of the applicable regulatory authority.
# 10 Information storage
This clause describes information storage structures that are mandatory (M),
conditional (C) or optional (O) for LCS, and the recovery and restoration
procedures needed to maintain service if inconsistencies in databases occur
and for lost or invalid database information. Information storage in RAN
network elements is specified in UTRAN Stage 2 (TS 25.305 [1]) and GERAN Stage
2 (TS 43.059 [16]) specifications.
## 10.1 HLR and HSS
The HLR/HSS holds LCS data for both UE subscribers and LMUs. If the privacy
profile data for UE subscribers are stored in H-GMLC/PPR, HLR/HSS needs to
store the corresponding pseudo-external identities and MO-LR related
subscription data shown in Table 10.4 and 10.5. The pseudo-external identities
are stored in the privacy exception list shown in Table 10.2. The details of
the pseudo-external identity are described in Annex C.
### 10.1.1 LCS Data in the HLR/HSS for an UE Subscriber
The IMSI is the primary key for LCS UE subscription data in the HLR/HSS. This
subscription data may be stored in a Multiple Subscriber Profile (MSP), with
the HLR/HSS able to hold a number of MSPs per IMSI.
For GSM and UMTS, the LCS UE subscription data includes a privacy exception
list containing the privacy classes for which location of the target UE is
permitted. Each privacy class is treated as a distinct supplementary service
with its own supplementary service code. The following logical states are
applicable to each privacy class (refer to TS 23.011 [22] for an explanation
of the notation).
Table 10.1: Logical States for each LCS Privacy Class
* * *
Provisioning State Registration State Activation State HLR Induction State
(Not Provisioned, Not Applicable, Not Active, Not Induced) (Provisioned, Not
Applicable, Active and Operative, Not Induced)
* * *
For each LCS privacy class, the HLR/HSS shall store the logical state of the
class on a per-subscriber (or per subscriber MSP) basis. In addition, the
permanent data indicated below shall be stored on a per subscriber (or per
subscriber MSP) basis when the logical provisioning state of the associated
LCS privacy class is \"provisioned\". For the meaning of each LCS privacy
class, refer to clause 9 and to TS 22.071 [4].\ Moreover a list of allowed
service types may be stored. The meaning of service types is defined in TS
22.071 [4].

In case that UE\'s privacy profile is stored and is checked in the GMLC
(H-GMLC) or in the PPR, pseudo-external identities may be set in the external
LCS client list of the HLR privacy exception list shown in Table 10.2. The
pseudo-external identity is not the identity of real external LCS client but
the identity which is used for notifying SGSN/MSC of the location request
class (call/session related or non-call/session related) and the required type
of indication for each class. Operator allocates E.164 addresses for the
pseudo-external identities.
Fourteen pseudo-external identities are needed to be defined. The pseudo-
external identities are summarized in the Table C.1. The pseudo-external
identities are registered in SLPP of each UE in advance.
LCS UE subscription data may include a mobile originating list containing the
LCS mobile originating classes that an UE is permitted to request. Each LCS
mobile originating class is treated as a distinct supplementary service with
its own supplementary service code. The following logical states are
applicable to each mobile originating class (refer to TS 23.011 [22] for an
explanation of the notation).

For each LCS Mobile Originating class, the HLR/HSS shall store the logical
state of the class on a per-subscriber (or per subscriber MSP) basis. In this
version of LCS, there is no additional permanent data in the HLR. The table
below shows the defined mobile originating classes. For the meaning of each
LCS mobile originating class, refer to clause 8 and to TS 22.071 [4].

## 10.2 VLR/SGSN
The VLR/SGSN contains the same LCS permanent data for each registered UE
subscriber, as does the HLR/HSS. This data is downloaded to the VLR/SGSN as
part of the location update procedure between the VLR/SGSN and HLR/HSS for an
UE subscriber.
## 10.2a MME
The MME contains the same LCS permanent data for each registered UE
subscriber, as does the HSS. This data is downloaded to the MME as part of the
Attach and Tracking Area Update procedures between the MME and HSS for a UE
subscriber.
## 10.3 GMLC
### 10.3.1 LCS Data in the GMLC for a LCS Client
The GMLC holds data for a set of external LCS clients that may make call
related or non-call related MT-LR requests to this GMLC. The permanent data
administered for each LCS client is as follows.

NOTE 1: The LCS Client is identified with E.164 number or APN-NI. APN-NI is
specified in TS 23.003 [17].
NOTE 2: The LCS Client name should not contain two equal signs, because those
characters are used to separate LCS client name from Requestor ID when GMLC
includes them into the same field.
### 10.3.2 LCS Data in the GMLC/PPR for a UE Subscriber
The GMLC (H-GMLC) or PPR may store LCS UE subscription data. This chapter
describes Rel-5 based privacy profile data stored in GMLC/PPR. If the home
network operator uses Rel-5 compatible privacy profile data, the profiles
shown in this chapter may be stored in GMLC/PPR. If the home network operator
supports Rel‑6 or later compatible privacy profile data, the profiles stored
in the GMLC/PPR may be related to different geographic areas, i.e. subscribers
may have different privacy profiles depending on subscribers\' locations.
The IMSI or MSISDN is the primary key for LCS UE subscription data in the
GMLC/PPR. This subscription data may be stored in a Multiple Subscriber
Profile (MSP), with the GMLC/PPR able to hold a number of MSPs per IMSI.
LCS UE subscription data includes a privacy exception list containing the
privacy classes for which location of the target UE is permitted. Each privacy
class is treated as a distinct supplementary service with its own
supplementary service code. The following logical states are applicable to
each privacy class (refer to TS 23.011 [22] for an explanation of the
notation).
Table 10.9: Logical States for each LCS Privacy Class
* * *
Provisioning State Registration State Activation State HLR Induction State
(Not Provisioned, Not Applicable, Not Active, Not Induced) (Provisioned, Not
Applicable, Active and Operative, Not Induced)
* * *
For each LCS privacy class, the GMLC/PPR shall store the logical state of the
class on a per-subscriber (or per subscriber MSP) basis. In addition, the
permanent data indicated in Table 10.10 may be stored on a per subscriber (or
per subscriber MSP) basis when the logical provisioning state of the
associated LCS privacy class is \"provisioned\". For the meaning of each LCS
privacy class, refer to clause 9 and to TS 22.071 [4].\ Moreover a list of
allowed service types may be stored. The meaning of service types is defined
in TS 22.071 [4].

In case that UE\'s privacy profile is stored and is checked in the GMLC
(H-GMLC) or in the PPR, the GMLC/PPR shall store the same pseudo-external
identity table with HLR, which is shown in Annex C.
GMLC (H-GMLC) or PPR may store codeword handling information and a list of
codewords given by the UE subscriber in order not to get the location request
rejected.

The GMLC (H-GMLC) or the PPR may store additional privacy information in order
protect UE users privacy. The details of the additional privacy check are
defined by each network operator and are outside the scope of this
specification.
## 10.4 Recovery and Restoration Procedures
The LCS recovery and restoration procedures allow temporary data to be
recovered or reinitialized following loss or corruption of data, such that
normal LCS service is rapidly restored and inconsistency between the data held
by different LCS network elements is removed. For a full description, refer to
TS 23.007 [23].
## 10.5 Interworking between network nodes in different releases
This clause describes possible scenarios for interworking between network
nodes in different releases. It is noted that LCS is only supported in A-mode
and Iu-mode in the CS domain in Rel-99. LCS is supported in A-mode and Iu-mode
in UTRAN CS and PS domains, but not in Gb-mode, in Rel-4. LCS is supported in
A/Gb mode and Iu mode in CS and PS domains for UTRAN and GERAN in Rel-5,
Rel-6, Rel-7 and Rel-8. LCS is supported in A/Gb mode and Iu mode in CS and PS
domains for UTRAN and GERAN and in the PS domain for E‑UTRAN in Rel-9 onwards.
The concept of LCS capability set is introduced in Rel-4, so it does not
appear in the specifications for R98 and R99 LCS.
### 10.5.1 LCS capability set
The following LCS capabilities are identified in the current version of this
specification. The HLR/HSS is notified the LCS capability of the serving node
by an indication, which indicates all the LCS the serving node supports, from
the serving node during location update procedure.
\- LCS capability set 1: R98 and R99 LCS (pre-Rel\'4 LCS)
\- LCS capability set 2: Rel\'4 LCS
\- LCS capability set 3: Rel\'5 LCS
\- LCS capability set 4: Rel\'6 LCS
\- LCS capability set 5: Rel\'7 or later LCS
NOTE 1: the concept of LCS capability set is introduced in Rel4 so that R98
and R99 serving nodes do not notify HLR/HSS this parameter. Therefore, even if
this parameter is absent the serving node may support at most LCS capability
set 1.
NOTE 2: For E-UTRAN access, LCS capability sets 1 through 4 are not
applicable. An MME that does not signal an LCS capability to the HSS shall be
assumed to provide no LCS support.
The serving node, which notified the HLR/HSS that it supports LCS capability
set 2, shall be able to handle the extended LCS Client list and LCS Client
List for call-related class from the HLR/HSS.
The serving node, which notified the HLR/HSS that it supports LCS capability
set 3, shall support the following capabilities:
\- capability to perform the service type privacy check.
\- capability to send the codeword to target UE for notification/verification.
\- capability to send the requestor ID to target UE for
notification/verification.
The serving node, which notified the HLR/HSS that it supports LCS capability
set 4, shall support the following capability:
\- capability to perform the privacy related action (i.e. checking the on-
going call/session and/or notification/verification procedures) which is
requested by H-GMLC.
The serving node, which notified the HLR/HSS that it supports LCS capability
set 5, shall support the following capability:
\- capability to perform the privacy related action (i.e. checking the on-
going call/session and/or notification/verification procedures) for
notification based on current location which is requested by H-GMLC.
### 10.5.2 Interworking between pre Rel-4 serving node and Rel-4 or later
HLR/HSS
The serving node that supports only pre-Rel\'4 LCS cannot handle the extended
privacy control for call-related/call-unrelated class of the Rel\'4 and later
LCS. That is, the serving node cannot provide the extended call-related/call-
unrelated class service to the user who subscribes to the Rel\'4 LCS.
Therefore HLR does not send the LCS subscriber data on call-related/call-
unrelated class for users who subscribe to the call-related class of Rel\'4
LCS to the serving node that supports only pre-Rel\'4 LCS.
### 10.5.3 Interworking between pre Rel-5 serving node and Rel-5 or later
HLR/HSS
If the HLR/HSS is notified that the LCS capability set 3 is not supported by
the serving node, it may decide not to send the LCS subscriber data to the
serving node, in order to protect user privacy.
In addition, if the HLR/HSS is notified that the serving node does not support
the LCS capability set 2, the procedures described in 10.5.2 also shall be
applied.
### 10.5.4 Interworking between pre Rel-6 network nodes and Rel-6 or later
HLR/HSS
In addition to the procedures in this section, if the HLR/HSS is notified that
the serving node does not support the LCS capability set 2 and/or set 3, the
procedures described in 10.5.3 shall be also taken into consideration.
#### 10.5.4.1 Rel-6 or later HLR/HSS with pre Rel-6 serving node
The Rel-6 or later HLR/HSS notifies the H-GMLC about the all LCS capability
set supported by the serving node.
In accordance with the notified LCS capability of the serving node and the
privacy profile of the target UE, the H-GMLC decides whether the location
estimation process can be continued or not.
In order to request the privacy related action (i.e. checking the on-going
call/session and/or notification/verification procedures) to the pre Rel-6
serving node, H-GMLC may send the Provide Subscriber Location request message
to the serving node with the pseudo-external identity. The detail of the
pseudo-external identity is described in Annex C.
## 10.6 LIMS-IWF
As the LIMS-IWF is a simple interworking function that provides routing of LCS
service requests and responses based on the target UE\'s SIP-URI and mapping
of SIP-URI to MSISDN it must not store user or LCS Client specific data during
or after a location request procedure.
# 11 Operational Aspects
## 11.1 Charging
Charging Information collected by the PLMN serving the LCS Client.
The following charging information shall be collected by the PLMN serving the
LCS Client:
\- type and identity of the LCS Client;
\- identity of the target UE;
\- results (e.g. success/failure, method used if known, response time,
accuracy) - to be repeated for each instance of positioning for a deferred
location request;
\- identity of the visited PLMN;
\- LCS request type (i.e. LDR or LIR);
\- requested Quality of Service information;
\- state;
\- type of event (applicable to LDR requests only);
\- time stamp;
\- type of co-ordinate system used.
## 11.2 Charging Information Collected by the Visited PLMN
The following charging information shall be collected by the visited PLMN:
\- date and time;
\- type and identity of the LCS Client (if known);
\- identity of the target UE;
\- location of the target UE (e.g., MSC, MSC Server, SGSN, MME, tracking area
ID, location area ID, cell ID, location co-ordinates);
\- which location services were requested;
\- requested Quality of Service information;
\- results (e.g. success/failure, positioning method used, response time,
accuracy) - to be repeated for each instance of positioning for a batch
location request;
\- identity of the GMLC or PLMN serving the LCS Client;
\- state;
\- type of event (applicable to LDR requests only).
###### ## Annex A (normative): Privacy Class selection rule in serving node
# A.1 Interrelation among privacy settings
There are five privacy settings and the interrelation among each privacy
setting in terms of privacy strictness is shown as follows:
Table A.1: Privacy settings
* * *
loose Positioning allowed without notifying the UE user ↑ Positioning allowed
with notification to the UE user Positioning requires notification and
verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if granted by the UE
user or if there is no response to the notification ↓ Positioning requires
notification and verification by the UE user; positioning is allowed only if
granted by the UE user strict Positioning not allowed
* * *
# A.2 Privacy class selection rule for pre Rel-6 mechanism
In pre Rel-6 network, the users privacy profile (SLPP) is stored HLR/HSS and
is downloaded to the serving MSC/SGSN. If more than one privacy class are
subscribed or in case Service Types and at least one privacy class are
subscribed, privacy class for an MT-LR is selected by the serving MSC/SGSN
according to the flow diagram shown in Fig. A-1.
An MT-LR may be applied to more than one privacy class or to Service Types and
one or more privacy classes. In this case, looser privacy setting shall be
selected. The privacy settings to be compared are the results of the privacy
checks for each applicable class and Service Type.
Note 1: The client type indicates PLMN Operator service, and the client is
within or associated with the VPLMN.
Note 2: The client type indicates value added service; the UE originated
call/session to the requesting LCS client is established and the address
associated to the LCS client used by the UE in call/session set up matches
with that contained in the location request.
Note 3: The client type indicates value added service.
Note 4: The looser privacy setting shall be selected.
Figure A.1: Privacy Class selection flow diagram
If the user subscribes Service Types, once that the privacy class has been
selected according to figure A.1, the resulting privacy setting shall be
compared with the result of Service Type privacy checking, and the looser
condition shall be applied to the MT-LR, provided that the LCS client was
authorized by the UE user to get location information.
# A.3 Privacy related action selection rule for Rel-6 and later
In Rel-6 and later, the privacy checking function is moved from MSC/SGSN to
H-GMLC/PPR of the target UE. This is also applied to EPS location request,
i.e. privacy checking is done at H-GMLC/PPR of the target UE. H-GMLC/PPR
selects one or two indicators of privacy check related action and sends the
indicators to serving MSC/SGSN/MME as shown in the clause 9.5.4. If the user
subscribes Service Types, the resulting privacy setting shall be compared with
the result of Service Type privacy checking, and the looser condition shall be
selected. The Service Type check result may be included in any of the two
privacy indicators, provided that the MT-LR is allowed for the relative
privacy class.
If the serving MSC/SGSN/MME receives the indicators from H-GMLC, the serving
node selects the privacy related action according to the flow diagram shown in
Fig. A-2.
Figure A.2: Privacy related action selection flow diagram of the serving node
NOTE 1: The UE originated call/session to the requesting LCS client is
established and the address associated to the LCS client used by the UE in
call/session set up matches with that contained in the location request.
NOTE 2: A prior change makes this check unnecessary; since the call unrelated
indicator is mandatory therefore the result is always \"YES\".
###### ## Annex B (normative): Presence of LCS client ID Components in MT-LR
The LCS client identity is composed of one or more than one of the following
components: LCS client type, external identity, internal identity,
call/session related identity, APN-NI, client name and Requestor Identity. For
Value added LCS client type it may contain also Client name and Requestor ID
type indicator. The LCS client type shall always be present and for each LCS
client type the presence of the other components are defined as follows:
+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | C | External | Internal | Call | Client | R | | omponent | identity | identity | /session | name | equestor | | | | | related | | Identity | | LCS | | | identity | | | | Client | | | | | | | type | | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | E | O | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | | mergency | | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | Value | M | N.A. | O | M | O | | added | | | [Note] | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | PLMN | N.A. | M | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | | operator | | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | Lawful | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | | I | | | | | | | ntercept | | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
NOTE: This component shall be present if the MT-LR is associated to either CS
call or PS session. If the MT-LR is associated with the CS call, the number
dialled by UE is used. Otherwise if the MT-LR is associated with the PS
session, the APN-NI is used.
###### ## Annex C (Informative): Pseudo external ID
In case that UE\'s privacy profile is stored and is checked in the GMLC
(H-GMLC) or in the PPR, a pseudo-external identity may be selected as a result
of the privacy check in GMLC/PPR.
The pseudo-external identities may be set in the external LCS client list of
the HLR privacy exception list shown in Table 10.2. The pseudo-external
identity is not the identity of real external LCS client but the identity
which is used for notifying SGSN/MSC of the location request class
(call/session related or non-related) and the required type of indication for
each class. Operator allocates E.164 addresses for the pseudo-external
identities. The pseudo-external identities are used for interworking with pre
Rel-6 serving nodes.
Fourteen pseudo-external identities shall be defined. The pseudo-external
identities are summarized in the Table C.1.
Table C.1: Pseudo-external identities
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | Privacy setting for | Privacy setting for | | identity | Call/Session related | Call/Session | | | class | unrelated class | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | N.A. | Location allowed | | identity 1 | | without notification | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | N.A. | Location allowed | | identity 2 | | with notification | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | N.A. | Location with | | identity 3 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location allowed if | | | | no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | N.A. | Location with | | identity 4 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location restricted | | | | if no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | Location with | Location not allowed | | identity 5 | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location restricted | | | | if no response | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | Location with | Location not allowed | | identity 6 | notification and | | | | privacy | | | Indicator 6 | verification; | | | | location allowed if | | | | no response | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | | Location with | | identity 7 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location restricted | | | | if no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | Location allowed | Location not allowed | | identity 8 | with notification | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | | Location with | | identity 9 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location restricted | | | | if no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | | Location with | | identity 10 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location allowed if | | | | no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | Location allowed | Location not allowed | | identity 11 | without notification | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | | Location with | | identity 12 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location restricted | | | | if no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | | Location with | | identity 13 | | notification and | | | | privacy | | | | verification; | | | | location allowed if | | | | no response | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Pseudo-external | | Location allowed | | identity 14 | | with notification | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE: There are five privacy settings shown in Annex A.1 for each class
(call/session unrelated class and call/session related class), so there are
twenty-five possible combinations of the privacy settings. However, as shown
in Annex A.2, even if the call/session related class criteria is met, the
privacy setting for call/session unrelated class is selected when the privacy
setting for the call/session unrelated class is looser than the privacy
setting for the call/session related class. Therefore the twenty-five
combinations can be reduced to the above fourteen combinations.
If the UE subscribes to the universal or PLMN class, H-GMLC/PPR sends the
pseudo external identity 1 to the serving nodes.
Usage of the pseudo-external identities are as follows:
\- The pseudo-external identities are registered in SLPP of the HLR/HSS.
\- The SLPP is sent to the serving nodes, during the Insert Subscriber Data
procedures.
\- After the privacy check in the H-GMLC/PPR, the H-GMLC/PPR selects an
appropriate pseudo-external identity according to the required privacy related
actions (i.e. checking the on-going call/session and/or
notification/verification procedures) in the serving node.
\- H-GMLC sends Provide Subscriber Location message to the serving node, which
includes the pseudo-external identity instead of the real external client
identity. The real external client identity may be included in the additional
information element and is sent to serving node. The pseudo-external identity
is sent to the serving node directly from H-GMLC or via V-GMLC.
Table C.2 and C.3 shows how the pseudo-external identities are set in the SLPP
in HLR/HSS.

The selection of pseudo-external identity is based on the result of the
privacy check in the H-GMLC/PPR. Table C.4 shows the relation between privacy
check result and the pseudo-external identities.

###### ## Annex D (normative): including Requestor identity to LCS client name
In case the MSC/SGSN or the UE is pre Rel-5 then there is no possibility to
send the Requestor identity to the UE in a new separate parameter. To obtain
this backward compatibility the GMLC can add the Requestor identity to LCS
client name.
In order to offer best possible service for the end user the UE should be able
to differentiate LCS client name and Requestor ID when they are included in to
a same parameter. Also it is important that the LCS client name and the
Requestor ID are separated with a consistent manner. Therefore there is a need
to define a rule how the GMLC should separate LCS client name and Requestor
identity. In the box below is described the practice how the LCS client name
and Requestor identity should be separated.
* * *
_LCS clientName_ ==_RequestorIdentity_
* * *
LCS client name and Requestor identity are separated with two equal signs.
NOTE: It is possible that the Requestor identity does not fit into the LCS
client name field. In that case as many characters as possible from the
beginning is added to the LCS client name field.
###### ## Annex E (Informative): Handling of pseudonyms in location services
There is a requirement in place on anonymity for both the requestor and the
target in the LCS Stage 1, TS22.071, and there are or will be regulatory
requirements to support anonymity in location services in some countries. It
is seen as a basic service requirement that the user should be able to request
anonymity at will.
There are various methods available for providing anonymity-support for LCS.
One model has been described by the GSM Association in the LS in TD S2-021104
to 3GPP. In short, GSMA\'s model introduces the following logical
architecture.
Figure E.1: GSMA logical model to support anonymity
In this PUSH model the pseudonym of the target UE is always generated for
certain LCS clients on behalf of the terminal\'s subscriber without a specific
request.
The PUSH model describes the case when the target UE requests its own location
using e.g. SMS or WAP. SMS and WAP functions currently have problems in
supporting anonymity, because the SMS/WAP gateways forward the originating
MSISDN to the receiver. This weakness may be resolved in practise e.g. such
that the SMS or WAP Gateway requests pseudonyms from a common device (PMD), as
shown in Figure E.1. In this process the gateway requests a pseudonym from PMD
in signalling step 2 and in signalling step 3 the gateway uses the pseudonym
in the service request that it sends to the LCS client. The gateway includes
the requesting terminal\'s verinym, i.e. the MSISDN, in the service response
it sends to the terminal in step 9. In this way the LCS client only knows the
pseudonym of the terminal and not the verinym. This solution is not LCS
specific, since the SMS/WAP gateway inserts pseudonyms in all SMS/WAP
messages, which the gateway forwards to the receivers (LCS clients) defined by
the operator in advance.
The Liberty Alliance Project has standardized methods that can be used to
ensure the anonymity of the target UE in location services using pseudonyms as
shown by the example in Figure E.2 below. The specifications of the Liberty
Alliance project are publicly available at http://www.projectliberty.org/.
Figure E.2: Logical model to support anonymity
In this PULL model the LCS client requests the pseudonym from the Gateway
before accepting the service request from the terminal. The proxy/gateway is a
so-called Liberty Enabled Client/Proxy, which also may support standard WAP
proxy/gateway functions as described in the appropriate WAP Forum
specifications.
1\. The terminal (UE) sends a standard Wireless Transport Protocol (WTP)
\--request to the Proxy/Gateway.
2\. The proxy/gateway converts the service request into an HTTP-request with a
dynamic IP address. This HTTP-request does not contain the MSISDN of the
terminal, so it is totally anonymous to the LCS-client.
3\. The LCS-client needs to get an assertion, i.e. a pseudonym, before it can
accept to provide location services to the terminal, so it sends a HTTP-
response to the Proxy/Gateway, which includes a request for a pseudonym.
4\. The proxy/gateway maps the LCS client\'s HTTP-response to the HTTP-request
it sent in step 2 and thus the proxy/gateway also knows to which terminal the
LCS client\'s HTTP-response is related. The proxy/gateway intercepts and
interprets the HTTP-response and finds the pseudonym request. It forwards the
pseudonym request to PMD and attaches the terminal\'s MSISDN to allow the PMD
to provide a pseudonym related to this MSISDN. In case PMD needs to contact
the target UE user for some reason, e.g. to ask for consent to deliver the
pseudonym to this specific LCS-client, this interaction is fully supported in
the Liberty Enabled Client/Proxy specification.
5\. The proxy/gateway sends an HTTP-request containing the pseudonym to the
LCS-client.
6\. The LCS-client sends a location service request to GMLC using the
pseudonym of the target terminal.
7\. The PMD may include the MSISDN in the pseudonym by encrypting it in such a
way that GMLC is able to determine the MSISDN itself and in such a case step 7
is not needed. In case GMLC cannot find out the verinym of the terminal
itself, it requests from PMD the MSISDN that corresponds to the pseudonym it
received from the LCS-client.
8\. GMLC provides location information to the LCS-client using the pseudonym
of the target terminal.
9\. The LCS-client sends an HTTP-response to the proxy/gateway containing the
requested location specific service content.
10\. The proxy/gateway maps the response to the outstanding request sent in
step 1 and delivers the result to the correct terminal using MSISDN.
Note that the mechanism described above is a generalized solution to the
problem of transporting something from party 1 (PMD) to party 3 (GMLC) so that
intermediate party 2 (LCS-client) cannot find out the real content transferred
between party 1 and party 3 (verinym in this case). Also note that since the
proxy/gateway does not push any pseudonym in step 2, it is not required to
understand the destination application and what information it may need. Step
3 allows any application to request a pseudonym or any information it may
need, thus making this a generalized solution, which may be used for many
types of applications, not only LCS.
It is to be noted that the Liberty release 1.1 specification has been
carefully studied by the EU article 29 committee and found to be in accordance
with the current EU privacy requirements. It is stressed, however, that it is
the responsibility of someone implementing or deploying a system in accordance
with the Liberty Alliance specifications to comply with EU directives and
requirements on privacy.
For roaming cases chapter 9.1.1 in this specification describes the cases
where the pseudonym contains the address(es) of the target UE\'s Home-GMLC so
that the Requesting-GMLC can forward the location request to H-GMLC, which may
determine the corresponding verinym itself or request the verinym from its
associated PMD.
###### ## Annex F (Informative): Mechanism for performing Change of Area Event
Detection
Note: the classification (i.e. normative or informative) of this Annex is FFS.
As described in section 9.1.9 that there may be alternative mechanisms to
transfer the deferred MT-LR with Area Event request to the UE. This annex
illustrates one mechanism. In this mechanism a Short Message Service (SMS) is
used to transfer, to the UE/(U)SIM, the Area event detection request via an
(U)SIM Application Toolkit application.
# F.1 (U)SIM Application Toolkit (USAT) Based Solution
In this (U)SAT based solution, the area event detection mechanism relies on
the proactive control of the UE by the (U)SIM using the (U)SAT commands
controlled by a specific Change of Area Deferred Location application. Figure
F.1 illustrates one possible method for downloading a change of area event
application to the UE, but does not detail the operation of the application.
The details of the application is outside the scope of this specification.
Further information about the possible (U)SAT commands, can be found from TS
31.111.
The following procedure (shown in Figure F.1) replaces Figure 9.6d in clause
9.1.9.
Figure F.1: (U)SAT Application Download and Change of Area Event Detection
Procedure
1) This step is the same as step 1 in clause 9.1.9.
2) This step is similar to step 2 in clause 9.1.9, except the LCS Service
Request does not reach the V-GMLC. Also the H-GMLC may request a translation
of geographic shape to network identities from a GMLC in the network serving
the target UE.
3) Information about the event, the (U)SAT application, that shall trigger the
sending of the Location Report shall be sent to the UE/(U)SIM. If privacy
action (notification and/or verification) was requested as a result of the
privacy check, the H-GMLC shall also include the required action to the
UE/(U)SIM. If notification/verification is required, the request shall
indicate the identity of the LCS client, the Requestor Identity (if
available), and the reference number. The mechanism by which the trigger
detection is performed via (U)SAT application may be operator dependent.
However, the (U)SAT Application shall contain the following information:
reference number, H-GMLC address, validity period of request, and the area
definition (of the target area).
4) If privacy verification was requested, the UE/(U)SIM indicates to its user
whether the location request will be allowed or not allowed in the absence of
a response and waits for the user to grant or deny permission. If privacy
verification was requested and the user grants permission, the USAT
Application shall be installed and the UE/(U)SIM then returns an
acknowledgement to the H-GMLC indicating permission is granted and (U)SAT
application is successfully installed. If the UE user does not respond after a
predetermined time period (and the request is not allowed in the absence of a
response) or denies permission, the UE/(U)SIM shall infer a \"no response\"
condition, the USAT Application is not installed, an appropriate error
response is returned to the GMLC/LCS Client and the remaining steps are
skipped. Otherwise the UE/(U)SIM notifies the UE user of the location request
(if required by the privacy action) and shall install the (U)SAT application
and acknowledge successful installation to the H-GMLC, including an indication
of \"no response\" but request is allowed if necessary. If at any point the
(U)SAT application fails to install, due to lack of support or otherwise, the
UE/(U)SIM shall inform the H-GMLC using an appropriate error cause.
5) The H-GMLC returns a LCS Service Response via R-GMLC to the LCS Client to
notify whether the request was successfully accepted/installed or not, without
a location estimate. When the R-GMLC returns the LCS Service Response to the
LCS Client, the LDR reference number assigned by the R-GMLC shall be included.
6) The UE/(U)SIM detects the desired change of area event.
7) The UE/(U)SIM reports the change of area event.
8) The H-GMLC may perform another privacy check as described in clause 9.1.1.
9) The H-GMLC then returns a LCS Service Response to the LCS Client via the
R-GMLC, if applicable, as in 9.1.1. When the R-GMLC returns the LCS Service
Response to the LCS Client, the LDR reference number that was sent to the LCS
Client in step 5 shall be included. If the GMLC for some other reason decides
to not wait any longer for the requested event to occur (e.g. timer expires),
an LCS Service Response shall be returned with an appropriate error cause
indicating termination of the deferred location request.
H-GMLC may be the origination point of the SMS-DELIVER and the USAT
Application messages.
