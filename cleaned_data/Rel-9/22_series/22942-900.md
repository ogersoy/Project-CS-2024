# 5 Requirements
## 5.1 Suggested high level requirements
The VAS-SMS shall be implemented without influencing the existing SMS service.
The VAS-SMS shall be implemented without depending on the terminal's
capability.
Users shall be able to register, activate, deactivate, withdraw and
reconfigure VAS-SMS via the UE, or web portals.
The VAS-SMS shall be designed and implemented in a way to provide users who
joined the services one coherent and identical user experience, regardless of
the SM flow and SM scenario (e.g. messages to and from applications, MO-MT in
an in network and MT from Foreign Network).
## 5.2 Overall system requirements
### 5.2.1 Management of service information
\- Capabilities provided to the user
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request from an application to
query/change the choice of services for a subscriber.
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request from an application to
query/change the subscriber's preferences for a certain service, for example:
i) To add or delete or modify a subscriber's filtering conditions by which
VAS-SMScan refuse some of the subscriber's incoming messages.
ii) To modify a subscriber's signature that will be appended to an SM sent
from the subscriber.
**iii)** To modify a subscriber's forwarding address that substitutes for the
subscriber's original receiving address.
\- Capabilities provided to the network
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request to query/change the
subscriber's information, for example:
i) To get the detail information about the subscriber's service.
ii) To add or delete a subscriber's service information.
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request to query the handling results
of the subscription service.
### 5.2.2 Short Message processing
The VAS-SMS should be able to deal with the content of an SM, for example:
i) To insert content (as agreed with the subscriber) into the original SM and
form a new SM (e.g. append the signature to the SM).
ii) To compile an SM by containing operator's information (e.g. construct a
delivery report).
**iii)** To use certain words in an SM as the filtering criteria.
The VAS-SMS should be able to convert the format of an SM into other formats
(e.g. email, WAP message, etc).
### 5.2.3 Short Message forwarding
With the advent of SM forwarding there is also the issue of how to handle the
situation when a user by mistake sets forwarding to wrong number (a number
that is in use). Ideally a recipient should be capable of stopping the
delivery of such SM to its own address. As a minimum the recipient's operator
should be capable of identifying forwarded SM and stop delivery.
Infinite forwarding loops needs to be prevented.
### 5.2.4 Short Message network storage
It should be possible for the operator to support Short Message Network
Storage to allow users to store the messages in the network.
It should be possible for users to store the messages in the network based on
their personal settings (e.g. store all sent & received messages, store the
messages from/to particular users, store the messages sent & received in a
specified period of time etc).
It should be possible for users to store and manage the messages for their
preference (e.g. users can set different folders to store different sort of
messages, therefore it is convenient to inquire the stored messages based on
message sort or key words).
It should be possible for the operator to ensure all relevant information of
the messages stored in the network are consistent with that displayed to
users, e.g. content of the messages, sender/recipient, sending/receiving time,
etc.

sent, i.e. to the original sender and to other recipients of the original
message.
### 5.2.6 Management and control of network based repository
VAS-SMS should be able to provide following capabilities to support network
based repository:
\- The VAS-SMS should allow configuring in such a way that certain sent or
received messages of a particular user can be stored persistently in a network
based repository.
\- The VAS-SMS should be able to support a request from SMS-SC to persistently
store a sent message in a network based repository at the time of sending.
\- The VAS-SMS should be able to support a request from an application to
upload certain messages into a network based repository for persistent
storage.
\- The VAS-SMS should be able to support a request from an application to
retrieve/delete certain messages stored in a network based repository
\- The VAS-SMS should be able to support a request from an application to view
the list of messages and related attributes (e.g. sender, recipient,
date/time, etc) in a network based repository
### 5.2.7 Addressing
The VAS-SMS should support different addressing formats to identify the sender
and recipient; it should support both MSISDN[3] and e-mail addressing
schemes[4].

specified in [2]).
The VAS-SMS should be able to submit one message to multiple recipients.
The VAS-SMS should be able to support the request to hide the sender's or
other recipients' addresses.
# 6 Requirements for service priority and interaction
The different rules of VAS-SMS priority and interaction are provided by
operator. For example, the priority order maybe as following:
\- SM Filtering
\- SM Network Storage
\- SM Forwarding
\- etc.
The VAS-SMS should be classified by priority and triggered according to
priority order.
The VAS-SMS should provide the capability to configure certain priority.
Caller SMS receipt has higher priority than Callee SMS Receipt service.
# 7 Quality of service
The quality of basic SMS service should not be affected by introducing the
VAS-SMS.
The following key performance for quality of VAS-SMS shall be kept consistent
with basic SMS. For example:
\- SMS delivery successful rate
\- authentication successful rate
\- end to end data loss rate
\- end to end data delay
\- charging successful rate
\- reliability of network and service
# 8 Charging aspects for VAS-SMS
The VAS-SMS shall provide accounting rules for accurate accounting. It shall
be able to support following charging aspects.
\- Charging Model
The VAS-SMS charging includes basic communication fee and special service fee.
Basic communication fee is paid for usage of network resource. CDR is
generated by SMSC. Special service fee is paid for usage of the VAS-SMS. CDR
is generated by the VAS-SMS system. Charging models of special service fee
shall include but not limit to the following items:
i) charging per VAS-SMS
ii) monthly basis
Per each service category, different charging models and rates should be
configurable for the special service fee.
\- Charging principle
The following principles shall be supported according to different service
categories:
i) VAS-SMS triggered by sending party -- basic communication fee and special
service fee are paid by the sending party.
ii) VAS-SMS services triggered by recipient -- basic communication fee is paid
by the sending party, whilst special service fee is paid by the recipient.
**iii) Charging only happens after** the status report has been received by
the SMSC.
\- Charging Scheme
The VAS-SMS shall support a standardized interface to transfer CDRs and other
charging related information between the VAS-SMS and the billing system for
prepaid and post-paid billing solutions.

Regulations.
# 10 Interworking
Interworking with existing messaging technologies and messaging services
should be supported.
The VAS-SMS should be able to send the content of an SM to a reachable
address, for example:
i) To send an email to email severs after converting the SM into an email.
ii) To send a WAP message to a WAP Push Gateway after converting the SM into a
WAP message.
**iii)** To send an SM to a subscriber by sending an SM to SMSC.
iv) To send an SM via IMS. Refer to MESSIW[5].
**v)** To send a delivery report .
# 11 Roaming
General roaming requirements should be compliant with roaming function of SMS.
The user should be able to experience the consistent VAS-SMS services whether
in home network or roaming.
# 12 Conclusions
The current TR is to study the requirements of value-added services for SMS,
which are the enhancement (or supplement) of normal GSM short message service
requirements.
It is proposed that after finalization of the present TR 22.942, 3GPP should
be asked to take the responsibility to create the stage 1 technical
specification
The architecture and protocol of various value-added services listed in TR
22.942 shall be consistent with each other. This should be followed by Stage 2
work on VAS4SMS in 3GPP.
