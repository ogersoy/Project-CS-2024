# Introduction
Conversational voice and audio services are among the most important ones in
3GPP mobile business. Switch from narrowband to wideband speech audio with
AMR-WB is an important improvement step for these services. In order to keep
high value in such services, Rel-10 and the new EPS system give an opportunity
for a next major step in voice and audio enhancement, particularly for very
high audio quality suited to the increasing mixed music/speech content.
The Evolved Packet System (EPS) is an evolution of the 3GPP architecture to a
higher-data-rate, lower-latency packet-optimized system that supports various
radio-access technologies. The EPS architecture has been optimized for mobile
broadband services, in particular enriched and new multimedia services. The
EPS system is an enabler for providing conversational services with very high
audio quality, including **enhanced voice** and mixed content quality.
This document aims at **studying use cases which may benefit from improved**
audio quality **for EPS services** and examining the need for enhanced
codecs**. The related system and service requirements** are discussed.
# 1 Scope
This study defines and analyses the new use cases in the environment of EPS
and its future services. It evaluates how much the newly defined requirements
are met by the already available codecs in 3GPP releases prior to Rel-10.
Potential new requirements for voice codecs are elaborated in due course.
Specifically, the objective of this study item is to:
  * **Identify service and system requirements,**
  * **Identify high level requirements,**
  * **Assess the existing codecs in respect to identified requirements,**
  * **Define a strategy for EPS voice codec(s) standardization**
  * **Identify some use cases for enhanced voice** and mixed content conversational multimedia service **for EPS (see Annex A).**
Starting from Rel-8 timeframe, MTSI as a conversational multimedia service is
provided over EPS. MTSI is the main service for which the enhancements are
targeted. This does not however exclude the enhanced service requirements from
being later adopted to other services where such enhancements are needed and
are found suitable.

> 4 Overview on the EPS service objectives and characteristics
## 4.1 EPS objectives
EPS objectives indicate the potential for new enhanced voice services. As EPS
will provide higher data rates, lower latency and enhanced QoS, voice services
can obviously be developed to take advantage of those features.
Furthermore, since EPS is a packet-optimised system, it will introduce
flexibility in codec functionality and voice service provision, but also
requires consideration regarding e.g. jitter and error concealment.
## 4.2 EPS requirements
EPS service requirements introduce interworking with variety of broadband
networks as well as PS services provided on Rel-9 and earlier. In addition,
EPS will be interworking with CS services. These requirements envision
backwards compatibility requirements also for voice services.
## 4.3 EPS Enhanced Voice Service
Enhanced Voice Service (EVS) is used in this TR to refer to the targeted
enhancements. The intention of this TR is to assess the existing voice
services against the requirements (identified in this TR). The enhancements
will be justified if the requirements cannot be met by the existing 3GPP
services.
There are no specific 'Enhanced Voice Service' or 'Voice Service' definitions
in 3GPP. The term 'EVS' is used for the purposes of this TR to refer to the
enhancements within each relevant 3GPP service (such as MTSI) as shown in Fig.
1.
In addition to other enhancements, improved narrowband and wideband quality
should be offered by the EVS but it is not intended that EVS will replace the
existing narrowband and wideband media types or codec formats.
The EVS codec will support the AMR-WB codec format as a subset of the coding
formats supported by it. See details in Clause 6.1.6. The AMR-WB interoperable
operation modes of the EVS codec become an alternative implementation for AMR-
WB operation provided that the enhancements are consistently significant.
# 5 System and service requirements
The enhanced voice services for EPS should fulfill the system and service
requirements described in the following sub-sections.
## 5.1 Quality of user experience
Enhanced voice services in the EPS should allow for significantly improved
quality of user experience compared to voice services enabled by pre-Rel-10
3GPP access systems, considering the advancement of other communication
systems. It should be possible to achieve significantly better service quality
than is possible with both Rel-9 3GPP narrowband and wideband voice services.
User experience is also impacted by the consistency of the quality experienced
by the user under varying access and core network conditions. Under varying
network conditions the user experience should be better than in pre-Rel-10 by
the means of EVS. The improvement of the end-to-end quality should address all
parts of the transmission chain.
## 5.2 Efficiency
Enhanced voice services in the EPS should be deployable in an efficient
manner. Enhanced voice services should address the efficient use of the
transmission resource in EPS access and transport networks as well as the
possibility to implement the new services on low-cost devices and network
equipment with limited computational resource. With regard to transmission
efficiency, it should exceed that of the pre-Rel-10 3GPP wideband voice
service.
## 5.3 Backward service interoperability with pre-Rel-10 3GPP networks and
devices
Transcoding generates additional network effort (e.g. costs, transcoding
gateways), degrades audio quality and increases latency. Transcoding-based
solutions for ensuring service interoperability should be avoided as much as
possible.
Besides, conference call may interconnect subscribers using enhanced quality
services equipped with new enhanced devices and users with \"old/legacy\"
terminals. The best possible quality should be delivered to all participants.
If transcoding cannot be avoided, voice conversational quality degradation
should be as limited as possible.
6 High level technical requirements on speech codecs
In the below, high-level technical requirement topics are listed. This list is
not exclusive.
6.1 Design constraints
## Audio bandwidth {#audio-bandwidth .Titre-2-+-Gauche-:--0-cm}
It is recommended that the EVS codec
  * have mandatory support of high-quality and high-efficiency operation of NB, WB, and SWB audio;
  * may support FB audio.
Note: NB audio is typically sampled at 8 kHz with an audio bandwidth of 100 --
3500 Hz. WB audio is typically sampled at 16 kHz with an audio bandwidth of 50
-- 7000 Hz. SWB audio is typically sampled at 32 kHz with an audio bandwidth
of 50 -- 14000 Hz. FB audio typically provides an audio bandwidth up to 20000
Hz.
{#section-3 .Titre-2-+-Gauche-:--0-cm}
  1. Number of audio channels
Stereo or multi-channel presentation is one way to realize significantly
improved QoE. The codec may provide stereo/ multi-channel coding capability.
Multiple monophonic coding, i.e. one monophonic coding per channel, can be
realized by appropriate packetization techniques while stereo/multi-channel
coding, i.e. joint coding of the channels, is part of the audio coder
algorithm. The choice of whether using dedicated stereo/multi-channel coding
or multiple monophonic codings depends on a trade-off between achievable
quality, available bit rates, available delay, complexity and other
implementation factors.
> If stereo/multi-channel coding capability is provided, it is necessary to
> specify how stereo or multi-channel capture/presentations could be achieved
> in mobile communications.
## Bit rates {#bit-rates .Titre-2-+-Gauche-:--0-cm}
It is recommended that the codec shall span a large range of bit rates from
low rates needed for high efficiency conversational speech services to high
rates required for EVS with high quality operation. It is recommended that the
offered span of bit rates shall be wide enough to allow for rate adaptation in
response to available transmission resource.
## Algorithmic delay {#algorithmic-delay .Titre-2-+-Gauche-:--0-cm}
The codec delay requirement for the EVS codec is recommended to be flexible
within certain limits, allowing for overall optimizations of the system
performance and considering that there is a trade-off between delay consumed
by the speech codec and delay consumed by the PS transmission via the LTE air
interface.
The delay requirements should be the same regardless of the nature of the
input content (e.g. speech, music and mixed content).
The algorithmic delay of the EVS codec should be such that the overall end-to-
end delay in an EVS-UE to EVS-UE connection meets or exceeds the preferred
performance expectations in 3GPP TS 22.105. According to 3GPP TS 22.105
v9.0.0, conversational voice one way delay is \ 8 Strategy for EPS\'s codec(s) standardization
This TR focuses on the identification and definition of **service and system**
requirements **and** high level codec requirements that should be met for the
"enhanced voice services". An EVS codec meeting these requirements allows for
substantially enhanced voice services over what is possible with pre-Rel-10
3GPP codecs.
It is recommended that 3GPP now define and start the EVS codec development
work item with the target to meet the requirements and recommendations set in
this TR.
###### ### Annex A: Use cases
Consensus was not reached regarding the relevance of the following use cases
to this TR. Furthermore, some use cases description are considered incomplete.
## A.1 High quality audio conferencing over heterogeneous networks and with
different terminals
Among the different use cases related to voice services, the high quality
audio conferencing scenario over heterogeneous networks and with different
terminals, described more in details below, is a relevant scenario considered
for this study item for the following reasons:
  * It is one of the most demanding for enhanced quality of service and high voice quality because of longer duration of conference calls.
  * It requires interoperability and flexibility since audio conferencing service may interconnect different users connected from different access networks and devices.
The use case describes the scenario of a multipoint audio conferencing session
with N participants over EPS.
The participants are connected over heterogeneous access networks that include
3GPP access (e.g. E-UTRAN) and non-3GPP access networks, like WiMAX, WLAN,
cdma2000®, PSTN..., with different QoS (bit rate, delay, packet loss, and
jitter). They are also supposed to be in a situation of mobility between
different access networks. They are participating using different types of
terminals and in different environments (home, office, car, train...). Such
terminals have different capabilities in terms of:
  * Supported codecs: new terminals support the EPS\'s codec(s) but old terminals can still participate in the conference even with only 3GPP pre-EPS codec(s).
The following examples are some possibilities illustrating the diversity of
the participation environment conditions:
  * User **A** with PC terminal connected to WLAN.
  * User **B** with a laptop terminal working outside and connected to its home network (e.g. non 3GPP defined).
  * User **C** with a 3G/EPS hand held terminal in car connected through the LTE access network. This participant is supposed to continue seamlessly the participation in the conference call when arriving to his office but using e.g. WLAN connection.
  * User **D** with 2G or 3G terminal in train connected through GSM/GPRS/EDGE or UMTS with noisy background.
    1. Two-party communication \-----------------------
The most typical and most important use case, where the end-user has high
expectations regarding the perceived audio quality, is conversational voice
communication between two parties (e.g. Multimedia telephony).
Within the scope of 3GPP systems, the most likely case is that at least one of
the involved terminals is a mobile terminal. Mobile terminals can in many
cases be assumed to be used in mobile environments with certain ambient noise
level. Also, it is likely that the mobile terminals will be used in hand-held
mode using the built-in microphones and loudspeakers, or with a monaural
mobile handsfree set. It is however notable that there is a technology trend
significantly enhancing the acoustic front-ends of mobile terminals. It can
hence be assumed that there are an increasing number of cases in which the
mobile terminal provides fullband and stereo (or multi-channel) capabilities.
Furthermore, such cases can be regarded typical for fixed line, PC, or IPTV
terminals. To optimize the end-user experience, during the codec negotiation a
wideband codec should be prioritized over a narrowband codec. The network
operator policy can override the codec negotiation.
## A.3 Interoperability with pre-Rel-10 3GPP systems {#a.3-interoperability-
with-pre-rel-10-3gpp-systems .list-paragraph}
Today, 3GPP systems have a subscriber base counting in billions. The
introduction of EPS can hence only be gradual and interoperation with pre-
Rel-10 systems and terminal equipment as well with Rel-10 equipment not
supporting EPS is a likely use case still for many years to come.
Although multiple methods to achieve interoperation may exist, the selected
method of interoperation should ensure the highest possible quality for the
end user relative to other possible methods of interoperation.
## A.4 Mobility scenarios {#a.4-mobility-scenarios .list-paragraph}
By their nature mobile terminals are likely to move during a session. Together
with the fact that EPS will not have 100% coverage from its first roll-out
this means that there is a high likelihood for handovers between cells with
EPS support and cells without. Cells without are cells with only CS or legacy
pre-Rel-10 PS access type. This scenario is likely to happen both with mobiles
participating in two-party as well as in multi-party communication use cases.
For mobile terminals which camps in EPS the services continuity as described
in 3GPP TS 22.278 [2] applies.
## A.5 Call Hold and (Explicit) Call transfer {#a.5-call-hold-and-explicit-
call-transfer .list-paragraph}
These are supplementary services defined in [2],[3]. The call hold service
allows a served mobile subscriber (subscriber A) to interrupt communication on
an existing active call (with subscriber B), to place another call (with
subscriber C) and, if desired, to re-establish the original communication.
The ECT supplementary service enables the served mobile subscriber (subscriber
A) who has two calls, each of which can be an incoming or outgoing call, to
connect the other parties in the two calls (subscribers B and C) and release
the served mobile subscribers own connection.
In both of these supplementary services it is possible scenario that one of
the calls established with subscriber A is an enhanced EPS voice service while
the other is a legacy 3GPP wideband or narrowband voice service.
## A.6 Voice-mail service {#a.6-voice-mail-service .list-paragraph}
A typical use case of voice mail service is that a first user A establishes a
call to a voice-mail server and leaves a message for some other user B. Later
user B connects to the server and listens to the message. One likely case is
that the terminals of both users are of different capabilities.
## A.7 Access to network media server content {#a.7-access-to-network-media-
server-content .list-paragraph}
An increasing number of conversational services between two or multiple
parties include access to media servers which put requirements on music and
mixed content (speech + music) quality. This use case involves server-based
media access like:
  * Calling participants of a conference call are listening music on hold waiting for the conference call organizer to open the bridge.
  * User is provided with a mixed content (speech + music) message (informative or advertising) from a multimedia server while waiting for the end user to answer.
## A.8 Music on hold
At present, music while on hold offers little more to the user than providing
an indication that the call has not dropped. EPS is an opportunity to provide
music on hold, of comparable quality to multimedia streaming, to improve user
experience.
