## 3.4 Test tolerances
The requirements given in the present document make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 36.521-3 [23] defines the test
tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The test tolerances are then added to the limits in this specification to
create test limits. The measurement results are compared against the test
limits as defined by the shared risk principle.
Shared Risk is defined in [ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5].
# 4 E-UTRAN RRC_IDLE state mobility
## 4.1 Cell Selection
After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the Cell selection
process takes place, as described in TS36.304. This process allows the UE to
select a suitable cell where to camp on in order to access available services.
In this process the UE can use stored information (_Stored information cell
selection_) or not (_Initial cell selection_).
## 4.2 Cell Re-selection
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable cell
and camp on it.
When the UE is in either _Camped_ _Normally_ state or _Camped on Any Cell_
state on a cell, the UE shall attempt to detect, synchronise, and monitor
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated by the serving
cell. For intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells the serving cell may not
provide explicit neighbour list but carrier frequency information and
bandwidth information only. UE measurement activity is also controlled by
measurement rules defined in TS36.304, allowing the UE to limit its
measurement activity.
### 4.2.2 Requirements
The UE shall search every layer of higher priority at least every
T~higher_priority_search~ = (60 * N~layers~) seconds, where N~layers~ is the
total number of configured higher priority E-UTRA, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD,
CDMA2000 1x and HRPD carrier frequencies and is additionally increased by one
if one or more groups of GSM frequencies is configured as a higher priority.
#### 4.2.2.1 Measurement and evaluation of serving cell
The UE shall measure the RSRP and RSRQ level of the serving cell and evaluate
the cell selection criterion S defined in [1] for the serving cell at least
every DRX cycle.
The UE shall filter the RSRP and RSRQ measurements of the serving cell using
at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the
filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by, at least DRX cycle/2.
If the UE has evaluated in N~serv~ consecutive DRX cycles that the serving
cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the
measurements of all neighbour cells indicated by the serving cell, regardless
of the measurement rules currently limiting UE measurement activities.
If the UE in RRC_IDLE has not found any new suitable cell based on searches
and measurements using the intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT
information indicated in the system information for 10 s, the UE shall
initiate cell selection procedures for the selected PLMN as defined in [1].

#### 4.2.2.2 Void
#### 4.2.2.3 Measurements of intra-frequency E-UTRAN cells
The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform RSRP
and RSRQ measurements of identified intra-frequency cells without an explicit
intra-frequency neighbour list containing physical layer cell identities.
The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable intra-frequency
cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS36.304 within
T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ when that Treselection= 0 . An intra frequency cell is
considered to be detectable if:
\- RSRP\|~dBm~ [>]{.underline} -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 21,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -123 dBm for Band 9 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥
-4 dB,
\- SCH_RP\|~dBm~ [>]{.underline} -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19,
21, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
> \- SCH_RP\|~dBm~≥-123 dBm for Band 9 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 and SCH
> Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB.
The UE shall measure RSRP and RSRQ at least every T~measure,EUTRAN_Intra~ (see
table 4.2.2.3-1) for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured
according to the measurement rules.
The UE shall filter RSRP and RSRQ measurements of each measured intra-
frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements
used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
T~measure,EUTRAN_Intra~/2
The UE shall not consider a E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of
the serving cell.
For an intra-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that has not
been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that the intra-frequency cell has met reselection criterion
defined [1] within T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_intra~ when T~reselection~ = 0 as
specified in table 4.2.2.3-1 provided that the cell is at least 3dB better
ranked. When evaluating cells for reselection, the side conditions for RSRP
and SCH apply to both serving and non-serving intra-frequency cells.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the intra-frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this intra-
frequency cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.4 Measurements of inter-frequency E-UTRAN cells
The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform RSRP or
RSRQ measurements of identified inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency
information is provided by the serving cell, even if no explicit neighbour
list with physical layer cell identities is provided.
If Srxlev > S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal > S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the UE
shall search for inter-frequency layers of higher priority at least every
T~higher_priority_search~ where T~higher_priority_search~ is described in
section 4.2.2.
If Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the UE shall
search for and measure inter-frequency layers of higher, equal or lower
priority in preparation for possible reselection. In this scenario, the
minimum rate at which the UE is required to search for and measure higher
priority layers shall be the same as that defined below.
The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable inter-frequency
cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS36.304 within K~carrier~ *
T~detect,EUTRAN_Inter~ if at least carrier frequency information is provided
for inter-frequency neighbour cells by the serving cells when T~reselection~ =
0 provided that the reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 5dB
for reselections based on ranking or 6dB for RSRP reselections based on
absolute priorities or 4dB for RSRQ reselections based on absolute priorities.
The parameter K~carrier~ is the number of E-UTRA inter-frequency carriers
indicated by the serving cell. An inter-frequency cell is considered to be
detectable if:
\- RSRP\|~dBm~ ≥ -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 21, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -123 dBm for Bands 9 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥
-4 dB,
\- SCH_RP\|~dBm~ ≥ -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 21, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
> \- SCH_RP\|~dBm~≥-123 dBm for Band 9 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 and SCH
> Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB.
When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall
be measured at least every T~measure,E-UTRAN_Inter~ . If, after detecting a
cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell
to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell. If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity
is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to perform
measurements on that cell.
The UE shall measure RSRP or RSRQ at least every K~carrier~ *
T~measure,EUTRAN_Inter~ (see table 4.2.2.4-1) for identified lower or equal
priority inter-frequency cells. If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell
whose physical identity is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell, the UE is not
required to perform measurements on that cell.
The UE shall filter RSRP or RSRQ measurements of each measured higher, lower
and equal priority inter-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within
the set of measurements used for the filtering, at least two measurements
shall be spaced by at least T~measure,EUTRAN_Inter~/2.
The UE shall not consider a E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of
the serving cell.
For an inter-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that has not
been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that the inter-frequency cell has met reselection criterion
defined TS 36.304 within K~carrier~ * T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_Inter~ when
T~reselection~ = 0 as specified in table 4.2.2.4-1 provided that the
reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 5dB for reselections based
on ranking or 6dB for RSRP reselections based on absolute priorities or 4dB
for RSRQ reselections based on absolute priorities. When evaluating cells for
reselection, the side conditions for RSRP and SCH apply to both serving and
inter-frequency cells.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this inter-
frequency cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.5 Measurements of inter-RAT cells
If Srxlev > S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal > S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the UE
shall search for inter-RAT layers of higher priority at least every
T~higher_priority_search~ where T~higher_priority_search~ is described in
section 4.2.2
If Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the UE shall
search for and measure inter-RAT layers of higher, lower priority in
preparation for possible reselection. In this scenario, the minimum rate at
which the UE is required to search for and measure higher priority inter-RAT
layers shall be the same as that defined below for lower priority RATs.
##### 4.2.2.5.1 Measurements of UTRAN FDD cells
When the measurement rules indicate that UTRA FDD cells are to be measured,
the UE shall measure CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP of detected UTRA FDD cells in
the neighbour frequency list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this
section. The parameter N~UTRA_carrier~ is the number of carriers in the
neighbour frequency list. The UE shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP
measurements of each measured UTRA FDD cell using at least 2 measurements.
Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at least two
measurements shall be spaced by at least half the minimum specified
measurement period.
The UE shall evaluate whether newly detectable UTRA FDD cells have met the
reselection criteria in TS 36.304 within time (N~UTRA_carrier~) *
T~detectUTRA_FDD~ when Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤
S~nonIntraSearchQ~ when Treselection~RAT~ = 0 provided that the reselection
criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB for reselections based on RSCP, or
a margin of at least 3dB for reselections based on Ec/Io.
Cells which have been detected shall be measured at least every
(N~UTRA_carrier~) * T~measureUTRA_FDD~ when Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or
Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~.
When higher priority UTRA FDD cells are found by the higher priority search,
they shall be measured at least every T~measure,UTRA_FDD~. If, after detecting
a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell
to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell.
For a cell that has been already detected, but that has not been reselected
to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating
that an already identified UTRA FDD cell has met reselection criterion defined
in 3GPP TS 36.304 [1] within (N~UTRA_carrier~) * T~evaluateUTRA_FDD~ when
T~reselection~ = 0 as speficied in table 4.2.2.5.1-1 provided that the
reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB for reselections based
on RSCP, or a margin of at least 3dB for reselections based on Ec/Io.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the UTRA FDD cell is
satisfied with the reselection criteria which are defined in [1], the UE shall
evaluate this UTRA FDD cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains
satisfied with the reselection criteria within this duration, then the UE
shall reselect that cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.2 Measurements of UTRAN TDD cells
When the measurement rules indicate that UTRA TDD cells are to be measured,
the UE shall measure P-CCPCH RSCP of detected UTRA TDD cells in the neighbour
frequency list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this section. The
parameter N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~ is the number of carriers used in the neighbour
frequency list. The UE shall filter P-CCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured
UTRA TDD cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements
used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
half the minimum specified measurement period. P-CCPCH RSCP of UTRAN TDD cells
shall not be filtered over a longer period than that specified in table
4.2.2.5.2-1.
The UE shall evaluate whether newly detectable UTRA TDD cells have met the
reselection criteria in TS 36.304 within time (N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~) *
T~detectUTRA_TDD~ when Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤
S~nonIntraSearchQ~ when T~reselection~ = 0 provided that the reselection
criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB.
Cells which have been detected shall be measured at least every
(N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~) * T~measureUTRA_TDD~ Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or
Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~.
When higher priority UTRA TDD cells are found by the higher priority search,
they shall be measured at least every T~measure,UTRA_TDD~. If, after detecting
a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell
to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell.
For a cell that has been already detected, but that has not been reselected
to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating
that an already identified UTRA TDD cell has met reselection criterion defined
in [1] within N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~ *T~evaluateUTRA_TDD~ when T~reselection~ = 0
as specified in table 4.2.2.5.2-1 provided that the reselection criteria is
met by a margin of at least 6dB.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the UTRA TDD cell is
satisfied with the reselection criteria which are defined in [1], the UE shall
evaluate this UTRA TDD cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains
satisfied with the reselection criteria within this duration, then the UE
shall reselect that cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.3 Measurements of GSM cells
When the measurement rules defined in [1] indicate that E-UTRAN inter-
frequencies or inter-RAT frequency cells are to be measured, the UE shall
measure the signal level of the GSM BCCH carriers if the GSM BCCH carriers are
indicated in the measurement control system information of the serving cell.
GSM BCCH carriers of lower priority than the serving cell shall be measured at
least every T~measure,GSM~ (see table 4.2.2.5.3-1).
When higher priority GSM BCCH carriers are found by the higher priority
search, they shall be measured at least every T~measure,GSM,~ and the UE shall
decode the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier. If, after detecting a cell in a
higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not occurred
then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell to
evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection, or to continuously verify the
BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier every 30s. However, the minimum measurement
filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still be met by
the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell.
The UE shall maintain a running average of 4 measurements for each GSM BCCH
carrier. The measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as possible
uniformly distributed over the averaging period.
If continuous GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in [1],
the UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every 30 seconds for each of
the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers. If a change of BSIC is detected for one GSM
cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM neighbour cell.
If the UE detects on a BCCH carrier a BSIC which is indicated as not allowed
for that carrier in the measurement control system information of the serving
cell, the UE is not required to perform BSIC re-confirmation for that cell.
The UE shall not consider the GSM BCCH carrier in cell reselection, if the UE
cannot demodulate the BSIC of that GSM BCCH carrier. Additionally, the UE
shall not consider a GSM neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it is
indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of the
serving cell.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the GSM cell is satisfied
with the reselection criteria which are defined in [1], the UE shall evaluate
this GSM cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains satisfied with
the reselection criteria within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.4 Measurements of HRPD cells
In order to perform measurement and cell reselection to HRPD cell, the UE
shall acquire the timing of HRPD cells.
When the measurement rules indicate that HRPD cells are to be measured, the UE
shall measure CDMA2000 HRPD Pilot Strength of HRPD cells in the neighbour cell
list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this section.
The parameter 'Number of HRPD Neighbor Frequency', which is transmitted on
E-UTRAN BCCH, is the number of carriers used for all HRPD cells in the
neighbour cell list.
When the E-UTRA serving cell fulfils Srxlev > S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal >
S~nonIntraSearchQ,~ the UE shall search for CDMA2000 HRPD layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is defined in section 4.2.2.
For CDMA2000 HRPD cells which have been detected, the UE shall measure
CDMA2000 HRPD Pilot Strength at least every (Number of HRPD Neighbor
Frequency)*T~measureHRPD~, when the E-UTRA serving cell Srxlev ≤
S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~.
The UE shall be capable of evaluating that the CDMA2000 HRPD cell has met cell
reselection criterion defined in [1] within T~evaluateHRPD~.

If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the CDMA2000 HRPD cell is
satisfied with the reselection criteria which are defined in [1], the UE shall
evaluate this CDMA2000 HRPD cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell
remains satisfied with the reselection criteria within this duration, then the
UE shall reselect that cell.
##### 4.2.2.5.5 Measurements of cdma2000 1X
In order to perform measurement and cell reselection to cdma2000 1X cell, the
UE shall acquire the timing of cdma2000 1X cells.
When the measurement rules indicate that cdma2000 1X cells are to be measured,
the UE shall measure cdma2000 1x RTT Pilot Strength of cdma2000 1X cells in
the neighbour cell list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this
section.
The parameter 'Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbor Frequency', which is transmitted
on E-UTRAN BCCH, is the number of carriers used for all cdma2000 1X cells in
the neighbour cell list.
When the E-UTRA serving cell fulfils Srxlev > S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal >
S~nonIntraSearchQ~, the UE shall search for cdma2000 1X layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is defined in section 4.2.2.
For CDMA2000 1X cells which have been detected, the UE shall measure CDMA2000
1xRTT Pilot Strength at least every (Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbor
Frequency)*T~measureCDMA2000_1X~, when the E-UTRA serving cell Srxlev ≤
S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~. The UE shall be capable of
evaluating that the cdma2000 1X cell has met cell reselection criterion
defined in [1] within T~evaluateCDMA2000_1X~.

* * *
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the CDMA2000 1X cell is
satisfied with the reselection criteria which are defined in [1], the UE shall
evaluate this CDMA2000 1X cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell
remains satisfied with the reselection criteria within this duration, then the
UE shall reselect that cell.
#### 4.2.2.6 Evaluation of cell re-selection criteria
The UE shall evaluate the intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell
reselection criteria defined in [1] at least every DRX cycle. When a non zero
value of T~reselection~ is used, the UE shall only perform reselection on an
evaluation which occurs simultaneously to, or later than the expiry of the
T~reselection~ timer.
#### 4.2.2.7 Maximum interruption in paging reception
UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in monitoring
downlink channels for paging reception.
At intra-frequency and inter-frequency cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor
the downlink of serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to
start monitoring downlink channels of the target intra-frequency and inter-
frequency cell for paging reception. The interruption time shall not exceed
T~SI-EUTRA~ + 50 ms.
At inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink of serving
cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to start monitoring downlink
channels for paging reception of the target inter-RAT cell. For E-UTRAN to
UTRA cell re-selection the interruption time must not exceed T~SI-UTRA~ + 50
ms. For E-UTRAN to GSM cell re-selection the interruption time must not exceed
T~BCCH~ + 50 ms.
T~SI-EUTRA~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure
delay of system information blocks defined in [2] for a E-UTRAN cell.
T~SI-UTRA~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure
delay of system information blocks defined in [7] for a UTRAN cell.
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from a GSM cell defined
in [8].
These requirements assume sufficient radio conditions, so that decoding of
system information can be made without errors and does not take into account
cell re-selection failure.
At cell re-selection to HRPD, the UE shall monitor the downlink of serving
cell for paging reception until the UE is capable of starting to monitor
downlink channels for paging reception of the target HRPD cell. For HRPD cell
re-selection the interruption time must not exceed T~SI-HRPD~ + 50 ms.
T~SI-HRPD~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the upper layer
(Layer 3) procedure delay of system information blocks defined in [11] in for
HRPD cell.

cdma2000 1X cell.
#### 4.2.2.8 void
#### 4.2.2.9 UE measurement capability
For idle mode cell re-selection purposes, the UE shall be capable of
monitoring at least:
\- Intra-frequency carrier, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 3 FDD E-UTRA inter-frequency carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 3 TDD E-UTRA inter-frequency carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 3 TDD UTRA carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 GSM carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 3 cdma2000 1x carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 3 HRPD carriers.
_In addition to the requirements defined above,_ a UE supporting E-UTRA
measurements in RRC_IDLE state shall be capable of monitoring a total of at
least 8 carrier frequency layers, which includes serving layer, comprising of
any above defined combination of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD,

#### 4.2.2.10 Reselection to CSG cells
Note: Requirements in this section are minimum requirements defined to ensure
the testability of autonomous CSG search. Further information on autonomous
search times in practical deployments is available in [25].
Reselection from non CSG to CSG cells may be performed using UE autonomous
search as defined in [1] when at least one CSG ID is included in the UE's
**CSG** white**list**. The requirements in this section are valid for
reselection to CSG cells previously visited by the UE when the radio
configuration parameters, including the carrier frequency and physical cell
identity of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and other neighbour cells are unchanged
from the most recent previous visit.
NOTE: According to [1], the UE autonomous search function, per UE
implementation, determines when and/or where to search for allowed CSG cells.
##### 4.2.2.10.1 Reselection from a non CSG to an inter-frequency CSG cell
The UE shall perform search and reselection to an allowed inter-frequency CSG
cell that has met CSG reselection criterion defined in [1] and that is in its
whitelist, within 6 minutes in the conditions shown in table 4.2.2.10.1-1.

## 5.1 E-UTRAN Handover
### 5.1.1 Introduction
### 5.1.2 Requirements
#### 5.1.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD
The requirements in this section are applicable to both intra-frequency and
inter-frequency handovers.
##### 5.1.2.1.1 Handover delay
Procedure delays for all procedures that can command a handover are specified
in [2].
When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover the UE shall be ready to
start the transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within D~handover~
seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
Where:
D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay to be defined in section
11.2 in 3GPP TS 36.331 [2] plus the interruption time stated in section
5.1.2.1.2.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command on the old PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission of the
new PRACH, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This requirement applies when UE
is not required to perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting
on the new PRACH.
When intra-frequency or inter-frequency handover is commanded, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt
Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms
Where:
> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
> cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the UE.
> If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target cell is
> unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell detection on
> the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms. Regardless of whether DRX is in
> use by the UE, T~search~ shall still be based on non-DRX target cell search
> times.
T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH
occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
> NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH configuration
> used in the target cell.
>
> In the interruption requirement a cell is known if it has been meeting the
> relevant cell identification requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise

#### 5.2.2.4.1 Handover delay
Procedure delays for all procedures that can command a handover are specified
in 3GPP TS 36.331 [2].
When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover, the UE shall be ready to
start the transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within D~handover~
seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
Where:
D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay to be defined in section

2.2.4.2.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command on the old PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission of the
new PRACH, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This requirement applies when UE
is not required to perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting
on the new PRACH.
When intra-frequency or inter-frequency handover is commanded, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt
Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms
Where
> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
> cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the UE.
> If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target cell is
> unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell detection on

> use by the UE, T~search~ shall still be based on non-DRX target cell search
> times.
T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH
occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
> NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH configuration
> used in the target cell.
In the interruption requirement a cell is known if it has been meeting the
relevant cell identification requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise
it is unknown. Relevant cell identification requirements are described in
Section 8.1.2.2.2 for intra-frequency handover and Section 8.1.2.3.4 for
inter-frequency handover.
## 5.3 Handover to other RATs
### 5.3.1 E-UTRAN - UTRAN FDD Handover
#### 5.3.1.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN FDD is to change the
radio access mode from E-UTRAN to UTRAN FDD. The handover procedure is
initiated from E-UTRAN with a RRC message that implies a hard handover as
described in [2].
##### 5.3.1.1.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover to UTRAN the UE shall be
ready to start the transmission of the new UTRA uplink DPCCH within
D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last E-UTRAN TTI containing the RRC
MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command.
where:
\- D~handover~ equals the RRC procedure delay, which is 50 ms plus the
interruption time stated in section 5.3.1.1.2.
##### 5.3.1.1.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
on the uplink DPCCH in UTRAN FDD, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The
interruption time depends on whether the target cell is known to the UE or
not.
The target cell is known if it has been measured by the UE during the last 5
seconds otherwise it is unknown. The UE shall always perform a UTRA
synchronisation procedure as part of the handover procedure.
If the target cell is known the interruption time shall be less than
Tinterrupt1
Tinterrupt1 = T~IU~+T~sync~+50+ 10*F~max~ ms
If the target cell is unknown the interruption time shall be less than
Tinterrupt2
> Tinterrupt2 = T~IU~+T~sync~+150 + 10*F~max~ ms
This requirement shall be met, provided that there is one target cell in the
MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command. Performance requirements for E-UTRA to UTRA soft
handover are not specified. When UE is connected to an E-UTRA cell, UTRA SFN
timing measurements are not reported. This implies that the timing of the DPCH
of the UTRA target cells in the active set cannot be configured by UTRAN to
guarantee that all target cells fall within the UE reception window of T~0~
+/- 148 chips.
Where:
T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing from the
E-UTRAN to the new UTRAN cell. T~IU~ can be up to one UTRA frame (10 ms).
F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the transmission time
intervals of all transport channels that are multiplexed into the same CCTrCH
on the UTRA target cell.
T~sync~ is the time required for measuring the downlink DPCCH channel as
stated in 3GPP TS 25.214 section 4.3.1.2 [20]. In case higher layers indicate
the usage of a post-verification period T~sync~=0 ms. Otherwise T~sync~=40 ms.
The phase reference is the primary CPICH.
The requirements in this section assume that N312 has the smallest possible
value i.e. only one insync is required.
### 5.3.2 E-UTRAN - UTRAN TDD Handover
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN TDD is to change the
radio access mode from E-UTRAN to UTRAN TDD. The handover procedure is
initiated from E-UTRAN with a RRC message that implies a hard handover as
described in [2].

MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command.
Where:
\- D~handover~ equals the RRC procedure delay, which is 50 ms plus the
interruption time stated in section 5.3.2.2.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
on the uplink DPCH or the SYNC-UL in UTRAN TDD, excluding the RRC procedure
delay. The interruption time depends on whether the target cell is known to
the UE or not.
The UE shall always perform a UTRA synchronisation procedure as part of the
handover procedure.
If the target cell has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt1
T~interrupt1~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+20 +10*F~max~ ms
If the target cell has not been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds,
the interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt2
T~interrupt2~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+180 +10*F~max~ ms
Where:
T~offset~ Equal to 10 ms, the frame timing uncertainty between the old cell
and the target cell and the time that can elapse until the appearance of a
Beacon channel
T~UL~ Equal to 10 ms, the time that can elapse until the appearance of the UL
timeslot in the target cell
F~SFN~ Equal to 1 if SFN decoding is required and equal to 0 otherwise
F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the transmission time
intervals of all transport channels that are multiplexed into the same CCTrCH.
The interruption time requirements for an unknown target cell shall apply only
if the signal quality of the unknown target cell is sufficient for successful
synchronisation with one attempt.
### 5.3.3 E-UTRAN - GSM Handover
#### 5.3.3.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to GSM is to transfer a
connection between the UE and E-UTRAN to GSM. The handover procedure is

case where the UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell before receiving the
RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command are valid when the signal quality of the GSM
cell is sufficient for successful synchronisation with one attempt. If the UE
is unable to synchronise to the GSM cell on the first attempt, it shall
continue to search for synchronisation information for up to 800 ms duration.
If after 800 ms the UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell it shall follow
the handover failure procedure specified in [2].
##### 5.3.3.2.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command the UE shall be ready
to transmit (as specified in [10]) on the channel of the new RAT within the
value in table 5.3.3.2.1-1 from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command. The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA
command within 50 ms, which is noted as RRC procedure delay.

The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
on the uplink channel in GSM, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The
interruption time depends on whether the UE has synchronized to the target GSM
cell or not and shall be less than the value specified in table 5.3.3.2.2-1.

### 6.4.1 Introduction
The requirements defined in this section are applicable to a UE supporting and
configured with CSG proximity indication and are valid when a UE is entering
the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) or leaving the proximity of
all CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency as specified in [2].
The detection of CSG proximity is based on a UE autonomous search function..
### 6.4.2 Requirements
The UE shall initiate transmission of the ProximityIndication message with
"entering" according to [2] within [6] minutes after entering the proximity of
one or more CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency.

"leaving" according to [2] within [6] minutes after leaving the proximity of
all CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency.
There is no need for statistical testing of this requirement.
NOTE: Entering the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) means that the
UE is near a cell whose CSG ID is in the UE's CSG whitelist (as determined
based on autonomous search procedures). Leaving the proximity of one or more
CSG member cell(s) means that the UE is no longer near any cell whose CSG ID
is in the UE's CSG whitelist.

N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$ before the reception of the first
detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame from the reference
cell UE initial transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in
one adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are defined in the
following requirements.
### 7.1.2 Requirements
The UE initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal to ±T~e~
where the timing error limit value T~e~ is specified in Table 7.1.2-1. This
requirement applies when it is the first transmission in a DRX cycle for
PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS or it is the PRACH transmission. The reference point for
the UE initial transmit timing control requirement shall be the downlink
timing minus $(N_{\text{TA_Ref}} + N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$. The
downlink timing is defined as the time when [the first detected path (in
time)] of the corresponding downlink frame is received from the reference
cell. _N_ ~TA_Ref~ for PRACH is defined as 0. $(N_{\text{TA_Ref}} +
N_{\text{TA\ offset}})$ (in _T~s~_ units) for other channels is the difference
between UE transmission timing and the Downlink timing immediately after when
the last timing advance in section 7.3 was applied. _N_ ~TA_Ref~ for other
channels is not changed until next timing advance is received.

* * *
Downlink Bandwidth (MHz) T~e_~ 1.4 24*T~S~ ≥3 12*T~S~ Note: T~S~ is the basic
timing unit defined in TS 36.211
* * *
When it is not the first transmission in a DRX cycle or there is no DRX cycle,
and when it is the transmission for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS transmission, the UE
shall be capable of changing the transmission timing according to the received
downlink frame except when the timing advance in section 7.3 is applied. When
the transmission timing error between the UE and the reference timing exceeds
±T~e~ the UE is required to adjust its timing to within ±T~e~. The reference
timing shall be $(N_{\text{TA_Ref}} + N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$
before the downlink timing. All adjustments made to the UE uplink timing shall
follow these rules:
1) The maximum amount of the magnitude of the timing change in one adjustment
shall be T~q~ seconds.
2) The minimum aggregate adjustment rate shall be 7*T~S~ per second.
3) The maximum aggregate adjustment rate shall be T~q~ per 200ms.
where the maximum autonomous time adjustment step T~q~ is specified in Table
7.1.2-2.

## 7.2 UE timer accuracy
### 7.2.1 Introduction
UE timers are used in different protocol entities to control the UE behaviour.
### 7.2.2 Requirements
For UE timers specified in [2], UE shall comply with the timer accuracies
according to Table 7.2.2-1.
The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements internally
in the UE. They do not include the following:
\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE reaction
time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is fulfilled), or
\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. TTI alignment when UE sends messages at timer
expiry).
Table 7.2.2-1
* * *
Timer value [s] Accuracy timer value \ **Cell Type** | > **Cell Radius** | > **Requirement** | +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------+ | > Small cell | > ≤ 3 km | > ≤ 3 μs | +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------+ | > Large cell | > > 3 km | > ≤ 10 μs | +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------+
For Home BS, the cell phase synchronization accuracy measured at BS antenna
connectors shall be better than the requirement specified in table 7.4.2-2.
Table 7.4.2-2 Cell phase synchronization requirement for Home BS (TDD)
* * *
Source Cell Type Propagation Distance Requirement Small cell ≤ 500 m ≤ 3 μs
Large cell > 500 m ≤1.33 + _T~propagation~_ μs
* * *
Note 1: _T~propagation~_ is _the propagation delay between the Home BS and the
cell selected as the ne_ twork listening synchronization source. In terms of
the network listening synchronization source selection, the best accurate
synchronization source to GNSS should be selected.
Note 2: If the Home BS obtains synchronization without using network
listening, the small cell requirement applies.
## 7.5 Synchronization Requirements for E-UTRAN to 1xRTT and HRPD Handovers
### 7.5.1 Introduction
This section contains the synchronization requirements for eNodeB capable of
supporting E-UTRAN to CDMA 1xRTT and HRPD handovers. To facilitate E-UTRAN to
CDMA 1xRTT and HRPD handovers, the CDMA System Time reference needs to be
provided to the UE in order for the UE to report the pilot PN phases of the
target 1xRTT or HRPD cells. This is achieved through the SIB8 message
broadcasted by the serving eNodeB:
> If the eNodeB is synchronized to the GPS time then the size of CDMA System
> Time information is 39 bits and the unit is 10 ms based on a 1.2288 Mcps
> chip rate.
>
> If the eNodeB is not synchronized to the GPS time then the size of CDMA
> System Time information is 49 bits and the unit is 8 CDMA chips based on
> 1.2288 Mcps chip rate.
The CDMA system time reference provided by the serving eNodeB has to be within
a certain level of accuracy in order to facilitate accurate reporting of the
pilot PN phases of the target 1xRTT or HRPD cells and enable reliable handover
to the 1xRTT or HRPD networks.
### 7.5.2 eNodeB Synchronization Requirements
#### 7.5.2.1 Synchronized E-UTRAN
The eNodeB shall be synchronized to the GPS time. With external source of CDMA
System Time disconnected, the eNodeB shall maintain the timing accuracy within
±10 μs of CDMA System Time for a period of not less than 8 hours.
The timing deviation between the SFN boundary at or immediately after the
ending boundary of the SI-window in which _SystemInformationBlockType8_
(containing the broadcasted CDMA System Time with 10-ms granularity) is
transmitted and the broadcasted CDMA System Time shall be within 10 μs.
#### 7.5.2.2 Non-Synchronized E-UTRAN
The timing deviation between the SFN boundary at or immediately after the end
of the boundary of the SI-window in which _SystemInformationBlockType8_
(containing the broadcasted CDMA System Time with 8-chip granularity) is
transmitted and the broadcasted CDMA System Time shall be within 10 μs. With
external source of CDMA System Time disconnected the SFN boundary at or
immediately after the broadcasted CDMA System Time in the SIB8 message shall
maintain the timing accuracy within ±10 μs of CDMA System Time for a period of
not less than 8 hours.
## 7.6 Radio Link Monitoring
### 7.6.1 Introduction
The UE shall monitor the downlink link quality based on the cell-specific
reference signal in order to detect the downlink radio link quality of the
serving cell as specified in [3].
The UE shall estimate the downlink radio link quality and compare it to the
thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link
quality of the serving cell.
The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio link
cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to 10% block error rate of a
hypothetical PDCCH transmission taking into account the PCFICH errors with
transmission parameters specified in Table 7.6.1-1.
The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio link
quality can be significantly more reliably received than at Q~out~ and shall
correspond to 2% block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission taking
into account the PCFICH errors with transmission parameters specified in Table
7.6.1-2.

can be used. For defining the inter-frequency and inter-RAT requirements
T~inter1~=30ms shall be assumed.
The requirements in section 9 are applicable for a UE performing measurements

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and additionally
performing a single measurement with measurement period of

cell identification delay can be expected.
In the RRC_CONNECTED state the measurement period for intra frequency
measurements is 200 ms. When no measurement gaps are activated, the UE shall

.H6}
Reported measurements contained in event triggered measurement reports shall
meet the requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as no
reporting criteria are fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that
will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~.This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay which caused by no UL resoureces for UE to send the measurement report.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T ~identify\ intra~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.1.1. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify_intra~ defined in section 8.1.2.2.1.1 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an
event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement_Period,\ Intra~ provided the timing to that cell has not changed
more than ± 50 Ts and the L3 filter has not been used. When L3 filtering is
used an additional delay can be expected.

No explicit neighbour list is provided to the UE for identifying a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell. The UE shall identify and report the CGI when requested by the
network for the purpose of 'reportCGI'. The UE may make autonomous gaps in
both downlink reception and uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1
message according to section 5.5.3.1 of 36.331 [2]. Note that a UE is not
required to use autonomous gap if si-RequestForHO is set to false. If
autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of 'reportCGI',
regardless of whether DRX is used or not, the UE shall be able to identify a
new CGI of E-UTRA cell within:
$T_{\text{identify_CGI,\ inter}} = T_{\text{basic}_{\text{identify_CGI,\
inter}}}\ \text{ms}$
Where
T~basic_identify_CGI,\ inter~ = 150 ms. This is the time period used in the
above equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new CGI
of E-UTRA cell is defined.
A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are fulfilled:
\- RSRP related side conditions given in Section 9.1 are fulfilled for a
corresponding Band,

Given that TDD configuration as in Table 8.1.2.3.2.1-1 is used, the UE shall
have more than 30 ACK/NACK transmitted during the identification of a new CGI
of E-UTRA cell, provided that:
\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. In case DRX is used, the ECGI
reporting may be delayed until the next DRX cycle.

## A.3.2 OFDMA Channel Noise Generator (OCNG)
### A.3.2.1 OCNG Patterns for FDD
The following OCNG patterns are used for modelling allocations to virtual UEs
(which are not under test) and/or allocations used for MBSFN. The OCNG pattern
for each sub frame specifies the allocations that shall be filled with OCNG,
and furthermore, the relative power level of each such allocation.
In each test case the OCNG is expressed by parameters OCNG_RA and OCNG_RB
which together with a relative power level ($\gamma$) specifies the PDSCH
EPRE-to-RS EPRE ratios in OFDM symbols without and with reference symbols,
respectively. The relative power, which is used for modelling boosting per
virtual UE allocation, is expressed by:
where $\gamma_{i}$ denotes the relative power level of the _i:th_ virtual UE.
The parameter settings of OCNG_RA, OCNG_RB, and the set of relative power
levels $\gamma$are chosen such that when also taking allocations to the UE
under test into account, as given by a PDSCH reference channel, a constant
transmitted power spectral density that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is
targeted.
Moreover the OCNG pattern is accompanied by a PCFICH/PDCCH/PHICH reference
channel which specifies the control region. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols
in the non-MBSFN subframes is the same as specified in the RMC used in the
test. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols in the MBSFN subframe is the maximal
allowed according to 3GPP TS 36.213 [16]. For any aggregation and PHICH
allocation, the PDCCH and any unused PHICH groups are padded with resource
element groups with a power level given by PDCCH_RA/RB and PHICH_RA/RB as
specified in the test case such that a total power spectral density in the
control region that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.
For subframes configured as PRS subframes the PDSCH allocation defined in the
OCNG pattern does not apply.
The system information is scheduled in the allocations reserved for the OCNG
patterns, in the subframes not configured for MBSFN. For this purpose the
number of the RB-s allocated with PDSCH defined in the OCNG pattern can be
reduced as necessary.

### A.3.2.2 OCNG Patterns for TDD
The following OCNG patterns are used for modelling allocations to virtual UEs
(which are not under test). The OCNG pattern for each sub frame specifies the
allocations that shall be filled with OCNG, and furthermore, the relative
power level of each such allocation.
In each test case the OCNG is expressed by parameters OCNG_RA and OCNG_RB
which together with a relative power level ($\gamma$) specifies the PDSCH
EPRE-to-RS EPRE ratios in OFDM symbols without and with reference symbols,
respectively. The relative power, which is used for modelling boosting per
virtual UE allocation, is expressed by:
where $\gamma_{i}$ denotes the relative power level of the _i:th_ virtual UE.
The parameter settings of OCNG_RA, OCNG_RB, and the set of relative power
levels $\gamma$are chosen such that when also taking allocations to the UE
under test into account, as given by a PDSCH reference channel, a transmitted
power spectral density that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.
Moreover the OCNG pattern is accompanied by a PCFICH/PDCCH/PHICH reference
channel which specifies the control region. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols
in the non-MBSFN subframes is the same as specified in the RMC used in the
test. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols in the MBSFN subframe is the maximal
allowed according to 3GPP TS 36.213 [16] Table 6.7-1. For any aggregation and
PHICH allocation, the PDCCH any unused PHICH groups are padded with resource
element groups with a power level given by PDCCH_RA/RB and PHICH_RA/RB as
specified in the test case such that a total power spectral density in the
control region that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.
For subframes configured as PRS subframes the PDSCH allocation defined in the
OCNG pattern does not apply.
The system information is scheduled in the allocations reserved for the OCNG
patterns, in the subframes not configured for MBSFN. For this purpose the
number of the RB-s allocated with PDSCH defined in the OCNG pattern can be
reduced as necessary.

#### A.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell
2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell shall be less than 34
s.
The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell
1, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay to an already detected cell shall be less than 8
s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell can be expressed
as: T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ + T~SI~, and to an already detected cell can be
expressed as: T~evaluateFDD,intra~ + T~SI~,
Where:
> T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ See Table 4.2.2.3-1 in section 4.2.2.3
>
> T~evaluateFDD,intra~ See Table 4.2.2.3-1 in section 4.2.2.3
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 33.28 s, allow 34 s for the cell re-selection delay to a
newly detectable cell and 7.68 s, allow 8 s for the cell re-selection delay to
an already detected cell in the test case.

#### A.4.2.2.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell
2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell shall be less than 34
s.
The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on cell
1, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell can be expressed
as: T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ + T~SI-EUTRA~, and to an already detected cell can
be expressed as: T~evaluate,\ E-UTRAN_\ intra~ + T~SI-EUTRA~,
Where:
> T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ See Table 4.2.2.3-1 in section 4.2.2.3
>
> T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_\ intra~ See Table 4.2.2.3-1 in section 4.2.2.3
T~SI-EUTRA~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this
test case.
This gives a total of 33.28 s, allow 34 s for the cell re-selection delay to a
newly detectable cell and 7.68 s, allow 8 s for the cell re-selection delay to
an already detected cell in the test case.
#### A.4.2.3 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency case
#### A.4.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the FDD-FDD inter-frequency cell
reselection requirements specified in section 4.2.2.4.
The test scenario comprises of 2 E-UTRA FDD cells on 2 different carriers as
given in tables A.4.2.3.1-1 and A.4.2.3.1-2. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively.
Both cell 1 and cell 2 are already identified by the UE prior to the start of
the test. Cell 1 and cell 2 belong to different tracking areas and cell 2 is
of higher priority than cell 1. Furthermore, UE has not registered with
network for the tracking area containing cell 2.

#### A.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to higher priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 2, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to higher priority shall be less than 68 s.
The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T1, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 1, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay to lower priority shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to higher priority cell can be expressed as:
**T~higher_priority_search~** \+ T~evaluateFDD,inter~ + T~SI~ , and to lower

The cell reselection delay to higher priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 2, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to higher priority shall be less than 68 s.
The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T1, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 1, and

#### A.4.2.6.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to higher priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 2, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to higher priority shall be less than 68 s.
The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T1, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 1, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay to lower priority shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to higher priority cell can be expressed as:
**T~higher_priority_search~** \+ T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_inter~ + T~SI-EUTRA~ , and
to lower priority cell can be expressed as: T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_inter~ + T~SI-
EUTRA~,
Where:
> **T~higher_priority_search~ See section 4.2.2**
>
> T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_inter~ See Table 4.2.2.4-1 in section 4.2.2.4
>
> T~SI-EUTRA~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
> needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this
> test case.
This gives a total of 67.68 s for higher priority cell search and 7.68 s for
lower priority cell search, allow 68 s for higher priority cell and 8 s for
lower priority cell in the test case.
### A.4.2.7 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency case in the existence of non-

#### A.4.3.3.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 2, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message on cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to lower priority shall be less than 21 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to lower priority cell can be expressed as:
T~evaluateUTRA_FDD~ + T~SI-UTRA~
Where:
> T~evaluateUTRA-FDD~ See Table 4.2.2.5.1-1
>
> T~SI-UTRA~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
> needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this
> test case.
This gives a total of 20.48 s for lower priority cell reselection, allow 21 s.

## A.4.4 E-UTRAN to GSM Cell Re-Selection
### A.4.4.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- GSM:
#### A.4.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to GSM cell re-
selection delay reported in section 4.2.2.5.
This scenario implies the presence of 1 E-UTRAN serving cell, and 1 GSM cell
to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1
E-UTRA carrier and 12 GSM cells. Test parameters are given in Table,
A.4.4.1-1, A.4.4.1-2, A.4.4.1-3. E-UTRA FDD cell (Cell 1) and GSM cell (cell
2) shall belong to different Location Areas. The test comprises two successive
time periods, T1 and T2. During initialization before the start of the test,
the UE is camped on cell 1. By the end of T1, the UE has identified BSIC on
the GSM BCCH carrier of cell 2 but the signal levels do not meet the
reselection criterion during T1. At the start of T2, the signal levels change
such that cell 2 satisfies reselection criterion. The GSM layer is configured
at a lower priority than the serving E-UTRA FDD layer.

### A.5.1.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 50 ms from the
beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 15 ms and is specified in section 11.2 in [2].**
**T~interrupt~** = 35 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in section
5.2.2.4.2.
This gives a total of 50 ms.
## A.5.1.3 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency handover
### A.5.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the FDD-FDD inter-frequency
handover requirements specified in section 5.1.2.1.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.5.1.3.1-1 and A.5.1.3.1-2. PDCCHs indicating new
transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would not
enter the DRX state. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration
T1, the UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2
becomes detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement
report. Gap pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1
is configured before T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE.

#### A.5.1.4.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 50 ms from the
beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 15 ms and is specified in section 11.2 in [2].**
**T~interrupt~** = 35 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in section
5.2.2.4.2.
This gives a total of 50 ms.
### A.5.1.5 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency handover: unknown target cell
#### A.5.1.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the FDD-FDD inter-frequency handover requirements for
the case when the target cell is unknown as specified in section 5.1.2.1.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.5.1.5.1-1 and A.5.1.5.1-2. No gap patterns are
configured in the test case. The test consists of two successive time periods,
with time durations of T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration
T1, the UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2
becomes detectable and the UE is expected to detect and start to transmit the
PRACH to Cell 2.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T1. The
start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC message
implying handover is sent to the UE.

#### A.5.1.7.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 50 ms from the
beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 15 ms and is specified in section 11.2 in [2].**
**T~interrupt~** = 35 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in section
5.2.2.4.2.
This gives a total of 50 ms.
## A.5.1.8 E-UTRAN TDD -- FDD Inter frequency handover
### A.5.1.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the TDD-FDD inter-frequency
handover requirements specified in section 5.2.2.3.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA TDD cell and one E-UTRA FDD cell as
given in tables Table A.5.1.8.1-1, Table A.5.1.8.1-2 and Table A.5.1.8.1-3.
PDCCHs indicating new transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that
the UE would not enter the DRX state. The test consists of three successive
time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start
of time duration T1, the UE does not have any timing information of cell 2.
Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the UE is expected to detect and
send a measurement report. Gap pattern configuration with id #0 as specified
in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before T2 begins to enable inter-frequency
monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE.

## A.5.2 E-UTRAN Handover to other RATs
### A.5.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- UTRAN FDD Handover
#### A.5.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to UTRAN FDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3.1.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.2.1.1-1, A.5.2.1.1-2 and
A.5.2.1.1-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

#### A.5.2.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCCH to Cell 2 less than 190 ms from
the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 50 ms, which is specified in section** 5.3.1.1.1**.**
**T~interrupt~** = 140 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in section
5.3.1.1.2.
This gives a total of 190 ms.
### A.5.2.2 E-UTRAN TDD - UTRAN FDD Handover
#### A.5.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the E-UTRAN TDD -- UTRAN FDD handover requirements
specified in section 5.3.1.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRAN TDD cell and one UTRAN FDD cell as
given in the tables A.5.2.2.1-1, A5.2.2.1-2 and A.5.2.2.1-3. The test consists
of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any timing
information of cell 2. Gap pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in
Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before the start of T2 to enable the monitoring
of UTRAN FDD. A neighbouring cell list, including the UTRAN cell (cell2),
shall be sent to the UE before T2 starts. During the time T2 cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send the measurement report. A
RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during T2, after the UE
has reported event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI
containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The handover
message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

##### A.5.2.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall begin to send access bursts on the new DCCH of the target cell
less than 100 ms from the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:
T~Handover\ delay~ = 90 ms (Table 5.3.3.2.1-1) + T~offset~ + T~UL~
T~offset~ : Equal to 4.65 ms, GSM timing uncertainty between the time from
when the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next timeslot in GSM
26 multiframe structure
T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms, the time the UE has to wait in case the next timeslot
is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.
This gives a total of 99.3 ms, allow 100 ms in the test case.

The UE shall start to transmit the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS to Cell 2
less than 120 ms from the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 50 ms, which is specified in section** 5.3.2.2.1**.**
**T~interrupt~** is defined in section 5.3.2.2.2. **T~interrupt~** = 70 ms in
the test as following:
T~interrupt1~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+20 +10*F~max~ ms
T~offset~ = 10 ms; T~UL~ = 10 ms; and F~SFN~ = 1 for UE decoding SFN; F~max~ =

###### A.5.2.5.1.1 Void
###### A.5.2.5.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to UTRAN TDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3.2.
The test scenario comprises of two cells, E-UTRA TDD cell1 and UTRA TDD cell2.
The test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1,
T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have
any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and
the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap pattern
configuration with id #1 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before
T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring. The test parameters are
given in Tables A.5.2.5.1-1, A.5.2.5.1-2 and A.5.2.5.1-3.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

#### A.5.2.10.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS to Cell 2
less than 280 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay = 50 ms, which is specified in section 5.3.2.2.1.
**T~interrupt~** is defined in section 5.3.2.2.2. **T~interrupt~** = 230 ms in
the test as following:
T~interrupt1~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+180 +10*F~max~ ms
T~offset~ = 10 ms; T~UL~ = 10 ms; and F~SFN~ = 1 for UE decoding SFN; F~max~ =
0 for SYNCH-UL sequence transmition.
This gives a total of 280 ms.
#### A.5.3 E-UTRAN Handover to Non-3GPP RATs
#### A.5.3.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- HRPD Handover
#### A.5.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to HRPD handover
requirements specified in section 5.4.1.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.1.1-1, A.5.3.1.1-2 and
A.5.3.1.1-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

#### A.5.3.2 E-UTRAN FDD -- cdma2000 1X Handover
#### A.5.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to cdma2000 1X
handover requirements specified in section 5.4.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.2.1-1, A.5.3.2.1-2 and
A.5.3.2.1-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

#### A.5.3.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start transmission of the reverse control channel in HRPD to Cell
2 less than 127 ms from the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
> RRC procedure delay **= 50 ms, which is specified in section**
> 5.4.1.1.1**.**
>
> **T~interrupt~** = 76.66 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in
> section 5.4.1.1.2.
This gives a total of 126.66 ms, allow 127 ms in the test.
#### A.5.3.6 E-UTRAN TDD -- cdma2000 1X Handover
#### A.5.3.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN TDD to cdma2000 1X
handover requirements specified in section 5.4.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.6.1-1, A.5.3.6.1-2 and
A.5.3.6.1-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

#### A.6.1.1.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to a known E-UTRA FDD intra frequency cell
shall be less than 1.5 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a

#### A.6.1.2.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown E-UTRA FDD inter frequency cell
shall be less than 3 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a
trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL_grant~ is not used.
T~UE_re-establish_delay~ = 50 ms + N~freq~* _T~search~_ \+ T~SI~ + T~PRACH~
N~freq~ = 2
_T~search~_ = 800 ms
T~SI~ _= 1280 ms; it is the_ time required for receiving all the relevant
system information as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 for the target E-UTRAN FDD
cell.
T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.
This gives a total of 2945 ms, allow 3 s in the test case.

#### A.6.1.3.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to a known E-UTRA TDD intra frequency cell
shall be less than 1.5 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a
trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL_grant~ is not used.
T~UE_re-establish_delay~ = 50 ms + N~freq~* _T~search~_ \+ T~SI~ + T~PRACH~
N~freq~ = 1
_T~search~_ = 100 ms
T~SI~ _= 1280 ms; it is the_ time required for receiving all the relevant
system information as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 for the target E-UTRAN TDD

#### A.6.1.4.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown E-UTRA TDD inter frequency cell
shall be less than 3 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a
trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL_grant~ is not used.
T~UE_re-establish_delay~ = 50 ms + N~freq~* _T~search~_ \+ T~SI~ + T~PRACH~
N~freq~ = 2
_T~search~_ = 800 ms
T~SI~ _= 1280 ms; it is the_ time required for receiving all the relevant
system information as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 for the target E-UTRAN TDD
cell.
T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.
This gives a total of 2945 ms, allow 3 s in the test case.
#### A.6.2 Random Access
#### A.6.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- Contention Based Random Access Test
#### A.6.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the behavior of the random access
procedure is according to the requirements and that the PRACH power settings
and timing are within specified limits. This test will verify the requirements
in Section 6.2.2 and Section 7.1.2 in an AWGN model.
For this test a single cell is used. The test parameters are given in tables

#### A.6.3.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit random access to Cell 2 less than 650 ms from
the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to UTRAN FDD observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
NOTE: The Re-establishment delay in this case can be expressed as
T~connection_release_redirect_UTRA\ FDD~ = T~RRC_procedure_delay~ +
T~identify-UTRA\ FDD~ + T~SI-UTRA\ FDD~ + T~RA~
where
T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms
T~identify-UTRA\ FDD~ = 500 ms
T~SI-UTRA\ FDD~ = the time required for acquiring all the relevant system
information of the target UTRA FDD cell. This time depends upon whether the UE
is provided with the relevant system information of the target UTRA FDD cell
or not by the E-UTRAN before the RRC connection is released. 0 ms is assumed
in this test case.
T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure. 40 ms is
assumed in this test case.

T~connection_release_redirect_UTRA\ FDD~ = T~RRC_procedure_delay~ +
T~identify-UTRA\ FDD~ + T~SI-UTRA\ FDD~ + T~RA~
where
T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms
T~identify-UTRA\ FDD~ = 500 ms
T~SI-UTRA\ FDD~ = the time required for acquiring all the relevant system
information of the target UTRA FDD cell. This time depends upon whether the UE
is provided with the relevant system information of the target UTRA FDD cell
or not by the E-UTRAN before the RRC connection is released. 0 ms is assumed
in this test case.
T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure. 40 ms is
assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 650 ms.
### A.6.3.3 Redirection from E-UTRAN FDD to GERAN when System Information is
provided
#### A.6.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE performs the RRC connection
release with redirection from the E-UTRA FDD to the target GERAN cell within
T~connection_release_redirect_GERAN~. This test will partly verify the RRC
connection release with redirection to GERAN requirements in section 6.3.2.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.6.3.3.1-1, A.6.3.3.1-2 and

#### A.6.3.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall begin to send access bursts on RACH of the target GERAN cell
(cell #2) less than 1120 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct "RRC connection release with redirection to GERAN"
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:
> T~connection_release_redirect_~ ~GERAN~ = T~RRC_procedure_delay~ \+
> T~identify-GERAN~ + T~SI-GERAN~ + T~RA~
T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms, which is the time for processing the received
message "_RRCConnectionRelease_.
T~identify-GERAN~ = 1000 ms, which is the time for identifying the target
GERAN cell.
> T~SI-GERAN~ = 0; UE does not have to read the system information of the
> GERAN cell since all relevant SI is provided to the UE in the

#### A.6.3.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS to Cell 2
less than 650 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to UTRA TDD observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
NOTE: The time delay can be expressed as: T~RRC_procedure_delay~ + T~identify-
UTRA\ TDD~ + T~SI-UTRA\ TDD~ + T~RA~, where:
T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms, which is specified in section 6.3.2.3.
T~identify-UTRA\ TDD~ = 500 ms; which is defined in section 6.3.2.3.
T~SI-UTRA\ TDD~ = 0 ms, UE does not have to read the system information of the
UTRAN TDD since all relevant SI is provided to the UE in the
"_RRCConnectionRelease_ " message.
T~RA~ = 40ms. This is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure
It gives a total delay of 650 ms.
### A.6.3.6 E-UTRA FDD RRC connection release redirection to UTRA TDD
#### A.6.3.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE performs the RRC connection
release with redirection from the E-UTRA FDD to the target UTRA TDD cell
within T~connection_release_redirect_UTRA\ TDD~. This test will partly verify
the RRC connection release with redirection to UTRA TDD requirements in
section 6.3.2.3.
The test parameters are given in table A.6.3.6.1-1, table A.6.3.6.1-2, and
table A.6.3.6.1-3. No measurement gaps are configured. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell
2. The "_RRCConnectionRelease_ " message containing the relevant system
information of Cell 2 shall be sent to the UE during period T1 and the start
of T2 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC message,
"_RRCConnectionRelease_ ", is received by the UE from cell 1. The
"_RRCConnectionRelease_ " message shall contain all the relevant system
information of Cell 2.

#### A.6.3.8.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS to Cell 2
less than 1930 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to UTRA TDD observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
NOTE: The time delay can be expressed as: T~RRC_procedure_delay~ + T~identify-
UTRA\ TDD~ + T~SI-UTRA\ TDD~ + T~RA~, where:
T~RRC_procedure_delay~ **= 110 ms, which is specified in section
6**.3.2.3**.**
T~identify-UTRA\ TDD~ = 500 ms; which is defined in section 6.3.2.3.
T~SI-UTRA\ TDD~: Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
need to be received by the UE during RRC connection release redirection to
UTRA TDD cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
T~RA~ = 40ms, this is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.
This gives a total delay of 1930 ms.

#### A.6.3.9.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to send random access to the target UTRA FDD cell (Cell 2)
less than 1930 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct "RRC connection release with redirection to UTRAN"
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
NOTE: The test requirement in this case can be expressed as
T~connection_release_redirect_UTRA\ FDD~ = T~RRC_procedure_delay~ +
T~identify-UTRA\ FDD~ + T~SI-UTRA\ FDD~ + T~RA~
where
> T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms
>
> T~identify-UTRA\ FDD~ = 500 ms
>
> T~SI-UTRA\ FDD~ = the time required for acquiring all the relevant system

### A.6.3.12 E-UTRAN TDD RRC connection release redirection to UTRAN FDD
without SI provided
#### A.6.3.12.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE performs the RRC connection
release with redirection from the E-UTRAN TDD to the target UTRAN FDD cell
within T~connection_release_redirect_UTRAN\ FDD~. This test will partly verify
the RRC connection release with redirection to UTRAN FDD requirements in
section 6.3.2.1.
The test parameters are given in table A.6.3.12.1-1, table A.6.3.12.1-2, and
table A.6.3.12.1-3. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the UE
shall not have any timing information of cell 2. The "_RRCConnectionRelease_ "
message not containing any system information of Cell 2 shall be sent to the
UE during period T1. The start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI
containing the RRC message, "_RRCConnectionRelease_ ", is received by the UE
from Cell 1.

#### A.6.3.12.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to send random access to the target UTRAN FDD cell (Cell 2)
less than 1930 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to UTRAN FDD observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
NOTE: The time delay can be expressed as: T~RRC_procedure_delay~ + T~identify-
UTRAN\ FDD~ + T~SI-UTRAN\ FDD~ + T~RA~, where:
> T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms, which is specified in section 6.3.2.1.
>
> T~identify-UTRAN\ FDD~ = 500 ms; which is defined in section 6.3.2.1.
>
> T~SI-UTRAN\ FDD~: Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks
> that need to be received by the UE during RRC connection release redirection
> to UTRAN FDD cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
>
> T~RA~ = 40ms, this is the additional delay caused by the random access

#### A.7.1.1.2 Test Requirements
For parameters specified in Tables A.7.1.1.1-1 and A.7.1.1.1-2, the initial
transmit timing accuracy, the maximum amount of timing change in one
adjustment, the minimum and the maximum adjustment rate shall be within the
limits defined in section 7.1.2.
The following sequence of events shall be used to verify that the requirements
are met.
For the 10MHz channel bandwith, the test sequence shall be carried out in
RRC_CONNECTED for both non-DRX and DRX with a cycle length of 80 ms (Tests 1
and 2, respectively):
a) After a connection is set up with the cell, the test system shall verify
that the UE transmit timing offset is within N~TA~×T~S~ ± 12×T~S~ with respect
to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame of
cell 1.
b) The test system adjusts the downlink transmit timing for the cell by
+64×T~S~ (approximately +2µs) compared to that in (a).
c) The test system shall verify that for Test 1 the adjustment step size and
the adjustment rate shall be according to the requirements in section 7.1.2
until the UE transmit timing offset is within N~TA~×T~S~ ± 12×T~S~ with
respect to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink
frame of cell 1. Skip this step for Test 2.
d) The test system shall verify that the UE transmit timing offset stays
within N~TA~×T~S~ ± 12×T~S~ with respect to the first detected path (in time)
of the corresponding downlink frame of cell 1. For test 2 the UE transmit
timing offset shall be verified for the first transmission in the DRX cycle
immediately after DL timing adjustment.
For the 1.4MHz channel bandwith, the test sequence shall be carried out in
RRC_CONNECTED for non-DRX (Tests 3):
a) After a connection is set up with the cell, the test system shall verify
that the UE transmit timing offset is within N~TA~×T~S~ ± 24×T~S~ with respect
to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame of
cell 1.
b) The test system adjusts the downlink transmit timing for the cell by
+128×T~S~ (approximately +4µs) compared to that in (a).
c) The test system shall verify that the adjustment step size and the
adjustment rate shall be according to the requirements in section 7.1.2 until
the UE transmit timing offset is within N~TA~×T~S~ ± 24×T~S~ with respect to
the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame of cell
1.
d) The test system shall verify that the UE transmit timing offset stays
within N~TA~×T~S~ ± 24×T~S~ with respect to the first detected path (in time)
of the corresponding downlink frame of cell 1.

#### A.7.1.2.2 Test Requirements
For parameters specified in Tables A.7.1.2.1-1 and A.7.1.2.1-2, the initial
transmit timing accuracy, the maximum amount of timing change in one
adjustment, the minimum and the maximum adjustment rate shall be within the
limits defined in section 7.1.2.
The following sequence of events shall be used to verify that the requirements
are met.
For the 10MHz channel bandwith, the test sequence shall be carried out in
RRC_CONNECTED for both non-DRX and DRX with a cycle length of 80 ms (Tests 1
and 2, respectively):
a) After a connection is set up with the cell, the test system shall verify
that the UE transmit timing offset is within (N~TA~ + 624)×T~S~ ± 12×T~S~ with
respect to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink
frame of cell 1.
b) The test system adjusts the downlink transmit timing for the cell by
+64×T~S~ (approximately +2µs) compared to that in (a).
c) The test system shall verify that for test 1 the adjustment step size and
the adjustment rate shall be according to the requirements in section 7.1.2
until the UE transmit timing offset is within (N~TA~ + 624)×T~S~ ± 12×T~S~
with respect to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding
downlink frame of cell 1. Skip this step for test 2.
d) The test system shall verify that the UE transmit timing offset stays
within (N~TA~ + 624)×T~S~ ± 12×T~S~ with respect to the first detected path
(in time) of the corresponding downlink frame of cell 1. For test 2 the UE
transmit timing offset shall be verified for the first transmission in the DRX
cycle immediately after DL timing adjustment.
For the 1.4MHz channel bandwith, the test sequence shall be carried out in
RRC_CONNECTED for non-DRX (Tests 3):
a) After a connection is set up with the cell, the test system shall verify
that the UE transmit timing offset is within (N~TA~ +624)×T~S~ ± 24×T~S~ with
respect to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink
frame of cell 1.
b) The test system adjusts the downlink transmit timing for the cell by
+128×T~S~ (approximately +4µs) compared to that in (a).
c) The test system shall verify that the adjustment step size and the
adjustment rate shall be according to the requirements in section 7.1.2 until
the UE transmit timing offset is within (N~TA~ +624)×T~S~ ± 24×T~S~ with
respect to the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink
frame of cell 1.
d) The test system shall verify that the UE transmit timing offset stays
within (N~TA~ +624)×T~S~ ± 24×T~S~ with respect to the first detected path (in
time) of the corresponding downlink frame of cell 1.
#### A.7.2 UE Timing Advance
#### A.7.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- UE Timing Advance Adjustment Accuracy Test
#### A.7.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the test is to verify E-UTRAN FDD Timing Advance adjustment
accuracy requirements, defined in section 7.3.2.2, in an AWGN model.
The test parameters are given in tables A.7.2.1.1-1, A.7.2.1.1-2, and
A.7.2.1.1-3. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time
duration of T1 and T2 respectively. In each time period, timing advance
commands are sent to the UE and Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), as specified
in table A.7.2.1.1-3, are sent from the UE and received by the test equipment.
By measuring the reception of the SRS, the transmit timing, and hence the
timing advance adjustment accuracy, can be measured.
During time period T1, the test equipment shall send one message with a Timing
Advance Command MAC Control Element, as specified in Section 6.1.3.5 in TS
36.321. The Timing Advance Command value shall be set to 31, which according
to Section 4.2.3 in TS 36.213 results in zero adjustment of the Timing
Advance. In this way, a reference value for the timing advance used by the UE
is established.
During time period T2, the test equipment shall send a sequence of messages
with Timing Advance Command MAC Control Elements, with Timing Advance Command
value specified in table A.7.2.1.1-2. This value shall result in changes of
the timing advance used by the UE, and the accuracy of the change shall then
be measured, using the SRS sent from the UE.
As specified in Section 7.3.2.1, the UE adjusts its uplink timing at sub-frame
n+6 for a timing advance command received in sub-frame n. This delay must be
taken into account when measuring the timing advance adjustment accuracy, via
the SRS sent from the UE.
The UE Time Alignment Timer, described in Section 5.2 in TS 36.321, shall be
configured so that it does not expire in the duration of the test.

## A.7.3 Radio Link Monitoring
In the following section, any uplink signal transmitted by the UE is used for
detecting the In-/Out-of-Sync state of the UE. In terms of measurement, the
uplink signal is verified on the basis of the UE output power:
\- UE output power higher than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as defined in TS
36.101 [5] clause 6.3.3.1) means uplink signal
\- UE output power equal to or less than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as
defined in TS 36.101 [5] clause 6.3.3.1) means no uplink signal
### A.7.3.1 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync
#### A.7.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.1.1-1, A.7.3.1.1-2 and
A.7.3.1.1-3 below. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.1.1-4 shows the variation
of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync
states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting
in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms.

### A.7.3.2 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync
#### A.7.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.2.1-1 and A.7.3.2.1-2 below.
There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test
consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.2.1-3 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the
start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to cell 1.
The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a
reporting periodicity of 2 ms.

Note 1: OCNG shall be used such that the resources in cell # 1 are fully allocated and a constant total transmitted power spectral density is achieved for all OFDM symbols. Note 2: The uplink resources for CQI reporting are assigned to the UE prior to the start of time period T1. Note 3: The timers and layer 3 filtering related parameters are configured prior to the start of time period T1. Note 4: The signal contains PDCCH for UEs other than the device under test as part of OCNG. Note 5: SNR levels correspond to the signal to noise ratio over the cell-specific reference signal REs. Note 6: The SNR in time periods T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 is denoted as SNR1, SNR2, SNR3, SNR4 and SNR5 respectively in figure A.7.3.2.1-3. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### A.7.3.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point F (420 ms after the start of
time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least in all
subframes configured for CQI transmission according to the configured CQI
reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.3 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync
#### A.7.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.3.1-1, A.7.3.3.1-2 and
A.7.3.3.1-3 below. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.3.1-4 shows the variation
of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync
states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting
in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a reporting periodicity of 1 ms.

#### A.7.3.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall transmit
uplink signal at least in all uplink subframes configured for CQI transmission
according to the configured CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time point C (240
ms after the start of the time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.4 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync
#### A.7.3.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.4.1-1 and A.7.3.4.1-2 below.
There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test
consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.4.1-3 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the
start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to cell 1.
The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a
reporting periodicity of 1 ms.

Note 1: For the special subframe configuration see table 4.2-1 in 3GPP TS 36.211. Note 2: For the uplink-downlink configuration see table 4.2-2 in 3GPP TS 36.211. Note 3: OCNG shall be used such that the resources in cell # 1 are fully allocated and a constant total transmitted power spectral density is achieved for all OFDM symbols. Note 4: The uplink resources for CQI reporting are assigned to the UE prior to the start of time period T1. Note 5: The timers and layer 3 filtering related parameters are configured prior to the start of time period T1. Note 6: The signal contains PDCCH for UEs other than the device under test as part of OCNG. Note 7: SNR levels correspond to the signal to noise ratio over the cell-specific reference signal REs. Note 8: The SNR in time periods T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 is denoted as SNR1, SNR2, SNR3, SNR4 and SNR5 respectively in figure A.7.3.4.1-3. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### A.7.3.4.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point F (420 ms after the start of
time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink
subframes configured for CQI transmission according to the configured CQI
reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.5 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
FDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.5.1-1, A.7.3.5.1-2, A.7.3.5.1-3
and A.7.3.5.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.5.1-5 shows the variation of the
downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

Figure A.7.3.5.1-5 SNR variation for out-of-sync testing in DRX
#### A.7.3.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
In test 1 and test 2 during the period from time point A to time point B the
UE shall transmit uplink signal at least once every DRX cycle, in the On-
duration part of the cycle in the subframe according to the configured CQI
reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
In test 1 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 900 ms after the start of time duration T3).
In test 2 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 6500 ms after the start of time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.6 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
FDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.6.1-1, A.7.3.6.1-2, A.7.3.6.1-3
and A.7.3.6.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.6.1-5 shows the variation of
the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

#### A.7.3.6.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point F (1120 ms after the start
of time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least once every
DRX cycle, in the On-duration part of the cycle in the subframe according to
the configured CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.7 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
TDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.7.1-1, A.7.3.7.1-2, A.7.3.7.1-3
and A.7.3.7.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.7.1-5 shows the variation of the
downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 1 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

Figure A.7.3.7.1-5 SNR variation for out-of-sync testing in DRX
#### A.7.3.7.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
In test 1 and test 2 during the period from time point A to time point B the
UE shall transmit uplink signal at least once every DRX cycle, in the On-
duration part of the cycle in the uplink subframe according to the configured
CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
In test 1 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 900 ms after the start of time duration T3).
In test 2 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 6500 ms after the start of time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.8 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
TDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.8.1-1, A.7.3.8.1-2, A.7.3.8.1-3
and A.7.3.8.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.8.1-5 shows the variation of
the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 1 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

#### A.8.1.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.1.2 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD intra-frequency event triggered reporting under
fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells
#### A.8.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event. This test will partly verify the FDD intra-frequency cell search
requirements in section 8.1.2.2.1.1
The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.2.1-1 and A.8.1.2.1-2 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. PDCCHs indicating new transmissions
or retransmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would not
enter the DRX state. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the UE
shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the

### A.8.1.3 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD intra-frequency event triggered reporting under
fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells with DRX
#### A.8.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the two tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting
of an event in DRX. The tests will partly verify the FDD-FDD intra-frequency
cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.2.1.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.1.3.1-1, A.8.1.3.1-2, A.8.1.3.1-3
and A.8.1.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell
2.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer to
keep UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource
at every DRX cycle.
In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH
to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.1.3.2 Test Requirements
In Test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2 to the moment when the UE send the measurement report on
PUSCH.
In Test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 25600 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles
on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the
measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report.
### A.8.1.4 Void
### A.8.1.5 E-UTRAN FDD - FDD Intra-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps
#### A.8.1.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.2.3.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA FDD carrier and two cells as given
in tables A.8.1.5.1-1 and A.8.1.5.1-2. PDCCHs indicating new transmissions
should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would have ACK/NACK sending
during identifying a new CGI of E-UTRAN cell. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At
the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any timing information of
cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the UE is expected to
detect and send a measurement report.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE.

#### A.8.1.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell global
identifier of cell 2 within 170 milliseconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + $T_{\text{identify_CGI,}\
\text{intra}}$+ reporting delay
= 15 + 150 + 2ms from the start of T3
= 167 ms, allow 170 ms.
The UE shall be scheduled continuously throughout the test, and from the start
of T3 until 170 ms at least 80 ACK/NACK shall be detected as being transmitted
by the UE.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The overall 80 ACK/NACK number is caused by two parts. Firstly, at least
60 ACK/NACK shall be sent during identifying the cell global identifier of
cell 2 according to the requirement in Section 8.1.2.2.3.1. Secondly, given
that continuous DL data allocation, additional 20 ACK/NACK shall be sent from
the start of T3 until 170 ms excludes 150 ms for identifying the cell global
identifier of cell 2.
### A.8.1.6 E-UTRAN FDD - FDD Intra-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps with DRX
### A.8.1.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.2.3. The requirement is
verified in a DRX configuration.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA FDD carrier and two cells as given
in tables A.8.1.6.1-1, A.8.1.6.1-2, A.8.1.6.1-3 and A.8.1.6.1-4. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the
UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE.
In the test UE needs to be provided at least once every 1280ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer to
keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore UE sends scheduling request (SR) to
obtain allocation to send the measurement report on PUSCH.

#### A.8.2.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.2.2 E-UTRAN TDD-TDD intra-frequency event triggered reporting under
fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells with DRX
#### A.8.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the two tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting
of an event in DRX. The tests will partly verify the TDD-TDD intra-frequency
cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.2.1.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.1.3.1-1, A.8.1.3.1-2, A.8.1.3.1-3
and A.8.1.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell
2.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle.
In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH
to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.2.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2 to the moment when the UE send the measurement report on
PUSCH.
In Test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 25600 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles
on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the
measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report.
### A.8.2.3 E-UTRAN TDD - TDD Intra-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps
#### A.8.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.2.4.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA TDD carrier and two cells as given
in tables A.8.2.3.1-1 and A.8.2.3.1-2. PDCCHs indicating new transmissions
should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would have ACK/NACK sending
during identifying a new CGI of E-UTRAN cell. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At
the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any timing information of
cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the UE is expected to
detect and send a measurement report.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE.

#### A.8.2.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell global
identifier of cell 2 within [170] milliseconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + $T_{\text{identify_CGI,}\
\text{intra}}$+ reporting delay
= 15 + [150] + 2ms from the start of T3
= [167] ms, allow [170] ms.
The UE shall be scheduled continuously throughout the test, and from the start
of T3 until [170] ms at least [47] ACK/NACK shall be detected as being
transmitted by the UE.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The overall [47] ACK/NACK number is caused by two parts. Firstly, at
least [35] ACK/NACK shall be sent during identifying the cell global
identifier of cell 2 according to the requirement for UL/DL configuration #1
in Table 8.1.2.2.4.1-1 of Section 8.1.2.2.4.1. Secondly, given that continuous
DL data allocation, additional [12] ACK/NACK shall be sent from the start of
T3 until [170] ms excludes [150] ms for identifying the cell global identifier
of cell 2.
### A.8.2.4 E-UTRAN TDD - TDD Intra-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps with DRX
#### A.8.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.2.4. The requirement is
verified in a DRX configuration.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA TDD carrier and two cells as given
in tables A.8.2.4.1-1, A.8.2.4.1-2, A.8.2.4.1-3 and A.8.2.4.1-4. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the
UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE.
In the test UE needs to be provided at least once every 1280ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer to
keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore UE sends scheduling request (SR) to
obtain allocation to send the measurement report on PUSCH.

#### A.8.3.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.3.2 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD Inter-frequency event triggered reporting when DRX
is used under fading propagation conditions in asynchronous cells
#### A.8.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These test will partly verify the FDD-FDD inter-frequency
cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.3.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.3.2.1-1 and A.8.3.2.1-2.
DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.3.2.1-3 and time
alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.3.2.1-4. In this tests, there are two cells on different carrier
frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is
provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The tests consists of two
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During
time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.3.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.3.3 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD inter-frequency event triggered reporting under
AWGN propagation conditions in asynchronous cells with DRX when L3 filtering
is used
#### A.8.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX when L3 filtering is used. This test will partly verify the
FDD-FDD inter-frequency cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.3.1.2
and the UE behaviour with the _filterCoefficent_ defined in [2].
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.3.3.1-1, A.8.3.3.1-2, A.8.3.3.1-3
and A.8.3.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 and the filter coefficient
is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, and T2 respectively. In this test, there are two cells on different
carrier frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 1 as defined in Table
8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH to obtain
UL allocation for measurement reporting.

### A.8.3.4 E-UTRAN FDD - FDD Inter-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps
#### A.8.3.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.3.5.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.8.3.4.1-1 and A.8.3.4.1-2. PDCCHs indicating new
transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would have
ACK/NACK sending during identifying a new CGI of E-UTRAN cell. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the
UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap pattern
configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before
T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.

#### A.8.3.4.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell global
identifier of cell 2 within 170 milliseconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + $T_{\text{identify_CGI,}\
\text{inter}}$+ reporting delay
= 15 + 150 + 2ms from the start of T3
= 167 ms, allow 170 ms.
The UE shall be scheduled continuously throughout the test, and from the start
of T3 until 170 ms at least 80 ACK/NACK shall be detected as being transmitted
by the UE.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The overall 80 ACK/NACK number is caused by two parts. Firstly, at least
60 ACK/NACK shall be sent during identifying the cell global identifier of
cell 2 according to the requirement in Section 8.1.2.3.5.1. Secondly, given
that continuous DL data allocation, and the measurement gaps have been
deconfigured before the start of T3, additional 20 ACK/NACK shall be sent from
the start of T3 until 170 ms excludes 150 ms for identifying the cell global
identifier of cell 2.
### A.8.3.5 E-UTRAN FDD - FDD Inter-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps with DRX
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.3.5. The requirement is
verified in a DRX configuration.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.8.3.5.1-1, A.8.3.5.1-2, A.8.3.5.1-3 and
A.8.3.5.1-4. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE. Measurement gaps shall be
deconfigured before the start of T3.
In the test UE needs to be provided at least once every 1280ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer to
keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore UE sends scheduling request (SR) to
obtain allocation to send the measurement report on PUSCH.

#### A.8.4.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 7680 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
> NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
> 2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of
> TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.4.2 E-UTRAN TDD-TDD Inter-frequency event triggered reporting when DRX
is used under fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells
#### A.8.4.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These test will partly verify the TDD-TDD inter-frequency
cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.3.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.4.2.1-1 and A.8.4.2.1-2.
DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.4.2.1-3 and time
alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.4.2.1-4. In these tests, there are two cells on different carrier
frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is
provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time aligmend. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The tests consists of two
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During
time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.4.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.4.3 E-UTRAN TDD-TDD inter-frequency event triggered reporting under
AWGN propagation conditions in synchronous cells with DRX when L3 filtering is
used
#### A.8.4.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX when L3 filtering is used. This test will partly verify the
TDD-TDD inter-frequency cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.3.2.2
and the UE behaviour with the filterCoefficent defined in [2].
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.4.3.1-1, A.8.4.3.1-2, A.8.4.3.1-3
and A.8.4.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 and the filter coefficient
is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, and T2 respectively. In this test, there are two cells on different
carrier frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 1 as defined in Table
8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH to obtain
UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.4.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 6400 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles
on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the
measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.4.4 E-UTRAN TDD - TDD Inter-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps
#### A.8.4.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.3.7.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA TDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.8.4.4.1-1 and A.8.4.4.1-2. PDCCHs indicating new
transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would have
ACK/NACK sending during identifying a new CGI of E-UTRAN cell. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the
UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap pattern
configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before
T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE. Measurement gaps shall be
deconfigured before the start of T3.

#### A.8.4.4.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell global
identifier of cell 2 within 170 milliseconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + $T_{\text{identify_CGI,}\
\text{inter}}$+ reporting delay
= 15 + 150 + 2ms from the start of T3
= 167 ms, allow 170 ms.
The UE shall be scheduled continuously throughout the test, and from the start
of T3 until 170 ms at least 42 ACK/NACK shall be detected as being transmitted
by the UE.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The overall 42 ACK/NACK number is caused by two parts. Firstly, at least
30 ACK/NACK shall be sent during identifying the cell global identifier of
cell 2 according to the requiremenet in Section 8.1.2.3.7.1. Secondly, given
that continuous DL data allocation, and the measurement gaps have been
deconfigured before the start of T3, additional 12 ACK/NACK shall be sent from
the start of T3 until 170 ms excludes 150 ms for identifying the cell global
identifier of cell 2.
### A.8.4.5 E-UTRAN TDD - TDD Inter-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps with DRX
#### A.8.4.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.3.7. The requirement is
verified in a DRX configuration.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA TDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.8.4.5.1-1, A.8.4.5.1-2, A.8.4.5.1-3 and
A.8.4.5.1-4. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE. Measurement gaps shall be
deconfigured before the start of T3.
In the test UE needs to be provided at least once every 1280ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer to
keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore UE sends scheduling request (SR) to
obtain allocation to send the measurement report on PUSCH.

#### A.8.5.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send the first measurement report containing the primary
scrambling code of cell 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 4800
ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct measurement reports observed with this delay during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
> NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
> 2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of
> TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.5.3 E-UTRAN FDD-UTRAN FDD event triggered reporting when DRX is used
under fading propagation conditions
#### A.8.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD-UTRAN FDD cell
search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.1.2.
In these tests, there are two cells, one E-UTRAN cell and one UTRAN cell, and
gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The common test parameters are given in Table A.8.5.3.1-1. Cell specific test
parameters are given in Table A.8.5.3.1-2 for E-UTRAN and in Table A.8.5.3.1-5
for UTRAN. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table
A.8.5.2.1-3 and time alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters
in Table A.8.5.2.1-4.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.5.3.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 2400 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE sends the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report
### A.8.5.4 E-UTRAN FDD - UTRAN FDD enhanced cell identification under AWGN
propagation conditions
#### A.8.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct enhanced
reporting of UTRAN cells. This test will partly verify the Enhanced UTRA FDD
cell identification requirements in section 8.1.2.4.1.1.1a.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.5.4.1-1, A.8.5.4.1-2 and
A.8.5.4.1-3 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time period T1, gaps are activated and an interRAT measurement
reporting configuration is configured, and linked to a UTRA measurement object
corresponding to channel UARFCN 1. Prior to time duration T2, the UE shall not
have any timing information of cell 2. Cell 2 is powered up at the beginning
of the T2.

The UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 6400 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion

### A.8.7.2 E-UTRAN TDD-UTRAN TDD cell search when DRX is used under fading
propagation conditions
#### A.8.7.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD to UTRAN TDD
inter-RAT cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.3.2
under fading propagation conditions.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.7.2.1-1, A.8.7.2.1-2 and
A.8.7.2.1-3. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table
A.8.7.2.1-4 and time alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters
in Table A.8.7.2.1-5. In these tests, there are two cells, 1 E-UTRAN TDD
serving cell and 1 UTRAN TDD cell to be searched, Gap pattern configuration #
0 as defined in table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time aligmend. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.7.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 6400ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement report on
PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 25.6s from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles on the
PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report
### A.8.7.3 E-UTRAN TDD - UTRAN TDD SON ANR cell search reporting in AWGN
propagation conditions
#### A.8.7.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
the strongest UTRAN TDD cell for SON automatic neighbour relations. This test
will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD - UTRAN TDD cell search requirements for
identification of a new UTRA TDD cell for SON given in section 8.1.2.4.13.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodical reporting with the purpose 'reportStrongestCellsForSON' is used.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1,
and T2 respectively. Prior to the start of time period T1, an interRATperiodic
measurement reporting configuration with purpose reportStrongestCellsForSON is
configured, and linked to a UTRA measurement object corresponding to channel
UARFCN 1. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of cell 2.

### A.8.8.2 E-UTRAN FDD-GSM event triggered reporting when DRX is used in AWGN
#### A.8.8.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD-GSM cell
search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.5.2.
In these tests, there are two cells, one E-UTRAN cell and one GSM cell, and
gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The common test parameters are given in Table A.8.8.2.1-1. Cell specific test
parameters are given in Table A.8.8.2.1-2 for E-UTRAN and in Table A.8.8.2.1-5
for GSM. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.8.2.1-3
and time alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.8.2.1-4.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.8.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report including
BSIC of cell # 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 3120 ms from
the beginning of time period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as
the time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send
the measurement report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 42.8 seconds from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report
### A.8.8.3 E-UTRAN FDD -- GSM event triggered reporting in AWGN with enhanced

#### A.8.10.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report including the
valid BSIC of cell # 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 3120 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
> NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
> 2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of
> TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
NOTE 2: The delay for GSM cell identification with BSIC verified is equal to
3120 ms, which is the sum of the event triggered measurement reporting delay
and the initial BSIC identification delay.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay = 2*T~Measurement\ Period,\
GSM~ = 2* 480ms =960ms.
Initial BSIC identification delay = 2160 ms.
### A.8.10.2 E-UTRAN TDD-GSM event triggered reporting when DRX is used in
AWGN
#### A.8.10.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD-GSM cell
search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.6.
In these tests, there are two cells, one E-UTRAN cell and one GSM cell, and
gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The common test parameters are given in Table A.8.10.2.1-1. Cell specific test
parameters are given in Table A.8.10.2.1-2 for E-UTRAN and in Table
A.8.10.2.1-5 for GSM. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table
A.8.10.2.1-3 and time alignment timer and scheduling request related
parameters in Table A.8.10.2.1-4.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.10.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report including
BSIC of cell # 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 3120 ms from
the beginning of time period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as
the time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send
the measurement report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 42.8 seconds from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report

#### A.8.11.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report for cell 2, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 7680 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report including BSIC of
cell 3, with a measurement reporting delay less than [7200] ms from the
beginning of time period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI
insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
> NOTE 2: The delay for GSM cell identification with BSIC verified is equal to
> [7200] ms, which is the sum of the event triggered measurement reporting
> delay and the initial BSIC identification delay.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay = 2*T~Measurement\ Period,\
GSM~ = 2* N~freq~*480ms = 1920ms.
Initial BSIC identification delay = [5280] ms, when one carrier frequency
other than GSM is monitored in the gaps.

#### A.8.11.6.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report for cell 2, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 7680 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report including BSIC of
cell 3, with a measurement reporting delay less than [7200] ms from the
beginning of time period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI
insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
> NOTE 2: The delay for GSM cell identification with BSIC verified is equal to
> [7200] ms, which is the sum of the event triggered measurement reporting
> delay and the initial BSIC identification delay.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay = 2*T~Measurement\ Period,\
GSM~ = 2* N~freq~*480ms = 1920ms.
Initial BSIC identification delay = [5280] ms, when one carrier frequency
other than GSM is monitored in the gaps.
## A.8.12 RSTD Intra-frequency Measurements
### A.8.12.1 E-UTRAN FDD intra-frequency RSTD measurement reporting delay test
case
#### A.8.12.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the test is to verify that the RSTD measurement meets the
requirements specified in Section 8.1.2.5.1 in an environment with fading
propagation conditions.
In the test there are three synchronous cells: Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3\.
Cell 1 is the reference as well as the serving cell. Cell 2 and Cell 3 are the
neighbour cells. All cells are on the same RF channel.
The test consists of three consecutive time intervals, with duration of T1, T2
and T3. Cell 1 is active in T1, T2 and T3, whilst Cell 2 and Cell 3 are
activated only in the beginning of T2. Cell 2 is active until the end of T3,
and Cell 3 is active until the end of T2. The beginning of the time interval
T2 shall be aligned with the first PRS positioning subframe of a positioning
occasion in the reference cell, where the PRS positioning occasion is as
defined in Section 8.1.2.5.1. Cell 1 transmits PRS in T2, while Cell 2
transmits PRS only in T3, and Cell 3 transmits PRS only in T2. Note: The
information on when PRS is muted is conveyed to the UE using PRS muting
information.
The OTDOA assistance data as defined in TS 36.355, Section 6.5.1, shall be
provided to the UE during T1. The last TTI containing the OTDOA assistance
data shall be provided to the UE ∆T ms before the start of T2, where ∆T = 150
ms is the maximum processing time of the OTDOA assistance data.
The test parameters are as given in Table A.8.12.1.1-1, Table A.8.12.1.1-2,
Table A.8.12.1.1-3 and Table A.8.12.1.1-4.

#### A.8.12.1.2 Test Requirements
The RSTD measurement fulfils the requirements specified in Section 8.1.2.5.1.
The UE shall perform and report the RSTD measurements for Cell 2 and Cell 3
with respect to the reference cell in the OTDOA assistance data, Cell 1,
within 2560 ms starting from the beginning of time interval T2.
The rate of the correct events for each neighbour cell observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%, where the reported RSTD measurement for
each correct event shall be within the RSTD reporting range specified in
Section 9.1.10.3, i.e., between RSTD_0000 and RSTD_12711.
NOTE: The RSTD measurement time in the test is derived from the following
expression, $T_{\text{PRS}}\left( M - 1 \right) + \text{160}\left\lceil
\frac{n}{M} \right\rceil$, where $M$=8 and $n$=16 are the parameters specified
in Section 8.1.2.5.1, Table 8.1.2.5.1-1, under Note 1. This gives the total
RSTD measurement time of 2560 ms for Cell 2 and Cell 3 with respect to the
reference cell Cell 1.
### A.8.12.2 E-UTRAN TDD intra-frequency RSTD measurement reporting delay test
case
#### A.8.12.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the test is to verify that the RSTD measurement meets the
requirements specified in Section 8.1.2.5.2 in an environment with fading
propagation conditions.
In the test there are three synchronous cells: Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3\.
Cell 1 is the reference as well as the serving cell. Cell 2 and Cell 3 are the
neighbour cells. All cells are on the same RF channel.
The test consists of three consecutive time intervals, with duration of T1 and
T2. Cell 1 is active in T1, T2 and T3, whilst Cell 2 and Cell 3 are activated
only in the beginning of T2. Cell 2 is active until the end of T3, and Cell 3
is active until the end of T2. The beginning of the time interval T2 shall be
aligned with the first PRS positioning subframe of a positioning occasion in
the reference cell, where the PRS positioning occasion is as defined in
Section 8.1.2.5.1. Cell 1 transmits PRS in T2, while Cell 2 transmits PRS only
in T3, and Cell 3 transmits PRS only in T2. Note: The information on when PRS
is muted is conveyed to the UE using PRS muting information.
The OTDOA assistance data as defined in TS 36.355, Section 6.5.1, shall be
provided to the UE during T1. The last TTI containing the OTDOA assistance
data shall be provided to the UE ∆T ms before the start of T2, where ∆T = 150
ms is the maximum processing time of the OTDOA assistance data.
The test parameters are as given in Table A.8.12.2.1-1, Table A.8.12.2.1-2,
Table A.8.12.2.1-3, and Table A.8.12.2.1-4.

#### A.8.12.2.2 Test Requirements
The RSTD measurement time fulfils the requirements specified in Section
8.1.2.5.2.
The UE shall perform and report the RSTD measurements for Cell 2 and Cell 3
with respect to the reference cell in the OTDOA assistance data, Cell 1,
within 2560 ms starting from the beginning of time interval T2.
The rate of the correct events for each neighbour cell observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%, where the reported RSTD measurement for
each correct event shall be within the RSTD reporting range specified in
Section 9.1.10.3, i.e., between RSTD_0000 and RSTD_12711.
NOTE: The RSTD measurement reporting delay in the test is derived from the
following expression, $T_{\text{PRS}}\left( M - 1 \right) +
\text{160}\left\lceil \frac{n}{M} \right\rceil$, where $M$=8 and $n$=16 are
the parameters specified for this test case in Section 8.1.2.5.2, Table
8.1.2.5.2-1, under Note 1. This gives the total RSTD measurement time of 2560
ms for Cell 2 and Cell 3 with respect to the reference cell Cell 1.

#### A.8.14.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event. This test will partly verify the TDD-FDD inter-frequency cell search
requirements in section 8.1.2.3.3.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.14.1.1-1 and A.8.14.1.1-2. In this
test, there are two cells on different carrier frequencies and gap pattern
configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.14.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.14.2 E-UTRAN TDD-FDD Inter-frequency event triggered reporting when
DRX is used under fading propagation conditions in asynchronous cells
#### A.8.14.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These test will partly verify the TDD-FDD inter-frequency
cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.3.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.14.2.1-1 and A.8.14.2.1-2.
DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.14.2.1-3 and time
alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.14.2.1-4. In these tests, there are two cells on different carrier
frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is
provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time aligmend. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.14.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.14.3 E-UTRAN TDD - FDD Inter-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps
#### A.8.14.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.3.6.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.8.14.3.1-1 and A.8.14.3.1-2. PDCCHs indicating
new transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would have
ACK/NACK sending during identifying a new CGI of E-UTRAN cell. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the
UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap pattern
configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before
T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE. Measurement gaps shall be
deconfigured before the start of T3.

#### A.8.14.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell global
identifier of cell 2 within 170 milliseconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + $T_{\text{identify_CGI,}\
\text{inter}}$+ reporting delay
= 15 + 150 + 2ms from the start of T3
= 167 ms, allow 170 ms.
The UE shall be scheduled continuously throughout the test, and from the start
of T3 until 170 ms at least 42 ACK/NACK shall be detected as being transmitted
by the UE.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The overall 42 ACK/NACK number is caused by two parts. Firstly, at least
30 ACK/NACK shall be sent during identifying the cell global identifier of
cell 2 according to the requiremenet in Section 8.1.2.3.7.1. Secondly, given
that continuous DL data allocation, and the measurement gaps have been
deconfigured before the start of T3, additional 12 ACK/NACK shall be sent from
the start of T3 until 170 ms excludes 150 ms for identifying the cell global
identifier of cell 2.

#### A.8.15.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 7680 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.15.2 E-UTRAN FDD-TDD Inter-frequency event triggered reporting when
DRX is used under fading propagation conditions in asynchronous cells
#### A.8.15.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the FDD-TDD inter-frequency
cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.3.4.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.15.2.1-1 and A.8.15.2.1-2.
DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.15.2.1-3 and time
alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.15.2.1-4. In these tests, there are two cells on different carrier
frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is
provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.15.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.15.3 E-UTRAN FDD - TDD Inter-frequency identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell using autonomous gaps
#### A.8.15.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for identification of a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps in section 8.1.2.3.8.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA FDD carrier and one E-UTRA TDD
carrier and one cell on each carrier as given in tables A.8.15.3-1 and
A.8.15.3-2. PDCCHs indicating new transmissions should be sent continuously to
ensure that the UE would have ACK/NACK sending during identifying a new CGI of
E-UTRAN cell. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying SI reading shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message shall create a measurement
report configuration with purpose _reportCGI and_ _si-RequestForHO_ set to
TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying SI reading is sent to the UE. Measurement gaps shall be
deconfigured before the start of T3.

#### A.8.15.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell global
identifier of cell 2 within 170 milliseconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + $T_{\text{identify_CGI,}\
\text{inter}}$+ reporting delay
= 15 + 150 + 2ms from the start of T3
= 167 ms, allow 170 ms.
The UE shall be scheduled continuously throughout the test, and from the start
of T3 until 170 ms at least 60 ACK/NACK shall be detected as being transmitted
by the UE.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The overall 80 ACK/NACK number is caused by two parts. Firstly, at least
60 ACK/NACK shall be sent during identifying the cell global identifier of
cell 2 according to the requirement in Section 8.1.2.3.5.1. Secondly, given
that continuous DL data allocation, and the measurement gaps have been
deconfigured before the start of T3, additional 20 ACK/NACK shall be sent from
the start of T3 until 170 ms excludes 150 ms for identifying the cell global
identifier of cell 2.

## A.8.19 CSG Proximity Indication Testing Case for E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter
frequency
Note : The test case in this section forms the basis for a signalling test for
CSG proximity detection.
### A.8.19.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the UE has implemented properly the
feature for indicating that the UE is entering or leaving the proximity of one
or more CSG member cells based on proximity detection with an autonomous
search function, as defined by the requirements in Section 6.4.
The test case consists of three successive segments: Test Preparation,
Negative Test, and Positive Test. The test scenario comprises of three E-UTRAN
FDD cells on different carriers. Cell 1 represents the serving cell in the
proximity of the CSG cell, Cell 2 the CSG cell, and Cell 3 the serving cell
not in the proximity of the CSG cell.. The description of the test procedure
is shown in Table A.8.19-1. The general test parameters and cell specific test
parameters are presented in Table A.8.19-2 and Table A.8.19-3 respectively.

### A.8.19.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall not send an "entering" proximity indication in T2 during Negative
Test.
The UE shall send an "entering" proximity indication in T3during Positive
Test.
# A.9 Measurement Performance Requirements
Unless explicitly stated otherwise:
\- Reported measurements shall be within defined range of accuracy limits
defined in Section 9 for 90 % of the reported cases.
\- Cell 1 is the serving cell.
\- Measurements are performed in RRC_CONNECTED state.
\- The reference channels assume transmission of PDSCH with a maximum number
of 5 HARQ transmissions unless otherwise specified.
## A.9.1 RSRP
### A.9.1.1 FDD Intra frequency case
#### A.9.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the RSRP measurement accuracy is
within the specified limits. This test will verify the requirements in Section
9.1.2 for FDD intra frequency measurements.
#### A.9.1.1.2 Test parameters
In this set of test cases all cells are on the same carrier frequency. Both
absolute and relative accuracy of RSRP intra frequency measurements are tested
by using the parameters in Table A.9.1.1.2-1. In all test cases, Cell 1 is the
serving cell and Cell 2 the target cell.

Note 1: OCNG shall be used such that both cells are fully allocated and a constant total transmitted power spectral density is achieved for all OFDM symbols (other than those in the PRS subframes). There is no PDSCH allocated in the subframe transmitting PRS. Note 2: Interference from other cells and noise sources not specified in the test is assumed to be constant over subcarriers and time and shall be modelled as AWGN of appropriate power for _N_ oc to be fulfilled. Note 3: $\frac{{\hat{E}}_{s}}{N_{\text{oc}}}$, PRS _Ê_ _s_ /_I_ ot, Io, RSRP and PRP levels have been derived from other parameters for information purposes. They are not settable parameters themselves. Io values are derived in the case that there is no PBCH, PSS or SSS in the OFDM symbols carrying PRS. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
#### A.9.8.2.2 Test Requirements
