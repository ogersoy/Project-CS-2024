# 4 Introduction
At the 3GPP TSG RAN #39 meeting, the Study Item description on \"Further
Advancements for E-UTRA (LTE-Advanced)\" was approved [1]. The study item
covers technology components to be considered for the evolution of E-UTRA,
e.g. to fulfil the requirements on IMT-Advanced. This technical report covers
the physical-layer aspects of these technology components.
# 5 Support of wider bandwidth
C _arrier aggregation_ , where two or more _component carriers_ are
aggregated, is supported by LTE-Advanced in order to support wider
transmission bandwidths e.g. up to 100MHz and for spectrum aggregation..
A terminal may simultaneously receive or transmit one or multiple component
carriers depending on its capabilities:
\- An LTE-Advanced terminal with reception and/or transmission capabilities
for carrier aggregation can simultaneously receive and/or transmit on multiple
component carriers.
\- An LTE Rel-8 terminal can receive and transmit on a single component
carrier only, provided that the structure of the component carrier follows the
Rel-8 specifications.
\- It shall be possible to configure all component carriers LTE Release 8
compatible, at least when the aggregated numbers of component carriers in the
UL and the DL are same. Consideration of non-backward-compatible
configurations of LTE-A component carriers is not precluded
The L1 specification shall support carrier aggregation for both contiguous and
non-contiguous component carriers with each component carrier limited to a
maximum of 110 Resource Blocks using the Release 8 numerology
\- For contiguous carrier aggregation, the needed frequency spacing between
the contiguous component carriers will be studied by RAN WG4. This study
should include the supported number of RBs per component carrier and the
needed guard bands between and at the edges for a certain aggregation case.
\- If possible, the same solution should be used in the L1 specifications for
contiguous and non-contiguous aggregation.
It will be possible to configure a UE to aggregate a different number of
component carriers of possibly different bandwidths in the UL and the DL. In
typical TDD deployments, the number of component carriers and the bandwidth of
each component carrier in UL and DL will be the same. RAN WG4 will study the
supported combinations of aggregated component carrier and bandwidths.
## 5.1 MAC-PHY interface
From a UE perspective, there is one transport block (in absence of spatial
multiplexing) and one hybrid-ARQ entity per scheduled component carrier. Each
transport block is mapped to a single component carrier only. A UE may be
scheduled over multiple component carriers simultaneously.
## 5.2 DL control signalling
The design principles for downlink control signalling of control region size,
uplink and downlink resource assignments, and downlink HARQ ACK/NACK
indication are described below.
\- Independent control region size is applied for each component carrier. On
any carrier with a control region, Rel-8 design (modulation, coding, mapping
to resource elements) for PCFICH is reused.
\- For signalling of resource assignments for downlink (PDSCH) and uplink
(PUSCH) transmission, following mechanisms are supported,
\- PDCCH on a component carrier assigns PDSCH resources on the same component
carrier and PUSCH resources on a single linked UL component carrier. Rel-8
PDCCH structure (same coding, same CCE-based resource mapping) and DCI formats
are used on each component carrier.
\- PDCCH on a component carrier can assign PDSCH or PUSCH resources in one of
multiple component carriers using the carrier indicator field(CIF), where
\- Configuration for the presence of CIF is semi-static and UE specific (i.e.
not system-specific or cell-specific)
\- CIF is a fixed 3-bit field, and Rel-8 PDCCH structure (same coding, same
CCE-based resource mapping) is reused.
\- CIF location is fixed irrespective of DCI format size
\- Cross-carrier assignments can be configured both when the DCI formats have
the same or different sizes
\- Explicit CIF at least for the case of same DCI format size
\- There will be an upper limit on the total number of blind decodes
\- For signalling of downlink HARQ ACK/NACK indication, following principles
are applied.
\- PHICH physical transmission aspects from Rel-8 (orthogonal code design,
modulation, scrambling sequence, mapping to resource elements) are reused.
\- PHICH is transmitted only on the downlink component carrier that was used
to transmit the UL grant
\- At least in case that the number of downlink component carriers are more
than or equal to that of uplink component carriers and no carrier indicator
field is used, the Rel-8 PHICH resource mapping rule is reused.
## 5.3 UL control signalling
The design principles for uplink control signalling of HARQ ACK/NACK,
scheduling request and channel state information (CSI) on PUCCH are described
below.
\- The Rel-10 PUCCH design supports up to five DL component carriers.
\- For signalling of HARQ ACK/NACK on PUCCH for downlink (PDSCH) transmission,
following mechanisms are supported:
\- All HARQ ACK/NACK for a UE can be transmitted on PUCCH in absence of PUSCH
transmission.
\- In general, transmission of one ACK/NACK for each DL component carrier
transport block is supported.
\- In case of power limitation, limited transmission of ACK/NACK for the DL
component carrier transport blocks is supported.
\- The design of the ACK/NACK resource allocation should consider performance
and power control aspects, while not aiming to optimise for the case of large
number of UEs being simultaneously scheduled on multiple DL component
carriers.
\- The scheduling request is transmitted on PUCCH and is semi-statically
mapped onto one UE specific UL component carrier.
\- Periodic CSI reporting on PUCCH is supported for up to five DL component
carriers. The CSI is semi-statically mapped onto one UE specific UL component
carrier and the design follows the Rel-8 principles for CQI/PMI/RI,
considering ways to reduce reporting overhead or to extend CSI payload.
# 6 Uplink transmission scheme
## **_6.1 Uplink spatial multiplexing_**
Uplink spatial multiplexing of up to four layers is supported by LTE-Advanced.
In the uplink single user spatial multiplexing, up to two transport blocks can
be transmitted from a scheduled UE in a subframe per uplink component carrier.
Each transport block has its own MCS level. Depending on the number of
transmission layers, the modulation symbols associated with each of the
transport blocks are mapped onto one or two layers according to the same
principle as in Rel-8 E-UTRA downlink spatial multiplexing. The transmission
rank can be adapted dynamically. It is possible to configure the uplink single
user spatial multiplexing transmission with or without the layer shifting. In
case of the layer shifting, shifting in time domain is supported.
If layer shifting is configured, the HARQ-ACKs for all transport blocks are
bundled into a single HARQ-ACK. One-bit ACK is transmitted to the UE if all
transport blocks are successfully decoded by the eNodeB. Otherwise, one-bit
NACK is transmitted to the UE.
If layer shifting is not configured, each transport block has its own HARQ-ACK
feedback signalling.
For FDD and TDD, precoding is performed according to a predefined codebook. If
layer shifting is not configured, precoding is applied after the layer
mapping. If layer shifting is configured, precoding is applied after the layer
shifting operation. Application of a single precoding matrix per uplink
component carrier is supported. In case of full-rank transmission, only
identity precoding matrix is supported. For uplink spatial multiplexing with
two transmit antennas, 3-bit precoding codebook as defined in Table 6.1-1 is
used.

transmit antennas

For uplink spatial multiplexing with four transmit antennas, a 6-bit precoding
codebook is used. The subset of the precoding codebook used for 1-layer
transmission is defined in Table 6.1-2. The baseline for the subset of the
precoding codebook used for 2-layer transmission is defined in Table 6.1-3.
For 3-layer transmission, the number of precoding matrices is 20, and only
BPSK or QPSK alphabets are used for non-zero elements in precoding matrices.

four transmit antennas: precoding matrices for 1-layer transmission.

## 6.2 Uplink transmit diversity
For UEs with multiple transmit antennas, an uplink Single Antenna Port Mode is
defined, where the UE behaviour is same as the one with single antenna from
eNodeB's perspective. For a given UE, the uplink Single Antenna Port Mode can
be independently configured for its PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS transmissions.
The uplink Single Antenna Port Mode is the default mode before eNodeB is aware
of the UE transmit antenna configuration.
### 6.2.1 Transmit Diversity for Uplink Control Channel
For uplink control channels with Rel-8 PUCCH format 1/1a/1b, the spatial
orthogonal-resource transmit diversity (SORTD) scheme is supported for
transmissions with two antenna ports. In this transmit diversity scheme, the
same modulation symbol from the uplink channel is transmitted from two antenna
ports, on two separate orthogonal resources.
For the UE with four transmit antennas, the 2-tx transmit diversity scheme is
applied.
## 6.3 Uplink multiple access
DFT-precoded OFDM is the transmission scheme used for PUSCH both in absence
and presence of spatial multiplexing. In case of multiple component carriers,
there is one DFT per component carrier. Both frequency-contiguous and
frequency-non-contiguous resource allocation is supported on each component
carrier.
Simultaneous transmission of uplink L1/L2 control signalling and data is
supported through two mechanisms
\- Control signalling is multiplexed with data on PUSCH according to the same
principle as in Rel-8
\- Control signalling is transmitted on PUCCH simultaneously with data on
PUSCH
## 6.4 Uplink reference signals
Similar to LTE, two types of uplink reference signals are supported by LTE-
Advanced:
\- Demodulation reference signal
\- Sounding reference signal
The precoding applied for the demodulation reference signal is the same as the
one applied for the PUSCH. Cyclic shift separation is the primary multiplexing
scheme of the demodulation reference signals.
The baseline for sounding reference signal in LTE-Advanced operation is non-
precoded and antenna-specific. For multiplexing of the sounding reference
signals, Rel-8 principles are reused.
## 6.5 Uplink power control
Scope of uplink power control in LTE-Advanced is similar to Rel'8:
\- UL power control mainly compensates for slow-varying channel conditions
while reducing the interference generated towards neighboring cells
\- Fractional path-loss compensation or full path-loss compensation is used on
PUSCH and full path-loss compensation on PUCCH
LTE-Advanced supports component carrier specific UL power control for both
contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation for closed-loop case, and
for open loop at least for the cases that the number of downlink component
carriers is more than or equal to that of uplink component carriers.
# 7 Downlink transmission scheme
## 7.1 Physical channel mapping
LTE-Advanced supports the PDSCH to be mapped also to MBSFN (non-control)
region of MBSFN subframes that are not used for MBMS
\- In case of PDSCH mapping to MBSFN subframes, both normal and extended
cyclic prefix can be used for control and data region, same CP length is used
for control and data
\- Relation between CP length of normal and MBSFN subframes in the control
region is the same as in Rel-8
## **_7.2 Downlink spatial multiplexing_**
Downlink spatial multiplexing of up to eight layers is supported byLTE-
Advanced.
In the downlink 8-by-X single user spatial multiplexing, up to two transport
blocks can be transmitted to a scheduled UE in a subframe per downlink
component carrier. Each transport block is assigned its own modulation and
coding scheme. For HARQ ACK/NAK feedback on uplink, one bit is used for each
transport block.
A transport block is associated with a codeword. For up to four layers, the
codeword-to-layer mapping is according to subclause 6.3.3.2 of TS 36.211. For
above four layers as well as the case of mapping one codeword to three or four
layers, which is for retransmission of one out of two codewords that were
initially transmitted with more than four layers, the layer mapping shall be
done according to Table 7.2-1.. Complex-valued modulation symbols
$d^{(q)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d^{(q)}(M_{\text{symb}}^{(q)} - 1)$ for
code word $q$ shall be mapped onto the layers$x(i) = \begin{bmatrix}
x^{(0)}(i) & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & x^{(\upsilon - 1)}(i) \
\end{bmatrix}^{T}$, $i =
0,1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},M_{\text{symb}}^{\text{layer}} - 1$ where
$\upsilon$ is the number of layers and $M_{\text{symb}}^{\text{layer}}$ is the
number of modulation symbols per layer.

mapping one codeword to three or four layers

### 7.2.1 Feedback in support of downlink spatial multiplexing
The baseline for feedback in support of downlink single-cell single-user
spatial multiplexing is codebook-based precoding feedback.
## **_7.3 Enhanced multiuser MIMO transmission_**
Enhanced multi-user MIMO transmission is supported in LTE-Advanced. Basic
principle of MU-MIMO in LTE-Advanced is as follows:
> \- Switching between SU- and MU-MIMO transmission is possible without RRC
> reconfiguration
## **_7.4 Downlink reference signals_**
Two types of downlink reference signals are considered for LTE-Advanced:
\- Reference signals targeting PDSCH demodulation
\- Reference signals targeting CSI estimation (for CQI/PMI/RI/etc reporting
when needed)
The reference signal structure can be used to support multiple LTE-Advanced
features, e.g. CoMP and spatial multiplexing.
### 7.4.1 Demodulation reference signal
Reference signals targeting PDSCH demodulation are:
\- UE-specific, i.e, the PDSCH and the demodulation reference signals intended
for a specific UE are subject to the same precoding operation.
\- Present only in resource blocks and layers scheduled by the eNodeB for
transmission.
\- Reference signals transmitted on different layers are mutually orthogonal
at the eNodeB.
The design principle for the demodulation reference signals is an extension to
multiple layers of the concept of Rel-8 UE-specific reference signals used for
beamforming (details on pattern, location, etc are FFS). Complementary use of
Rel-8 cell-specific reference signals by the UE is not precluded.
**Normal subframes with normal CP:**
For rank 1and 2, the same DM-RS structure (including patterns, spreading and
scrambling) as in LTE Rel-9 is used, as illustrated in Figure 7.3.1-1. For
rank 2, DM-RS for 1st layer and that for 2nd layer are multiplexed by means of
code division multiplexing (CDM) by using orthogonal cover code (OCC) over two
consecutive resource elements (blue) in time domain.

For rank 3 and 4, the DM-RS pattern is illustrated in Figure 7.3.1-2. DM-RS
for 1st layer and that for 2nd layer are multiplexed by means of CDM by using
OCC over two consecutive resource elements (blue) in time domain. DM-RS for
3rd layer and that for 4th layer are multiplexed by means of CDM by using OCC
over two consecutive resource elements (green) in time domain. DM-RS for 1st
and 2nd layers and that for 3rd and 4th layers are multiplexed by means of
frequency division multiplexing (FDM).

### 7.4.2 CSI reference signal
Reference signals targeting CSI estimation are
\- cell specific
\- sparse in frequency and time.
\- punctured into the data region of normal/MBSFN subframe
## **_7.5 Downlink transmit diversity_**
For the downlink transmit diversity with more than four transmit antennas
applied to PDCCH, and PDSCH in non-MBSFN subframes, the Rel-8 transmit
diversity scheme is used.
# 8 Coordinated multiple point transmission and reception
Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission/reception is considered for LTE-
Advanced as a tool to improve the coverage of high data rates, the cell-edge
throughput and/or to increase system throughput in both high load and low load
scenarios.
## **_8.1 Downlink coordinated multi-point transmission_**
### 8.1.1 Terminology and definitions
Downlink coordinated multi-point transmission implies dynamic coordination
among multiple geographically separated transmission points.
General terminology:
\- Serving cell: Cell transmitting PDCCH assignments (a single cell). This is
the serving cell of Rel-8 (concept that already exists)
CoMP categories:
\- Joint Processing (JP): data is available at each point in CoMP cooperating
set (definition below)
\- Joint Transmission: PDSCH transmission from multiple points (part of or
entire CoMP cooperating set) at a time
\- data to a single UE is simultaneously transmitted from _multiple_
transmission points, e.g. to (coherently or non-coherently) improve the
received signal quality and/or cancel actively interference for other UEs
\- Dynamic cell selection: PDSCH transmission from one point at a time (within
CoMP cooperating set)
\- Coordinated Scheduling/Beamforming (CS/CB): data is only available at
serving cell (data transmission from that point) but user
scheduling/beamforming decisions are made with coordination among cells
corresponding to the CoMP cooperating set.
CoMP sets:
\- CoMP cooperating set
\- Set of (geographically separated) points directly or indirectly
participating in PDSCH transmission to UE. Note that this set may or need not
be transparent to the UE.
\- CoMP transmission point(s): point or set of points actively transmitting
PDSCH to UE
\- CoMP transmission point(s) is a subset of the CoMP cooperating set
\- For Joint transmission, the CoMP transmission points are the points in the
CoMP cooperating set
\- For Dynamic cell selection, a single point is the transmission point at
every subframe. This transmission point can change dynamically within the CoMP
cooperating set.
\- For Coordinated scheduling/beamforming, the CoMP transmission point
corresponds to the "serving cell"
> \- CoMP measurement set: set of cells about which channel state/statistical
> information related to their link to the UE is reported as discussed in
> subclause 8.1.3
\- The CoMP measurement set may be the same as the CoMP cooperating set
\- The actual UE reports may down-select cells for which actual feedback
information is transmitted (reported cells)
In addition, we have**:**
RRM measurement set: in support of RRM measuremets (already in Rel-8) and
therefore not CoMP specific
### 8.1.2 Radio-interface specification areas
Downlink coordinated multi-point transmission should include the possibility
of coordination between different cells. From a radio-interface perspective,
there is no difference from the UE perspective if the cells belong to the same
eNodeB or different eNodeBs. If inter-eNodeB coordination is supported,
information needs to be signalled between eNodeBs.
Potential impact on the radio-interface specifications is foreseen in mainly
three areas:
\- Feedback and measurement mechanisms from the UE
\- Reporting of dynamic channel conditions between the multiple transmission
points and the UE
\- For TDD, channel reciprocity may be exploited
\- Reporting to facilitate the decision on the set of participating
transmission points
\- For TDD, channel reciprocity may be exploited
\- Preprocessing schemes
\- Joint processing prior to transmission of the signal over the multiple
transmission points
\- Downlink control signaling to support the transmission scheme
\- Reference signal design
\- Depending on the transmission scheme, specification of additional reference
signals may be required.
> \- CSI RS design should take potential needs of DL CoMP into account
New forms of feedback and signaling may be needed to support CoMP that are,
for example, configured by RRC for a given UE.
\- As baseline, the network need not explicitly signal to the UE the CoMP
transmission point(s) and the UE reception/demodulation of CoMP transmissions
(CS/CB, or JP with MBSFN subframes) is the same as that for non CoMP (SU/MU-
MIMO)."
\- Any additional feedback designed for CoMP shall be consistent with the
feedback framework for SU/MU-MIMO.
### 8.1.3 Feedback in support of DL CoMP
The three main categories of CoMP feedback mechanisms have been identified to
be:
\- Explicit channel state/statistical information feedback
\- Channel as observed by the receiver, without assuming any transmission or
receiver processing
\- Implicit channel state/statistical information feedback
\- feedback mechanisms that use hypotheses of different transmission and/or
reception processing, e.g., CQI/PMI/RI
\- UE transmission of SRS can be used for CSI estimation at eNB exploiting
channel reciprocity.
Combinations of full or subset of above three are possible.
Look at these types of feedback mechanisms for the evaluations. UL overhead
(number of bits) associated with each specific feedback mechanism needs to be
identified. The feedback overhead (UL) vs, DL performance tradeoff should be
assessed with the goal to target minimum overhead for a given performance.
For the CoMP schemes that require feedback, individual per-cell feedback is
considered as baseline. Complementary inter-cell feedback might be needed. UE
CoMP feedback reports target the serving cell (on UL resources from serving
cell) as baseline when X2 interface is available and is adequate for CoMP
operation in terms of latency and capacity. In this case, the reception of UE
reports at cells other than the serving cell is a network implementation
choice.
The feedback reporting for cases with X2 interface not available or not
adequate (latency and capacity), and for cases where feedback reports to the
serving cell causes large interference (e.g., in heteronegenous deployment
scenarios) for CoMP operation needs to be discussed and, if found needed, a
solution needs to be identified.
Do not have to confine the CoMP studies to payload sizes currently supported
by PUCCH operation..
Two possibilities should be studied the "container" of the DL CoMP feedback:
\- Expand the supported PUCCH payload sizes
\- Use periodic/a-periodic reports on PUSCH
#### 8.1.3.1 Explicit Feedback in support of DL CoMP
This subclause lists different forms of explicit feedback in support of DL
CoMP. They are all characterized by having a channel part and a noise-and-
interference part.
**Channel part** :
\- For each cell in the UE's measurement set that is reported in a given
subframe, one or several channel properties are reported
\- Channel properties include (but are not limited to) the following ('i' is
the cell index):
\- Channel matrix (Hi) -- short term (instantaneous)
\- The full matrix Hi, or
\- main eigen component(s) of Hi
\- Transmit channel covariance (Ri), where Ri = (sum{Hijâ€ Hij})/J,
j=0,1,2,...,J-1, ('j' is span over time or frequency)
\- The full matrix Ri, or
\- main eigen component(s) of Ri
\- Inter-cell channel properties may also be reported
**Noise-and interference part** , e.g.,
\- Interference outside the
\- cells reported by the UE
\- CoMP transmission points
\- Total receive power (Io) or total received signal covariance matrix
\- Covariance matrix of the noise-and-interference
\- the full matrix, or
\- main eigen component(s)
#### 8.1.3.2 Implicit Feedback in support of DL CoMP
This subclause lists different forms of implicit feedback in support of DL
CoMP.
\- There are hypotheses at the UE and the feedback is based on one or a
combination of two or more of the following, e.g.:
\- Single vs. Multi user MIMO
\- Single cell vs. Coordinated transmission
\- Within coordinated transmission: Single point (CB/CS) vs. multi-point (JP)
transmission
> Within Joint processing CoMP:
\- Subsets of transmission points or subsets of reported cells (Joint
Transmission)
\- CoMP transmission point(s) (Dynamic Cell Selection)
\- Transmit precoder (i.e. tx weights)
\- JP: multiple single-cell or multi-cell PMI capturing coherent or non-
coherent channel across reported cells
\- CB/CS: Single-cell or multiple single-cell PMIs capturing channel from the
reported cell(s) to the UE
> \- Transmit precoder based on or derived from the PMI weight
\- Other types of feedbacks, e.g. main Multi-cell eigen-component, instead of
PMI are being considered
\- Receive processing (i.e. rx weights)
\- Interference based on particular tx/rx processing
There may be a need for the UE to convey to the network the hypothesis or
hypotheses used (explicit signalling of hypothesis to eNB). And/or, there may
be a semi-static hypothesis configuration e.g. grouping of hypotheses
(explicit signalling of hypothesis to the UE). And/or, precoded RS may be used
to allow UE to generate refined CQI/RI feedback
8.1.3.3 UE transmission of SRS in support of DL CoMP
This subclause lists UE transmission of SRS related feedback in support of DL
CoMP. UE transmission of SRS can be used for CSI estimation at multiple cells
exploiting channel reciprocity. Enhanced SRS schemes may be considered.
### 8.1.4 Overhead in support of DL CoMP operation
DL CoMP operation overhead is very much related to the DL-RS structure (see
subclause 7.2).
\- Studies on CSI RS impact on PDSCH transmissions to Rel-8 UEs for various RS
densities needed
\- There should be no impact from CSI RS transmission on transmission of
PBCH/PSS/SSS
## 8.2 **_Uplink coordinated multi-point reception_**
Coordinated multi-point reception implies coordination among multiple,
geographically separated points. Uplink coordinated multi-point reception is
expected to have very limited impact on the RAN1 specifications. Uplink CoMP
reception can involve joint reception (JR) of the transmitted signal at
multiple reception points and/or coordinated scheduling (CS) decisions among
cells to control interference and may have some RAN1 specification impact.
The need for extended CP operation in certain UL subframes should be further
investigated.
# 9 Relaying functionality
Relaying is considered for LTE-Advanced as a tool to improve e.g. the coverage
of high data rates, group mobility, temporary network deployment, the cell-
edge throughput and/or to provide coverage in new areas.
The relay node is wirelessly connected to the radio-access network via a
_donor cell_. With respect to the relay node's usage of spectrum, its
operation can be classified into:
_\- inband_ , in which case the eNB -relay link shares the same carrier
frequency with relay-UE links. Rel-8 UEs should be able to connect to the
donor cell in this case.
_\- outband_ , in which case the eNB-relay link does not operate in the same
carrier frequency as relay-UE links. Rel-8 UEs should be able to connect to
the donor cell in this case.
For both inband and outband relaying, it shall be possible to operate the eNB-
to-relay link on the same carrier frequency as eNB-to-UE links
With respect to the knowledge in the UE, relays can be classified into
_\- transparent_ , in which case the UE is not aware of whether or not it
communicates with the network via the relay.
_\- non-transparent_ , in which case the UE is aware of whether or not it is
communicating with the network via the relay.
Depending on the relaying strategy, a relay may
\- be part of the donor cell
\- control cells of its own
In the case the relay is part of the donor cell, the relay does not have a
cell identity of its own (but may still have a relay ID). At least part of the
RRM is controlled by the eNodeB to which the donor cell belongs, while parts
of the RRM may be located in the relay. In this case, a relay should
preferably support also LTE Rel-8 UEs. Smart repeaters, decode-and-forward
relays, different types of L2 relays, and Type 2 relay are examples of this
type of relaying.
In the case the relay is in control of cells of its own, the relay controls
one or several cells and a unique physical-layer cell identity is provided in
each of the cells controlled by the relay. The same RRM mechanisms are
available and from a UE perspective there is no difference in accessing cells
controlled by a relay and cells controlled by a "normal" eNodeB. The cells
controlled by the relay should support also LTE Rel-8 UEs. Self-backhauling
(L3 relay), "Type 1 relay nodes", "Type 1a relay nodes", and "Type 1b relay
nodes" use this type of relaying.
At least "Type 1" and "Type 1a" relay nodes are part of LTE-Advanced.
A "Type 1" relay node is an inband relaying node characterized by the
following:
\- It control cells, each of which appears to a UE as a separate cell distinct
from the donor cell
\- The cells shall have their own Physical Cell ID (defined in LTE Rel-8) and
the relay node shall transmit its own synchronization channels, reference
symbols, ...
\- In the context of single-cell operation, the UE shall receive scheduling
information and HARQ feedback directly from the relay node and send its
control channels (SR/CQI/ACK) to the relay node
\- It shall appear as a Rel-8 eNodeB to Rel-8 UEs (i.e. be backwards
compatible)
\- To LTE-Advanced UEs, it should be possible for a relay node to appear
differently than Rel-8 eNodeB to allow for further performance enhancement.
"Type 1a" and "Type 1b" relay nodes are characterised by the same set of
features as the "Type 1" relay node above, except "Type 1a" operates outband
and "Type 1b" operates inband with adequate antenna isolation. A "Type 1a"
relay node is expected to have little or no impact on RAN1 specifications.
A "Type 2" relay node is an inband relaying node characterized by the
following:
\- It does not have a separate Physical Cell ID and thus would not create any
new cells.
\- It is transparent to Rel-8 UEs; a Rel-8 UE is not aware of the presence of
a Type 2 relay node.
\- It can transmit PDSCH.
\- At least, it does not transmit CRS and PDCCH.
## 9.1 Relay-eNodeB link for inband relay
### 9.1.1 Resource partitioning for relay-eNodeB link
In order to allow inband relaying, some resources in the time-frequency space
are set aside for the backhaul link (Un) and cannot be used for the access
link (Uu). At least the following scheme will be supported for this resource
partitioning:
General principle for resource partitioning at the relay:
\- eNB â†’ RN and RN â†’ UE links are time division multiplexed in a single
carrier frequency (only one is active at any time)
\- RN â†’ eNB and UE â†’ RN links are time division multiplexed in a single
carrier frequency (only one is active at any time)
Multiplexing of backhaul links in FDD:
\- eNB â†’ RN transmissions are done in the DL frequency band
\- RN â†’ eNB transmissions are done in the UL frequency band
Multiplexing of back haul links in TDD:
\- eNB â†’ RN transmissions are done in the DL subframes of the eNB and RN
\- RN â†’ eNB transmissions are done in the UL subframes of the eNB and RN
### 9.1.2 Backward compatible backhaul partitioning
Due to the relay transmitter causing interference to its own receiver,
simultaneous eNodeB-to-relay and relay-to-UE transmissions on the same
frequency resource may not be feasible unless sufficient isolation of the
outgoing and incoming signals is provided e.g. by means of specific, well
separated and well isolated antenna structures. Similarly, at the relay it may
not be possible to receive UE transmissions simultaneously with the relay
transmitting to the eNodeB.
One possibility to handle the interference problem is to operate the relay
such that the relay is not transmitting to terminals when it is supposed to
receive data from the donor eNodeB, i.e. to create "gaps" in the relay-to-UE
transmission. These "gaps" during which terminals (including Rel-8 terminals)
are not supposed to expect any relay transmission can be created by
configuring MBSFN subframes as exemplified in Figure 9.1.2-1. Relay-to-eNodeB
transmissions can be facilitated by not allowing any terminal-to-relay
transmissions in some subframes.
Figure 9.1.2-1: Example of relay-to-UE communication using normal subframes
(left) and eNodeB-to-relay communication using MBSFN subframes (right).
### 9.1.3 Backhaul resource assignment
In case of downlink backhaul in downlink resources, the following is valid
\- At the RN, the access link downlink subframe boundary is aligned with the
backhaul link downlink subframe boundary, except for possible adjustment to
allow for RN transmit/receive switching
\- The set of downlink backhaul subframes, during which downlink backhaul
transmission may occur, is semi-statically assigned
\- The set of uplink backhaul subframes, during which uplink backhaul
transmission may occur, can be semi-statically assigned, or implicitly derived
from the downlink backhaul subframes using the HARQ timing relationship
\- A new physical control channel (here referred to as the "R-PDCCH") is used
to dynamically or "semi-persistently" assign resources, within the semi-
statically assigned sub-frames, for the downlink backhaul data (corresponding
to the "R-PDSCH" physical channel). The R-PDCCH may assign downlink resources
in the same and/or in one or more later subframes.
\- The "R-PDCCH" is also used to dynamically or "semi-persistently" assign
resources for the uplink backhaul data (the "R-PUSCH" physical channel). The
R-PDCCH may assign uplink resources in one or more later subframes.
\- Within the PRBs semi-statically assigned for R-PDCCH transmission, a subset
of the resources is used for each R-PDCCH. The actual overall set of resources
used for R-PDCCH transmission within the above mentioned semi-statically
assigned PRBs may vary dynamically between subframes. These resources may
correspond to the full set of OFDM symbols available for the backhaul link or
be constrained to a subset of these OFDM symbols. The resources that are not
used for R-PDCCH within the above mentioned semi-statically assigned PRBs may
be used to carry R-PDSCH or PDSCH.
\- The detailed R-PDCCH transmitter processing (channel coding, interleaving,
multiplexing, etc.) should reuse Rel-8 functionality to the extent possible,
but allow removing some unnecessary procedure or bandwidth-wasting procedure
by considering the relay property.
\- If the "search space" approach of R8 is used for the backhaul link, use of
common search space, which can be semi-statically configured (and potentially
includes entire system bandwidth), is the baseline. If RN-specific search
space is configured, it could be implicitly or explicitly known by RN.
\- The R-PDCCH is transmitted starting from an OFDM symbol within the subframe
that is late enough so that the relay can receive it.
\- "R-PDSCH" and "R-PDCCH" can be transmitted within the same PRBs or within
separated PRBs.
\- No "R-PCFICH" exists for indication of backhaul control region size in time
and frequency domains
## 9.2 Relay-eNodeB link for outband relay
If relay-eNB and relay-UE links are isolated enough in frequency (possibly
with help of additional means such as antenna separation), then there is no
interference issue in activating both links simultaneously. Therefore, it
becomes possible for relay-eNodeB link to reuse the channels designed for UE-
eNodeB link.
## 9.3 Relay-eNodeB link for inband relay Type 1b
If the outgoing and incoming signals at the relay are adequately isolated in
the spatial domain, e.g., by appropriate arrangement of the respective
antennas for the Un and Uu links, the eNBâ†’ RN and RNâ†’ UE (RNâ†’ eNB and UEâ†’ RN)
links can be activated simultaneously without the need for the time division
multiplexing. The operation of Type 1b relay nodes may not be supported in all
deployment scenarios.
# **9A Heterogeneous deployments**
Heterogeneous deployments consist of deployments where low power nodes are
placed throughout a macro-cell layout. Different scenarios under consideration
that could occur in heterogeneous deployments are discussed in Appendix
A.2.1.1.2
The interference characteristics in a heterogeneous deployment can be
significantly different than in a homogeneous deployment. Examples hereof are
given in Figure 9A-1. In case (a), a macro user with no access to the CSG cell
will be interfered by the HeNB, in case (b) a macro user causes severe
interference towards the HeNB and in case (c), a CSG user is interfered by
another CSG HeNB. On the right hand side, case (d), path-loss based cell
association (e.g. by using biased RSRP reports) may improve the uplink but at
the cost of increasing the downlink interference of non-macro users at the
cell edge.
Figure 9A-1: Examples of interference scenarios in heterogeneous deployments.
In these scenarios, preliminary results indicate that methods for handling the
uplink and downlink interference towards data as well as L1/L2 control
signaling, synchronization signals and reference signals are important. Such
methods may operate in time, frequency and/or spatial domains.
## **_9A.1 Rel-8/9 schemes_**
Several methods for handling the above-mentioned interference scenarios using
the functionality present in Rel-8/9 can be envisioned. Examples hereof
include using different carrier frequencies for different cell layers, or, if
the same carrier is used across different cell layers, by restricting the
transmission power during part of the time for at least one cell layer to
reduce interference to control signalling on other cell layers or through
different power control schemes as discussed in [TR36.921]. Enhancements to
these types of schemes can be considered in releases beyond Rel-9.
## **_9A.2 Non-Rel-8/9 schemes_**
A common property of the non-Rel-8/9 schemes below is that they provide means
for coordination of the control channel interference between cell layers.
Examples of some mechanism that might be used for interference handling can be
found in Section 8.
### **9A.2.1 CA-based scheme**
Carrier aggregation (CA) with cross-carrier scheduling using CIF , described
in Section 5.2 and agreed to be part of Rel-10, can be used for heterogeneous
deployments. Downlink interference for control signaling can be handled by
partitioning component carriers in each cell layer into two sets, one set used
for data and control and one set used mainly for data and possibly control
signaling with reduced transmission power. One example is illustrated in
Figure 9A.2.1-1. For the data part, downlink interference coordination
techniques can be used. Rel-8/9 terminals can be scheduled on one component
carrier while Rel-10 terminal capable of carrier aggregation can be scheduled
on multiple component carriers. Time synchronization between the cell layers
is assumed in this example.
Figure 9A.2.1-1: One example of carrier aggregation applies to heterogeneous
deployments.
### **9A.2.2 Non-CA based schemes**
Several schemes for control-channel interference handling not relying on
carrier aggregation can be envisioned, including, but not limited to, time-
domain and frequency-domain schemes.
In a time-domain scheme, interference handling for downlink control signalling
can be achieved by restricting the transmission during part of the time,
possibly in combination with time shifting, for at least one cell layer to
reduce interference to control signalling on other cell layers. Time
synchronization between the cell layers is assumed in this approach.
In a frequency-domain scheme, the downlink control signalling is transmitted
over part of the carrier bandwidth. Interference management can be achieved by
using different parts of the carrier bandwidth for control signalling in
different cell layers. Time synchronization between the cell layers is
assumed.
# 10 Evaluation of techniques for Advanced E-UTRA
Section 10.1 presents the evaluation results of the techniques for advanced
E-UTRA against the 3GPP targets [3]. The evaluation results in Section 10.2
are in support of the submission of the 3GPP \"_LTE Release 10 & beyond (LTE-
Advanced)\"_ to the ITU-R as a candidate technology for the IMT-Advanced.
## 10.1 Cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency against
3GPP target
Cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency are evaluated
through extensive simulations conducted by a number of companies. The tables
in the following subclauses show the simulation results focusing on LTE-
Advanced configurations, i.e., downlink and uplink MU-MIMO, downlink and
uplink CoMP, and uplink SU-MIMO.
Tables 10.1-1, 2, 3, and 4 show the source specific simulation parameters that
characterize the performances of downlink FDD, downlink TDD, uplink FDD, and
uplink TDD, respectively. Note, however, that the performance differences
among sources could also be explained by other factors such as detailed signal
processing algorithms at the transmitter and the receiver.
In the tables for downlink, control channel (CCH) duration (_L_ OFDM symbols)
and the number of the MBSFN subframes are the factors that affect the
overhead. In the MBSFN subframes, there are no CRS in data regions, which
effectively reduce the overhead. Channel estimation and receiver types are the
factors that affect the demodulation performance. CSI-assumption at eNB is the
factor that characterizes the transmit signal processing at eNB for MU-MIMO
and CoMP schemes. In the tables for uplink, the PUCCH bandwidth is the factor
that affects the overhead.

## 10.2 Cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency for ITU-R
requirements
Cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency are evaluated
through extensive simulations conducted by a number of companies. The
simulation assumptions applied in the following evaluations are shown in Annex
A.3. Detailed information covering a range of possible configurations is
provided in Annex A.4 and [5]. The tables in the following subclauses show the
simulation results focusing on LTE-Advanced configurations, i.e., downlink and
uplink MU-MIMO, downlink and uplink CoMP, and uplink SU-MIMO.
Tables 10.2-1, 2, 3, and 4 show the source specific simulation parameters that
characterize the performances of downlink FDD, downlink TDD, uplink FDD, and
uplink TDD, respectively. Note, however, that the performance differences
among sources could also be explained by other factors such as detailed signal
processing algorithms at the transmitter and the receiver. More detailed
assumption on each component is shown in [5].

Tables 10.2.3.2-1 and 10.2.3.2-2 show the spectrum efficiency results of
4-by-2 MU-MIMO schemes with eNB antenna configuration (C) and (A),
respectively. Results show that the MU-MIMO schemes satisfy the ITU-R

###### ### Annex A: Simulation model
## A.1 Link simulation scenarios
Link simulation analyses with (8x8) DL MIMO configuration can be conducted in
relation to studies concerning the peak data rate requirements set forth in
[36.913].
## A.2 System simulation scenarios
### A.2.1 System simulation assumptions
#### A.2.1.1 Reference system deployments
This subclause describes the reference system deployments to use for the
different system evaluations.
##### A.2.1.1.1 Homogeneous deployments
The minimum set of simulation cases is given in Table A.2.1.1-1 along with
additional assumptions related to carrier frequency (CF), Inter-site distance
(ISD), operating bandwidth (BW), penetration loss (PLoss) and UE speed.
For 3GPP cases only, the system simulation baseline parameters for the macro-
cell deployment model are as specified in [TR 25.814], with the modifications
given in Table A.2.1.1-2.
For the ITU cases, simulation parameters should be aligned with the ITU
guidelines in [IMT Eval], some of which are reflected in Table A.2.1.1-1. Note
that [IMT.EVAL] subclause-8 defines different antenna horizontal and vertical
pattern from those defined in Table A.2.1.1-2 which is for 3GPP case
evaluation only.

##### A.2.1.1.2 Heterogeneous deployments
Heterogeneous deployments consist of deployments where low power nodes are
placed throughout a macro-cell layout. A subset of the macro-cell layouts
described in subclause A.2.1.1.1 could be used for heterogeneous network
deployments evaluation. For calibration purpose, the following cases should be
used
\- Case 1
\- Case 3- Rural/high speed
To assess the benefit of adding low-power nodes to become a heterogeneous
network, performance comparison should be made to homogeneous macro-cell only
deployment.
The categorization of the low power nodes is as described in Table
A.2.1.1.2-1.

Femto cells) No X2 as baseline (*) Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Placed
indoors. Consumer deployed. Relay nodes Through air-interface with a macro-
cell (for in-band RN case) Open to all UEs Placed indoors or outdoors
* * *
Note: The reference to new nodes in this TR and its corresponding
characteristics are applicable to evaluations in this TR only.
(*): Baseline is in accordance to Rel-8/9 assumption. Evaluations with
interference management for HeNBs (via X2 or other means) allowed to assess
interference management benefits
Table A.2.1.1.2-2 presents the baseline deployment scenario for Heterogeneous
network.

Outdoor relay 6.2 Macro + outdoor RRH/Hotzone e.g., outdoor pico
* * *
Note 1: Priorities are as follows:
1) Indoor HeNB clusters
2) Outdoor Hotzone cells with configuration #1 and #4 (in Table A.2.1.1.2-4)
3) Indoor Hotzone scenario (RAN4 femto or pico models could be used)
4) Other scenarios can be studied with lower priority
Note 2: Relay deployment scenario (5.2, 6.1) are studied separately.
Table A.2.1.1.2-3 presents the baseline parameters for initial evaluations in
heterogeneous networks. More detailed modelling of new nodes propagation and
channel model based on IMT.EVAL should be considered for performance
evaluation at a later stage.

*1 Outdoor RRH/Hotzone model 1 is based on TR 25.814 and IMT.EVAL UMi NLOS model, outdoor relay and outdoor RRH/Hotzone model 2 LOS and NLOS path loss models are based on field measurements and LOS/NLOS probability functions for macro to UE and macro to relay are based on ITU models and probability functions for relay or pico to UE are based on field measurements; femto and indoor relay path loss is based on ITU-R M1225 single floor indoor office model. Outdoor relay antenna height for both access and backhaul link is 5m. Path loss models for case 3 with 10m antenna height are FFS.
*2 Shadowing fading value for relays is applicable to NLOS component of the path loss. Value for LOS component is FFS.
*3 Cells including macro cells of the overlay network and new nodes.
Fast fading may be modelled using any of the following:
\- No fast fading as in current TR
\- Fast fading with TU and fixed correlation matrix
\- Fast fading with ITU/SCM models or possible simplifications [ref.
R4-091103] could also be used. (Detailed proposals to be discussed, e.g.,
relevant propagation model to use with these.)
For preliminary simulation, all fast fading channel models can be applied. The
baseline fast fading model to be used for final evaluation results should be
discussed in future (or in WI).

##### A.2.1.1.3 Assumptions for Coordinated Multi point Transmission and
Reception Evaluations
Performance evaluations should at least provide details related to:
\- Cooperating scheduler
\- CoMP category
\- Feedback assumption and feedback impairment modelling
\- Backhaul assumptions
\- Time/frequency synchronization assumptions
\- Transmission modes:
\- MU-MIMO and/or SU-MIMO operation in conjunction with CoMP
\- Selection of transmission mode (assumptions on how dynamic or semi-static
the transmission mode can be selected)
\- Creation and maintenance of CoMP sets:
\- Assumptions on CoMP sets definition and creation
\- fixed vs. adaptive clusters, size of cluster...
Geometry cdf for the CoMP UE should be provided where appropriate, compared to
the geometry cdf for a non-CoMP UE.
The performance of downlink/uplink multi-point transmission and reception, and
advanced ICIC techniques is sensitive to the backhaul capacity and latency. In
general, the backhaul latency could be classified into the following
categories
\- Minimal latency (in the order of Î¼s) for eNB to RRH links
\- Low latency (\ _PL~ | 10dB | 0dB | ITU UMa | | macro BS | is | LOS~(R)= | | | | | | outside | > 103 | | | | | | | .4+24.2l | | | | | | | og10(R)_| | | | | | | > | | | | | | | > _PL~N | | | | | | | LOS~(R)= | | | | | | | > 131 | | | | | | | .1+42.8l | | | | | | | og10(R)_| | | | | | | > | | | | | | | > For | | | | | | | > 2GHz, | | | | | | | > _R _in | | | | | | | > km. | | | | | | | > | | | | | | | > Case | | | | | | | > 1: | | | | | | | > * | | | | | | | Prob(R)= | | | | | | | min(0.01 | | | | | | | 8/R,1)* | | | | | | | (1-exp(- | | | | | | | R/0.063) | | | | | | | )+exp(-R | | | | | | | /0.063)_ | | | | | | | > | | | | | | | > Case | | | | | | | > 3: | | | | | | | > _Pro | | | | | | | b(R)=exp | | | | | | | (-(R-0.0 | | | | | | | 1)/1.0)_ | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | | (2) UE | | | 20dB | | | | is | | | | | | | inside | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | UE to | (1) UE | _PL(dB)_ | 10dB | 40dB | ITU InH | | RRH | is | = | | | (NLOS) | | /Hotzone | inside a | _Max(131 | | | | | | d | .1+42.8l | | | | | | ifferent | og10(R), | | | | | | building | 147. | | | | | | as the | 4+43.3lo | | | | | | indoor | g10(R))_ | | | | | | hotzone | | | | | | | | For | | | | | | | 2GHz _, | | | | | | | R_ in km | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | | (2) UE | | | 20dB | | | | is | | | | | | | outside | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+ | | (3) UE | _PL~ | LOS: 3dB | 0dB | ITU InH | | | is | L~OS(R)= | | | | | | inside | 89.5 + | NLOS: | | | | | the same | 16.9l | 4dB | | | | | building | og10(R)_ | | | | | | as the | | | | | | | indoor | _PL | | | | | | hotzone | NLOS(R)= | | | | | | | 147 | | | | | | | .4+43.3l | | | | | | | og10(R)_ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | For | | | | | | | 2GHz _, | | | | | | | R_ in km | | | | | | | | | | | | | | _P | | | | | | | rob(R)=_ | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

#### A.2.1.2 Channel models
Annex B describes the IMT-Advanced Channel Models, which are specified in the
IMT.EVAL of ITU-R[15].
#### A.2.1.3 Traffic models
Traffic models for system performance evaluations are given in Table
A.2.1.3-1. System throughput studies shall be assessed using full-buffer
traffic model capturing continuous traffic and non-varying interference.
Additionally, evaluations with time-varying interference shall be carried out
using bursty traffic models. Table A.2.1.3-1 proposes FTP traffic models to
exercise system performance studies in bursty traffic.

##### A.2.1.3.1 FTP traffic models
Two FTP traffic models are considered as non-full buffer traffic models.
Tables A.2.1.3-2 and A.2.1.3-3 show the parameters for FTP traffic model 1 and
model 2, respectively. Figure A.2.1.3.1-1 and A.2.1.3.1-2 illustrate the user
arrival of traffic model 1 and 2, respectively. Baseline model is Model 1 with
file size of 2 Mbytes, however Model 1 with file size of 0.5 Mbytes and Model
2 with file size of 0.5 Mbytes can be also evaluated.

\- Small file size of 0.5 Mbytes can be chosen to speed-up the simulation.
\- Simulations are run for various Î» to find performance metrics covering at
least the range of HM-NCT (See A.2.1.3.2) that leads to [10%, 50%] of RU (See
A.2.1.3.2) in non-CoMP SU-MIMO.
\- Possible range of Î»: [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5] for 0.5 Mbytes, [0.12, 0.25,
0.37, 0.5, 0.625] for 2 Mbytes (See A.2.1.3.4 for more details). Range of Î»
can further be adjusted.
\- The same traffic should be simulated for CoMP and non-CoMP schemes. The
above range of Î» will cover RU from 10% to 50% for non-CoMP SU-MIMO

Range of K can further be adjusted.
\- The reading time D is the time interval between end of download of previous
file and the user request for the next file.
\- The same traffic should be simulated for evaluating CoMP and non-CoMP
schemes. The above range of K will cover RU from 10% to 50% for non-CoMP SU-
MIMO.

##### A.2.1.3.2 Performance metrics
The following performance metrics are considered for non-full buffer traffic
models.
\- Mean, 5, 50, 95 % user throughput
\- User throughput = amount of data (file size) / time needed to download data
\- time needed to download data starts when the packet is received in the
transmit buffer, and ends when the last bit of the packet is correctly
delivered to the receiver
\- Served cell throughput
\- Served cell throughput = total amount of data for all users / total amount
of observation time / number of cells
\- Harmonic mean normalized cell throughput (HM-NCT)
\- Harmonic mean normalized cell throughput = served cell throughput /
harmonic mean of the full buffer cell throughput
\- Harmonic mean of the full buffer cell throughput = average number of full
buffer users per cell / mean( 1 / full buffer user throughputs)
\- The 2% worst and 2% best users are excluded from the harmonic mean
\- Full buffer simulations are run with 10 UEs / cell
\- Normalized cell throughput (NCT)
\- Normalized cell throughput = served cell throughput / full buffer served
cell throughput
\- Resource utilization (RU)
\- Resource utilization = Number of RB per cell used by traffic during
observation time / Total number of RB per cell available for traffic over
observation time
\- In case of MU-MIMO, one RB allocated to N users within a cell is counted as
used N times
##### A.2.1.3.2.1 Reference points
Possible reference points to compare CoMP, non-CoMP, SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO
techniques:
\- R1: X% HM-NCT value that leads to 50% RU for SU-MIMO (i.e. X value is
derived from the SU-MIMO case, and is then the same for all techniques)
\- R2: Traffic load that gives 50% RU for SU-MIMO
\- R3: 45% NCT
Reference point R1 may be a baseline point. However, the results should be
obtained at the other reference points to gain understanding about how these
new metrics relate to each other. R1 and R3 capture both the user throughput
and cell capacity gains in a reasonably well utilized network. R2 captures the
user throughput gain at a given offered load. Further refinement of adequate
reference points can be considered.
##### A.2.1.3.3 File dropping criteria
A guideline of modelling file dropping for non-full buffer traffic simulation
is given as follows.
\- Files may be dropped from the simulation either to preserve stability at
high loads, or because the radio conditions are insufficient for reliable
communication.
\- Method for ensuring queue stability in high load conditions:
\- drop a file if its transfer is not completed within a maximum transfer time
T_drop
\- T_drop = 8s for S = 0.5 Mbyte
\- T_drop = 32s for S = 2 Mbyte
\- Methods for handling HARQ retransmission failure:
\- model RLC ACK
\- if RLC ARQ is not modeled, drop the file after the maximum number of HARQ
retransmissions is reached.
\- Method to restrict the impact of users in very poor radio conditions:
\- if RLC is modelled: Remove from the system the users who experiment a MAC
error rate higher than 3%
\- a MAC error is defined as a transport block being not correctly received
after the maximum number of retransmissions.
\- do not include removed users\' throughput nor contribution to the served
cell throughput in the simulation results.
\- if RLC is not modeled: user outage is implicitly approximated by file
dropping when the maximum number of HARQ retransmissions is reached.
\- Dropping a file means:
\- the file is given zero user throughput
\- the data in the dropped file is not included in the served cell throughput
\- The amount of data dropped or not transmitted shall be recorded separately
according to whether it arises from users removed due to high MAC error rate
or other causes, and the corresponding file dropping rates shall be indicated
in the simulation results.
Alternatives methods can be considered, and should be then described.
##### A.2.1.3.4 Estimation of range ofÎ» and K
For FTP Model 1
offered traffic =Î»* S.
For LTE 2x2 10MHz, the [10%, 50%] range of resource utilization could be
covered by the range of offered traffic [2 4 6 8 10] Mbps. For a file size of
500kbyte = 4 Mbit, this corresponds to:
Î»= offered_traffic/S = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]/4 = [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5] users/s.
Î»values for file size of 2Mbytes can be computed in the same way.
For model2, the inter-arrival time is given by Tt + D with Tt file transfer
time. In this caseÎ»= 1/(Tt+D). The total offered traffic per cell is then
given by
offered traffic = Î»* K * S = K * S / (Tt + D)
Assuming download data rate of 12.5 Mbps, the file transfer (download) time Tt
is 0.32 sec for file size of 500 Kbytes = 4 Mbits. By using this rough
estimate, offered traffic is K*4/(0.32+5). When the range of offered loads is
[2 4 6 8 10], the corresponding range of K is
K = [2 4 6 8 10]/4*5.32 \~= [2 5 8 10 14] users
#### A.2.1.4 System performance metrics
For evaluations with full-buffer traffic model, the following performance
metrics need to be considered:
\- Mean user throughput
\- Throughput CDF
\- Median and 5% worst user throughput
For evaluations with bursty traffic model, the following performance metrics
need to be considered:
\- User perceived throughput (during active time), defined as the size of a
burst divided by the time between the arrival of the first packet of a burst
and the reception of the last packet of the burst
\- Average perceived throughput of a user defined as the average from all
perceived throughput for all bursts intended for this user.
\- Tail perceived throughput defined as the worst 5% perceived throughput
among all bursts intended for a user
\- User perceived throughput CDF (average and/or tail user perceived
throughput).
\- Percentage of users with [1]% or more dropped packets.
\- Median and 5% worst user perceived throughput (average and/or tail user
perceived throughput).
\- Overall average user throughput defined as average over all users perceived
throughput.
For VoIP capacity evaluations, the following performance metrics need to be
considered:
\- VoIP system capacity in form of the maximum number of satisfied users
supported per cell in downlink and uplink.
\- System capacity is defined as the number of users in the cell when more
than [95%] of the users are satisfied.
\- A VoIP user is in outage (not satisfied) if [98%] radio interface tail
latency of the user is greater than [50 ms]. This assumes an end-to-end delay
below [200 ms] for mobile-to-mobile communications.
For heterogeneous network performance evaluation, the following performance
metrics are the highest priority:
\- Existing full buffer and bursty traffic performance metrics
> \- Throughput CDFs are for all UEs, i.e., macro UEs and HeNB/pico UEs
\- Macro cell area throughput
\- Fraction of throughput over low power nodes
\- Macro and low power node serving UE throughput ratio
The following table should be included along with the simulation assumptions
accompanying all results:
* * *
Are Throughput Values based solely on an assumption of a number of trials of
_independent_ placing of UEs? Comments Yes/No If "Yes," then state the number
of trials, i.e., placing of a group of UEs in cells used. If "No," either
state the methodology by which confidence interval is achieved as well as
confidence interval and confidence level, or justify the method of user
placing in different trials.
* * *
#### A.2.1.5 Scheduling and resource allocation
Different scheduling approaches have impacts on performance and signalling
requirements.
Evaluations should include a high-level description of the scheduling and
resource allocation schemes simulated, including relevant parameter values.
For frequency or carrier specific scheduling, and multipoint transmission
schemes, any feedback approach, delay, and feedback error assumptions should
also be indicated. For uplink queue-related scheduling, similar indications
should be given for any buffer status feedback.
Evaluations should include fairness, as described in subclause A.2.1.4 above.
#### A.2.1.6 Antenna gain for a given bearing and downtilt angle
##### A.2.1.6.1 Polarized antenna modelling
In case of polarized antennas, the polarization is modelled as angle-
independent in both azimuth and elevation, in the antenna local coordinate
system. For a linearly polarized antenna, the antenna element field pattern,
in the horizontal polarization and in the vertical polarization, are given by
$F_{\varphi}\left( \varphi,\theta \right) = F_{\varphi}\left(
\varphi,\theta,\zeta \right) = \sqrt{A\left( \varphi,\theta
\right)}\text{cos}\left( \zeta \right)$ (A-1)
and
$F_{\theta}\left( \varphi,\theta \right) = F_{\theta}\left(
\varphi,\theta,\zeta \right) = \sqrt{A\left( \varphi,\theta
\right)}\text{sin}\left( \zeta \right)$, (A-2)
respectively, where $\zeta$ is the polarization slant angle[^1] and$A\left(
\varphi,\theta \right)$ is the 3D element antenna gain pattern as a function
of azimuth angle, $\varphi$ and elevation angle,{width="0.12708333333333333in"
height="0.17083333333333334in"}, which are defined in Figure A.2.1.6.1-1. Note
that the vertical and horizontal field direction are defined in terms of the
spherical basis vectors, $\hat{\theta}$ and $\hat{\varphi}$, respectively
(i.e., $F_{H}(\varphi,\theta) = F_{\varphi}(\varphi,\theta)$ and
$F_{V}(\varphi,\theta) = F_{\theta}(\varphi,\theta)$).
For 2D element antenna gain pattern:
$F_{\varphi}\left( \varphi \right) = F_{\varphi}\left( \varphi,\zeta \right) =
\sqrt{A\left( \varphi \right)}\text{cos}\left( \zeta \right)$ (A-3)
and
$F_{\theta}\left( \varphi \right) = F_{\theta}\left( \varphi,\zeta \right) =
\sqrt{A\left( \varphi \right)}\text{sin}\left( \zeta \right)$, (A-4)

##### A.2.1.6.2 Antenna gain for a given direction and mechanical tilt angle
A global coordinate system with Cartesian coordinates (_x,y,z_) and a local
("primed") coordinate system with Cartesian coordinates (_x',y',z'_) are
defined with a common origin, with the _y'_ -axis being parallel to the
y-axis; that is, the x-axis of the global coordinate system, should be aligned
with the pointing direction of the sector[^2]. The global coordinate system is
oriented with its _z_ -axis along a vertical direction, thus having its _xy_
-plane coinciding with a horizontal plane, and all directions in space (angles
of arrival and departure) are defined in the global coordinate system angular
coordinates _Î¸_ and _Ï†_ , see Figure A.2.1.6.1-1.
Assume that an antenna is installed with the antenna aperture normal direction
(and antenna main beam peak for a conventional sector antenna) in the _xz_
-plane and that the antenna radiation pattern is defined in terms of angles
$\theta'$and $\varphi'$ in the local coordinate system, with the local
coordinate system antenna-fixed.
Mechanical tilt is modeled as a rotation of the antenna-fixed coordinate
system around the _y_ -axis. For zero mechanical tilt the antenna-fixed
coordinate system coincides with the global coordinate system. Conventionally,
for sector antennas with cylindrical shape, the antenna radiation pattern
defined in the antenna-fixed coordinate system is measured with the antenna
cylinder axis installed to coincide with the _z\'_ -axis of the antenna-fixed
coordinate system. Note that electric tilt, and hence beam pointing direction,
does not in general affect the choice of antenna-fixed coordinate system.
By rotating the local coordinate system with respect to the global coordinate
system the same effect as mechanical tilting is attained. Since the antenna
pattern is defined in the local coordinate system, which has been rotated with
respect to the global coordinate system, a transformation must be performed to
allow evaluation of the tilted antenna pattern as a function of coordinates in
the global coordinate system. This transformation relates the spherical angles
($\theta$,$\varphi$) in the global coordinate system to spherical angles
($\theta'$,$\varphi'$) in the local (antenna-fixed) coordinate system and is
defined as follows:
$\theta' = \text{arccos}($$\text{cos}\varphi\text{sin}\theta\text{sin}\beta +
\text{cos}\theta\text{cos}\beta$), (A-5)
$\varphi' = \text{arg}($$\text{cos}\varphi\text{sin}\theta\text{cos}\beta -
\text{cos}\theta\text{sin}\beta + j\text{sin}\varphi\text{sin}\theta$), (A-6)
where $\beta$ is the mechanical tilt angle around the _y_ -axis as defined in
Figure A.2.1.6.2-1.
Having only the total gain pattern $A'(\theta\text{',}\varphi')$in the local
system, the total gain in the global $\left( \theta,\varphi \right)$-system is
simply given by the relation
$A(\theta,\varphi) = A'(\theta\text{',}\varphi')$ (A-7)
with $\theta'$ and $\varphi'$given by (A-5) and (A-6).

Figure A.2.1.6.2-1 Definition of angles and unit vectors when the local
coordinate system has been rotated an angle $\beta$ around the _y_ -axis of
the global coordinate system.
For polarized fields a transformation of the field components is needed, in
addition to the coordinate transformation. For a mechanical tilt angle
$\beta$, the global coordinate system field components $F_{V}(\theta,\varphi)$
and $F_{H}(\theta,\varphi)$, (defined as $F_{V}(\theta,\varphi) =
F_{\theta}(\theta,\varphi)$ and $F_{H}(\theta,\varphi) =
F_{\varphi}(\theta,\varphi)$) are calculated from the field components
$F_{\theta'}(\theta\text{',}\varphi')$ and
$F_{\varphi'}(\theta\text{',}\varphi')$ of the radiation pattern in the local
(antenna-fixed) coordinate system as
$F_{V}(\theta,\varphi) = F_{\theta}(\theta,\varphi) =
F_{\theta'}(\theta\text{',}\varphi')\text{cos}\psi -
F_{\varphi'}(\theta\text{',}\varphi')\text{sin}\psi$ (A-8)
$F_{H}(\theta,\varphi) = F_{\varphi}(\theta,\varphi) =
F_{\theta'}(\theta\text{',}\varphi')\text{sin}\psi +
F_{\varphi'}(\theta\text{',}\varphi')\text{cos}\psi$ (A-9)
where $\theta'$ and $\varphi'$ are defined as in (A-5) and (A-6), and $\psi$
is defined as:
$\psi = \text{arg}\left( \text{sin}\theta\text{cos}\beta -
\text{cos}\varphi\text{cos}\theta\text{sin}\beta +
j\text{sin}\varphi\text{sin}\beta \right)$. (A-10)
As an example, in the horizontal cut, i.e., for $\theta = \text{90}^{\circ}$,
equations (A-5), (A-6) and (A-10) become
$\theta' = \text{arccos}($$\text{cos}\varphi\text{sin}\beta$), (A-11)
$\varphi' = \text{arg}($$\text{cos}\varphi\text{cos}\beta +
j\text{sin}\varphi$), (A-12)
$\psi = \text{arg}\left( \text{cos}\beta + j\text{sin}\varphi\text{sin}\beta
\right)$. (A-13)
The notation $F_{H}(\varphi)$and$F_{V}(\varphi)$, used below, should be
interpreted as the field components for the specific$\theta$ that is given by
the direction of the propagation; that is, the angle between the global z-axis
and the line connecting the site antenna and the UE.
If $\pm \text{45}^{\circ}$ polarized antennas are used, the field components
$F_{\theta'}$ and $F_{\varphi'}$ are related to the co-polarized and cross-
polarized field components in the local (antenna-fixed) coordinate system for
the $- \text{45}^{\circ}$ polarized antenna as
$F_{\theta'} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(F_{\text{co} - \text{45}} + F_{\text{cross}
- \text{45}})$ , (A-14)
$F_{\varphi'} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( - F_{\text{co} - \text{45}} +
F_{\text{cross} - \text{45}})$, (A-15)
and similarly for the $+ \text{45}^{\circ}$ polarized antenna.
#### A.2.1.7 Advanced receivers modeling
##### A.2.1.7.1 Iterative soft interference cancellation receivers
Advanced receivers based on iterative soft interference cancellation receivers
(e.g. Turbo SIC) are non-linear receivers whose performance improves with the
reliability of the interference reconstruction as the number of iterations
increases. Modeling this interference reconstruction reliability or not in
system-level simulations has a significant impact on the accuracy of the
performance evaluation, especially if only a small number of iterations is
performed in order to limit the receiver complexity.
Therefore, for system-level simulations employing a link-to-system abstraction
of iterative soft interference cancellation receivers, the interference
reconstruction reliability should be modeled. In order to ease the comparison
of results from different sources, the simulation conditions should briefly
describe the used modeling method.
In addition, the number of iterations should be indicated, as this parameter
impacts the receiver performance as well as its complexity.
#### A.2.1.8 Effective IoT
According to the ITU evaluation guidelines [4] an IoT (Interference over
Thermal noise) measure reflecting the 'effective' interference received by the
base station should be used. No definition of this measure is provided
however. This subclause contains a simple effective IoT measure, taking the
interference suppression capabilities of the receiver into account.
A linear receiver, e.g. an MRC or MMSE, with _M_ antennas is assumed. The
received signal at antenna _m_ is
$r_{m} = h_{m}x + e_{m} + n_{m}$ (A-16)
where _h_ ~m~ is the channel between the (single) transmitter and receive
antenna _m_ , _x_ is the transmitted symbol, _e_ ~m~ is the sum of the
interfering signals (e.g. aimed at other users), and _n_ ~m~ is the thermal
noise at antenna _m_. The receiver processing constitutes of estimating the
transmitted symbol _x_ by appropriately weighting the received signal at each
antenna with a complex-valued weight _w~m~^H^_ , and then summing the weighted
signals. The sum-weighted output signal is given by
$y = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}{w_{m}^{H}r_{m}} = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}{w_{m}^{H}\left(
h_{m}x + e_{m} + n_{m} \right)}$ (A-17)
Alternatively, using vector and matrix notation, where bold variables are
column vectors spanning the antenna domain:
$y = w^{H}\left( \text{hx} + e + n \right)$ (A-18)
The effective SINR at the receiver output is given by the ratio of the power
of the desired part of the signal, **w** _^H^_**h** _x_ , to the power of the
non-desired part of the signal, **w** _^H^_(**e** +**n**) which under the
assumption that noise and interference is independent can be written as
$\text{SINR}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{w^{H}\text{hh}^{H}w}{w^{H}\left( Q + N
\right)w}$ (A-19)
where
$Q = E\left{ \text{ee}^{H} \right}$ (A-20)
is the covariance matrix of the interference, and
$N = E\left{ \text{nn}^{H} \right}$ (A-21)
is the covariance matrix of the noise. Note that typically **N** =Ïƒ^2^**I** ,
where Ïƒ^2^ is the noise variance per antenna, and **I** is the identity matrix
of size _MxM._
The denominator in the effective SINR expression now contains the effective
power of the interference and thermal noise. Hence:
$P_{\text{INeff}} = w^{H}\left( Q + N \right)w$. (A-22)
The effective IoT can now be defined as the ratio between the total effective
noise and interference power to the effective thermal noise power
$\text{IoT}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{P_{\text{INeff}}}{P_{\text{Neff}}} =
\frac{w^{H}\left( Q + N \right)w}{w^{H}\text{Nw}}$. (A-23)
Since receive weights typically vary over frequency and time, the effective
IoT should be calculated per frequency and time instant, and then averaged
(i.e. do not average P~INeff~ and P~Neff~ separately). The average is taken
over allocated resources, non-used resources are excluded.
### A.2.2 System level simulator calibration
To facilitate LTE-A evaluations simulators have been calibrated to ensure that
they produce comparable results. In a first step (1a), downlink wideband SINR
(also denoted 'geometry') and coupling loss distributions for the ITU
scenarios and 3GPP case 1 have been evaluated and compared. In a second step
(1c) downlink and uplink spectral efficiencies, user throughput distributions,
and SINR distributions for a basic LTE configuration have been evaluated and
compared. The parameters used are listed in Table A.2.2-1.

### A.2.3 Downlink CoMP evaluation assumptions for intra-NodeB CoMP
The objectives of downlink CoMP evaluation for intra-eNodeB CoMP is to clarify
the performance gain of CoMP schemes over single-cell schemes, and clarify the
need of enhanced feedback or SRS.
The intra-site CoMP with up to 3 coordinated co-located cells is the baseline
scenario for performance evaluation, as shown in Figure A.2.3-1, with both 2
transmit antennas per cell and 4 transmit antenna per cell. For full buffer
traffic model, the evaluations include 2 users per cell and 10 users per cell.
Alternative scenario (without X2 interface) can be evaluated, e.g. Intra-
eNodeB CoMP with distributed Radio Remote Heads.

## A.3 Evaluation assumptions for IMT-A
The discussions during the study item phase have raised a lot of different
choices. In order to have a meaningful set of evaluation results for ITU-R
submission, a common baseline of the key L1 parameters was proposed; in order
that the results from different parties would not deviate too much so that
forming any common view of the expected benefits of LTE-A is less difficult.
These parameters are not exclusive or restrictive to additional results.

###### ### Annex B: Channel models (Informative)
The ITU-R IMT-Advanced channel model is a geometry-based stochastic model. It
can also be called double directional channel model. It does not explicitly
specify the locations of the scatters, but rather the directions of the rays,
like the well-known spatial channel model (SCM) [B1]. Geometry-based modelling
of the radio channel enables separation of propagation parameters and
antennas.
The channel parameters for individual snapshots are determined stochastically
based on statistical distributions extracted from channel measurements.
Antenna geometries and radiation patterns can be defined properly by the user
of the model. Channel realizations are generated through the application of
the geometrical principle by summing contributions of rays (plane waves) with
specific small-scale parameters like delay, power, angle-of-arrival (AoA) and
angle-of-departure (AoD). Superposition results to correlation between antenna
elements and temporal fading with geometry dependent Doppler spectrum.
A number of rays constitute a cluster. In the terminology of this document we
equate the cluster with a propagation path diffused in space, either or both
in delay and angle domains. Elements of the MIMO channel, e.g., antenna arrays
at both link ends and propagation paths, are illustrated in Figure B-1. The
generic MIMO channel model is applicable for all scenarios, e.g. indoor, urban
and rural.
Figure B-1 The MIMO channel
The time variant impulse response matrix of the _U_ x _S_ MIMO channel is
given by
$H\left( t;\tau \right) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}{H_{n}\left( t;\tau \right)}$ ,
(B-1)
where _t_ is time, _Ï„_ is delay, _N_ is the number of paths, and _n_ is path
index. It is composed of the antenna array response matrices **F** _~tx~_ and
**F** _~rx~_ for the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) respectively, and
the dual-polarized propagation channel response matrix **h** _~n~_ for cluster
_n_ as follows
$H_{n}\left( t;\tau \right) = \iint_{}^{}{F_{\text{rx}}\left( \phi
\right)h_{n}\left( t;\tau,\varphi,\phi \right)F_{\text{tx}}^{T}\left( \varphi
\right)\text{dÏ†dÏ•}}$ . (B-2)
The channel from Tx antenna element _s_ to Rx element _u_ for cluster _n_ is
expressed as
$\begin{matrix} H_{u,s,n}\left( t;\tau \right) = \sum_{m =
1}^{M}\begin{bmatrix} F_{\text{rx},u,V}\left( \phi_{n,m} \right) \
F_{\text{rx},u,H}\left( \phi_{n,m} \right) \ \end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_{n,m,\text{VV}} & \alpha_{n,m,\text{VH}} \ \alpha_{n,m,\text{HV}} &
a_{n,m,\text{HH}} \ \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} F_{\text{tx},s,V}\left(
\varphi_{n,m} \right) \ F_{\text{tx},s,H}\left( \varphi_{n,m} \right) \
\end{bmatrix} \ \text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ }\ \times \text{exp}\left(
j2\text{Ï€Î»}_{0}^{- 1}\left( {\overline{\phi}}_{n,m} \cdot
{\overline{r}}_{\text{rx},u} \right) \right)\text{exp}\left(
j2\text{Ï€Î»}_{0}^{- 1}\left( {\overline{\varphi}}_{n,m} \cdot
{\overline{r}}_{\text{tx},s} \right) \right) \ \text{\ \ \ \ \ }\ \text{\ \ \
}\ \times \text{exp}\left( j2\text{Ï€Ï…}_{n,m}t \right)\delta\left( \tau -
\tau_{n,m} \right) \ \end{matrix}$ (B-3)
where _F~rx,u,V~_ and _F~rx,u,H~_ are the antenna element _u_ field patterns
for vertical and horizontal polarizations respectively, _Î±~n,m,VV~_ and
_Î±~n,m,VH~_ are the complex gains of vertical-to-vertical and horizontal-to-
vertical polarizations of ray _n_ ,_m_ respectively, _Î»_ ~0~ is the wave
length of the carrier frequency, ${\overline{\varphi}}_{n\text{.}m}$ is the
AoD unit vector, ${\overline{\phi}}_{n\text{.}m}$is the AoA unit vector,
${\overline{r}}_{\text{tx},s}$and ${\overline{r}}_{\text{rx},u}$ are the
location vectors of element _s_ and _u_ respectively, and _Î½~n,m~_ is the
Doppler frequency component of ray _n,m_. If the radio channel is modelled as
dynamic, all the above mentioned small-scale parameters are time variant,
i.e., they are functions of _t_ [B8].
The IMT-Advanced channel model for the evaluation of IMT-Advanced candidate
RITs consists of a Primary Module and an Extension Module. In this part, only
the primary module is included, which is mandatory for IMT-Advanced
evaluation. The Primary Module covers the mathematical framework, which is
called _generic model_ , a set of parameters as well as path loss models.
The generic channel model is a double-directional geometry-based stochastic
model. It is a system level[^3] model in the sense that is employed, e.g., in
the SCM model [B1]. It can describe an unlimited number of propagation
environment realizations for single or multiple radio links for all the
defined scenarios and for arbitrary antenna configurations, with one
mathematical framework by different parameter sets. The generic channel model
is a stochastic model with two (or three) levels of randomness. First, large-
scale (LS) parameters like shadow fading, delay, and angular spreads are drawn
randomly from tabulated distribution functions. Next, small-scale (SS)
parameters like delays, powers, and directions of arrival and departure are
drawn randomly according to tabulated distribution functions and random LS
parameters. At this stage the geometric setup is fixed and the only free
variables are the random initial phases of the scatters. By picking (randomly)
different initial phases, an infinite number of different realizations of the
model can be generated. When the initial phases are also fixed, there is no
further randomness left.
Figure B-2 shows the overview of the channel model creation. The first stage
consists of two steps. First, the propagation scenario is selected. Then, the
network layout and the antenna configuration are determined. In the second
stage, large-scale and small-scale parameters are defined. In the third stage,
channel impulse responses (ChIRs) are calculated.
The generic model is based on the drop concept. When using the generic model,
the simulation of the system behaviour is carried out as a sequence of
"drops", where a "drop" is defined as one simulation run over a certain time
period. A drop (or snapshot or channel segment) is a simulation entity where
the random properties of the channel remain constant except for the fast
fading caused by the changing phases of the rays. The constant properties
during a single drop are, e.g., the powers, delays, and directions of the
rays. In a simulation the number and the length of drops have to be selected
properly by the evaluation requirements and the deployed scenario. The generic
model allows the user to simulate over several drops to get statistically
representative results. Consecutive drops are independent.

## B.1 Channel models
This subclause provides the reference channel model for each test environment.
These test environments are intended to cover the range of IMT-Advanced
operating environments.
The test operating environments are considered as a basic factor in the
evaluation process of the candidate RITs. The reference models are used to
estimate the critical aspects, such as the spectrum, coverage and power
efficiencies.
### B.1.1 Void
### B.1.2 Primary module
The following subclauses provide the details of the channel models, including
the path loss models, for the terrestrial component. For terrestrial
environments, the propagation effects are divided into three distinct types:
These are the path loss, the slow variation due to shadowing and scattering,
and the rapid variation in the signal due to multipath effects. The channel
models are specified in the frequency range from 2 GHz to 6 GHz. For the rural
macro-cell scenario (RMa), the channel model can be used for lower frequencies
down to 450 MHz. The channel models also cover MIMO aspects as all desired
dimensions (delay, AoA, AoD and polarisation) are considered. The channel
models are targeted for up to 100 MHz RF bandwidth.
#### B.1.2.1 Path loss models
Path loss models for the various propagation scenarios have been developed
based on measurement results carried out in [B2, B7, B9-B14], as well as
results from the literature. The models can be applied in the frequency range
of 2 -- 6 GHz and for different antenna heights. The rural path-loss formula
can be applied to the desired frequency range from 450 MHz to 6 GHz. The path
loss models have been summarized in Table B.1.2.1-1. Note that the
distribution of the shadow fading is log-normal, and its standard deviation
for each scenario is given in the table.

[Step 10b:]{.underline} Generate channel coefficients for each cluster _n_ and
each receiver and transmitter element pair _u,s_. Alternatively to Step 10a
channel coefficients can be generated by applying the so called correlation
matrix based method. Temporal correlations (Doppler effect) are introduced
either by filtering independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian
sequences with a proper Doppler spectrum shaping filter or by applying some
equivalent method. MIMO antenna correlations are introduced by performing a
linear transformation to the temporally correlated sequences. Unique
covariance matrices are determined for each drop and radio link based on the
parameters defined in the previous steps. The MIMO covariance matrix can be
composed of transmitter and receiver spatial correlation matrices, and by the
polarization covariance matrices with the Kronecker product of matrices.
Spatial correlation matrices can be derived for each cluster directly from the
ChIRs of Step 10a [B3, B4]. Alternatively, spatial correlation matrices and
the polarization covariance matrices can be derived from the antenna
configuration and the model parameters (AoA, AoD) determined in Step7 with XPR
parameter from Table B.1.2.2.1-4 [B5].
[Step 11:]{.underline} Apply path loss and shadowing for the channel
coefficients. This is valid only for system level simulations.
Table B.1.2.2.1-4 Channel model parameters
\- In the table below _DS_ = rms delay spread, _ASD_ = rms azimuth spread of
departure angles, _ASA_ = rms azimuth spread of arrival angles, _SF_ = shadow
fading, and _K_ = Ricean K-factor.
\- The sign of the shadow fading is defined so that positive SF means more
received power at UT than predicted by the path loss model.
