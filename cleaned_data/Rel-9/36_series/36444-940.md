# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Elementary Procedure:** M3AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An
Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between MCEs and the EPC. These
Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to
build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between
some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description.
Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked
independently of each other as stand alone procedures, which can be active in
parallel. The usage of several M3AP EPs together or together with EPs from
other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g. TS 23.246 [6]
and TS 36.300 [3]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two
kinds of EPs are used:
\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure
successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
\- On time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for
the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined
for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
**MCE MBMS M3AP ID:** Unique identity, referencing the MBMS-service-associated
logical M3-connection within an MCE.
**MME MBMS M3AP ID:** Unique identity, referencing the MBMS-service-associated
logical M3-connection within an MME.
**MBMS E-RAB:** An MBMS E-RAB refers to the concatenation of an M1 bearer and
the corresponding radio bearer, as defined in TS 36.300 [3].
**MBMS-service-associated signalling:** When M3AP messages associated to one
MBMS service uses the MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection for
association of the message to the MBMS service in MCE and EPC.
**MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection: The MBMS-service-associated
logical M3-connection uses the identities _MME MBMS M3AP ID_** and **_MCE MBMS
M3AP ID_. For a received MBMS service associated M3AP message the** MME
identifies **the** associated MBMS service based on the **_MME MBMS M3AP ID_**
IE and **the** MCE identifies **the** associated MBMS service based on the
**_MCE MBMS M3AP ID_** IE _._

# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the MCE exactly and completely. The EPC functional behaviour is
left unspecified.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in clause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
> 1) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed
>
> The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
> certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports
> procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST
> message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message
> used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an
> appropriate cause value.
>
> 2) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed
>
> The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if
> supported,\" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the
> receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y,
> the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly
> informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see section 10.
## 4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related
IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format
that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded
regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the
Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case
characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. MBMS procedure.
Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is
written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word
\"message\", e.g. MESSAGE NAME message.
IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the
_Information Element Name_ is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the
abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. _Information Element_ IE.
Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in
the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2
enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Value\".
# 5 M3AP Services
M3AP provides the signalling service between MCE and EPC that is required to
fulfil the M3AP functions described in clause 7. M3AP services are defined as
> MBMS associated services: They are related to the whole M3 interface
> instance between the MCE and MME utilising an MBMS associated signalling
> connection.
>
> Non MBMS associated services: They are related to the whole M3 interface
> instance between the MCE and MME utilising a Non MBMS associated signalling
> connection.
# 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of M3AP messages.
M3AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
# 7 Functions of M3AP
The M3AP protocol provides the following functions:
\- Session Management. This overall functionality is responsible for starting,
stopping and updating MBMS sessions.
\- Reset functionality to ensure a well defined initialisation on the M3
interface.
\- Error Indication functionality to allow a proper error reporting/handling
in cases where no failure messages are defined.
The mapping between the above functions and M3 EPs is shown in the table
below.

## 8.2 MBMS Session Start
### 8.2.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Start procedure is to request the MCE to
determine whether an MBMS E-RAB for an upcoming MBMS Session for a given MBMS
Bearer Service can be accommodated by the E-UTRAN. The MCE is also requested
to establish an MBMS service associated logical M3 connection. The MBMS
Session Start procedure is triggered by the EPC (MME).
The procedure uses MBMS Service associated signaling.
### 8.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.2-1: MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST
message to the MCE.
The MCE shall use the information in the _MBMS E-RAB QoS parameters_ IE to
determine whether the requested configuration can be accommodated within
E-UTRAN.
The MCE shall report to the MME, in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message
the result of the requested MBMS E-RAB.
### 8.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.2.3-1: MBMS Session Start procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MCE determines that the E-UTRAN is not able to accommodate the
requested configuration (e.g. the necessary MBMS resources for the MBMS
Session could not be established), the MME shall be informed by the MBMS
SESSION START FAILURE message including a suitable cause value.
### 8.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.3 MBMS Session Stop
### 8.3.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Stop procedure is to inform the MCE about the
end of an ongoing MBMS Session for a given MBMS Bearer Service, and that the
E-UTRAN should release the allocated MBMS E-RAB resources and that the
associated MBMS service associated logical M3 connection should also be
released. The MBMS Session Stop procedure is triggered by the EPC (MME).
The procedure uses MBMS Service associated signaling.
### 8.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.2-1: MBMS Session Stop procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST
message to the MCE. Upon receipt of the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message, the
MCE shall send the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message after the MCE releases
the affected resources and removes the MBMS bearer context.
### 8.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
### 8.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.4 Error Indication
### 8.4.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected
errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an
appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising MBMS-
service-associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses MBMS-
service-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non MBMS-service-
associated signalling.
### 8.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.2-1. Error Indication procedure, MME originated. Successful
operation.
Figure 8.4.2.1-2. Error Indication procedure, MCE originated. Successful
operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving
node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the _Cause_ IE or
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by utilising MBMS-service-
associated signalling the _MCE MBMS M3AP ID_ IE and the _MME MBMS M3AP_ IE
shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of _MCE MBMS
M3AP ID_ IE and the _MME MBMS M3AP_ IE are not correct, the cause shall be set
to appropriate value e.g. \"Unknown or already allocated MCE MBMS M3AP ID\",
\"Unknown or already allocated MME MBMS M3AP ID\" or \"Unknown or inconsistent
pair of MBMS M3AP ID\".
### 8.4.3 Abnormal Conditions
## 8.5 Reset
### 8.5.1 General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the
E-UTRAN, or part of E-UTRAN M3AP MBMS-related contexts, in the event of a
failure in the EPC or vice versa.
The procedure uses non MBMS-service associated signalling.
### 8.5.2 Successful Operation
#### 8.5.2.1 Reset Procedure Initiated from the MME
Figure 8.5.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the MME. Successful
operation.
In the event of a failure at the MME, which has resulted in the loss of some
or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the
MCE.
At reception of RESET message the MCE shall release all allocated resources on
M3 related to MBMS-service association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly
in the RESET message and remove the MBMS-service contexts including MBMS M3AP
IDs for the indicated MBMS service associations.
After the MCE has released all assigned M3 resources and the MBMS M3AP IDs for
all indicated MBMS service associations which can be used for new MBMS-
service-associated logical M3-connections over the M3 interface, the MCE shall
respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The MCE does not need to wait for
the release of resources and contexts to be completed before returning the
RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
_If the RESET message contains the MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection list IE, then:_
\- _The MCE shall use the MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE and/or the _MCE MBMS M3AP ID_
IE to explicitly identify the MBMS service association(s) to be reset.
\- The MCE shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each MBMS
service association to be reset, the _MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection Item_ IE in the _MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection
list_ IE. The _MBMS-Service -associated logical M3-connection Item_ IEs shall
be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also
unknown MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connections. Empty _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IEs, received in the RESET message, may
be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the _MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE is included in the _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection Item_ IE for an MBMS service association, the MCE shall
include the _MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the **_MCE MBMS M3AP ID_** IE is included in an _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection Item_ IE for an MBMS service association, the MCE shall
include the _MCE MBMS M3AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another
Reset procedure) on the same M3 interface related to an MBMS service
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be
aborted.
#### 8.5.2.2 Reset Procedure Initiated from the E-UTRAN
Figure 8.5.2.2-1: Reset procedure initiated from the E-UTRAN. Successful
operation.
In the event of a failure at the MCE, which has resulted in the loss of some
or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the
MME.
At reception of RESET message the MME shall release all allocated resources on
M3 related to the MBMS service association(s) indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the RESET message and remove the MBMS M3AP ID for the indicated
MBMS service associations.
After the MME has released all assigned M3 resources and the MBMS M3AP IDs for
all indicated MBMS service associations which can be used for new MBMS-
service-associated logical M3-connections over the M3 interface, the MME shall
respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
_If the RESET message contains the MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection list IE, then:_
\- _The MME shall use the MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE and/or the _MCE MBMS M3AP ID_
IE to explicitly identify the MBMS service association(s) to be reset.
\- The MME shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each MBMS
service association to be reset, the _MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection Item_ IE in the _MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection
list_ IE. The _MBMS-Service -associated logical M3-connection Item_ IEs shall
be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also
unknown MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connections. Empty _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IEs, received in the RESET message, may
be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the _MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE is included in the _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection Item_ IE for an MBMS service association, the MME shall
include the _MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the **_MCE MBMS M3AP ID_** IE is included in an _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection Item_ IE for an MBMS service association, the MME shall
include the MCE _MBMS M3AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another
Reset procedure) on the same M3 interface related to an MBMS service
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be
aborted.
### 8.5.3 Abnormal Conditions
#### 8.5.3.1 Abnormal Condition at the EPC
If the RESET message includes the _MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection list_ IE, but neither the _MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE nor the _MCE
MBMS M3AP ID_ IE is present for an _MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection Item_ IE, then the MME shall ignore the _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection Item_ IE. The MME may return the empty _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IE in the _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection list_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
#### 8.5.3.2 Abnormal Condition at the E-UTRAN
If the RESET message includes the _MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection list_ IE, but neither the _MME MBMS M3AP ID_ IE nor the _MCE
MBMS M3AP ID_ IE is present for an _MBMS-Service-associated logical
M3-connection Item_ IE, then the MCE shall ignore the _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection Item_ IE. The MCE may return the empty _MBMS-Service-
associated logical M3-connection Item_ IE in the _MBMS-Service-associated
logical M3-connection list_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
#### 8.5.3.3 Crossing of Reset Messages
If Reset procedure is ongoing in MCE and the MCE receives a RESET message from
the peer entity on the same M3 interface related to one or several MBMS
service associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the received RESET message, the MCE shall respond with RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.5.2.1.
If Reset procedure is ongoing in MME and the MME receives a RESET message from
the peer entity on the same M3 interface related to one or several MBMS
service associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the received RESET message, the MME shall respond with RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.5.2.2.
## 8.6 MBMS Session Update
### 8.6.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Update procedure is to inform the MCE about
changing characteristics of the MBMS session, e.g. changing the service area
information of one service session.
The procedure uses MBMS-Service-associated signalling.
### 8.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.2-1. MBMS Session Update procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST
message to the MCE.
The MCE shall use the information contained in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST
_message_ to update its own parameters of this session such as the service
area parameters. The MCE shall then transfer the updated parameters to the
involved eNBs according to the service area.
After receiving the response from the involved eNBs the MCE shall report to
the MME in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message the result of the update.
### 8.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.6.3-1: MBMS Session Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MCE determines that the E-UTRAN is not able to accommodate the
requested updating, the eNB shall send to the MME the MBMS SESSION UPDATE
FAILURE message.
### 8.6.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table.
In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the related
capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\" cause values
indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources
were available to perform the requested action.
* * *
Radio Network Layer cause Meaning Unknown or already allocated MCE MBMS M3AP
ID The action failed because the MCE MBMS M3AP ID is either unknown, or (for a
first message received at the MCE) is known and already allocated to an
existing MBMS service related context. Unknown or already allocated MME MBMS
M3AP ID The action failed because the MME MBMS M3AP ID is either unknown, or
(for a first message received at the MCE) is known and already allocated to an
existing context. Unknown or inconsistent pair of MBMS M3AP IDs The action
failed because both MBMS M3AP IDs are unknown, or are known but do not define
a single MBMS context. Radio resources not available No requested radio
resources are available. Invalid QoS combination The action was failed because
of invalid QoS combination. Interaction with other procedure The action is due
to an ongoing interaction with another procedure. Not supported QCI Value The
E-RAB setup failed because the requested QCI is not supported. Unspecified
Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values
applies.
* * *
* * *
Transport Layer cause Meaning Transport Resource Unavailable The required
transport resources are not available. Unspecified Sent for transport network
layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
* * *
* * *
NAS cause Meaning Unspecified Sent for NAS cause when none of the specified
cause values applies.

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.1 General
M3AP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.691 [4] and ITU-T Rec. X.680
[5].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the M3AP protocol with ASN.1.
In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause
and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take
precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of
conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of M3AP messages.
M3AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct a M3AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the
object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in
one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
If a M3AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
### 9.3.2 Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be
part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
inter-operability.
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.
